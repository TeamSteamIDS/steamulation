Early Access Review
								Invisible, Inc.  is a roguelike, turn-based, strategy stealth game. Moving past the buzzwords, it's a game where you move your units through randomized levels by observing the patterns of enemy movement and then avoiding them on your way to the exit point of the level. If you're lucky, you'll find some items or cash along the way. As you go further in the game, you face more and more dangerous enemies. Eventually you get spotted, die, and have to start again from the beginning. You do that last bit a lot, actually. I've noticed a lot people assuming that the game is similar to Shadowrun Returns or XCom due to the isometric perspective. It really isn't, and if you go in trying to play it that way you will end up being frustrated. Invisible, Inc. is a stealth game and a roguelike. Combat is difficult and usually not an effective way to deal with enemies. Also, it is a roguelike, to the extent that word still means anything, and you will most likely fail a lot as you learn how to play, and sometimes just because the random number generator screwed you over. How much you enjoy it will depend on your tolerance for that sort of thing.Also, this being early access, there's always the question of whether the creators are going to actually finish the game. Klei is a pretty well established company at this point, and they previously did a public beta similar to early access with their game Don't Starve. Personally, I think they're trustworthy based on that track record. Not that I'm an expert or anything.			"

												All right, so I do recommend the game, but I'll say right away that it's easily not for everyone. In short, if you're expecting a well-pieced together story, you won't find it here, but if you're after a rogue-like turn-based dungeon crawler, then this game will be right up your alley.The presentation is probably the game's biggest strength. It's put together well in shiny visuals, clean UI, and a fun gameplay concept that takes isometric turn-based combat and makes it stealth-oriented, where you're better off avoiding the enemies rather than engaging in fights. The game is fun, if you enjoy turn-based tactics that let you plan your every ally's move.The gameplay concept is solid, but some of its execution was a fair bit annoying to me personally. A lot of the challenge presented felt simply artificial and unfair. The raising security level each and every turn forces you to rush each mission. Exploration is simply not rewarded under this system, because the longer you stay on your mission, the more security measures will be added after every few turns, which will eventually put you in a tight spot. I never came across any way for me to freeze or reduce the security level. It's just a rush against time, but on turn-based basis.I was also not fond of the fact that I couldn't buy any equipment for my party in between missions. The only time I could do it was if I happened to find an automated shop during missions, when I had virtually no money to spend. Of 4 agents I had in my missions, 2 were running about without weapons and just being used to sit on the guards. This brings me to another annoyance. If you don't have a weapon, you have no way to deal with the guards. No idea what sort of agents these are who can't even take out a guard from behind unless they have a tazer. Things start to get more complex when you meet enemies in armour, who are invulnerable to most weapons, and your only chance is to play a cat and mouse game where you're constantly running away.But, I really did like being able to improve my agents in between missions by upgrading their stats, even if stats themselves did feel a bit unbalanced. Speed felt like the most useful stat by far, since it gave you more action points, with hacking being a close second, since everything requires hacking. But strength and anarchy felt next to useless. Strength only lets you carry more items, and anarchy makes you steal slightly more money from the guards.And lastly the story, well, it was mostly on the background. The most of it you'll see is in the opening and ending cutscenes. But the rest of the game you're just dungeon-crawling really. It was pretty neat to get to pick which mission to do from a wide selection. It's very non-linear and each mission simply increases your assets - either you rescue an extra agent to add to the team, or you find some new shiny gear to use. Though because of that, it also meant that there were no story-related reasons to do any mission. You could expect the same approach in each one and merely doing as many as you can to pass 72 hours in-game before having to do the final one with what you've got.I was also hoping there'd be some more character development. All the agents in your team were just mute puppets for you to control. They never showed any personality or had anything to say aside from a witty one-liner at the start of each mission.Having said this, if you are a dungeon-crawl fanatic and like challenge, you should enjoy this game very much. It has higher difficulty modes, as well as an endless mode too where you have to survive for as long as you can. Overall, it's a worthy game to try and I have had my fair share of fun with it, even though the main campaign is rather on the short side.			"

												Despite the high positive review % this game is criminally underplayed and I believe I can provide some insight that isn't covered in the other reviews and also address some points from the negative reviews because they may deter people that would otherwise enjoy this game and get their money's worth. That said I will be as objective as possible.First thing, this is pure turn based strategy gameplay. The campaign and storyline is there but you need to enjoy the raw gameplay in order to appreciate this game. Despite what you've been told the 'stealth' part is completely optional; it can be as disgustingly brutal as you want it to be. My preferred end-game is to kill everything and I've found the right setup to make it extremely effective. Winning isn't about figuring out what strategy works; they all 'work' even on the 'Expert' difficulty. The reason Expert is considered by Klei to be the intended difficulty is because it's the hardest preset that doesn't limit your options. Specifically 'Expert Plus' only discourages knocking out guards until you get EMP access but I don't expect anyone who hasn't played the game to know what I'm talking about here; just know that even the ""hardest"" difficulty still only limits your strategical options temporarily.I can accept most negative opinions of some features but my major gripe is their point about the RNG. Take it from me; you do not lose because of RNG when playing on a preset difficulty (not custom settings). In most cases blaming RNG on your loss is a clear case of the Dunning-Kruger effect. You lose because you made strategical or tactical mistakes. Of course everyone makes careless mistakes from time to time and Invisible Inc acknowledges and embraces that with a number of ""rewinds"" that essentially legitimises save-scumming.There is an alarm system that increments every turn, adding difficulty over time throughout each mission. Some opinions express distaste for it but I think it's great. Historically most stealth games are very easy; you can be as patient as you'd like and often killing or incapacitating people has no repercussions. If that's the requirement for stealth games then this isn't one. It's a strategy game first and foremost, and a very unique one.Overall this game isn't easy at the higher difficulties. Beginner exists for a reason so it's ok if you can't brain. If you let it this game will teach you how to brain. Not recommended under the influence of alcohol or sleep deprived, or try anyway, whatever. Fight me in the comments, on the forums, or real life.			"

												Nobody does stealth like Klei!  If you enjoyed playing Tenchu: Stealth Assassin on PS1, you need this game.If you enjoy XCOM (the original or the reboot), you need this game.If you've ever seen an episode of Mission:Impossible, you need this game.If you enjoy ""Rogue-likes"", you need this game.Invisible, Inc. puts you in a dangerous, near-future, 1984-esque big brother world of mega-corporations gone bad, with nothing to survive on but your wits and the specialized abilities of your hand-picked team of professional spies.  The game plays like a ""run and hide"" XCOM.  The goal here is not to storm the battlements, mow down the guards, and plant a flag over their corpses.  You're outnumbered, outgunned, and certain death waits around every blind corner.  In true espionage fashion, if your team has to pull their guns, it means you've screwed the pooch, your team is compromised, and now you're in a desperate firefight to sprint to the exit before the corporate army seals off the building.At the beginning, you pick two team members, whose special abilities will dictate your play style through an increasingly punishing randomly-generated corporate maze.  You can bring a sniper, sure!  But maybe a computer expert would be less noticeable than gunshots ringing through the halls.  Or you can bring a stealthy lockpicker, but then who's going to judo chop the guards when they show up wearing body armor? Along the way, you may have the opportunity to rescue captured agents and increase your team's size.  The agents available to be rescued are randomized, creating a different play experience each time.The graphics and sound create an inviting, futuristic pulp-fiction atmosphere.  The music is appropriately dangerous, and fitting to the Mission: Impossible play style.  There are a ton of options to make the game easier or harder in whatever way you choose, so you can pick your own challenge level, from a casual romp through a save-scumming corp beatdown to hardcore, ironman, no going back, the-T-1000-is-after-you mode.Get it.  You'll be happy you did.  "

												What people need to understand about Invisible, Inc. is that it has a rogue-like/lite format.  Complaints about the campaign being 'short' or the story not being very elaborate completely miss the mark.  Would you consider those things as negatives for games like FTL or Binding of Isaac?  No.  The campaign is simply half a dozen or so levels strung together with an endearing B-movie cyberpunk spy narrative.  It adds charm and atmosphere but is hardly necessary for the enjoyment of the game's mechanics.  Like Klei's other games, Don't Starve and Mark of the Ninja, the emphasis is on the core gameplay and not the needless fluff you find in most AAA games today.The levels are randomly generated so you won't get bored challenging yourself on higher difficulties or endless mode to see how long you can survive.  There's also the right mix of characters, abilities, items, and hacking powers to keep things interesting when you customize your squad.  Additionally you are able to tweak various difficulty settings to tailor an experience that's the right mix of fun and frustration.If you are a fan of turned based tactical squad strategy games that deliver a high amount of replay via randomization then you'll love Invisible, Inc.

												This is like XCOM except it won't waste your time with huge maps and long drawn-out firefights across a ravine. It feels a lot more like dancing, as your squad scampers around guards and rooms, trading places / items / roles. Very emergent qualities to the mechanics too -- you might make some noise to bait a guard outside, and he'll open a door and wander into your melee overwatch ambush... but then he left the door open, which means a hacked turret has line of sight to another guard in that room, and so the turret kills him -- the noise alerts other guards and raises the global alarm level, which shuts down your turret and spawns 2 more guards, etc. Things happen because of things, and almost every situation is avoidable if only you had planned ahead a bit better.Anyway, this is an exceptionally well-done game. Highly recommended. (DISCLOSURE: I completed the campaign on all 3 base difficulty levels. I didn't pay for my copy of the game. I know one of the developers.)			"

												A corporate pacification squad prepares to break down the door and rush in assault rifles blazing. Your escape route is clear, but Banks still needs one turn to hack the brain of the Plastech CEO you were sent to interrogate. What do you do?After being beamed to the mission site, you are faced with two doors leading to the opposite sides of the building - one is watched by a guard and the other is clear. Send your team through the unguarded route and you risk being trapped at side opposite to the escape elevator when your intrusion is noticed. Have Nika knock out the guard so you can split up and he'll wake up in a few short turns, starting a facility-wide manhunt. What do you do?While ransacking a Sankaku tech office, Dr. Xu has been caught alone by an armed security drone, programmed to kill. The rest of the team, too far away to help, will be sighted by a patrolling camera drone next turn, revealing their location to every Sankaku security personnel within six city blocks. You only have enough power to hack one of the drones. What do you do?

I don't think there's ever been a game more consistently suspenseful as Invisible Inc. Even when you dance around guards and fill your accounts with corporate capital uncontested you aren't allowed to forget for a minute that it only takes one miscalculation to launch you into a freefall. The biggest credit for this goes to the alarm mechanic. Invisible makes detection a matter of unavoidable, gradually advancing doom rather than a fail state or an excuse to turn itself into an inferior action game.The alarm level creeps upwards with your every turn and every mistake, introducing new security measures and guards into the level, and not a single one of the many gadgets and programs available to your agents can do so much as slow it down. It will only stop when the sirens are blaring, private military troops are flooding the building and your agents are darting frantically from room to room, burning through every item and augmentation they have in order to stave off death for just a little while longer.Invisible isn't a game about avoiding detection, it's about surviving it.

The core of the game, sneaking from cover to cover and ambushing guards, is immediately intuitive. Instead of of deriving false depth from superfluous mechanics it sets up complex situations and tough choices with just a few precision-designed rules. Things are mixed up by the equipment salvaged from the field, ranging from movement-boosting stimulants to electric door traps. Customization isn't the right word here, though - your resources are always scarce so you must take whatever you can find and build your strategy around that. Plans only last minutes before being replaced by mad improvisation.Let's go back Dr. Xu and his predicament. Maybe he found a rudimentary invisibility rig in the previous mission, not powerful enough to get him out of the drone's field of view but allowing him to run up to it and temporarily disable it with his EMP tool, an augment only he has access to. Or perhaps Decker can use a stimulant to gain just enough action points to reach the room and gun the drone down. Or maybe there's no way out, but Xu survives his injuries and can be recovered from a detention center later on.Oh, and the corporations aren't short of tricks either. The reason Xu got caught? He opened a safe after you triggered a countermeasure program that sets an alarm to all containers on the level. And what if the program was activated by you stunning that same drone that's now threatening Xu so he could sneak to the safes undetected? This is where Invisible Inc. really shines - being a host to a multitude of tactical causes and effects without ever being overwhelming, and never letting you settle into a comfortable routine like many of its peers, even classics, do.

The soundtrack punctuates the action with surprising vigour and demonstrates some of the best use of reactive music since Proteus. When the tension rises, so does the tempo, making sure your heart will pump faster and faster as the alarm tracker keeps filling up. Likewise the art design is just as slick as one can hope for, taking a good step forward from Mark of the Ninja's and Don't Starve's Saturday morning look while still staying recognizably within Klei's house style.As cool as its presentation is, in terms of UI design Invisible does stumble into an occasional tripwire. Finding the correct button to hack that pesky camera instead of a nearby server computer requires a bit too much fiddling with the camera than I'd like, and the times I've found myself unwittingly knocking out a guard with a conciousness monitor suggests that the varying abilities of guards and drones could be more clearly communicated. These are very minor gripes though, and would be hardly noticed if the rest of the game wasn't so well-crafted.It is tempting to call Invisible an almost-perfect clockwork of a game but that would hardly do justice to the terror and triumph it evokes each mission and each turn. Every drop of sweat and tears I shed over it makes me more convinced that I'm looking at a future classic. It is the kind of a game that will creep into your mind and steal your heart.			"

												If you're the kind of gamer who is interested in turn-based stealth, just stop reading and buy Invisible Inc. right now.If you're still on the fence, I'll explain. Invisible Inc.'s closest relative is gaming is probably Bionic Dues. Don't feel bad if you've never played or heard of Bionic Dues, because there's only like 3 of us who have. For everyone else, Invisible Inc. is a lot like FTL or Desktop Dungeons, if those games were turn-based stealth games. You spend the vast majority of your time inside missions, sneaking around, trying to hit objectives and robbing safes you come across. You manage several different resources as you do this. Power can be found in consoles, and you can also generate it on your own using different programs. You spend it to disable or turn enemy infrastructure and drones into yours. Alarms build up over time, and also increase when you are spotted or trigger certain things. Cooldowns are another resource to manage, as you can disable guards, but only short periods of time and only every few turns or so. Your items with cooldowns can also do other things. Finally, you have to manage your positioning. That's a bit more abstract than most, but you have to decide whether to split up and cover more ground, or stick together, minimize your visibility profile, and give your agents the ability to support each other. Once you've been through the game a couple times, it will feel like second nature.At the beginning of each game, you choose your 2 starting agents (who each have predetermined unique augments, and some starter gear), a power generating program, and a hacking program. Each of these choices affects your overall strategy within missions. It's much like choosing your starting ship in FTL.As you rob safes and recover objectives in the game, you get credits to buy your agents weapons, items, and cybernetic augments that they carry with them for the rest of the campaign (or until you sell them). You strategically choose your missions based on the rewards you'll get from them, and have limited opportunities between missions to buy and sell items from a fence. Between missions you can also upgrade your agents' stats directly.Enemies consist of drones, guards, cameras, daemons, and a handful of other things. Guards are self-explanatory. Drones are like guards, but you can hack them. Cameras are also fairly easily understood. Daemons are things that lurk inside of cameras, drones, and other hackable infrastructure that are essentially one-shot traps that trigger when you fully hack their hosts. The mix of these things you encounter are dictated in part by which corporation you're infiltrating. Each corporation has its own specialties and strengths.Each campaign lasts for 3 in-game days, with missions taking between 5 or 6 and 12 hours. That means you're running 8 missions, plus the final mission. Each campaign therefore lasts for about 5 or 6 hours of real time.This is a poorly written review I did in a few minutes, so try not to mind my jumping around too much. All I'm trying to poorly communicate is that it scratches the same itch as FTL, with procedurally generated everything, big elements of both luck and skill, highly variable starting conditions, and the ability to pursue several strategies, as well as that roguelike sense of getting handed the dumbest stuff and still trying to make it work somehow.

												Wow!I'm a huge fan of tactical turn-based games and have played almost all of them.  To date the high water mark for me has been Jagged Alliance 2 (+v1.13 mod) with the XCOM reboot and Frozen Synapse filling the other spots on my podium.XCOM2 has been at the top of my ""eagerly-awaiting"" list for some time and I figured I'd bridge the wait with Invisible Inc.  Turns out (pun intended) I hugely underestimated this game.  It is brilliant!  Not only is it better than Enemy Unknown/Within but even my prized JA2 may need to step aside.Why?ESCALATING TENSIONThe stealth gameplay works wonderfully. As combat and time quickly escalate efforts against you, the need to be efficient in your infiltration is always at the forefront. This prevents idling/turtling as every turn matters. You need to know how far to push and when to cut and run. The pacing is excellent.MINIMAL LUCKThere are no probabilities to hit or variable damage. Even the path that enemies will move on their turn can be known. You might think this predictability would reduce the fun - it doesn't - it enhances it. All the information is there but you have to know how to get it.  This makes you supremely responsible for the outcome of your decisions and it is eminently satisfying.REPLAYABILITYThis is not a story dependant game. It's about the process, not the ending so repeated playthoughs do not feel repetitive. As the maps are procedurally generated there is no repetition here either. Even character builds are kept fresh between playthoughs as you only pick your initial two team members. Additional members (and their unique abilties), as well as available gear, are random. Rather than min/max a single favourite build, each playthough requires a solution using different tools.There is more to praise about this game but the above are what I consider the key points that set it apart and elevate it to the top of the genre.This is Game-Of-The-Year worthy.  If you like this style of game, I cannot recommend it enough!*EDIT: I stand by my original review as this is still one of my all time favourites. However, for what I consider the best experience, I'd suggest playing with the following mods:UI TWEAKS (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=581951281)This adds a few really handy features to the UI that handily fixes some of the very few interface shortcomings.

												This game is incredible. It has been quite a while since I had the effect of ""What? Already 3 in the morning? But ... one more mission ...."" (it is 3:33 AM as I write this)Klei took all the good things about round-based strategy from the big brother XCOM and added their experience with stealth games and some unique gameplay ideas to the mix and ... it works perfectly. To round it all up they got some rogue-like elements like permadeath for the agents and (depending on the difficulty) very limited possibilities to retry. But failing the short campaign (took me 5 hours on first try on beginner difficulty) will always yield some XP that unlocks new agents and abilities for the next round. That alone would be enough for a great little game but Klei also shows again just how good they got with art and design. Artwork, sound design, UI - every little detail down to how the menus fade in feels just right and makes this good game a perfect one.If you like stealth, and if you like round-based strategy, this is the game for you!To the guys and gals at Klei: Fantastic work, I can't wait what you are working on next!

Early Access Review
								This has several things I usually don't look for in a game -- permadeath, a fiendishly steep learning curve, and procedurally-generated levels that leave a lot of your success or failure (usually the latter) to luck -- but I am finding it so addictive I feel like I'm in that episode of TNG where everyone gets exposed to that new space game and it takes over their brains.Since it's Early Access, some of the joins are still showing, like the banter that seems a little disconnected (the guy who sells gear has offered me condolences for my loss a number of times when all my agents were alive). More importantly, a game with this many characters should really have more nonwhite faces.I'm looking forward to seeing how they continue to develop the game and respond to community feedback. Even in its current state, I feel like I've gotten my money's worth of gameplay already. Now if you'll excuse me I need to go look at some trees or something for a while until the afterimages of doorways and dotted character pathways stop playing across the inside of my skull.			"

												Stealth games are rarely made, and when they are made, they are rarely about stealth but more of shooter wearing the tag of a stealth game. Invisible Inc. however was able to captured the essence of stealth quite perfectly. The game is turn based and gives the player tight requirements in doing infiltration base missions. Although the requirements are tight, the game uses a unique system where the longer you are on the mission, the more dangerous it gets, therefore starting the mission with a low difficulty and gradually increasing.The most unfortunate thing about the game is the campaign story. The narrative is great, but story was cut short right when it gets interesting, I do hope to see a much longer campaign.Pros:- Captures the essence of a stealth perfectly- Amazing art style with some wonderful cut scene- Great story- Randomized maps, giving a nice replayability- Plenty of equipments to mess withCons:- The game's story was cut short :(- More			"

Early Access Review
								You know how you scroll through reviews to see a big red ""Not Recommended"" just to see some critical analysis of the game in question.  I know I do it and invariably I come across ""this game should be done already"" guy.  You all know him.  He's the guy who buys an early access game and then goes on to say the game has a lot of bugs and that it isn't worth the money in its current form blah blah blah.Well here's the thing about invisible inc.  When I first played this game, it only had 3 characters and 2 or 3 mission types.  The items were limited to basically 2 different guns, some ammo, and med packs.  The hacking was a very simple system and you couldn't upgrade your hacking abilities.  The thing is though, I still had a blast playing it.  In fact, the game in that state was still well worth $15 in my opinion.A left the game alone for a couple months as I moved and finding a new place for my PC was a bit of an issue.  But when I came back to this game, I found the updates were incredible.  A wide variety of characters with varied skills (6 or 7 I believe).  There are at least 5 missions types and they are suprisingly different in gameplay experience.  Detention centres for example contain a prisoner which may or may not be another agent to add to your roster.  Chief financial suites give you access to vault codes for future Vault missions.  The inventory received a similar upgrade.  Many items and even different types of equipment including augments which improve your characters functionality in their role by giving them unique passive buffs or abilities.  Equipment is no longer limited to guns and ammo but includes hacking aids, stim packs, gadgets like deployable cameras or sound traps, and alternative weapons like darts, tracers, etc.What I am really trying to say here is that this game feels like it is a finished game with all the polish and content to justify its price tag and then some.  Technically, the game runs smoothly, the mechanics behave in a predictable manner without allowing the player to exploit them.  This allows you to plan ahead, and think of strategies that involve more than one turn.  There is nothing worse than having an awesome plan in your head, thinking it all through, executing the first 3 steps, just to have step 4 blow up in your face because the guard decided to turn around for absolutely no reason.  This is what I would call unpredictable mechanics and while a certain level of ""randomness"" or unpredictability can make the game more fun, Invisible Inc. is a game where once you learn how the enemies behave, the difficulty comes from having to use your brain and stay one step ahead of the game (not from throwing a random guard your way at the perfectly wrong time).  TLDR? This game is leading by example.  This is exactly how early access should work.  The dev's could have cut and run and moved on to another project months ago, and they still would have been less buggy and more fun than a lot of ""finished"" games out there *cough Looking your way Double Fine cough*.  Klei has shown me that a dev company can truly care about the experience their customers get and work hard to make sure that the final product is something they can proudly put their names on.  If any of the dev's read this seriously GOOD ON YOU!  More companies need to operate this way!			"

Early Access Review
								As of Update 1:Invisible Inc is a pretty interesting take on tactical turn-based stealth (yep, stealth) in a setting of corporate espionage somewhere in the future.Game is rock hard, so if you don't like dying and replaying a lot - this game's not for you.Unique mechanics like alarm level and hacking in separate cyberspace make gameplay pretty dynamic compared to the XCOM where you can just overwatch all the time.Randomly generated levels give you practically unlimited replayability (well, at least until you are just bored by the game itself).Mix in great style, zero bugs (at least I haven't seen any) and Klei's ""Next update: X days"" counter (same that they had in Don't starve) and you get a pretty damn good game.Worth every penny even in this state. But again - if you don't like tough turn-based games, do not even bother.More detailed look in the video:

												Invisible is a turn-based stealth strategy game. It has often been compared to XCOM, but really these games take entirely different approaches to squad-based tactics. Here, your spy agency has been raided by the dystopian megacorps and you're on the run. You've escaped with two agents, minimal gear, and your hacker AI that's on 72 hours of emergency power. That means you have three days to bust out more agents, steal new gear, and prepare for a decisive strike back at the corporations. Every agent is precious, and if you want to succeed you have to use every resource that you can get your hands on.The game is essentially a roguelike strategy game. A run through the campaign takes about 5-6 hours, and win or lose you gain experience towards unlocking new starting options like additional agents or hacking programs. Each mission is a procedurally generated network of rooms filled with safes to crack, terminals to hack, and plenty of guards, robots, cameras, and other defenses. A straight fight with armed guards is out of the question, so you have to peek through doors and stealth around security as much as you can. The behaviors of the guards are simple but must be managed carefully to prevent situations getting out of control. Guards are normally stationary or on a two-point patrol path, but if they see something suspicious, they check it out (using scanners and other tools if they have them!). Fully alerted guards break from their patterns and search for you relentlessly, so stealth is ALWAYS the best option. You can knock out guards with tasers or darts, but when they come to they'll be on full alert. Killing is an option but an expensive one; lethal weapons are expensive, generally need ammunition, and advance the alarm tracker.The alarm tracker, by the way, is a brilliant little feature that makes sure you don't take a million years waiting out guard patrols and extended hacks. When you start a mission, the corporations know SOMETHING is going on, but not WHAT. So every turn, the alarm tracker advances a step. Every 5 steps, the alarm level advances and a new security feature comes online. It might be more cameras, it might be tougher firewalls, or it might be additional guards. Certain actions you take can additionally advance the tracker, like being spotted by guards or tripping a hacking Daemon. Your strategy needs to be balanced between caution and speed, and riding that line makes every mission tense and challenging.And that's just the basics! Robotic drones have their own properties and tactics, which ties into the whole hacking side of the game. Your AI can hack any of the networked features of the level to give you access to security cameras, safes, and even take over drones and turrets. This costs power, which you can hack out consoles, generate using your agent skills, or supply with programs purchased for your AI. And this is really the beauty of Invisible, that everything has so many solutions. Just with guards alone, you can create a natural distraction (opening a door) to stealth past them, you can stun them, you can kill them, you can set traps using special items, you can steal keys from them to open up alternate paths, you can hack turrets or drones to take them down with, or you can use special distraction programs to lure them away. Unlike XCOM, the random element isn't in whether or not a dice roll will make your strategy work, it's in what resources you will find to form a strategy around. You're not always going to find personal cloaks or AP-restoring stims, so you have to work with whatever you've got. It's guerrilla espionage, and it's thrilling when you make a plan work.Missions will earn you credits to buy new gear and upgrade your agents' basic abilities (max AP, inventory slots, etc.), augments to give them new abilities, programs for hacking, and chances to free new agents (up to 4 total). Even the selection of missions is randomized, as well as the travel time between them, so your overarching strategy for each game is going to vary wildly. It's a game made to be played multiple times and the INCREDIBLE wealth of difficulty options ensure that you can play at a level you enjoy. Beginner difficulty lets you rewind up to 5 turns per mission and even restart the entire mission once, allowing you to learn and experiment as much as you want. Experienced loses the restart option and cuts your rewinds down to 3, forming a good middle-ground between Beginner and Expert, the ""base"" difficulty which only allows one rewind. There are additional modes like Endless where you survive as many days as you can and Time Attack where you only have 2 minutes to take your turn. You can even expand difficulty options in any mode to tailor specific features exactly how you want them.Invisible has very quickly become the gold standard of strategy for me. The balance of stealth and strategy is perfect, there are tons of items and skills to work with, there are no unwinnable situations, and there's an amazing amount of replayability between the different modes and difficulties. The Klei art style is perfect for this as well, and it does the dark, slick oppression of megacorps really well as you skulk around. There is a story to the campaign but it's a very thin one and hardly the reason to dive deep into this game. It's consistently one of the most rewarding gaming experiences, and more people absolutely need to be playing it.			"

												Turn based stealth action. Nothing else to say.Difficulty -  challenging to OMG WTF !?Patience - I would say this applys. But it does not. There is a turn timer that increases security the longer you lurk in the       mission. So, this forces you to get what you can and GTFO.Items - Gadgets and dodad's to help you out. Some weapons to increase your KO / Fatality when dealing with guards.Money - Completing missions gets you cash. You need this. You can not redo missiosn to farm cash. You MUST move along to more difficult missions without a choice.Characters - Base skills are different between each. But level them up as you see fit or desire.now... GAMEPLAYIt's fanastic.Movement/ Actions - Action Points system operated. I have no greivence with this. Feels like X-Com all over again.LINE OF SIGHT ( LoS ) - THIS is the game. You rush around a corner, you probably just got your Agent get killed. You need to maintain a vigilence of speed vs caution. Guards and security devices have LoS too. Once spotted, you are most likely Killed on your next turn.Rewind -  Nice feature. Lets you take your previous turn over again. BUT, you only get one. Death of your Agent - When an agent dies, your life starts to suck. I have not confirmed it, but I think when your Agent is down, if you can carry them to the escape, you save them. Otherwise if you finish the mission with the one agent and leave the other where they got downed, the downed Agent is K.I.A..OTHER STUFF....Sound is good. You get to hear the guards on patrol. That's a nice little heads up.Graphics. They work. Objects and animation is smooth. Details are not distorted or fuzzy.Controls. you only need your mouse. THIS is deceptive, because there are no mouse control settings in the options menu. Just a keyboard key layout. Yes. I reccomend this game. It kills time and if you are not careful... 5 hours later your boss calls you and asks, ""Why aren't you at work!""			"

Early Access Review
								Listen to me, please don't think i'm joking or i'm some kind of fanboy when I say...I Absolutely Love This Game!Pleae bear with me while I attempt to give me amature review of this game.First off I should say, this game was made by Klei Entertainment, the makers of some amazing games such as Mark of the Ninja (Literally one of the best stealth games ever) , Don't Starve (Very good and addicting suvival/adventure game) , Shank 1 + 2 (Pretty good 2D brawler) , And Eets + Eets munchiesm (Fun puzzle game).I've had the game in Alpha way before it came on Steam Early Access (Klei allowed people to buy a super early build of it from their site) and I barely touched it, then I decided to play it again recently, and so far, i've clocked in about 9 hours total, 7.5 of those hours being from me playing the most recent build and i'm enjoying the hell out of it.But let me get to the main points.The Story: At the moment there isn't much, you're an agency, and you have 72 hours to complete missions before your final mission, choosing a mission tells you how long it will take to complete, and they're also generated randomly, so you never will know the layout of the map, or play the same old thing, you have to learn each time, also you're building your Agency's reputation each time you complete a map, by looting/collecting data/exploring the map.- The stealth gameplay: Honestly when i started playing this, like an idiot I skipped the tutorial and got myself demolished, it literally took me hours to even learn how to hack.But yeah, this game is Stealth based, taking on an enemy head on will get you KILLED, you can stun them for a bit, and even kill them (at the risk of setting of an alarm), or you can avoid combat all together while just hacking, and looting, which brings me to my next point.- Hacking: It's pretty simple, you press space and go into Igconita mode (Igconita was the original title of the game), and you can see what you can hack, which at the moment are just Cameras, Safes, Power supplies, and a lot of other object which may expose the full map to you, and show where other panels are.Also hacking takes up ""PWR"" which is basically power or battery life, but with one of the perks you choose in the beginning they give you two pwr each round.Alarms: There's an alarm system, with every turn as in after all your characters have moved, the alarm bar will fill up a peg, and the stakes get higher- First alarm = Cameras are now active, if you're spotted the guards will search the area the camera saw you at, but you can easily hack the cams.- Second Alarm = It's twice as hard to hack, not too difficult, just instead of using 1 PWR you'll use 2 to hack some things.- Third Alarm = Another guard will come down to investigate, making it a little tricker to get around.- Forth alarm and so on = Elite guards with armor who move faster, this patten continues until you either die, or your escape.This alarm system introduces an excellent risk and reward concept, due to the fact that you can stick around and keep exploring and looking for possible loot or intel, but you'll make it harder for yourself, but you also get a higher score in the end.....or die trying.Characters: Deckard is experienced stealth spy, who can cross large areas and move around the map, my favorite really.Internationale: She's the hacker, she can hack things though walls, which honestly, is pretty usefull.There's two more characters to unlock, as well as some perks.Overall it's a 10/10 for me, didn't enjoy it at first, but it REALLY grew on me, looking forward to seeing it grow into something special.Also online co op would be interesting, i'll update this review as I think of more to say on it.

												I don't remember the last time I lost so much sleep playing a game. Invisible Inc. is awesome, mixing together tactical depth (like XCOM/Laser Squad Nemesis with more options) with almost RPG-like character growth. It's as fun losing as it is winning -- my most enjoyable game was when I blew everything I had and just barely failed. The permadeath gives weight to your decisions. Everything is done well -- music, graphics, the whole feel. For older gamers like myself, who don't have the hand-eye coordination we used to have, and have lost the caffeinated squirrel reflexes of the past, Invisible Inc is totally engrossing. My Highest Recommendation.			"

												While the gameplay can have some fun moments, I can't say I'm particularly impressed with many of the design decisions.There is certainly some fun to be had in playing the role of elite cyber-spies in a hostile world. The two core mechanics (the sneaky, explory, stabby part, and the hacky, chancy, resource managy part) work well together. The mission selection and character progression parts also add a nice strategic element to the game. The interface works well enough, though it's perhaps a bit lacking on the clarity. However, there are enough things wrong with the game that none of these things really make up for the shortcomings.My biggest pet peeve is that there is a consistent refusal to present any pertinent information until after it would have been useful. That's certainly a good way to force replayability, but it does nothing to endear the game enough to actually want to go through the trouble. All it does is ensure that the first play-through is full of annoying experiences that could have been solved with a few more lines of dialog. It doesn't end there. The stealth is a bit less exciting than you would expect from the people that made Mark of the Ninja. It uses the standard vision cone system, which doesn't really translate favorably into the slower nature of turn-based games. It's hard to feel excited when sneaking past a bunch of fairly predictable, and very dumb mobile vision cones. The only time there is any semblance of a challenge is when the computer floods the level with dozens of enemies, and broadcasts your location every turn. This takes the game from ""stealth"" to ""I hope the RNG was kind to me.""The difficulty curve is quite inconsistent. The game is actually really simple once you get going. The missions are straight forward resource management problems; optimizing the use of AP, Power, Items, and Time. I would have liked a few more lessons about conserving resources and priorities at the start, but it's easy enough to figure out with a bit of trial and error. However, it will occasionally ramp up to night impossible when you failed to get a specific item for a particular situation, more often than not because you never even found what you needed. That's acceptable in a rogue-like where most game measure in  minutes, but much less enjoyable in a longer game where even a quick playthrough demands your attention over many hours of gameplay.The levels are at the mercy of the RNG, sometimes making even high difficulty tasks a breeze, while other times putting an ever more aggravating set of obstacle in your way on even the easiest maps. There are plenty of dead ends and empty rooms, and little else to explore. With the inclusion of permadeath, and a very limited optional rewind feature this can lead to some annoying situations.I did enjoy the actual execution of the missions. There was enough flavor to the game that I enjoyed going through the campaign. Unfortunately, it lacked the depth of more complex games like Frozen Synapse, and it failed up for that lack of depth in any useful way. In particular, the game would have benefited from a stronger store, and more interactive characters. Judging by the dialog there was a fairly interesting, dark, and deep world behind the game. There are certainly tidbits here and there hinting at an interesting story going on in the background. Unfortunately that world does not really come through; the inter-mission cutscenes are too short, and never change, while in game there is barely any dialog except a few triggered lines whenever you meet specific objectives.I think there was definitely a missed opportunity for some kind of data-collection mini-game with bits about the world. Some occasional character banter would have gone a long way; as it is your characters are just bland dolls you control. Sure, the narrator character mentions a bit of backstory when you select them, and they have different looks, and different equipment, but they might as well have been formless blobs for all it mattered. I would have liked to see a bit of in-game dialog of the playable characters reminiscing about old missions, or random events around them. This could have offered some depth to the story, and introduced concepts as the game went on instead of dumping you in a situation you were supposed to expect.Finally, I did notice a somewhat consistent problem with clicks failing to register. More than a few times I clicked on a character and sent them to a new location only to have my previously selected character run into the center of the action. It's easy enough to deal with by clicking on a character a few times, but it's just one more annoyance that takes away from the experience.In all it's a passable turn-based tactics game, sporting a fairly basic stealth element that doesn't feel very well thought out. It doesn't really bring much interesting to the table. It doesn't do a very good job of introducing itself, and when you puzzle it all out the end result is not spectacular. It's a game that tries to force you to play more of it, without actually doing much to make you want more. I can certainly see some people enjoying it, but it's certainly not something that will have any sort of wide appeal.Give it a try if you really like turn-based tactics games, or if it's on sale. Otherwise save yourself the time and headache.			"

												Okay, okay.  I really like Klei Entertainment.  However, there are pros and cons.  I will go over those.As with other games by this developer, Invisible Inc. retains Klei's trademark fantastic art style and morbid sense of humor.  There's a lot of shenanigans you can get away with if you play the ideal way - stealth - instead of engaging every enemy you see.  This is where you'll get to see some funny scenarios, like jumping in and out of a guard's ""noticed"" sight range, just to mess with his head.  ""What was that?""  ""I thought I saw something!""  Ah...priceless.  Gameplay involves a bit of trial and error.  I don't find any of the characters to be overpowering, but with experience, you can ""play the system"" and do things like max out Internationale's *remote* hacking abilities, since she's the best candidate to shove hacking skill points on.  As for other mechanics, I dislike turn-based games, and don't find the rewind feature particularly helpful.  I've seen this feature in other games, and it's usefulness boils down to how badly you've messed up the situation.  While you can fix a game-ending team formation in one rewind, the 5 rewind limit will not help if you spent several turns idling to regenerate your hacking power.  Even at the easiest difficulty, I felt like I lost alot of progress.  Overall, I love this game and would recommend it just because Klei does stealth games very well (they also made Mark of the Ninja, which isn't turn-based).  Again, to get missions completed effectively, you'll need to throw a bit of paint at the wall and see what sticks.  The game is worth the challenge.			"

Early Access Review
								Hello Internet! Today id like to give unto you my review of the game Invisible Inc.For those who haven't played it yet, or are weighing their options carefully as they peruse the reviews of the game, must be aware. Invisible Inc. is a turn based, stealth, procedurally generated game; somewhat reminiscent of games like X-COM or Wasteland in terms of turn based and team deployment, but with a major focus on stealth and subterfuge. Like X-COM, their is some resource management both in-game and out, but not to the same degree. The game is still not fully done yet and the developers are carefully approaching what their vision of the game should be. Negatives:(I like to start with these first)-Very unforgiving of mistakes. Enemies are quick to punish errors with the swift death of your characters. While it is possible to revive fallen units, it is extremely dangerous.-Balancing. All aspects of the game are undergoing constant tweaks and fixes, that sometimes lead to unfair advantages for both players and enemies. -Procedurally Generated. No two maps are the same. Certain rooms however will typically have aspects about them that are the same every time(I.e. Holding cell areas always have higher level guards, or robot sentry levels almost always have a random roving eyebot). This by itself is not a negative, but it can be when three or more of these higher difficulty rooms are placed next to eachother, making the player either waste a lot of valuable resources just to find an empty safe room or to enter a bloodbath. Positive:-Most important to mention for positives is the amazing dev team that regularly puts out game changing updates, including any number of new items, characters, revisions, tweaks, updates, etc.; all the while listening to their community.-Story. While vague so far, the story of Invisible Inc. has been developing more and more with each update; adding new dialogue here, a new description on that item, etc. Once the game is fully created I believe that we shall have a compelling and riveting story for us to play through.-Art Style. The environments, as well the characters themselves, have a very distinguished and marked style. Cartoonish in appearance but with a gritty realism that punctuates the plot and setting of the game.-Characters and Leveling. Starting off, you only have access to two characters with which you have full control of in game. All of the current characters within the game are capable of being chosen and played after you have leveled up an arcade-style profile experience level; which increases every time you play the game and complete a campaign run-through. The characters are all dynamically different, both in appearance and capabilities, that allow you to capitalize on certain items, enemies, and strategies that the game has available.-Interesting Gameplay Mechanics. While most of the game is a turn based, stealth ordeal; you must frequently hack and control electronics that affect events in the players world using an advanced AI, which is essentially a game of resource management. You can get past all of the guards and make it to the loot filled safes scattered around the levels but if you don't carefully conserve the power that your AI uses to hack things for you, you'll be♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck.-Logical Gameplay. Every action must be taken with a myriad of variables to consider. Should you risk sprinting to cover more ground, but possibly alert an unseen guard? Should you purchase more ammo for your characters pistol, or invest in their stealth skill instead? Even something as simple as opening a door must be taken into consideration as you may have no idea whats on the other side. Invisible Inc. gives you the tools with which to complete your goals but it is up to you on how you use them.-Atmosphere and Setting. ""Why are these missions always indoors?"" -Shalem. The idea is that you, and a select few others, barely escaped an intelligence agancies form of a coup and you must send agents on missions to gather resources and support against the rising corporate giants around the globe. Set in a (not so far away or unthinkable) dystopian future where corporations seem to have more power than the world governments, you must use fantastic technologies such as implants, lasers, robots and super advanced AI to stop these Corporate menaces. While most of the missions are withing the corporate offices and labs that you are fighting, the game vaguely eludes to you that the rest of the world is none the wiser of whats really going on.In conclusion, Invisible Inc. is a solid 8.0/10.0 for me, an avid fan of both stealth and turn based games. It is a very cerebral game, paired with the subtle cunning required for a stealth action;  making for interesting gameplay. While still not fully developed yet, this game is proving that it's great potential is being realized and capitalized on by their dev team. I have no doubts that this game will one day be a GOTY worthy candidate and will be within the libraries of all the strategy nuts out there(Like me!). Thank You for taking the time to read this. -Bee			"

												I have a hard time computing my thoughts on this game, I started a playhtrough before I bought the dlc so my campaign run was the short version. Keep in mind that you can get a longer and probably better experience by buying the dlc first.I like this game, but I cannot recommend it for a few reasons that seem small but really makes a big impact on the enjoyment of the game(at least mine).Figuring out how to play this game is hard, you are rewarded for being careful and violence is generally punished. Killing or knocking people out makes the game harder BUT the more turns you take the harder it gets as well. This is supposed to make the game into you walking a thin line between being too aggresive and being too slow however it just ends up with you feeling like every choice you make is wrong. A lot of your decisions are also based on too little information, meaning the choices are sometimes not even possible to make based on what you see but you must roll the dice.So what we have here is a game where it is very hard to figure out how to play, well I figured out how I wanted to play this game but I was never allowed to. All the items in this game are attainable or not based on RNG, I wanted for example to knock guards out in melee but I never got any of those tools(except the ones you start with) and not even a chance to purchase one. I see what the developers are after with this they want you to make do with what you get and adapt your playstyle depending on what the RNG gives you, its a neat concept really and it creates a great replayability.My issue here though is this, I don't want replayability and I don't want to randomly die because the tools I got were subpar and the RNG gods sneezed in my direction. I don't want to have to restart and play through the♥♥♥♥♥♥due to that, this issue might not have been so bad by itself but together with the fact that you can't even play like you want to because gear, augments and computer abilities are all based on RNG it makes it not fun. For people that love turn based strategic games and also love to replay games for a long time and adapting your playstyle and characters depending on what gear you get this will be your thing. Sadly I really like to make the choices about how my characters are geared out and how they fight myself so I can't recommend the game even though I liked it. "

												Full immersion tactical gaming at its best here. Finally a game that rewards innovative and ""out side of a box"" thinking. A real breath of fresh air in a stale 2015. Specific example: There's no feeling like doing what is called an ""am bush"" and seeing your plan unfold just as you predicted. Or did it? With ever growing stakes Invisible Inc sets the perfect pace and ramps the difficulty and tension up like a monster truck. I didn't think I'd ever be saying this, but Invisible Inc is THE Chessmaster 9000 of the modern era. Who should play it? Do you find yourself thinking, ""called it..."" on a regular basis? Then this game is the ultimate test of your gaming intuition, steadfastness and thoughtfulness my forward thinking friend. I don't write many reviews, but I couldn't help myself on this one. Everyone, from the average backseat theorycrafter to the hardcore delegation enthusiast should give this game a shot. It's a Real Checkmat			"

This opinion was made without the dlc played.A good game with an expectionnaly good and unique gameplay.Introduction :The gameplay is rather original and the only game I could make a comparison is Xcom (I'm not saying there are no other games like this, I just don't know any with my own knowledge c;), as it's both a turn-based game and a game where you can loose your agents and possibliy missions. Expect this game is quite unique as it's a stealth game where you don't want to kill people.The gameplay :In this game you have to tackle on various corporations with more or less the same goal everytime : go in, keep a low profil, hack something or steal something, then get out, if possible with everyone alive.  It's very fun and rewarding to hack and use our brain to avoid the agents and other devices in our way. The gameplay is so solid and you really feel incontrol of your team : if you win, it's thanks to you. If you screw, it's also because of you!Between each mission you have a world map where you can select your next target, with informations about the kind of mission and rewards, as well as the time spent to get there. Once 72hours is gone, you have to go on the final mission (that is btw probably the less interesting mission, kinda like xcom once again). Every missions you did before that served to prepare your agents, as well as your equipment for the final showdown.Between missions you also have to choose, sell/buy your collected loot to keep what is the most useful for your crew, as well as uppgrading your agents and AI skills if you want. There is a lot of choices in aptitudes and items, so others playthrough are encouraged. Besides finishing one playthrough gives you xp and unlocks more agents, items.The design of the game as well as the world portayed is REALLY stylish and unique. The main characters voices are really good and the graphics are also top quality.The bad :On the bad points, I have to say that the story is not that interesting even though it seemed promising at first. The game tries to hint about a big conspiracy, with lot of corporations involves as well as government, but it ultimately fails to explain anything and the end is rather abrupt and feels very cheap. Worse, the ending feels like it was cut before a real ending was going to happen, like we are going to expect something more. I know this game expects the player to play multiple playthrough because of it's solid gameplay, but for me this was a big turn off.The only other bad points about this game, is that it does not explain quite a few importants things. For instance I was hoarding implants for my future agents, until I discovered that I would unlock new agents only after finishing the game once. Very frustrating. As a conclusion I have to say that this game was a really good surprise. It's very solid and fun, with a unique design and style. But don't expect to have a compeling story, but I think if you are already aware of this fact before starting to play, you will enjoy the game a lot more than me. "

Early Access Review
								Invisible, Inc. is a stealth tactical turn based game from Klei Entertainment, notable to me for Don't Starve. It isn't terribly fleshed out yet, but what is there -- the stealth-focused completely unforgiving rogue gameplay, agent trait management, equipment management, and 'Icognito' mode (the hacking mechanism) -- is really, really fun. Even if they don't add many more features (as I write this, in a week a major 'warez' based update is coming out) it's still a really enjoyable, deep thinking game. It has even taken the place of X-Com for the time being, for those times I want my turn based tactical combat fix. Another reason it really came to my attention is the hard focus on stealth gameplay -- alot like Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell -- but with a charming, cartoony art style. Your agents will end up being found and mercilessly gunned down as your Central Operator expresses her disappointment in your performance. And then you begin again with a fresh new team, in a fresh new environment (did I mention its PROCEDURALLY GENERATED which is something X-Com was never able to master) to raid, pillage and escape from various corporate facilities. It's also a game that makes you say ""Just one more turn"" and staying up far later than intended playing it. If any of what I've said above peaks your interest, it get's a solid Recommend from me. Try picking it up on sale for insane value, but it's totally worth the $15.99 it is now.			"

												Update: RockPaperShotgun just named Invisible Inc as the 11th best PC Strategy game of all time.  https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/11/18/the-50-best-strategy-games-on-pc/41/Original Review: Invisible, Inc.:  Why I love her ...Invisible, Inc is a turn-based, tactical, stealth game -- with some RPG elements thrown in (i.e., you can choose to upgrade your agents' abilities).  If that's not enough, you've got a robust, random-level generator that ensures no two games will play the same.Are you sold yet?  Well, it's got great spy-gadgets and doo-dad's that would make 'Q' from James Bond proud; cloaking devices, holographic projectors, various computer hacking programs, weapons, shock traps, EMP's, and MUCH more can turn your pedestrian team into a true wrecking crew that will leave those fat-cat corporations trembling.Did I mention that it's rogue-like?  Lose an agent and they're gone ... yeah, it's challenging; be prepared to die and fail -- this game makes you appreciate the journey as well as the destination.  As per usual with Klei though, they've provided a fantastic game-setup screen for you to tailor the difficulty of the game to suit your tastes.There is one more 'feature' that I forgot to mention:  It's FUN.  It's lots and lots of FUN.  Get Invisible, Inc today!			"

												I've been playing Invisible, Inc. now for a week or so, taking my time, and I feel somewhat compelled to write a review for it. First, I didn't read the tin so I had no idea what it was all about beyond stealth, and kinda like Shadowrun. What I didn't realize is that it's a roguelike, with excellent balance, and it can be brutally punishing. Not since Dishonored have I played a game where I have had honest to goodness nail-biting moments that I have to stop playing and tell my wife about. Seriously. ""...and so this guard was right in front of the objective and wasn't moving so I had to take him out. And I didn't want to just kill him, right? But I didn't want to babysit his unconcious body. So, like, I had to make a diversion to get him to check out the other room...""My wife humors me. Crazy thing is, I have to take my time with the game - it's honestly stressful. Fun, definitely, but stressful. I absolutely recommend it. Maybe it will lose its lustre at some point, but for now, I'm hooked.			"

												This game has given me more than 80 hours of joy (with many more to come), and it's time for me to give back.I would like to preface by saying I got this game on sale during the last Winter sale. Was it worth $7 including DLC? Absolutely. Is it worth $24 with said DLC? Debateable, depending on how much you're sold on this game before buyinig it. Invisible Inc. is an amalgamation of many different things that I love in video games. It's a procedurally-generated, turn-based stealth game with a cyberpunk aesthetic. You start each campaign with two agents, and it's up to you to direct them through the sprawling, massive levels to accomplish the objectives, whatever they may be. There are four different corporations for you to infiltrate, with locations all around the world. They each have their own strengths and unique units to make life harder for your agents. But the agents are unique too. While you initially only start out being able to choose 2 at the beginning of the  campaign, you unlock many more by gaining XP at the end of each playthrough, whether you succeed or not. Each agent has unique starting skills and abilities, but you can re-spec them throughout a campaign to suit your own, unique playstle. You also gradually unlock new starting programs, which are used for the hacking mechanic. All of Invisible Inc's missions contain hackable items. You can hack a camera and make their eyes into your own, or you can hack into a safe and uncover credits or items. Hacking costs PWR, which is very limited, so it isn't the solution to everything.Concerning the campaigns, every playthrough is unique. While they begin and end with the same mission types, the level layout and location are always different. Now, the campaign itself is quite short, taking place over the course of just 72 hours, or 120 if you get the DLC. This can be a problem for some people, as you may simply not get the right missions in order to be prepared for the brutal final assault at the end. I personally, don't get mad when I have to start over, because it just means I get to play more Invisible Inc.The missions (you'll have time for about 5-7 of them in a 72 hour campaign), are thrilling high-risk, high-reward endeavors that provide a lot of memorable moments. There are many different mission types, such as robbing corporate vaults or accessing a server farm. They each present their own unique challenges; crack that vault open, and enforcer units will arrive to investigate the location. Universally, though, all missions have a turn limit of sorts. Even if your agents remain completely undetected, without disturbing any sentries, the alarm level gradually ramps up each turn. When the alarm stage increases, the mission becomes more difficult. Additional cameras activate, more guards arrive, and they eventually pinpoint your location. You spend the entire time stalked by this turn counter, so every move counts. In addition to main objectives, you may stumble across a side-mission that unlocks additional awards if completed. They're rather limited in the base game, but the DLC adds many more.The story is rather minimal, which I found disappointing just because of the interesting universe that is implied by the parts we do see. The dev team was pretty small, and only three characters receive voice acting. For a team this small, I'm glad they focused on the gameplay, but your mileage may vary.Overall, Invisible Inc is an absolutely thrilling experience that I recommend to anyone who enjoys turn-based tactics, stealth, or just cyberpunk in general. If you're interested but not fully convinced, then just wait for it to go on sale. I, for one, am happy to give Klei my money so they can hopefully make games like this, and perhaps, one day, a sequel. "

												Like a stealth based x-com with permadeath, incredibly fun and stylish. Set in a future where corporations rule the world and control the most advanced technology. Using 2-4 agents and the Incognita hacking system, you take different kinds of missions to steal money and upgrades for your team, all on the fly, in order to take on greater challengers and the inevitable final (very hard) mission. Highly recommended to tactical turn-based lovers.Several very impressive difficulties with an even more impressive array of custom choices that affect map generation, guard count, and many other aspects of the gameplay and difficulty. Permadeath is semi-optional but since you always feel like you deserve it when you are caught (and there are many other items and tactics that can still bail you out on even the hardest modes) it is fun to keep on. You can adjust pretty much every aspect of the challenge in the options, including Endless Mode.Fully animated, fantastic voice acting and solid, slick writing. There's a story happening here with specific characters somewhat like x-com, but the characters are decidedly stronger and more unique - each playable agent is a specific character with endemic abilities, and there are alternative versions of each character with new costumes and abilities, all unlockable fairly easily.Even the music is satisfying and seems to be somewhat adaptive, pulsing more intensity as you make crucial mistakes and things heat up. The sound design and art direction in general seem immaculate. Other than grunts and 'huh?'s in the missions, only the two 'overseer' characters and Incognita (the hacking AI critical to your mission) herself are voiced, but everything recorded glows. Nonetheless, despite all the animated scenes and voiced dialogue, there isn't a single thing you can't easily skip through when trying to beat the game for the Nth time.For me it picks up right where X-Com: EU/EW left off, with an evolving focus on moving safely and unseen through cover and controlling confrontations before they happen, and actual all out combat being rare or more or less phased out. Still, there are weapons, a combat system, armor and even dealing with bodies. All are equally important, but lethal ammo is somewhat expensive to find (and to use).This game is insane for the price. I really think you should get it.			"

												I enjoy tactical strategy but not stealth games; decided to try this given the positive reviews. I wanted to like it but found myself thinking this game could have been much more than it was. The core mechanic can be fun, but I still have to go thumbs down. Three primary complaints:1. The story and characters are underwritten. This makes the game mostly a sandbox that gets repetitive quickly. 2. The environments are one note. Every level looks and feels the same. The adversary has no personality or variety. 3. The game's economy/balancing doubles down on the repetitive loop that the above creates. On the first playthrough, I cruised to the end only to find myself missing critical equipment to complete the final mission that, in retrospect I was had not been offered for purchase from any of the game's semi-inaccessible vendor options in the first place. The between mission vendor is literally useless, frequently having nothing to offer for sale, thereby raising the question why he's included at all. The game's response is to suggest I replay the entire campaign again as part of a metagame. This would be fine given that the game moves at a decent clip except that the repetitiveness of the core game makes replaying it extremely boring. I only have so much time, replaying a game I'm lukewarm on hoping procedural generation will give me opportunities to acquire needed items to finish it doesn't sound like fun, it sounds like a chore.I think there is a core for a great game here, either by changing the setting (say to the Cold War or by licensing a spy property like Archer or Austin Powers or No One Lives Forever) or a sequel that focuses more on making the game both challenging AND fun by opening up the inventory more, giving the world more character, and creating a villain worth beating.

Early Access Review
								This was one surprise of a game for me. The concept sounded good, but I figured it might be one of those games that you really need to invest loads of time into to learn all the various parts, skills, techs and strategies. Far from it! The game mechanics are simple enough and there's not a lot here that will confuse people (although some perks are a little unclear as to what they do) but man, it will challenge you!The game is challenging and your death and demise is ALWAYS your fault! There is no luck here. Laziness and lack of forethought will be your undoing. That's the beauty of this game. Randomly generated levels combined with solid game rules and permadeth equals loads of replayability and agonising consequences for screwing up.If you like games where it's all about planning without the effect of luck, undpredicatble levels and the risk of losing with one mistake, this is for you. It's not a shooter, in fact, that's your last and often unwanted resort. It's a stealth game to the max and it teases you with the random levels, as sooooo many times I've died just wanting to explore that next room, even though I've completed my mission and the exit is JUST THERE!!! Do you leave an unconscious agent so at least your game can continue, or or do you attempt to strategically resue them knowing that the gaurd numbers ar eincreasing and that they will find you eventually. Great game. If you love strategy and stealth, do not hesitate. One of the best pickups I've had in years. Updates are pretty regular, and I have had zero bugs that I am aware of. I thinkn the tea, are approaching final game stage now.   10/10			"

												With games like Don't Starve and Mark of the Ninja under their belt, I had pretty high expectations for Klei Entertainment's Invisible, Inc. and sure enough it impresses. If you've played Mark of the Ninja you probably have an idea of how well Klei handles stealth and it shines once again here in the form of turn-based gameplay, great skill/inventory progression and elaborate, procedurally generated levels that make every playthrough unique and results in high replayability. The premise is simple enough; you choose two agents at the beginning of a playthrough (and can unlock more to choose from as you play, each with their own unique loadout and abilities), pick from a list of randomized targets that offer various benefits - such as banks containing large amounts of credits to buy items with or upgrade your agents' skills, cybernetic labs to augment your agents and offer them new abilities, server farms to improve your hacking software, or even detention centers where additional agents may be held that can be freed and join your team - and do what you can to prepare for one final mission. The different targets will have varying degrees of security which increases as you complete more assignments and start to build a reputation. Along with this is an ""Alarm Level"" system that increases for each turn you spend skulking around the buildings, adding a sense of urgency to every mission and making you weigh the benefits of staying longer to gather more resources against the risk of being caught due to the rising security levels. While initially places you break into may just have basic guard patrols and easily hacked technology, eventually the targets will start to have armored guards resistant to the tools at your disposal, automated drones and turrets that can't simply be knocked out and firewalls that trigger various defenses when tapped into; it's up to you as you play to make sure you prepare accordingly for the escalating difficulty and stay one step ahead of the new obstacles put in your way.To top off the solid gameplay, Invisible also has wonderful atmospheric design. Between the music, characters and art direction this game pulls off a great near-future feel combined with espionage that really sells the setting and ""story"" despite how simple both are; you may very well find yourself basing your Agent choices not just on their utilities but who they are as characters in regards to their biographical information and personalities.Incredibly challenging and equally addictive, it's hard not to recommend this for as cheap as it is given the polish and care that's obviously gone into it. If you're looking to infiltrate high-tech facilities with informational warriors and feel the heat as you try to escape with the goods, I'm confident that Invisible, Inc. will more than meet your expectations as it did with mine.

Early Access Review
								Hi guys, this game is pretty good. If you are like me and have played most any squad based tactical turn based game then you will like this a lot. First of all it is from Klei and those guys did Mark Of The Ninja and Don't Starve. I love those.The graphics are pretty good and the art direction is neat. Sound and such are good as well.But you play those games for the gameplay and it is quite solid. First the missions and objectives are quite good and this game is more akin to Commandos as you actually try not to kill the bad guys. You are leading a team of spies on espionage missions. You can kill but it is discouraged.There are quite a few interesting mechanics that I have never seen in this type of game before. There is a fully fleshed out stealth which is a novelty for this type of games in general. There is also hacking which is pretty neat and later on in the game you get a lot of gadgets that make it very tactical how to go about completing the level. And talking about levels they are all procedurely generated which is pretty sweet and gives a lot of replay value. And one of the most novel things about the game is the alarm system. When you start a level an alarm bar starts filling up and different things happen when you get to new levels - more guards, hacks costing more, etc. So this makes it so you cannot take your time and a lot of times you are under pressure - do I go for that room or do I leave.Overall, I feel that the game offers a lot of cool new mechanics I have not seen before with good graphics and sound, and stellar art direction. And all of it procedurally generated. The only drawback is that it can get a bit repetitive and since there really isn't a whole lot of story to it (yet) you might find it hard to go for another playthru or mission. I hope they do add more things to do between missions as right now it is just a map screen where you choose where to go next. Also, more variety in the mission tiles will be welcome as well as possibly ways to affect the light sources thru hacks etc.Overall highly recommended.			"

												I thought turn-based grid stealth sounded silly, but it actually works pretty well. With the number of optional things to do in each level, turns spent waiting for guards to move out of the way or your cooldowns to recharge still feel productive because you almost always have other objectives to work towards if you can't go for the final prize right away. And the combination of a constantly ticking alarm level with your most gamechanging gadgets having long cooldowns mean that even with the turn based system, you still want to carefully consider how to use each item. The biggest complaint I've heard so far is the short length of the campaign, but I did not find that to be a problem, because the game is very replayable with a decent number of different agents, items and augmentations available, many of which synergize well with certain other characters and pieces of equipment, as well as a great list of options for customizing your own campaigns with endless modes, faster alarms, sturdier guards, or any combination thereof.

												So I've seen a couple of negative reviews about this game revolving around the low amount of players who have managed to complete it on the extra hard difficulties. You know you are scraping the bottom of the criticism barrel when your major complaint is about Steam Achievements being hard to get. Before the Contingency Plan DLC, the highest difficulty setting was Expert and it's still only been completed by 2.5% of people. The higher difficulties than that don't change the story ending, or the actual story in anyway, so the achievement just adds a few millimeters to your e-peen.The game is superb, pick it up on sale with Contingency Plan, you won't regret it.

Early Access Review
								Anxious to see how they continue development. Like a single player version of Spy Vs. Spy. Multiplayer would be very interesting. Invisible Inc brings a lot to the table with slow paced game play where you have to think about where to explore next, can you spend the time looking for more loot and risk more guards showing up? Do you split up your team or keep them close to work together? Hack the safe or cameras? Easy to get into, but the challenge lies in balance the experience and equipment, taking only the necessary equipment with you  so you can steal enough loot to get the next upgrade. I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes turn based strategy. The game is not easy or a walk in the park. It is not conventional in that you don't have to (and probably shouldn't) complete every level 100% before leaving it and moving to the next. This all can change with the monthly updates and I will keep this review as up to date as I can but for now I am very happy with my purchase and look forward to more play time. Edited: added more description.			"

												Having (somehow) clocked up 199 hours on record in less than three months, this seems like a good moment to give this game my whole-hearted recommendation for:-- the fidelity of its stealth experience. With the exception of the final level, combat/gun battles bring in the law of diminishing returns, so your primary resources really are desks, corners, chair backs, potted plants, etc. Confrontation is ultimately unavoidable, but even then because of the escalating alert levels, ambush and misdirection work far better than firepower.- its exquisite interface. Take the classic board game template with its sense of control and overview. Randomize the 'board' each time and have it unveil itself bit by bit as you move across it (especially clever here is the way electronic devices such as consoles, cameras, safes, act as little 'beacons' within unexplored areas, helping you feel out the edges of the map). Switch between AI and agent-operator modes at the touch of a button, spin the map, and even toggle the amount of wall cut-away to keep abreast of all your options.- its emphasis on tactical gameplay. Some may disagree with me here, but I feel that there's only a limited amount of strategy involved, as procedurally-generated levels and randomized items mean you are mostly confronting unkowns. It's all about how you adapt your options to each new circumstance rather than sitting back to watch a master-plan execute itself, and this means each turn is as riveting as the last.- its high tension-low frustration ratio. Despite its crazy odds, perma-death, and fearsome difficulty at the later levels, I've never once felt the kind of exasperation that most games present when ratcheting up the challenge levels. Great pacing and balance keep this game totally absorbing even while you're failing (which is what you'll spend an awful lot of your time doing).- its charming visual design, characterisation and voice acting, which loads of other reviews have already commented on.Most of my other games are shooters, but even I can see that Invisible Inc. is what gaming can be at its best...

												The most enjoyable stealth game I've ever played. I'm not a fan of the genre due to its slow pace, often annoying cameras, unclear enemy vision/hearing cones, and repetitive AI dialogue (especially with AI that--after a mere 10 seconds--forgets you just killed all of their friends despite the pile of bodies and goes back to their patrol route like nothing happened). Invisible, Inc. distills the ideals of the stealth genre down into an easily digestible, cartoonish, isometric game that manages to be challenging and rewarding without feeling cheap, and also solves a lot of control/camera issues that are found in full on 3D stealth titles.My sole complaint thus far is that--much like in FTL or any roguelike really--the items you can find or purchase seem too random to where you can either get a bunch of really cool stuff, or a bunch of meh. At the very least the agency merchant (Monst3r) could sell more items whenever you're between missions. More often than not his shop is literally empty. Aside from that, this is definitely another imaginative, polished Klei release and a welcome addition to my collection.			"

												Invisible, Inc. is one of the best games I’ve ever played. The turn based stealth gameplay is extremely well designed, intuitive and engaging. The cyberpunk setting is excellent, in particular the art style and the music which contributes to the slow building of tension as difficult scenarios unfold. Excellent pacing and difficulty scaling present a highly rewarding challenge without ever feeling unfair or frustrating (like X-Com).Invisible, Inc. also has superb replayability although I think different endings for completing the game on a higher difficulty setting would have been a rewarding final touch. I highly recommend this game is anyone who enjoys turn based tactical games. I eagerly await more Invisible Inc content and more quality cyberpunk games (my favourite genre). "

												Backed this game since when it was sold for 2 for $17 and it is just keep getting better and better. Played it recently and was amazed how fluid the gameplay and mechanics now. This is a great Turn base strategy game that will keep you interested for maybe around 10 hours on campaign average (includes the time where you fail it and gain some XP).You can't really bruteforce you way in compared before in early access since they made lethal weapon nerfed with the removal of unlimited ammo reloadAlso there's now workshop support and a new DLC which I haven't checked yet.

												After numerous turns of dancing around the evac zone, juggling recharge clips and knocked out guards, reviving wounded comrades with med gel, hacking bots, attempting to block paths, I succeeded in safely escorting a really slow hostage out of the facility, but my best agent, Banks, got shot. We couldn't go back to save her. We failed her. I failed her. I got too greedy cracking all the safe boxes. I miss you, girl. I miss your levelled up stats and gadgets.9/10, leave me to my grief.

												I first played Invisible Inc. back when it was originally released in early access and loved it then. I didn't keep up with the game much during its beta development, so I was extremely surprised by the amount of quality content and polish pumped into the game for its release. I certainly have a bit of brand loyalty due to my extensive admiration of Don't Starve, but I'm under the heavy impression that Klei is one the best developers in respect to their early access protocol. Invisible Inc. certainly bolsters their track record. In fact, Klei probably fights with Amplitude for my favorite niche indie game developers. Out of my 100+ steam friends, only one other seems to have played the game, so I figure it's all the more worthwhile to try to get the name out there.Anyway, Invis Inc. is a squad-based tactical stealth game with a hacking emphasis and a beautiful cover and line-of-sight system. I hear it often referred to as ""Stealth XCOM,"" and I think that fits the bill somewhat well if you're going for a short but sweet description such as that. Otherwise, I'd say Invisible inc. is very unique for what it is. It sports decent replayability thanks to randomized layouts, rogue-like item procurement, and unlockable content for future runs, but the amount of these features certainly don't stack up to other more prominent rougue-likes such as Binding of Isaac and whatnot. I'm often reminded of old stealth-based board games while playing due to the tile-based movement and layout.The game takes place in a cyberpunk future wherein megacorporations have replaced governments and your squad of spies, fully armed with an anthropomorphic hacking supercomputer ""Incognita,"" cybernetic implants, and futuristic gadgets, fight the man pro-proletariat under their noses. Or at least, as under their nose as possible. Crisp voiceovers are  a pleasant feature considering Klei's indie nature, especially with Incognita's Hal-esque quips prodding your throughout the game with a snarky twist. A fully (and gorgeously) animated cutscene accents the beginning and end of the game, although this aspect becomes moot quite quickly in a game meant to be replayed consistently a la most games with randomized features. The ending is pretty neat though, I'll say that much. Music is great, akin to espionage titles such as Gunpoint. It gets more intense as your alarm level raises as well, which is another nice feature. Oh yeah, great art style too. The little portraits of your spies' long, Norman Rockwell-esque faces slowly animated in boredom as you pick your next action is probably my favorite part of the HUD. Jeff Agala seems to have a knack for creating distinct and appealing artistic themes for the games he's created art for.Speaking of HUD, the games does an amazing job at displaying what you need to know mechanically in order to properly make your way through the corporations with being caught. Enemy line of sight is clearly portrayed through different stylistic and color cues depending on whether you'll be hidden, slightly noticed, or clearly seen (all of which play a big part.) It's something that's changed since I played it in early access, and makes the game much, much more enjoyable. The cover system is satisfying and very well-done. It feels very rewarding to find yourself undetected inside a room otherwise completely monitored by cameras and guards. Finding out how to move undetected is easy as well, as your path in question is color coded depending on how much you'll be seen on the way (white/yellow/red.) Characters are unique and all share different roles and potential. Depending on what items you get through the game, you can build some real monsters on the way. (I'm looking at you, Nika and Sharp.) The stages and scenery also look great in a cyberpunk Deus Ex: HR kind of way.I could probably go on, but I think I've droned on enough anyway. Point is, I love this game, and I hope I see more people playing it. It deserves a bigger audience.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm far too lazy to write a proper review, I'll just C&P somethings I already wrote in the forums.Same guys as did Don't Starve (Klei apparently).It's an isometric turn-based squad stealth game (and a very good one at that).It doesn't feel like Early Access, at least the bad kind, or rather, it feels like a full AAA game that is still getting updates, so far (e.g. think Payday 2, FTL in terms of quality since FTL is indie).It's a roguelike if you use the very open definition, in other words, it has permadeath(agents are irreplaceable and you can ""lose"" the game) and proc gen.re: proc genThe levels so far seem to be intelligently designed, like a puzzle. Haven't come across anything unbeatable yet (not counting the guy who posted the screenie of a level not possible to reach the exit, heh), but certainly difficult (Heavy blocking a vault with 2 guards inside it first mission, detention centre with 2 patrol guards and a Captain inside, double Heavy patrols, etc). I'm guessing that there's some general rules followed for placement of stuff, besides the obvious (no guards in starting room), and it seems pretty well done so far, the missions don't feel like randomness jumbled together, so good job. They feel like story missions even though they are in fact proceduraly generated. It's a bit like the generation of Binding of Isaac levels, except it feels less random than that even- I imagine it's  basically the same though, placing certain things with a small bit of patterning.re: graphics, interface, musicI can never get tired at starting a fresh level and hearing the music start up, and then looking at Internationale's animation and grumpy face, good touch :)Also the random blocks moving up and down and around in Incognita and the main game screen while playing a level. I never really paid attention to them before, but it's way better than a blank background :)While I'm here, the interface is really great too. I'm playing fullscreen and I just realised how the interface never gets in the way of anything, it's never intrusive, and even though the game is in isometric view, I never have problems seeing anything or seeing where stuff is (I do switch to incognita for a broader view sometimes), I feel like I've always got a good view of the immediate area and the whole level, and it always feels like the interface elements are invisible until I need them, since they take up so little space. I also rarely feel the need to rotate the levels at all, I've played a ton of missions and completely forgot that I could rotate with Q and E that it turned out to be a huge surprise to me.re: gameplay and balanceBoth are great, keeping more entertained than the other half dozen games I purchased recently. It's a ""hard"" game, if you're a veteran at tactical turn-based you'll probably find it easy though (at least I think it's easy once you've got the game mechanics pat down).Reccomend at base sale price Y/N: Y, if you're interested in this kind of game it's a fair deal in terms of gameplay(how much fun) & replayability(how many hours before you get bored) - or wait for an eventual sale, but either way.I have a low threshold for getting bored, I get bored by games really easy, so two thumbs up. Hope you enjoy it.			"

Early Access Review
								Not changing the game does not mean that excellence can't be achieved.The individual components of ""Invisible, Inc."" are not new: stealth-based gameplay, resource control, and a gameplay flow of ""your turn, their turn"".  However, the premise, and how elegantly these components come together, is nothing short of art.As the driving force of a spy organization on its last legs after some unknown infiltration, your last two agents must undertake missions around the world in a last-ditch attempt to regain capital and resources, in the form of bionic augments for your agents, buffs for your UI internet ICE program, Incognita, cool-as-the-other-side-of-the-pillow spytech, and cold hard cash for whatever else comes along.The squad at Klei seemed to have considered everything, alllowing for your agents to lure the hapless security guards out of position for them to be avoided, subdued, or removed with extreme prejudice, according to your preference as a player.  Offsetting this level of care, ""Invisible, Inc."" is BRUTAL.  One mistake, and your agents will be spotted, cornered, and removed from play with one-shot-one-kill nonchalance.From the art style, reminiscent of Nagel-gone-Tron, to the ""let's play it again"" gameplay, ""Invisible, Inc. is a masterpiece, and is one of those games that infiltrates my thoughts while I'm away from the keyboard.  Easily my frontrunner on my personal ""Game of the Year"" list, ""Invisible, Inc."" gets my highest recommendation.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game when it first went Alpha due to my love of Mark of the Ninja and my liking of XCOM: EU. This game is supposed to be kind of a fusion of both, a stealth-based tactical RPG. I was dissatisfied with it for reasons I’ll list below but because its was extremely early Alpha I decided to just wait until it became more complete. Unfortunately it really hasn’t changed much.Right now the game is a mess, people claim it is hard, but it’s all artificial difficulty to an extremely punishing degree. Unlike beloved stealth games like MGS, Thief, Splinter Cell, Dishonored, and Klei's own Mark of the Ninja this game actively punishes you for taking your time and being cautious due to an alarm system that’s constantly ticking up from the start of a level even if you’ve been completely undetected.  The procedurally generated levels also can throw you into unwinnable situations.  Even fans of XCOM: EU will be probably be dissatisfied because as I said this game punishes you for being cautious, which is the cornerstone of good XCOM playing. Your agents aren't nearly as expendable as XCOM troopers too which makes it even more ridiculously punishing. Stunning enemies is rather pointless because they just get up after two turns and shooting them just brings down the whole building on you. The only real way to beat levels right now is totally speed-run them (Which is even harder due to the procedural generated levels), which is not what a stealth game is inherently about; stealth games are about being taking your time and exploring your surroundings by doing things like studying camera locations and guard patrol patterns. Invisible Inc. just throws that all away and it really suffers for it.This game as it is right now is just for masochists. But it still is very early in development and I really hope Klei turns it around because there is a lot of potential here to make a fun and fair game. The groundwork is all there.I’ll keep this review updated when big enough updates come around.			"

												I keep seeing developers and reviewers alike describe it as an ""Xcom stealth game""...only as an afterthought mentioning the Syndicate overtones; personally the Syndicate vibe hit me way more strongly, even though in terms of gameplay it probably does lean towards Xcom more than Syndicate (Syndicate wasn't turn-based).I hated this game at first, mostly because it almost punishes you for exploring; but, that's not really what this game is about. In comparison to most stealth-oriented games, where exploring the environment, and figuring out how to use it to your advantage or make progress, is half of the game, this game doesn't work like that; you are effectively timed in each mission, the escalating alarms serving as a disincentive to open up the entire map of the level (think Spelunky), merely complete your objectives and gtfo, if you're an explorer or a completionist you're going to have to come to terms with this. The exception to this rule is endless mode, where eventually you will have to unlock pretty much every safe in a level to find an exit key, which I found aggravating as all hell but that's kind of the point.Once I got past that though I really enjoyed it, the RNG can be unfair sometimes but that's generally when you break out the lethal weapons in a run, rather than knock-outs (at which point, it really does start to feel like Xcom). And really, once you're done achievement-whoring you can set up the campaign options however you like, even moreso if you download and install a couple mods, to the point of allowing you to control the frequency of random difficulty occuring mid-mission.I have everything Klei's made besides Shank and the stuff precluding it in my Steam library...I still haven't played Don't Starve or its DLC but between this and Mark of the Ninja (the best Batman game ever made, by the by), and their upcoming Sims in Space game that I want so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad called ""Oxygen Not Included"", I'll have to at least look at whatever they release, even if it looks stupid; these guys do solid work, and their games are often either outside the box (and good), or its something that's already been done before, but now done like you always kinda wanted it to be.Did I mention mods? Steam workshop, yessss.  At first it was just for new languages, there's actual mods there now.			"

												Invisible Inc is fantastic at making you feel like a sneakydeaky super agent. The game is difficult, but never unfair. Even with all the guards, drones, and security systems, your own greed is your greatest adversary. The objective's right there in front of you, but there's this shiny safe full of cash just slightly out of your way... There aren't even any guards on the way there. Probably. What's the worst that could happen?Eight turns later, you stumble into a dead end, the alarm level's gone up by two, and five guards are hunting you down like you ran over their wife and insulted their cat.Or maybe you don't stumble. Maybe you absolutely nail it, leaving nothing but cracked safes, snoozing penniless guards, and one very confused camera drone in your wake, as you head off to rob the next suckers blind. And there are always more suckers to rob.			"

												I was hoping for something that delivered the almost unbearable tension of ironman XCOM battles in a stealth focused form.The small team size and procedural map generation largely prevent this from being the case - random building layouts with forks both leading to long chains of rooms (one with the objective, one with a dead end) combine with a security timer to force you to split your agents up.  Once the team is split down to individuals the overlapping advance and interlocking support plans that make the best squad & turn based games so interesting vanishes.Completed the campaign once, which unlocks new stuff for the next play through.  Never felt any inclination to start that next playthrough.The game feels like it’s on the edge of being great and that a few tweaks that facilitated keeping the team close and provided more mutual support and interaction options could significantly improve things.

												I figured I should leave a positive review for this game as I've spent way too much time on this :DThis is the best turn based tactics game out there in my opinion. The focus is on stealth and speed, and you have to make every move count. There's a small margin for error on the highest difficulties, and it's very rewarding if you manage to get yourself out of a bad situation relatively unscathed.I love the fact that during the missions, almost everything is deterministic. The layout and the guard patrols may be randomly decided, but everything else is predictable to the point where you can plan a few turns ahead and execute it just as planned. When a mission goes south, even then you can use very dangerous tactics in order to guide your enemies to locations/directions that will help you successfully escape. There is hardly any luck involved, and pretty much every challenge has a solution. But make a mistake, and it could all be over.If you give this game a try, play on the expert difficulty level. Or expert plus if you want a real challenge. The game was made for those two difficulty levels and it's a blast.Every few months you get an itch to play this game again. At the time of writing, this happened to me again. It's still great!			"

												Invisible, Inc. A truly remarkable, and downright mindnumbingly great game. One of the most interesting parts is that success or failure isn't merely some random luck of the die, but the result of your action. In a sense, you feel you succeed because you took the steps to succeed, and you feel like you failed because of your own mismangement, and not because of the game's cruelty to you. It's a game that gives you all the time you want for your turns (unless you're playing time attack), deciding where you want to put your agents, where you want to move them, what to do, what to hack and the like. But it only gives you very few opportunities to take those decisions back. You know that when you do make your agent do something, you hack something, that is a decision that you made and you will pay for it, however good or bad it will affect you in the end.One of the most amazing things in the game is the soundtrack. Not merely for how wonderful it is, but how it actually slowly changes from a subdued theme to a heart pumping track as the alarm levels pile up, making you feel the tension that's filling the air as security becomes more and more difficult to deal with. It add to that layer of how the game feels, how everything is meant to get you into the mood of how tense all the action is getting.I will say, the game isn't perfect. It does have its flaws. The story, though nice and quite good, is a rather short one. Even with the tension of 72 hours, you're given a story that gives you details, but only just. You get some idea of the world, but not enough to get a better picture. But these are issues that don't detract from the solid game that is still there.			"

												This game is amazing on so many levels.First of all, the eye-catcher, it's very unique art-style.Something which is by now expected of Klei Entertainment.These guys pull out something new out of their hat for each title they create.And Invisible, Inc. is no exception to this, standing out of the competition even on the first look.There are even little details, like the A.I. which is helping you out getting more an more silly, as it's power-supply is dwindling throughout the campaign.The gameplay is also quite unique in the way, that it's featuring two seeminly contradicting goals, first, be stealthy and careful, secondly be quick.The game features a security-level which will tick up for any turn you make, but it will also raise if you get spotted by a guard, or if you are even killing a guard without certain preparations before.If the security-level reaches certain amounts the stage will become harder, by adding new security measures like additional cameras or adding additional guards, sometimes with even better equipment.Diving deeper into the gameplay, shows that the games rules are extremely solid.It's not leaving any room for debate over an actions turnout was luck or the players own fault.This removes a lot of frustration from the game, because you could never argue that you had just bad luck, or the game whould be cheating.If something goes wrong, only you only have yourself to blame.But the game has some problems.The campaign is fairly short (about 4-5 hours per play through) and the story told is nothing even remotely as engaging as it was the case with Mark of the Ninja or Shank. Klei could certainly have done better than this.Additionally the number a different enemies is very limited with not even a dozen different kinds.But were Invisible, Inc. Shines is it's replay ability with 10 different options for starting agents, some with alternative loadouts and several different starting programs for your A.I.Additionally the game features several difficulty levels, which limits your ability to redo turns and stages, as well as raising the security-level in more extreme ways.But that's not all, it features a massive amount of different options to customize your own difficulty and even different modes aside from the campaign, like time-attack mode or endless mode.So, in the end, the short campaign amounts easily 30+ hours of gameplay if you want to at least try out every mode.

												Invisible Inc is a turn based stealth game.  As such, it fits a niche that I haven't seen filled, and it does it quite well.  The turn system is very similar to X-Com, but without the randomness.  Actions are either possible and they will succeed, or they are not possible and you can not attempt them.  This is a good thing, and it eliminates the frustration found in X-Com where your sniper would miss time and time again on shots that had a 99% chance to hit.  While the AI in this game is not the smartest, the fact that every level is randomly generated, and you can't go back to a previous save when you fail, means that every playthrough will be different and still challenging.  During Early Access this game was incredibly good, but incredibly hard.  The release version now includes diffculty options and a story arc (a very good one so far, I might add) allowing you to ease into the game.  Once you are finished with the story in the game, you can play on endurance mode, where the game will just keep randomly generating harder and harder missions for you.  This was what the early access of the game was like, and I liked it back then, so I can see it keeping entertained after I am done with the story arc.			"

								Invisible, Inc is a game made by the same developers of Don't Starve. Very similar to X-Com (both the futuristic setting and gameplay) but focuses more on stealth. In Invisible, Inc you break into different facilities and have to complete objectives, like stealing an item or rescuing a person. The gameplay is both complex and fun; and you really feel the tension as you're playing. Like most rougelikes it's brutal and a single mistake may lead to death, although there are ways to avoid this if you're careful. It's great at forcing you to adapt to situations and I really appreciate that. The game's still in Early Access but Klei update it every 15 days or so. I highly recommend it to fans of the stealth, rougelike and turn based genre's.			"

Early Access Review
								Early access review for 2015-1-20Invisible Inc is an stealth game with roguelike elements, an interesting setting (Can't go wrong with some cyberpunk), and procedurally generated levels that will test your skill at stealth not by making you control a spy and sneaking around yourself, but by having you command a team of agents as they sneak around. It is a somewhat unique game, as a tactical turn based stealth roguelike there is little like it. It manages to avoid the problem many stealth games appear to have, which is that every room is a puzzle to get through on its own with no relation to the rest of the mission, often with alarms cooling down after a few seconds of waiting and with oblivious guards. Invisible Inc is different. The alarm won't go down, the guards won't overlook you, and your agents aren't bulletsponges. In this game you will need to get through the whole facility and exit with your objective(Or without, if you fail it) preferably before the alarm is raised and all the guards come looking for you. To assist you in this, aside from your skilled agents, is the ability to hack into the building's security. You can take over cameras, drones, and almost everything electronic. It does stealth right - It's hard, it's lethal if you get spotted(But not impossible), and yet gentle enough that you can take risks and experiment with different tactics and builds to see how they perform and to push to the limits of your skill and the guard's vision. Beware though, if you are easily discouraged, this may not be the game for you. It takes from roguelikes and if you lose your agents, that's the end of that run. An agent who dies can be revived in the mission with expensive medi-gel, if you can get to them before the guards surround them, but if you leave without them they are lost forever(Or until you start a new game, at least) The game is harsh, but fair. If your agents get shot, they go down. If you shoot a guard, they also go down. Guards who have seen you will actively hunt for you, and if you move too slowly your presence will be detected, and the alarm raised. You may also find that if you are not prepared, you are up against much better guarded facilities than you can handle.All in all, it's very much worth a buy, offering a unique experience that will allow you to keep coming back to it. And what's more, the developpers seem to be dedicated to finishing it. On your main menu there is a countdown in days for when the next update will come around. So if you get tired, you know how long until you can get back in and explore again			"

												Invisible, Inc.~~~~~~~~~~ The Invisible HQ was overthrown by a surprise attack from the Corporation. In the chaos of the intense fighting, Central had just enough time to retrieve “Incognita”, a high tech software that is used for hacking purposes. Unfortunately, “Incognita” will only run for another 72 hours on backup power and you have to get as many resources as possible to setup your counter attack.This is truly an exciting and challenging turn-based strategy game with a stealth component to it. You will start your campaign with 2 agents and “Incognita” at your side with it’s infinite hacking skills. Each mission you play will be randomly generated which make this game brilliant in term of replay ability.  Guards, enforcers, drones and demons are some of the enemies you will have to face within your missions. Realistically, you need to achieve your main objective and make sure you gather all credits (if you can) as fast as possible because every 5 turns the security level will increase and you might find yourself surrounded by additional foe. This game does not hold back and you will probably find your agents frequently cornered or even being killed if you make the wrong move. However, you can rewind (limited) to your last move, up to 5 times if you play as a beginner but only 1 time in the expert level.Between each mission you will be able to purchase additional equipments, weapons and other items for your agents and you will need it!The graphics are well done, the game runs smoothly and you will enjoy the cutscenes. Positives:~~~~~~~~  -	Randomly generated missions-	Challenging-	Good graphics and voice over-	Trading cards-	AchievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~~ -	Can be frustrating at timeInvisible Inc will keep you on the edge of your seat.

												If xcom is commadning a military team,invisible inc is commadning a team of burglers,There are a lot of similarites, however the key differences are that your team of burglers don't want to kill anyone, or alert anyone. If you like turn based strategy, it's very good. The game kind of lacks in game modes and difficulty settings, endless and a campain, that are not hugely different. One thing that makes this game speciall is that all the randomness is in the map generation, there is nothing like a 20% chance that your team members will just miss.Game length is about 20-40 hours of content. More if you want to go into the insane difficulty modes, however that difficulty kind of breaks the game.			"

												Simply one of the best single-player games I've ever played.The theme is evoked well and the mechanisms of play are finely tuned. The real genius though, lies in how the game handles mistakes. In many games failure just costs time, or you are forced to reload whenever you make a mistake. Invisibles Inc. also allows this, but it really shines when you set up a game without rewinds or reloads. Then you get to experience how good a game can really be. The perfectly executed stealthy infiltration can quickly become a deadly game of cat and mouse, and successfully pulling unconscious agents out of a botched operation is way more satisfying than a reload could ever be.Points of reference could be XCOM or the best roguelikes, like Brogue, but I think Invisibles Inc. outclasses them all.My only criticism lies with how certain equipment can make core elements of the game trivial to overcome. It's not so fun when you have a ""super agent"" able to avoid or overcome all opposition. The relatively short campaign time-frame and random item availability prevents this from becoming a significant problem though.			"

												One of the best stealth games I've played.Getting straight to the point, this game is basically the love child of XCOM and FTL.You will control your agents, which will have their own set of unique abilities, to get through each mission with varying objectives. Unlike XCOM, one of your highest priority isn't to eliminate the hostiles in the mission, rather you have to get in, complete the objective, then get out as quiet and efficiently possible.You will improve your agents capabilities using credits, equipment, and augments you've earned from one mission to the next, all in preparation for the big final mission à la FTL.A relatively difficult game, but once you understand the mechanics well enough and you enjoy that satisfying feeling of executing a plan flawlessly then you will love this game.PROS:-Strong mechanics-Satisfying gameplay-Huge replayability-CyberpunkCONS:-Difficulty spike for the last mission can be frustrating "

												I really enjoyed their previous stealth game (Mark of the Ninja), so I was looking forward to this one. At one moment of the game the mission loop became a bit routine, so I expected there will be introduced another feature to enrich the gameplay... but instead of it the game was suddenly over, much earlier than I'd expect. It encourages you to play it again with an increased difficulty, but it's not really that compelling to play it again.			"

												It's truly a nice game for strategy game lovers. It contains impressive story, lots of gadget and attractive levels. Turn-based gaming rule allows you needn't run in a hurry, but you still have to decide carefully what to do next. You'll feel like a real agent as the movies when playing. I really like it and have it for my brain exercising.The only disappointment part for me is that it costs a little higher than I expected, for its simple graphic elements and only 1GB disk storage. (Yep it runs fast anyway) $9.99 would fit me and I think most people would like to see a cheaper price.			"

Early Access Review
								Anyone who enjoys stealth games: GET THIS GAME! Invisable, Inc. managers to combine the turn-based ""combat"" from games like XCOM and combine it with the stealth of games like Deus Ex and Splinter Cell. The game has a unique mechanic where the level of security goes up every five turns, meaning that if you take your time you may have a much harder time escaping later. This also means that you can't just wait around for the guards to move because more will show up if you take too long. Another great thing is that the guards NEVER give up searching after they see you. The bottom line is if you want a very tactical stealth game based on skill and planning and not waiting and luck, this could be the game for you. It feels very polished for an early-access game.			"

												Turn-based stealth - what's not to like?Generally, my biggest turnoff in turn-based games is random elements, specifically in combat. XCOM was a big offender in this, and while I still enjoyed it, I found myself constantly savestating in case I missed an 80-90% shot. In Invisible Inc, however, the combat is pretty black and white - if you're seen, you have one action to retaliate (or, more realistically, get out of sight) or else you're shot. The hacking mechanic is solid, adding a unique layer of strategy and resource management.Only two minor complaints come to mind - the music isn't all that memorable and the guards are pretty often underwhelming. (So far though I've only beaten the easy campaign - in hard the alarm raises when you knock out a guard, so it looks like you have to be much more careful)			"

								*Early Access Review*I want to like this game.I want to like this game.I REALLY want to like this game!Problem is that the diffifculty curve starts at insane, there's little to no training, and even the easy missions are painfully hard.Normally in these games I'd wind up save scumming for an extended period until either I learned the tricks of the trade, or finally upgraded my characters to the point that I can handle the missions.But you're not allowed to do that in this game. You lose a guy, it's autosaved and they're gone forever. You can't save during a mission.And due to how the game is created, that being that the system builds each stage from scratch, and that you're on a time limit before bigger scarier badguys show up... well, you can't wait for patterns, sometimes the patterns don't help you, and if you go slow you die.You also die if you go fast.People who love hardcore difficulty games will love this.People who suck at them, like myself, will never complete a single stage after twenty tries.*sigh*			"

								This game is awesome and well worth the price if you're a fan of roguelikes and turn based isometrics. In my opinion it plays like a blend of old school xcom (line of sight mechanics, turn based gameplay, overwatching) and the first metal gear solid games where stealth is a huge part of gameplay and getting noticed by guards has dire consequences. It is not an easy game at all, however you do feel like you're getting better and learning more after every death. Saving a prisoner or stealing corporate intel and getting away without alerting guards feels so good.			"

												A masterclass in design. Every single mission, from the simplest to the riskiest, is like a small heist movie playing out in front of you. Each procedurally generated level is interesting, tense, and provides just enough wiggle room for you to barely succeed by the skin of your teeth. I was initially skeptical of the premade agents (as opposed to X-Com's randomly generated ones), but having set characters allows them to be more three-dimensional in their personality and loadout, making for thrilling combinations as different squad configurations lead to whole new strategies. The sound is excellent. The visuals are clean and striking. It's extremely difficult, yet welcoming and intuitive. It's great. Buy it.			"

												I have backed this game in it's early stage, watched it go over the changes and tweaks. When I first played it, the game felt very raw. Nothing really made sense and game only had two gamemodes available. And one of them wasn't even complete!Look at this game now. Graphics look fancy smooth, every action has an animation, missions have detailed description on what advantages they can give you. The game now have noticeable difficulty settings and allows you to chose from over 6 gamemodes. Not only that, but you can set your own way of playing, by selecting the custom option. And they even have voice overs now. The tactical element of the game have definitely improved since then as well. Altho AI still doesn't seem very smart, on higher difficulties it proves to be quite a challenge to outplay it and still to come out on top.If you are asking yourself, ""is it worth my money and time and should I even bother with this game?"" I say yes. Buy it and it will not disappoint you.Also, it has guns.			"

								This game is unforgiving, cruel, against you, angry, and rough, but that is what makes it so great. Permadeath is real. One hit kills are real. Smart guards are real. There is nothing handed to you, and on the contrary, it feels as if you are robbed from time to time. It is a little frustrating at times, but not in a bad way. The game has a learning curve to it, and, if you stick with it, once you figure out how to go about sneaking through a level without using force until it is completely necessary, the world becomes your oyster.This game is made for people who love playing chess on master difficulty. As it continues to be developed, I hope that they add more of a story line, but as for gameplay? I feel as if they have a nice foundation that will only improve as they continue working.			"

												I don't like this game, because the whole concept is based around stress. In every level the enemy hacks your ai and rises the alarm level every game round until there are more and more guards swarming the level. And if you take out a guard it does not raise an alarm(only if you kill a guard, the alarm level goes up) but start to search the surroundings. So this spy game is basically not about stealth but getting your mission done while being hunted by guards. And this concepts makes this game for my taste incedibly annoying. Its not about careful planning and tactics. Its more about having luck to take the right way in the beginning, dodging guards by staying out of line of sight and clicking things. I also don't like the automatically generated maps. The result is that all you do is hacking terminals, hacking cameras, hacking safes or free a prisoner. All that with a simple mouse click. Always the same, even if the levels look different. If the game is difficult then not in cause of a complex tactical situation but just because there are many auto-generated guards swarming the room you have to go through. There are most of the time no ""alternate solutions"". You can't expect more than an additional door.I was expecting a more Deus-Ex like gaming experience, with nice gadgets, more complex hacking, real stealth, alternate approaches and ways to solve a problem. Remember that game? Tons of way to get into a enemy base. Secret intel about the enemy base to collect. NPCs you could talk/force into helping you. Background information about the things you do. I also miss any kind of small story lines about the companies and enemies you rob. So... No immersion. No believable game world. Just automatically generated level where you start to get hunted by guards sooner or later while trying to find the exit.			"

												So after playing this game for quite a while, finally beating it on the highest difficulty and trying out many possible starting combinations I've got to say - this game's a blast.Procedurally generated stealth experience that is actually a stealth experience, not just sneaking around and sneak attacking enemies deliberately placed in their spots by a designer, tweaking the level so you can play through it in a ""sneaky fashion""? Damn son, that sounds like something really neat.In this game you will have to take risks, adapt to everchanging circumstances and even though the game's turn-based, you will constantly race against time, trying to optimize your every move because the clock is always ticking. Oh and there's no turning back - you only have a few rewinds for one save, so every mistake counts.Hard, innovative, unique and satisfying - and I really mean every single one of these words. If you like games that are an actual challenge and you kinda like stealth games but feel like you've never actually been given an experience that could be trurly called ""steath"", then this game is worth checking out.One of my all-time favourites, yet another shiny gem made by Klei; game's top notch in every one of its aspects.Check it out, it's really amazing.And by the way, I really recommend watching a 27min long talk called ""Designing Procedural Stealth for Invisible Inc.""; you can find it on Youtube. One of Klei's designers talks about their way of approaching the idea of making a stealth game that is actually very different on many levels from any other well known games from this genre.The stuff that this guy says in it is really, really interesting and it actually made me enjoy the game even more.

												I absolute love this game. Its difficult and you have to think about a lot of different aspects with every single move you make as they WILL have consequences for how the level plays out.You also have to be careful not to waste turns as the security becomes more intense with every security level. I really like that about the game, it sucks you in and it makes you have to REALLY think, to me, thats quite rare. I like the stories of the agents as well as the story for the game, however i do think the ending was a let down. I'm hoping they make a second game so it can continue and we can see what happens next. I thought the ending itself was great, it was unexpected and i was excited to get to play in the aftermath. When i saw the credits and discovered that was the end i was really dissapointed... until i discovered custom mode. Once i noticed what you can do with the game in custom mode, it made me wanna complete story on experienced, it made me determined to finish it to unlock more items and then play on custom mode. I finished the story on beginner level in less than 6 hours of playing time and i am now doing experienced level. So far i have had to restart a few times, which i think the game expects and rewards you for in the sense that if you tried hard and you gain enough XP you unlock agents and things for Incognita. I currently have 5 agents (you start with 2) and ive only been playing for 11 hours total. I cannot wait to start custom mode and i really find this game to be the strategy game ive been missing for ages. When i first saw it i didnt think i would neccesarily enjoy playing it, but i REALLY do. I got the game yesterday. & i've played for 11 hours. Speaks to how gripping it really is. I definitely reccomend this game if youre looking for something challenging and tactical that doesnt require a beastly computer and has a cute story to it.			"

												The design of this game is so perfectly tuned.Within missions there is little to no randomness involved, so most failures feel like mistakes that you deserved. The game stacks the odds against you, but then provides you with a wealth of information and abilities to puzzle out a solution. At times it can feel more like a puzzle game than a turn-based strategy game (which I think is a good thing).Also the roguelite elements are great for replayability. The random level generator is very good at generating interesting, challenging level layouts and unlocks and abilities make each run satisfyingly different right from the start.			"

								A really great tactical turn based espionage game.The game has a high replay value thanks to it's randomly generated levels, each with it's own objective. Players can choose from a list of missions allowing for a particular style of mission if desired. Likewise, the game offers a number of unique characters some of which must be found and unlocked during rescue mission.

								Invisible, Inc is what I would describe as a ""Cutting Edge"" turn-based game.The mechanics that govern how the player controls the character(s) during missions is top-notch -- I wish that more turn-based games functioned in this manner.To be specific, each character can use their AP (action points) in any order with very few restrictions and the control system does not punish the player. This design philosophy sets Invisible, Inc apart from many other games of the same ilk and makes the play experience far more satisfying.There is a Story mode with a unique scoring mechanic and there is also an ""Endless"" mode, the latter of which I found very much to my liking.As someone who has been playing turn-based games for over a decade ranging from X-Com to Final Fantasy Tactics, I can assure you that this game has a very progressive control scheme.

For the first four hours of play, I was thinking this is really a great game.  When I reached the point of total story immersion and was anticipating the next mission and chance to use my newly acquired weapon...the credits roll.  I went back to see if I had accidentally bought an early access game, but no, it appears this is it.  After finishing the campaign in about 4.5 hours, I now have the option to play the same missions over and over again with increasing difficulty, but that would be increasingly less satisfying.  Therefore, I personally regret the purchase.  It is a great concept and perhaps some won't expect more than it is, but the campaign was only 1/10th of what I would have expected it to be.  Unfortunately, half-baked/full-price games have become the norm.			"

								""Banks and Internationale stood, trapped in a corner with nowhere to hide as lights flashed red around them, and sirens began to wail. Three guards bore down on them, weapons drawn. Banks looked wistfully at the ginger hacker who had become her friend, then shook her head, reached out, and took Int's hand. ""I'll see you next go 'round."" she whispered, and jammed her custom paralyzer into her friend's arm. The frail hacker's eyes went wide with betrayal, then understanding as half a dozen bullets slammed first into Banks. then her own thin frame. She couldn't feel a thing, the injected venom had dulled her pain. She slumped to the floor next to her partner in crime, and smiled slowly. ""Next life."" she whispered, and closed her eyes.""I wasn't a fan of the six character permadeath thing at first, but it's really grown on me. Each character feels uinque, and knowing how frail and easily killed they are makes them, oddly, seem more badass. When it only takes one shot to kill you, the fact that you're breaking into a facility filled with guards and robots and (most of the time) making it out alive again feels incredibly empowering. Also it makes each characters untimely demise feel all the more painful. A few AI inconsistancies and one or two pathfinding blunders have kept this from being a perfect game, but it absolutely nails the tone and style. Heartily recomended.			"

												Invisible, Inc. is a turn-based stealth strategy game with roguelike elements.You control a team of up to four operatives through a number of procedurally generated levels. There are several different mission types with different objectives and rewards.The core gameplay is excellent and you are pretty much forced to rely on stealth as lethal weapons are rare and weapon reloads are expensive. A single hit will kill any of your characters and the game is rather unforgiving with your mistakes. Luckily you get a limited number of rewinds to fix your errors.In addition to your operatives, you also control Incognita, an advanced artificial intelligence. Incognita can provide combat support by hacking various devices such as safes, turrets and enemy drones. This adds a nice second layer to the battles.While the gameplay itself is great, there are some design decisions that I'm not really a fan of. Most importantly, you are given a strict 72 in-game hour limit for the campaign. This only leaves you time for a pretty limited number of missions to improve your team and to prepare for the final mission.The game could have also used some more variation with the levels as they start to look rather repetitive after a while.Despite these flaws Invisible, Inc. is still a good game and I'd recommend it to any fans of stealth or turn-based games.The Contingency Plan DLC pack adds new items, agents and two extra days to the campaign. Overall I think the DLC is a good addition and I definitely enjoy the longer campaign more.The good:- Smooth UI- Gorgeous art style- Interesting game mechanics- Fun gameplay- Good variety of agents, items, and programsThe bad:- Repetitive levels- Difficulty varies a lot- Fixed time limit in the campaign			"

								Invisible Inc. is a spy/stealth/strategy game set in the near future: A dark dystopian world where a pistol magazine can hold a maximum of three bullets and ammo is so scarce that even spy agencies cannot afford to buy it; A world where cybernetic implants cost the same as tranquilizer guns; A world where CEOs of megacorporations pisses away all their money on implanting heartrate monitors into every security guard; A world where heavily guarded encrypted safes store less money than the average indie game costs...As silly as some of this may sound it is all actually well balanced and works really well. After I got over the fact that there is no simple way to buy a gun and shoot everybody I realised that right now this is one of the most interesting and innovate stealth strategy games on the market. And besides, where's the fun in a stealth game where you can simply buy a machine gun to mow down all your enemies?A lot of stealth games encourages you to stand around for ages to wait for guards to get into the right positions so that you can do whatever it was you set out to do. Invisible Inc recognises that if you were a superspy, you wouldn't be able to spend all day waiting around while the entire corporate fortress you have infiltrated goes into full lockdown mode. A superspy would move fast, take what they came for, and get out. There is a nice tension to Invisible Inc. and it really feels satisfying when your team of highly trained espionage agents move like wraiths through a building hacking systems, stealing corporate info and tech and dissapearing before the security system realises what is going on. Take too long, and the chances of your agents making it out alive becomes smaller every turn.If you like stealth games and you can deal with something that it a little tense and challenging, you should definitely buy this game. A word of warning though, this game can be really punishing and the learning curve is quite steep, so be prepared to die early on and start over a few times.My only complaint at this stage is that the game could use a little bit more content and a lot more context. The procedurally generated missions are fine, but outside of missions there is very little to do. The story mode involves you having agents on the run, infiltrating corporation after corporation in preparation for a final mission. There is an ""Endless"" mode but right now that is simply story mode again without the final mission, which means that essentially it feels and plays a bit like a survival game. It really feels like there should be a ""career"" mode (for lack of a better term) where you can systematically build your espionage agency.That said, the price is reasonable and the game is still in early access. Knowing Klei it is likely that more content will be added before and after the full release.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a fantastic roguelike stealth game. For an early access version, it's really well polished and balanced. Without knowing this I'd think it was a full release version. Before I played it I didn't think that it was possible to do a roguelike, procedural environment suitable for stealth gameplay, but there it is. This is a gem. Tough, fair, fun.UPDATE:So it came out of early access and it's even better. There are voiceovers, there is a final mission that is a total nailbiter and some cinematics. I dig the art style. I just beat the game on expert and hoo boy, only 53% of achievements unlocked. And because it's a roguelike, replaying on tougher challenges (and the endless mode and the endless plus mode) means that I can keep playing without getting bored: levels don't repeat themselves.The one OP thing seems that the rescue missions give you extra agents. Once you're up to 4 it makes the later missions a lot easier. I'm not sure whether 4 agents is the maximum you can have, but even with 4, the last mission becomes a hairball quick. I won't talk about the last mission not to spoil it, but the layout also changes from one replay to the next (I failed my first ironman take on it), so it can affect your tactics greatly.Pro tip: guards have two vision cones: the big cone (noticed squares) and smaller cone inside of it (watched squares). You can step into noticed squares without getting shot, and guards will investigate that square. You can kite them off their paths this way.You're welcome.			"

												If you like turn based and stealthy games, this one will not disappoint. It's always a balancing act of what you're willing to hack, what safes you're willing to break, and how far you'll push your agents before you decide it's time to get out.A lot of people aren't happy with the length of the game. If you play story, that may be true, but you can do custom games to play on an endless campaign and tinker with a whole suite of options.Banks was cut off from the team and was swarmed by four heavily armored guards. She ran around between two rooms for eight turns with the help of Decker revealing the guards' movements before finally slipping past them. The game creates some very intense situations and the increasing security gauge makes those intense moments.This is definitely a game with a ton of replayability with the procedurally generated maps. Definitely give this game a try, you won't be disappointed.			"

												Invisible, Inc. is an excellent take on the turn based tactics genre with a strong focus on resource management, stealth and non-lethal takedowns. This game makes me think of XCOM with a bit of Deus Ex and a hint of Door Kickers. There is a risk-reward system in play. The longer you stay on a level, the more resistance you encounter as the time goes on. With that risk come opportunities to collect more loot and steal more credits. These resources will in turn help you more adequately prepare for future missions.The campaign is relatively short, but there seems to be a good deal of replayability.Also I think I'm in love with this game's art style and animation quality. Absolutely gorgeous!			"

Early Access Review
								I'm constantly amazed at how often I'm sucked into this gem of a game. Even as an early access release, the developers have done a fine job crafting the entire stealth experience. I can't count the number of times I've found my heart beating a little faster knowing that I'd just gotten myself into a terrible, terrible position that I could have avoided.While the game's difficulty is high, that's to be expected from a roguelike where you are expected to die - and die often. Yet getting back into Invisible, Inc.'s various scenarios is always a joy. There's an excellent sense of strategy in choosing your agents, your hacking programs, and then slowly amassing your own collection of gadgets and stat upgrades to help you deal with the various threats in the game. Choose wisely, and the right moves and gadgets may allow you to rescue yourself from utter defeat.And the best part? With each build update, the game just keeps getting better and better, with more things to do and more toys to play with.10/10			"

												Absolutely! One of the best games I've played. I am not good at writing reviews so I will keep it short. This is a game for people who love inventing stratagies and are patient and don't mind difficult games. There are a good selection of ""modes"" to play in for people who prefer different diffuculties. The story is pretty good but don't go in just for it. It is really just some extra butter on a nice slice of toast. You will find yourself in situations where you really need to stop and think. Your every move counts and (assuming you are not on the easiest difficulty) if you fail a mission, the whole campaign ends. It adds a layor of immense intensity to the game. Voice acting is excellent although there isn't a lot. This isn't really important but there are an equal amount of female and male agents if you are someone who cares about that. Anyway. I see people do this so I will try to do a rating thing.STORY: 3.5/5GAMEPLAY: 5/5REPLAYABILITY: 5/5VOICE ACTING: 4/5CONCEPT 5/5GRAPHICS: 4.5/5OVERALL: 4.5/5I would reccomend reading other reviews as they will be more detailed.

												It's a decent turn based game. Well made, intuitive to the experienced players in the genre. So why give it a thumbs down? Lack luster story, progression, and depth. It's short, over-hyped, and not worth the price tag. Basically I'm saying you can find something juicier for less. I was dissapointed once I realized replaybility was tethered to repetitive grind of the same concepts while unlocking more agents and upgrading them. I suppose that has appeal to some people, but so does watching paint dry, or watching the same show over and over again after the last season ran over a decade ago. To conclude, if you're looking for depth and immersion it's best sought elsewhere, because this game does not deliver. Unless you love the idea of working quality control on an assembly line this won't do anything but dissapoint you. If for whatever reason you love mind numbingly repetative gameplay then you could actually consider this review as a thumbs up, because then this is the game for you.			"

												Invisible Inc is an amazing game. I've been playing it over the past 2 weeks, and the more I play, the more I like it. Currently have 45 or so hours clocked in the game, which is actually the second highest playtime of any game in my Steam library! It's also one of the most addictive games I have played in recent memory that keeps drawing you back for more. Those 45 hours were played in under 10 days.Anyways, the gist of the game is that it is a punishing ""rogue-lite"" turn-based strategy game, with a heavy emphasis on stealth. It draws inspiration from XCOM Enemy Unknown and has got similar interface, but the core tactical gameplay is very different. The game's campaign can be completed pretty quickly (on your first try on Beginner, you should do it in under 4 hours), but this game has been thoroughly designed with increasing difficulty levels in mind. From Beginner to Experienced, and then to Expert, you should get three complete runs at least, each offering a unique playing experience. Also, you will die a lot, particularly when you get to expert, so the game makes you learn from your mistakes to improve future runs. I myself played the game on Beginner first, then after 15 or so tries I got through Expert, after which I played Expert Ironman and finally completed Endless 5/10 days in the same run. The game's levels are always randomly generated. Initially, I didn't like this, cause sometimes you can be dealt an unfair hand and the level generated could be extremely difficult to traverse. But eventually, over time, you learn to deal with it. There's an element of risk vs reward. Do you go slow, at the expense of your alarm tracker increasing quickly...or do you go faster, at the expense of being spotted by the enemy? Even though I've played for 45 odd hours, there are so many unique combinations of augments, programs, items and weapons that the game has got an incredible room for experimentation. Since all of these are randomly obtained or bought along the way, you always have to adapt your playstyle, and as such, the game doesn't become boring or repetitive. There are 4 different enemy corporations, each of them having a different unique threat, so that adds to keep the game fresh as well. There's also around 7 or 8 different mission types, and you have to make your choices count on which mission type to select, based on your needs. When I played the game on Beginner at first, I liked it. Then moving on to Expert, I found it too frustrating to the point I was almost going to stop playing. However, once I cleared that hurdle and moved on to Ironman and Endless runs, I have grown to absolutely love the game. Recommended if you like turb-based strategy like XCOM, and/or if you like stealth games, and/or if you like challenging games that punish and make you learn from your mistakes.			"

												A very solid game, consistently developed through Early Access.  It is pretty well polished and I was thrilled to play through the full release version.If you played or read about Mark of the Ninja (also by Klei), you know that they take stealth games seriously, especially in the way they provide interface feedback to the player and allow multiple paths to victory.Invisible, Inc. is a great game in the squad-based-grid-tactics spirit of XCOM, and also in the I-can't-believe-they-killed-me-that-isn't-fair! spirit of XCOM...although just as with that game, as you learn and get better, you'll know that you are to blame, and the game isn't unfair, it is just difficult.My favorite thing about this game, which came later on in Early Access, was the ability to really tweak the kind of game you want, including difficulty, Iron-Man-style, duration (endless mode), etc.  This truly gives the player the choice to play the level of challenge they like.I recommend this game without reservation!

Invisible Inc. is a turn based stealth game. You choose from different missions and agents in order to gear yourself up for the final mission. The stealth in this game is awesome fun and I never would have imagined that a turn based game would have such awesome stealth. Depending on which agents you use and which implants weapons and upgrades you get you will want to handle different situations differently which means there is a lot of replayability. Customisable difficulty and game modes also really add to the replay value. There are 3 base difficulties and two extra game modes and a super ruthless difficulty (expert+). Endless for people who don't like things ending and time attack to really put the pressure on by timing your turns. Perhaps the best aspect of this though is the fact you can tweak your difficulty with a myriad of different options.THE GOOD- Randomized levels- Easy to learn- Permadeath keeps every decision tense- Challenging stealth- Different play styles- Colorful art style- Risk Vs Reward gameplay adds lots of depthTHE BAD- Unchanging story- Some random stages are way too cluttered- Enemy AI isn't the greatestDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

								After a mere 3 hours in-game, I can say without a doubt that Invisible, Inc. is an awesome piece of work. From the makers of Don't Starve (Klei Entertainment) comes a stealth game similar to all of those flash-based spy deals you used to play as a kid. This adds in beautiful artwork and voice acting, although the gameplay proved a bit klunky for the first two hours.Once I broke the learning curve and began winning six or seven missions in a row, the game continued to reward me with extra items and improved skills (no surprise there). Even for an alpha game, this is a great buy. Glad I picked it up for 25% off.UPDATE: Still a great game, but the developers seem to have thrown on a lot more mechanics than necessary. In beta, I felt that decisions tended to be simpler and less punishing.			"

Early Access Review
								I have only played this game for a small amount of time, and I do have a few other things to try out for it, but here is my review on the game, Invisible, Inc.First thoughts, this game is challenging and even sometimes unfair because of how hard and tricky it can be to complete the objectives, not just partially, but completely.   It is very punishing for if you make mistakes, such as not looking before entering a room, or for not closing the door behind you as you ran pass it.   However, this game is somewhat like a game of chess.  You have to think ahead, plan on what to do if certain events occur, and know when to stay down and wait, and when to be aggressive and go for the push.   With that said, this game will not do well for those who play without thinking, or jump first, look second.Gameplay:   Invisible, Inc. is a top-down isometric game that is turn-based, meaning that after you do whatever it is you do, the enemy has their turn to do whatever it is they do.   Also, this is a rogue-style game, so you will die often, and when you do, you will start from the very beginning.    In terms of mechanics, you pick to play with two agents who each have their own little niche in things.  One agent has better movement ability, so he can move farther and let others move farther too.  Another agent can scan for computers and electronics in a certain radius.  Aside from that, the agents all have their own, slightly unique, stats.  The stats are broken down to Stealth (affects movement), Inventory (storage space), Anarchy (affects stealing traits), and Hacking (affects hacking skills).   You earn money to buy upgrades.There are also items and weapons that can be used to assist you in the break-in.  These range from lethal weapons such as pistols and rifles, to non lethal weapons, such as paralyzers and target marking guns.   There are also tools to be used in helping such as an invisible cloaking device, items to instantly hack a computer or camera, or a noise distracter to draw the attention away from you.    With storage being limited, you have to think wisely about what to buy/take and what to sell or not take.Aside from tools and weapons, there are collectables to steal that will fetch a nice sum of money, an even hostages to rescue, who can help reveal more locations for you to break into.Graphics:   Just looking at the pictures on the store page should give you a good enough idea on what to expect.  IMO, the good thing about graphics like these, is that they are unique enough to give it its own style and not rely on 'super 4k HD parallax & mega bloom"" style of graphics, and thus keeps the focus on the game itself, rather than the looks.   And of course, people with weaker performing computers, can easily run this game.Sound/music:   Not many sounds or music things going on but the current sounds that are heard, are good in that they make it easy to tell what it is that is going on when you hear it, like the sound of quick loud footsteps means a target is running, instead of walking.  Or the Alert, target spotted, sound played when you get spotted.   There is very little variety, if any, music, but that keeps the atmosphere focused.  Personally, I wouldn't mind there be more styles of music, or a music style change after the guards have spotted you for the first time (kind of like how payday the heist was)Other thoughts:   This review will be updated sometime after the big big update that is set for sept. 30.   Since there are hints for new things coming, I will most likely change this if it adds more stuff to the game.  Until then, I would like to point out that this is an EA game, and it is clear that it is not complete.  What I mean by this, is that the story mode of this game, is short.  After you complete, you unlock Endless Mode.   And after playing through it a few times, there is nothing much to do.   The levels are randomly generated I believe, and that does give it a nice 'new ffel' to things, but the building tiles used for each 'unique' place, are pretty similar and it can be repetitive.    Also, being randomly generated, there are times where the AI or the setup of the guards, is just outright, impossible to counter, and usually ends up being a game where you either all die together, or one person makes a break for it, but make sure to not get spotted, or else you have one action to do before you get shot.Overall:  This is a great turn-based stealth game that has a lot of potential, and in my opinion, is an example of an EA game, done right.   Hopefully this next update will add the amount of stuff that it is showing.  Til then, I'm just going to try out new things and see how it goes.			"

												No other game does tension quite like Invisible, Inc.This is a turn-based tactics game, giving you control over a small number (typically 2-4 agents) and tasking you to infiltrate the premises of various rival corporations. As you do so, you build up the resources of your own corporation, be that more cash, more equipment/weapons, a larger pool of agents or new hacking software.Perhaps uniquely in its genre, Invisible, Inc., also plays like a roguelike, and it practically expects you to fail a number of your campaigns attempts before you eventually succeed; this might imply, the game can be brutally difficult at higher difficulty levels. That may be a turn-off for some, but so long as you're not too concerned about achievements, there are excellent controls to tailor that difficulty to your liking - much more than just the typical easy/normal/hard, etc.The gameplay centres around the tactical missions, which take place at two levels. First, you have the movement of your agents, moving through the levels to attempt to reach your main objective, complete the relevant task (steal an item, extract an agent, acquire personal upgrades, etc.) and get out alive. As each turn passes, the security system of the corporation you're infiltrating rises, steadily bringing online more defences, summoning more enemies and generally making your progress more challenging. Because of this, moves are a limited resource and every one feels meaningful.On top of this, you can expend power to use hacking tools - disabling or taking over obstacles, unlocking equipment caches and similar such abilities. Again, though, this power is only a very limited resource (earned in a number of ways, depending on your loadout choices), so every decision on when to use hacks feels very meaningful.  As you progress through the game, you can acquire new hacking tools, broadening their usefulness.When it comes to enemy encounters, there's no XCOM-like randomness - if you shoot, you hit - with the downside being that this applies to your enemies just the same. Making the decision to take out an enemy is, as with everything in Invisible, Inc., not something to do without thought, though - doing so will lead to that security level ticker accelerating upwards.Ultimately, every mission is a balance between how much you benefit want to try to extract against how much risk you can afford to take, and knowing when to stock pushing your luck and head for the exit is a crucial skill.I've focused so far only on the tactical encounters, but for good reason as these are the game's core. However, it's at least worthy of note there's a limited metagame overlaid over the these, allowing you the opportunity to buy new equipment with cash from missions and then to select your new mission from a number of options.I can't finish without at least a nod to the game's *superb* sense of style throughout, expertly capturing the dystopian futuristic aesthetic, and with a punchy soundtrack to boot.As I mentioned at the start, the game does expect you to play through it a number of times, which can mean that it becomes a little repetitive, but with each playthrough you unlock new options for your starting agents and loadouts - making full use of these allows the game fresh in spite of any repetitious aspects.All in all, if you're looking for a tactical game to test your skills, without ever feeling unduly unfair, and with excellent customisation, Invisible, Inc. gets my highest recommendation "

												Fantastic game centered around tactical risk/reward decision making combining the best elements of FTL, Gunpoint, Light, Mark of the Ninja, and Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Levels are procedurally generated with extensive options for modifying the level generation parameters and the graphics are beautiful.Glad to see the developers include a diverse cast of women in the agency. The game is set in an extremely distopian future, where transnational corporations openly control public policy, while employing high tech conventional and cyberweapons, surveillance, and general shenanigans to keep the populace in line. Invisible Inc., a private agency of criminals and revolutionaries, are attempting to wrest control away from the corps. Obtain cybernetic upgrades, performance-enhancing drugs, cash, and an arsenal of weaponry from high-security corporate banks, weapons depots, prisons, and labs.Invisible Inc., rewards less lethal play and has a fairly sophisticated stealth system incorporating sound and shadow. When guards notice a dead colleague, more guards are called and the alarm level raised, making escape much more difficult. Destruction of emplacements in the buildings also incurs a financial penalty, so your best runs will take these penalties into account as part of the overall risk/reward dynamic of the game.Highly recommended.

												An awesome stealth/spy Roguelike.For the main game, you get a limited amount of time to perform as many ops as you can, making the most of stealth and hacking to get through stages. Steal from the corps, get clues on where to go, free other agents to join your team. All of this prepares you for the final showdown.There is also the option for an endless mode, where you simply see how long you can run missions before something goes horribly wrong.The mechanics are solid and the stealth system is very well done. Peek through keyholes and around corners to get an idea of what's coming. Observe guards to figure out where they're patrolling. Hack into cameras to make them work for you. Use blind spots to get the jump on enemies, or more often simply to get around them.This isn't a combat game. While there is knockouts and some lethal weapons, the majority of this game is based on getting through a stage with as little attention as possible.A hell of a lot of fun, and full of replay value. A must have.			"

Early Access Review
								I've recently found out about his game on klei forums and ever since i saw the trailer about a couple of months ago i was so excited and intrested in trying this out i usually never play spy games or turn based games but i was willing to give invisible, inc a shot because it was made by my favorite company, so i bought the game and my breath was taken away just at the main menu the art style the music just everything about it gave me chills (just like my all time favorite game don't starve) so i KNEW this game was the one. First thing i did was start up the tutorial (I recommend this to everyone who starts) it was fun easy and simple to learn how the game needs to be played! After that i created mission mode I've done a lot of reading on the forums so i knew alot of the stuff that was supposed to be in the game so i did the first mission got past 1 building pretty simple your fun stuff you get to do in this game and no others! I took out guards hacked into mainframes, safes, took over a TURRENT it was just baller and truly fun but then i died on my 2nd building due to me being curious what was behind the door P.S Always peek through doors never just flat out burst and run! And remember patience is key to winning sometimes and my favorite person so far would either be shalem or deckard! this is so worth the early access price of 16! Might as well get it now so you don't have to pay extra later and enjoy your fun now!			"

												Without the DLC, this is a relatively short game. With the DLC, it's about medium-length.The ending may not be to everyone's taste, as it starts with a ""to be continued"" and then swerves. Hard,However, Inc is so exceptionally polished that it works perfectly as a roguelike, story aside, and is the absolute culmination of the gameplay formula implemented by Shadowrun Returns. Inc's universe is not as rich as Run's, but Inc is also a tighter, more focused game that squeezes in world-building only where it's unintrusive. If you enjoyed one game, you're likely to enjoy the other.Gameplay in Inc orbits around careful planning and risk management and shouldn't feel unfamiliar if you're used to tactical RPGs or you loved Monaco, but folks who prefer kicking down doors and going in guns blazing might be put off. The music and visual design help to culture a nicely tense atmosphere and it's easy enough to forget that you can walk away, make a sandwich, eat it, and come back all in the same five second interval of game time, but the first couple lessons the game teaches you tend to be hard ones. The kind that prematurely end a run.Still, defeat isn't bad in Inc, as it lets you cash out your xp and get new optional unlocks for your next attempt at the campaign.			"

												It's fun. The tactical game is very good and interesting. It is tense and often quite exciting. Graphics are well done and thematic.My complaint would the lack of replayability. This game gets old pretty fast and there's virtually NO strategic element to the game. Imagine pairing this tactical gameplay with a strategic overlay and purpose like one of the XCOM games? I'd literally starve to death playing that. But they didn't seem to put much thought into the story or strategic side of the game and it's relatively non-existent. As a result it feels like half of a really good game.			"

Early Access Review
								The world over, take note! This game is a perfect example of Early Access Done Right.The game is built around a solid base of turn-based stealth with sound risk/reward mechanics, and new features are added every patch that add to the experience without introducing horrid imbalance or aggravating bugs (yet).The core game is very challenging, even on easy, and mistakes are often brutally punished. But it's a good kind of challenge. Once your agents are skilled up and have a decent augment or two to their abilities you'll be much better equipped to roll with the punches. The brilliant part is that the punches get harder the longer you play. If you risk a lot early, you can be ahead of the curve, if you play it slow and safe then you may find yourself ill-equipped for later challenges.Without having hit final release yet, I can already recommend this game as being one of the all-time greats in gaming. It's doing strange new things with the stealth-em-up genre and absolutely hitting the mark.Buy it. Don't even wait for release, buy it now.			"

												Invisible Inc is a triumph. If you like difficult games (though the easy mode is fair), replayable games, turn-based strategy games, or feeling like an absolute hero when you escape by the hair of your chin, you'll love this game. For being a grid-based game and able to be played on just about any computer, the production quality is very high. It's a beautiful mix of great storyline and asthetic and well-constructed, challenging, and remarkably deep content. I recommend picking up a few of the workshop mods that expand the items and agents available. One of the best games I've played on steam.			"

 My game of the year for 2015Tactical EspionageTactical: Of or pertaining to the arranging, positioning, or maneuvering of forces in contact or near contact with the enemy, so as to achieve an objective or objectives in a campaign or battle.Espionage: The practice of spying or of using spies to obtain secret information, especially regarding a government or business.I love, love, love this genre of video games and  Klei Entertainment dishes it out with style in their Spy thriller Invisible, Inc.The game play is intense! Last round of the game I was down to three out of a six man team. I thought it was game over. Determined I played my moves right and pulled through with a heck of a come back and won the game! Very tense, very slick in many aspects. Sharp, edgy also come to mind with a lite story and an ending that will kick you in the teeth. Incognita goes Skynet. Which makes me believe there will be an Invisible, Inc. 2 or at the least some DLC and that's fine by me!Are there any down sides? Well... some might call this game short. I have no problem with that and others might proclaim the items are scarce. IMO that makes the game. Play your moves and items right and you'll be surprised at the turn out!Oh yeah, here's a tip. Close doors! All of them! Also make sure to purchase the Taurus program asap.Invisible, Inc. "

												Imagine FTL injected with a heavy dose XCOM and sprinkled with the Mark of a Ninja's art style and stealth, and you get Invisible, Inc.It's a very unique stealth/strategy rogue-lite game which borrows different mechanics from different games to create a one-of-a-kind experience. You choose two agents at the beginning of each campaign, and you're tasked with gathering resources (weapons, gear, agents) to prepare them for an end mission after some allotted time. You're given a map filled with different missions, and each one is tailored such that you're given something special in return. One mission may filled with credits to spend on items, while another may supply you with a third agent to help you. Deciding between these missions is crucial, as all of these assets you're sent out to gather are important to survive and succeed in the end-game.The missions themselves are highly engaging, compelling, and challenging, and takes on a turn-based mechanic like in XCOM. It's a stealth game, so you either have to maneuver around enemies, or take them out silently. Everything in the game is a one-hit KO, so being spotted once is most likely going to lead to death, which is probably my favorite part of the game. It feels so engaging. Every turn matters, and the decisions you make have dire consequences if carried out recklessly, however, you must act swiftly, because every turn ticks a timer on an alarm, and the higher it gets, the harder the missions become (more surveillance cameras, more enemies, higher hacking costs).The game is also a rogue-lite, so each subsequent run awards you exp which unlocks new agents and gear to bring along to the next one. You're also given an exhaustive list of different customizability options from changing the length of each run to changing how many guards appear on each mission to how many rooms there are in each mission. It's crazy! You make the game as hard or easy as you want.The art-style is also gorgeous. Definitely has that Klei feeling. The gameplay is so deep that it's hard to go over every single aspect of it, but for the price it's most definitely worth the price of admission. IT'S AWESOME.			"

												This is a turn based strategy game like X-Com, but it has less options and is a little bit simpler.Does this mean the game is bad? No, it's on the contrary a great and entertaining game.It has all the excitement of a turn based strategy game minus the long 'one more turn' bogs.Plus you can't just kill everyone in sight. The game is not designed that way. You have to manage your resources (power and incapacitation) and you have to make choices and leave things behind. So the choices you make do affect your gameplay.I like this game. I'm excited about it. I want more of it.			"

												Invisible Inc is just incredible. At the time of writing this, I've dedicated nearly 3 days of my life playing this game (both in early access and in full release), and I don't regret a second of it. The game is fantastic, with fun gameplay and interesting characters. The story is great, and I cannot stress how amazing the final mission is.  It's incredibly intense, and by far the best mission in the game. The cutscenes could do with a bit of improving, but that's really all of the bad things I have to say.Klei say they plan on releasing DLC too, which is great, because then there's more to add to this fantastic game.9.8/10, would definitely recommend to anyone.

								Invisible Inc is one hell of a strategy game. Every move counts. Every turn counts. Every detail in preparation, be it the equipment you choose, the mission type, security level or travel time matters. One single mistake can mean the difference between a massive reward or a botched op.The game uses an alert level system which increases at every turn, pushing the player to act before it gets too difficult. It's a little unsettling at first, especially in the beginning when agents don't have a lot of action points. But it's there for a reason: without it, there would be little challenge because of the nature of the game: it's a stealth game. Without it, you could take 300 turns to recon all point of interests and patrol routes and the game would get boring fast.The game challenges you to remain undetected as much as possible, as killing guards raises the alarm level instantly, while neutralizing them is only temporary, after which they will actively search for you.Sneaking past patrols and using cover is immensely rewarding. I've seen comments about some situations being unwinnable because of the random level generator, but that's simply not true. Every situation has a solution, but you may lack the proper preparation, strategy or equipment to win it. If that's the case, the game actually encourages you to cut your losses and head to the nearest exit. A failed mission is a lot less painful than losing an agent, since the game only has permadeath.Invisible Inc is a gem that no other game can really compare to. It's in its own league as a stealth-based turn-based strategy game.			"

								Lets get one this out of the way, this is the most frustrating, venus fly trap of a game as has ever existed and as such you should be keep that in mind when buying....A learning curve almost childs play the game draws you in with promise of riches beyond your widlest dreams and all you have to do is take them....easier said than done for this game as something you dont.. Guards, these lumbering patriots walk the walls furiosly and in some cases stare at the walls blankly awaiting your magnificient entrance. Your agents peek through the door and catch ones eye,  here he comes through the door straight into your web and slam! youve knocked him out and stolen his id card. You now have accesss to the floor and upon releasing the prisones you increase your agent count!.....this game is too easy you think strolling around the corridors without a care in the world, this will take minutes...Enter the elite garden and his clevel Daemon friends, these higher level secirty measure can quickly over power an inexperienced and cocky move and will often lead to complete team death as well as miserably ego bruising in seconds. Yes this game has it all, the suspense the thrill, jesus even the violent deaths and in my opinion what more do you need from a british agent :) Carry on Spying Chaps =D			"

												There are three questions that you need to ask yourself if you're on the fence about buying this game1) Do you like stealth games?2) Do you like hardcore Roguelikes?3) Do you like Tactics games where you have to balance limited resources?Now, just looking at the tags listed on the game, it shouldn't come as a surprise that this game is all of those things. But you have to understand, it is those things arguably in their purest form.Most good stealth games are designed to inscentivize stealth and sneaking. Think of Deus Ex or Dishonored, or (to a lesser extent) Assassin's Creed. Those games reward you with a smoother, cleaner getaway if you are patient, meticulous, and forward-thinking, sneaking around to find out gaurd patterns, using violence only when you have to. BUT you could still play any of those games like a normal action game, mowing through enemies as you go.Invisible Inc is not like that. It is pure in its aspirations to be a stealth game. Your capacity for violence is limited, and it is usually not your best option. Knocking enemies out puts you on a clock waiting for them to wake up (unless you leave behind a teamate to babysit them and keep them knocked out). Killing enemies results in an instant increase in security as well as a small 'cleaning fee' at the end for each corpse you leave behind. So most of the time, you want to stick next to cover and stay unnoticed for as long as you can.So, again, ask yourself; do you like stealth games? If you really like being in that mindset of avoiding contact, never getting caught - if you've done pacificism runs for fun, or often find yourself trying to explore shooter maps without tipping off enemies, you'll probably love this game. This game is also a Roguelike in a pretty pure sense; the beginner level difficulty is challenging but fair, and a very good way to get used to the mechanics and the characters. Everything past that is extremely difficult, and you have to go in expecting to fail often. Like in other more recent roguelikes, such as FTL or Binding of Isaac, there is unlockable content that you get a closer crack at with each failed attempt, so losing doesn't hit as hard, Also keep in mind, the beginner mode is lots of fun and still plenty challenging without having punishing difficulty. So, if maybe hard-as-nails-roguelikes aren't really your thing, you can still get at least 15 hours out of this game replaying story mode and trying out all the unlockable characters. Each playthrough is different, and the more you play, the more you learn interesting tricks or combos. You can unlock basically everything playing on beginner, so don't feel like you'd be missing outif you don't dip into the deep end. But if you honestly ENJOY getting spanked by a game, then I think this is really up your alley.Lastly, I asked you if you like tactics games where your resources are limited and your decisions matter. Think of games like X-com or Banner saga - on missions, your characters are each finely honed tools, with their own limited bag of tricks. Maybe you have to keep track of your Ammo. Maybe you have to keep track of your Power level. Maybe you have to keep track of how close they are to eachother. The many different items and characters allow for many different playstyles, but while on a mission, you will be juggling something, making tactical decisions and taking educated risks based on what and who you have. Then, in between missions, you're deciding how to spend (or save) your money, how to distribute items, and what missions to go on, with missions having varying enemy types based on where they are, varying loot based on what your aiming for, and each taking a certain amount of time out of a limited clock of time before the final mission. Suffice it to say, you have a lot of decisions to make, and all of them matter.For me, this game is perfect. I answer an emphatic YES to all of these questions, and all of the games that I just compared this one to more or less make up my 'best of' list of games. This is a synthesis of all the things I really like in games right now. However, I recognize that I am an audience of one, and not everybody likes the same things I do. So ask yourself those questions, and if it looks like a yes on all fronts I would heartily suggest you buy this game.			"

Reasons for Buying Invisible Inc.What can I say? I've been watching this game since it came on Early Access but I never buy/play before the final release. Lucky for me I didn't because now I can see my life disappearing down the wormhole of ""just one more run"". This game manages to perfectly balance the risk vs reward combo that is a necessity in all ""resource management"" rogue-lites (think FTL). Too many times I have had an agency retired by a single guard standing in the way of some final corporate safe that I think I can make only to find out that I've just over reached...And then I start again. There was an excellent Extra Credits piece on how the speed of restarting can be very important and it is only ever a few mouse clicks to restart an agency here. The combinations of skills, implants and software where all approaches feel valid leads to a game that feels infinitely playable.It also never sacrifices its vision. Despite being able to stand up to the corporate forces in any singular instance, it is never going to be a winning strategy and stealth should always be your first option. The limitation on rewinds forces needing to learn how to read a room, guard patrols and alert statuses in order to pick which side of a bench you are going to crouch behind... pick the wrong side and you'll be hitting restart shortly.Reasons Not To You have work tomorrow You have an assignment due that requires more than 5 minutes work You don't want to play one of the best tactical turn-based or stealth games ever released "

								By far the most complete Early Access game I've played. Took about 2 hours to play through the easy mode story. It shares a lot of features with traditional rogue-likes (perma-death, procedurally generated levels) and turn-based games like x-com (action points, overwatch abilities) those two things blended with the stealth aspect make the game perfect for me. The alarm stages must have been toned down since the complaints I heard, while they add more guards, I always felt they ramped it up nice and slowly. I never felt like the game was pushing me through the level, but the alarm stages helped pile more danger onto things when you messed up.Can't wait to go through it again on the normal/ironman modes with all the new agents.

Early Access Review
								Fascinating little game from Klei, the creators of Don't Starve, with a beautiful cyberpunk/espionage style that instantly had me buying. The game still feels barebones and needs plenty of improvements, but the partial content so far is impressive. What stands out positively is its stylish hand-drawn artstyle along with decent UI and gameplay. The characters and their personalities are fun as well, but I can't help but to hope for a little more interesting & diverse cast by the time the game is published. Or perhaps to learn a little more about them in-game as the intro text is all the description you will ever get on both the characters and the world they live in.In terms of gameplay, like in most rogue-like & perma-death genre games, there is a steep learning curve and while it is entertaining, levels can quickly become devastating. It offers a very tense, challenging experience but I wish there was more context for some of the game's attributes, such as the passive ""alarm level"" timebomb or the purpose of ""reputation."" I'll have to add more when newer builds get released, but I think this has the opportunity to become a brilliant game & I hope it suceeds. Good luck klei!			"

I kind of wish it would be slightly kinder to those of us who don't particularly care for roguelikes (the inability to save and load a game like less ""hardcore"" games is not fun for me), but a lot of people seem to love that stuff.Anyway. Get this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Fascinating little game from Klei, the creators of Don't Starve, with a beautiful cyberpunk/espionage style that instantly had me buying. The game still feels barebones and needs plenty of improvements, but the partial content so far is impressive. What stands out positively is its stylish hand-drawn artstyle along with decent UI and gameplay. The characters and their personalities are fun as well, but I can't help but to hope for a little more interesting & diverse cast by the time the game is published. Or perhaps to learn a little more about them in-game as the intro text is all the description you will ever get on both the characters and the world they live in.In terms of gameplay, like in most rogue-like & perma-death genre games, there is a steep learning curve and while it is entertaining, levels can quickly become devastating. It offers a very tense, challenging experience but I wish there was more context for some of the game's attributes, such as the passive ""alarm level"" timebomb or the purpose of ""reputation."" I'll have to add more when newer builds get released, but I think this has the opportunity to become a brilliant game & I hope it suceeds. Good luck klei!			"

												Very strong, would recommend. With a neat, compact story, clever style, and a level up/income system that presents you with constant ""this or that"" choices, when you know you really want both, Invisible Inc presents some tight stealth game play that effectively ramps up the tension without (I think) unduly stressing the player out. Easy to turn on, easy to turn off, if you enjoyed XCOM (that is to say, nail-biting turn-based how-do-I-keep-this-guy-alive-now game play), then this will feel like a natural fit.The campaign is painfully brief, beatable in a handful of hours, and that's a pity - there's a lot more I'd like to have seen. There are a lot of nice replay options to explore (a la Don't Starve), and that's a plus, but not a complete substitute for a lengthier campaign. I can only hope that an (appropriately priced) expansion is forthcoming, as there's plenty of room to add more agents, gear, software, and opponents. This shouldn't stop you from getting the game, however, if you like careful planning, pleasant tension, and a game with style. 8/10, if only for the brevity; the game play, aesthetics (visual and audio), and campaign (such as it is) are strong.

												Great game. The game benefits from repeated plays and the numerous game modes such as ENDLESS where you try your darnest to avoid FRACTAL 2.0 as long as possible.  In a way, this game does rogue-like better than XCOM or Darkest Dungeon given that you always have a time limit - the main story you have 72 hours to do what you need to do; Endless has the ever-increasing difficulty where you will get HOSED if you are not prepared for the long haul by Day Six or so. You are always under time pressure and money pressure. Expect a great game with wonderful mechanics and enough items/agents/augments to keep you playing and trying new things. The DLC is also great, namely for the story missions (The Research Lab, the Forge). The Steam Workshop has a few dedicated modders who provide great stuff (the 4 extra agents added so much replayability to this game when I was starting to wonder if I had any reason to run something other than Internationale/Nika every game.)Lastly, yes, this is a stealth game. BUT. You owe it to yourself to embrace the lethal weapons and fire bullets when you need to. The game tells you that lethal weapons are rare. It tells you that reloads are expensive. It has the alarm level rise a ton on deaths. Buy a Flurry Gun. Give it to Nika. Disable enemy heart monitors. Enjoy the carnage.			"

												Invisible Inc is such an awesome game! I played during early access and was really quite interested in it, It's great to see how far the game has come and the things that has changed. Highly recommend getting it if you're interested in turn-based strategy-ish games, and who doesn't like secret agents?. Just don't expect it to be easy ;)The basic storyline is that Invisible Inc. HQ was overthrown by a surprise attack, which resulted in the company fleeing the building. Central, the owner of the company managed to retrieve the special program ""Incognita"" before leaving, but the program can only run on backup power for another 72 hours.It's a turn-based stealth game where you take control of a handful of secret agents (2 to begin with, but can increase to a maximum of 4) which break into big corporation buildings. Your agents move silently (while not running) but with guard patrols you have to plan your moves carefully so they don't get seen, which involves hiding behind cover. Your agents have weapons such as the Neural Disruptors which temporarily disable guards for a few turns, while an agent is on top of them they will pin them down and the guard won't be able to get back up. You can also steal money and key-cards from guards to get through locked doors. Once a weapon is used, most have some sort of cooldown. There are also weapons that can kill guards, but killing guards will set off their heart monitors which raises the alarm level.""Incognita"" is a special program which Invisible Inc. owns, it allows them to hack cameras, safes, turrets, and other objects to take control of them. You need power to hack objects, which is gained from consoles around the map. If an agent is seen by a camera it will start recording them and guards will be alerted to their location. If a guard finds them, it will enter overwatch and will shoot during the players turn if the agent being targeted moves into an open area. The agent must either find cover (behind a object in the room 1 square away), use a cloaking rig to turn invisible, or the guard has to be taken out. With a limited timer in the main game (72 hours (not real hours), though there is also a endless mode) you have to choose places which are near, and determine which buildings are best to visit first. For example, some places such as the bank vaults (money!!) require special access cards gained from other levels to get into the high security vaults (aka: extra room with lots o' money). Also look out for detention centers which hold another agent which can join your team if you manage to rescue them.Also, graphics are great, cutscenes are beautiful. I just love the high-tech look of it all, even the menus are pretty. <3			"

												I previously wrote a review for this game shortly after it entered Early Access. After leaving it for some time, I returned a couple of days ago when it was fully released. And holy hell, the game has been seriously, SERIOUSLY polished.Graphics/SoundGorgeous. Every character is stylised and are distinctive in their appearance, making telling your agents apart a breeze. The music is wonderful and frankly rather catchy. It doesn't intrude on your game, rather simply bolstering the experience. The tempo of the music speeds up as the alarm level rises, toying with your sense of urgency and driving you to get your agents out as fast as possible.Gameplay/UIThere has been some beautiful polishing here. Guards can be easily identified, along with their visual area - parts of the map that are in their cone of vision but behind cover are also easy to spot, making navigating the somewhat tricky rooms nicely intuitive. Cover is abundant when it needs to be, but never clutters the map.Visual representations of information are good, too. Footsteps generate little echo pulses, rooms you have visual on are nicely distinguished from rooms you don't, etc.The UI is clean, well-designed and frankly wonderful to look at. Abilities are easy to comprehendThe game is, above all, a challenge. The turn-based nature allows you to take your time and make planned decisions, but every mission has a propensity to go straight to hell  because of a guard walking into a room just as you're crouched over his mate's body rifling through his pockets. The game doesn't pull punches and you frequently have to make sacrificial decisions as to whether you want to risk everything on getting those lat couple of safes or play it safe.The addition of limited rewinds (The ability to undo decisions) is a fantastic one. You can switch 'em off if you feel it's too cheaty, but the game only allows you to rewind a few times before you're stuck with your choices. You have a safety net, but it's made of dental floss and chewing gum.Long story short: If you like tactical, turn-based games, well done stealth elements and games with a good difficulty scale, you need this game.

												Please note that this game is much more complex than Shadowrun, XCOM, or many other turn-based strategy titles.  There is consistently much more to manage in-game.  It proved a little too much for me.  In addition, sometimes the procedurally-generated levels seem a little uninspired.  Lastly, the game expects you to play through multiple times, and perhaps to fail on at least one of these playthroughs.  However, when you fail, you unlock a few more options for the next go-around.  I would much much prefer simply a longer campaign, rather than retreading the same story notes over and over.			"

												Invisible, Inc. is one of the best stealth games I've played to date (and I normally don't take to stealth games...I'm too impatient).  The art style and music are fantastic to boot, though I REALLY like the fact that you can customize your game setup by adjusting individual sliders/buttons.  Easily recommendable!

												Can be a challenge but the reason it's not recommended is the game is only 6 missions - that's it.(based around the plot point the computer ai helping you only has 72 hours to find a system or she dies / runs out of power for good).  I thought it would maybe go into act 2 or something - but it ends and just says play again on increased difficulty.Being such a short game - it's hard to really advance your characters or experiment with different gear unless you just play again.   I remember not being able to get into a vault w/o a vault key that you can get on other missions.  (apparently some really cool gear in that vault).  BUt such a short game no chance to really do that.  Missions into areas for ""better gear"" is a joke as you still have to purchase it.(you just broke into / hacked into some complex  illegally - and you have to buy gear from a system you just hacked).

												You are a team of half-machine secret agent ninjas teleporting into buildings and stealing everyone's stuff without being seen. This is what all stealth games should be.A bold move by Klei, the king of bold moves in videogames, this is an isometric turn-based PvE cyberspy simulator, and it goes much better than you'd think. It's 2074 and government has been replaced by evil supercorporations, so your targets are one of four of them who own all the credits and shiny plasma guns. Gameplay consists of ninja-ing around buildings, predicting guard patrols, stealing items, hacking mainframe devices to use to your advantage, and trying not to get annihilated by the constant barrage of unforseen threats. A lot of this game's fun lies in getting ♥♥♥♥ed over halfway through a mission and having to dig yourself out, i.e., getting spotted by an unnoticed guard and alerting the whole building, security daemons that give you negative status effects, or just being an idiot and having no way to undo your mistake (You get 1-5 rewinds depending on difficulty). Invisible Inc. does not forgive, and I'm glad it doesn't, because then the missions wouldn't be mind-shatteringly tense to play, and incredibly rewarding to beat.As per Klei, the art direction is beautiful. The bloom from glowing hallways, the stylised futuristic theme, and the subtle screen effects, like distortion when activating Incognita (Hacker mode) make for an incredibly nice game to look at, admire, admire too hard, die, and admire the game over screen. The game over screen is also beautiful, because it along with the mission report gives you a plethora of information on how you were the most unprofessional spy agency on the planet. Another lovely thing about the levels is the tantalising prospect of the perfect run: nobody sees you, you loot every safe, hack every camera, complete the objective, and leave before anyone even realises you were there. This is a rare occurrence, but when it happens, it's like thunderous applause from every human being on Earth.The soundtrack... the soundtrack. It's exquisite. It's everything I could've ever asked for from this theme. The music ramps up gradually as security tightens, going from foreboding background strings to ""Everything is insanity and red flashing alarms and on fire"". It adds SO much to the game. Just - just listen to it. Go and look it up. It's masterful.£15 to be a cyberninja. Yes, Klei, that will do.			"

Early Access Review
								Fantastically envisioned turn-based stealth game with great tension, aesthetics, and deep mechanics that are satisfying to master. However, it requires a very different mindset from games like XCOM:EU- neither slowly inching your way through a level nor an all-out offense will get you very far. I definitely don't regret buying this in Early Access, and Klei is very open with Invisible Inc's community. Looking forward to this game's future.			"

												Thrilling from beginning to end, Invisible Inc. rewards inventiveness, foresight and careful planning with thoroughly satisfying victories. The emergent, ever-changing circumstances combine with a myriad of gameplay elements during missions to produce memorable situations, heroic escapes and tragic deaths.The game's short yet highly replayable campaigns can be doomed by certain mistakes, and while the random map generation might occasionally make missions harder, the ultimate result comes entirely from the player's actions. A solid plan can provide enough battlefield control to put a team through seemingly impossible scenarios.Stealth is always the best option, it's immensely fun and doesn't devolve into mindless action the moment agents are spotted. Unless part of an intricate plan, detection leads to a frantic revision of strategy and securing a escape route becomes paramount. The enemy corporations always have the upper hand in the event of a direct fight, which coupled with the ever-rising alert levels encourage the player to be quick and sometimes bold to outwit their adversaries.Overall, Invisible Inc. offers an unparalleled turn-based strategy experience and possibly the best stealth gameplay in the history of videogames. Definitely a strong Game of the Year candidate and a steal at 20 dollars.Buy it now and gear up, Operator! You're in for a wild ride.			"

It's stealth-cyberpunk action speaks heavily to an old Shadowrun RPG fan like me, and I often find myself agonizing over choices that all seem good, but which will affect my game in very different ways.I have fun playing with different combinations of agents & AI hacking programs, as well as trying to find that sweet spot of strategy where I am not a jack of all trades but also have not specialized myself into a corner.The continued dev support is much appreciated, and I hope more DLC will be made in the future.

												I was sceptical before I bought this game, because I am not particularly a fan of turn-based strategy. But Klei managed to produce yet another great game, which seems to avoid all the usual weak points of turn-based strategy. There are no random, chance-based damage numbers or critical hit modifiers. The gameplay is deterministic - for any action you take you know exactly what will happen, so you can precisely plan each turn. That doesn't mean there are no random events however, and the solid procedural level generation makes for a great replayability. That together with the great artwork and soundtrack makes it a must-buy.			"

												This game is a tactical steal-em-up set in the not-too-distant future. Similar to XCOM, if XCOM soldiers went down in one hit. This game is brutal. Good thing your agents have 360 degree vision, near-perfect information on enemy vision, and never miss a shot. Feel free to take your time planning your turn - you're going to need it, operator.The good:Replayability - levels are procedurally generated, with up to four possible flavors depending on which corporation you infiltrate. Players can unlock tons of agents and programs (and discover many more) so you can try out lots of different combinations.Risk vs reward - what you get out of a level depends on what you put into it. You can play cautiously, staying out of sight, only taking what won't be missed, or you can play balls to the wall, taking out guards left and right, stealing everything that's not bolted to the mainframe.Information - the game allows you to gather information to make a perfect move (or take a calculated risk), and you get to sit back and watch like an evil genius as guards stumble past your hiding places.The bad:Simple mistakes - there's a lot to keep in mind in Invisible, and some of the ones that will bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥are the most tedious to keep track of. Don't forget to activate Fusion! Don't forget to close doors behind you! Don't forget to hack before the firewalls go up!

												Klei Entertainment is turning out to be a company that is very hard to be disappointed by. Mark of the Ninja was a brilliant blend of platforming and stealth, and we're all familiar with the great survival game that Don't Starve is (even if you're like me and only know anything about that game because everyone you know seems to play it). Klei has given us another stealth game, except this time it's a cyberpunk turn-based game with a hint of strategy, and it has the be the best combination of those things I've played since Syndicate.You've got your standard cyberpunk themes in this game; giant megacorporations that rule the world, cybernetics, and everything including the coffee maker being hooked up to the internet. That last part is particularly important to you, because one of your most important tools in this game is an AI called Incognita who you will use to deal with the enhanced security you would be expect in a cyberpunk setting. Cameras? Hack them. Safes full of corporate goodies? Hack them. Menacing turret in the center of a room with four guards? You could hack it, but it might be a bad idea, as enemies usually have heart monitors that raise the alarm when you kill them. Doesn't mean you can't knock them out with your futuristic stun gun, though!Gameplay is fun and decently challenging, with the game never putting you in an outright impossible situation. Levels are procedurally generated,with often fantastic results, striking a good balance between obstacles and things that can help the player. The player navigates these levels with a team of up to four agents, though is limited to two at the beginning of every campaign. All campaigns have the same plot, but can vary based on which difficulty is chosen and the luck of the player with level generation. Completing a campaign, regardless of win or loss, rewards the player with experience, which unlocks more agents and hacking tools to choose from at the beginning of a campaign. With so many ways to start a campaign and so many ways a campaign can go, the game has tremendous replayability.The story is rather nice for what the game is. The game is actually fairly short, with most of the potential to steal your time coming from doing multiple playthroughs. Thus, there really isn't that much space for a story to fill, but it uses that space very efficiently. The game establishes its setting very well, and the player will have a good feel for the game world after one or two playthroughs. That said, there may be a few holes you won't fill in on your first playthrough, and characterization of the agents you have access to takes a few playthroughs to be truly complete. But at least every agent is unique in some way or another, both in story and gameplay. The plot itself isn't anything award-winning, but it will keep you interested and you'll love how it ends (No spoilers!).The graphics are nice, though it definitely took a cue from the style of Mark of the Ninja. The UI is great, and the player is given multiple ways to view and assess a situation.The music is nice to listen to, and every sound effect sounds just right (Something is really satisfying about hearing my agents tase the crap out of a guard).  Everything compliments each other very well, and it definitely adds to that stealthy feel. I actually can't find anything big to complain about with this game. It's been finished and polished very well, and I haven't seen any bugs or glitches on my end. The biggest problem in the game is that as a consequence of the level generation, security is occasionally placed in nonsensical locations with strange schedules, such as a guard that spends the entire level staring at a blank wall, and that's a really small problem. The game is terrific on every front, and in my opinion it's definitely a game that money is well-spent on. This is definitely a game that belongs in the library of any true stealth game fan.			"

								Invisible Inc. is a fantastic game from the same team that brought us Mark of the Ninja. The turn based style works amazingly well with the corporate espionage theme. Take one part XCOM, add a bit of Metal Gear Solid style stealth, and add a rogue-like element, and you have this game. Absolutely recommend 100%, this sub-$20 game is more than worth its price.			"

												Invisible, Inc. is one of the best-designed games I've ever played.  I am thrilled and challenged by its turn-based stealth combat. I don't see myself exhausting its many possibilities for a long time due to its massive replayability.In the game you control several agents trying to infiltrate a corporate black site.  As opposed to many games with stealth elements, you don't usually having the option of just going in and shooting everybody.  You are fragile and outnumbered, and your arsenal of weapons (especially lethal weapons) is quite restricted.  Instead, your most robust tools are your ability to hide using the generous cover system and your ability to observe the situation and plan ahead.  (Not to belittle the variety of equipment and hacking tools you can use to get an edge) You can spend action points to peek around corners and to predict enemy movements, and in the end form plans to get yourself out of extremely dangerous situations.However, the game is quite challenging because your strong tactical options in the short-term coexist with long-term strategic pressures.  In Invisible, Inc. the ticking alarm counter means you can neither act too slowly or too quickly.  Ghosting through the level entirely undetected reduces the chance you'll be caught in the short run, but in the long run taking too long means enforcer spawns that home in on your position.  Similarly, getting all of the loot scattered across a level takes precious time and thus accrues additional risk.  However, missing out on that loot just means you're that much less prepared for the endgame.The game is procedurally-generated, meaning that no two levels will ever be the same. On the campaign-level, you have some control over your initial starting agents and hacking tools (these get unlocked by finishing campaigns even if you lose).   However, most of your team's capabilities rely on assets acquired either in the randomly-generated stores or the mission objectives.  This randomness means you have to adapt to the options presented.  The only thing that is always fixed is the objectives for the first and last level (I haven't played the DLC level which I think is also fixed), and the plot.  The developers have included quite a few options for custom campaign difficulty, so you have quite a bit of freedom to adjust certain gameplay elements to your desires.I have seen some criticism for the fact that the game's story is short and is the same every time, but I'm happy with the length of a campaign and do not think that a procedurally-generated story would be possible with the same level of polish.  At the end of the day, I value the gameplay over other all considerations.  I will note that the game looks great while still running well on my aging laptop.  Overall, I feel this game was an excellent purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for an engaging (if sometimes stressful) turn-based game.			"

												Talk about a game with good design and heart, because Invisible, Inc. is exactly that: a combination of engaging gameplaying and lovable design.This is a game that I bought and never played because I shrugged it off as ""meh, it looks like another slightly above average indie game"", but I was very, VERY wrong. If you enjoyed XCOM and were looking for a similar game but with a stealth, Cold War twist, then this game might just befor you:WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THIS GAME? GAMEPLAY - Invisible, Inc. plays much like XCOM - it is turn-based, isometric, and relies heavily on tactics and positioning. There are some five different mission structures, and it is not easy to complete the levels perfectly (let alone at all, somtimes). Every map is randomly generated, so every playthrough is guaranteed to be fresh and exciting. 10/10 for this aspect, truly. ARTSTYLE - Much like Dungeon of the Endless had it's unique style and art, Invisible, Inc. also grabs and holds on to it's Cold War identity. The characters, maps, global map, and weapons look like something out of an old movie, and the transitional art in-between levels is gorgeous. VOICE ACTING - Monst3r takes the cake, but the voice acting in this game is top-notch. Nothing amateur here.SOUNDTRACK - The music and sound effects in this game are stellar. I found myself sometimes pausing youtube and just engaging myself in what the game had to offer. Some of it is pretty spooky and quiet, but it's really well-done.WHAT'S MEDIOCRE ABOUT THIS GAME? TUTORIAL - The only ""not good thing"" to this game is that occasionally you get confused on the mechanics, when do guards see/hear you, how to obtain neccessary items, etc. that you unfortunately discover with failure most of the time. If the tutorial was a little more thorough, this would not be an issue.WHAT'S BAD ABOUT THIS GAME? NOTHING - I have absolutely no quarrels with this game. It delivers everything it promises and does not disappoint.This game is the king, and if you are even mildly interested in anything I said or liked XCOM-esque in the past, immediately purchase this title at full price, and consider even going for the Contingency Plan DLC. I'm kicking myself for not having started playing this earlier, and I do not want you to repeat my mistake.9/10			"

								This game is more than ready to graduate from EA. It's about the only roguelike I've ever wanted to play more than a few times. In fact, I can't get enough! So many unique agents, and so much customization -- and you can unlock more by gaining XP with each run. The variety of items and enemies make for an interesting tactical challenge every time. If you like turn-based tactics, stealth, and high-tech espionage, Invisible, Inc. is a sure winner!			"

								Dreamed of being a special on a sneaking mission?Dreamed of being a hacker on a stealing mission?Dreamed of .. fighting your way to the access key of a safe?And you like turn-based games?Well, then Invisible, Inc. is the best game I can recommend to you!The game is easy to explain .. You have the control of a team of special agents, which can be rebuilt after every try, and Incognita, your personal hacking program, and you have to get equipment for the Final Stage. You get those equipment by stealing or by buying them (it would be the same way as you steal all the credits, too). Of course, it gets more difficult after some time as you have only 3 days to get those and your enemies make themself ready to kill you.Besides this interesting idea, the game provides a special graphic style that I really like, some music that fits the ambience, manifoldness and frequent updates regarding bug fixes or even new characters!The only problem I have is the fact, that I am too bad for this game in some cases as I just run into my enemies for example..All in all, it's is a really great game, frankly, one of the best games I've played recently.Kudos to you, Klei!

It's stealth-cyberpunk action speaks heavily to an old Shadowrun RPG fan like me, and I often find myself agonizing over choices that all seem good, but which will affect my game in very different ways.I have fun playing with different combinations of agents & AI hacking programs, as well as trying to find that sweet spot of strategy where I am not a jack of all trades but also have not specialized myself into a corner.The continued dev support is much appreciated, and I hope more DLC will be made in the future.

												Invisible Inc. is a wonderfully refined, highly addictive turn-based strategy stealth game. You control a small team of special agents that must infiltrate a randomly generated facility filled with just about every type of security measure you can imagine. It's your job to guide your agents through the facility and use the various tools at your disposal to complete your objectives. The game is short, but its value lies in its complexity. Everything in your arsenal, be it your agents, your hacking programs, your cybernetic augments, or your collected equipment, can dramatically affect how you play, making for a tremendous deal of replay value. Also, despite being a stealth game, the gameplay is incredibly fast-paced. Though you have an unlimited amount of time to make each move (unless playing Time Attack), every turn you take increases an alert tracker that makes the mission harder as more turns pass, creating an interesting balance between being careful and being swift. Though for those who prefer things more balanced towards one or the other, the amount of custom options available basically allows you to play however you wish.This game is all about progress. You start with a small collection of tools and must consider where to send your agents, what to spend your money on, and what you need most for the final mission that will determine whether you win or lose (provided you make it that far). Though the feeling of progress is unceremoniously lost to the void after completing said final mission, it's only really disheartening when you lose.Though the game gives you the ability to take back a handful of your moves each mission, this game can be very challenging on the higher difficulties, and while luck can be a factor, I find it comforting that the majority of my losses have felt like they were the result of my own mistakes, rather than the game placing me in a no-win situation. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in complex strategy games, games where every choice matters and every tool can change your play style. This is the kind of game you really get into once you understand how to play. Then you really, really get into it when you really understand how to play. Also, if you like computer hacking sound effects, this game has some nice ones.			"

Early Access Review
								5 1/2hours into the game and i was able to complete the game. Almost. I say almost as among all the other levels of the game, it cant be even compared to the last level of the game. Turrets in most of the rooms with daemon protected firewall along with all the other system.  Daemon protecred firewalls are basically like negative event or debuff that will occur to your team should you completely hack the protected system with that firewalls. With armoured guard and robots roaming the level. If you manage to get this far into the game and not all of your teammates have armour piercing taser or guns, be mentally prepared to have a hard time.Those of you who had played Xcom: Enemy Unknown, the gameplay is relatively similar. The difference is that you dont go in gun blazing, with rockets and nades flying all over the place. You go in quietly. The consequences of going in loud is harsh as the game progress on that level. Customization wise of your agent loudout before starting the mission is at bare minimum. You are not giving a variety set of tools and weapon to play with at the start. Those set of tools and weapons can only be bought through shops which can be found during your mission playthrough. The cost of such items is expensive and at this stage you must consider on sacrificing on leveling your agent or getting new sets of tools,weapon and augmentation. Even if you decide to buy things of the shop, the item being sold is randomize. So every level the item is different and you might get the items that you are not looking for.There isn't much content honestly (since I'm able to get to the final mission in just a few hours) as the game is just in early access. The game also mention that this is the 'last' of the content of the game so far should you be able to reach the final mission. The replay value so far is the wanting of unlocking new agents and perks for you to run through the game again. As the story mode allow you to pick the default 2 agents that is available as you start the game for the first time.I'm currently planning to go for another run of the game with the new agents and perks to see if can beat the game completely. Either that or waiting for new content being released before playing again. Those of you who like to play turn base movement strategy game and want to try something different yet similay, may want to consider in getting this game. For those that havent play such a genre before, I would recommend you should wait for the game to be out of early access. 8/10 would recommend this game.			"

												Klei Entertainment is turning out to be a company that is very hard to be disappointed by. Mark of the Ninja was a brilliant blend of platforming and stealth, and we're all familiar with the great survival game that Don't Starve is (even if you're like me and only know anything about that game because everyone you know seems to play it). Klei has given us another stealth game, except this time it's a cyberpunk turn-based game with a hint of strategy, and it has the be the best combination of those things I've played since Syndicate.You've got your standard cyberpunk themes in this game; giant megacorporations that rule the world, cybernetics, and everything including the coffee maker being hooked up to the internet. That last part is particularly important to you, because one of your most important tools in this game is an AI called Incognita who you will use to deal with the enhanced security you would be expect in a cyberpunk setting. Cameras? Hack them. Safes full of corporate goodies? Hack them. Menacing turret in the center of a room with four guards? You could hack it, but it might be a bad idea, as enemies usually have heart monitors that raise the alarm when you kill them. Doesn't mean you can't knock them out with your futuristic stun gun, though!Gameplay is fun and decently challenging, with the game never putting you in an outright impossible situation. Levels are procedurally generated,with often fantastic results, striking a good balance between obstacles and things that can help the player. The player navigates these levels with a team of up to four agents, though is limited to two at the beginning of every campaign. All campaigns have the same plot, but can vary based on which difficulty is chosen and the luck of the player with level generation. Completing a campaign, regardless of win or loss, rewards the player with experience, which unlocks more agents and hacking tools to choose from at the beginning of a campaign. With so many ways to start a campaign and so many ways a campaign can go, the game has tremendous replayability.The story is rather nice for what the game is. The game is actually fairly short, with most of the potential to steal your time coming from doing multiple playthroughs. Thus, there really isn't that much space for a story to fill, but it uses that space very efficiently. The game establishes its setting very well, and the player will have a good feel for the game world after one or two playthroughs. That said, there may be a few holes you won't fill in on your first playthrough, and characterization of the agents you have access to takes a few playthroughs to be truly complete. But at least every agent is unique in some way or another, both in story and gameplay. The plot itself isn't anything award-winning, but it will keep you interested and you'll love how it ends (No spoilers!).The graphics are nice, though it definitely took a cue from the style of Mark of the Ninja. The UI is great, and the player is given multiple ways to view and assess a situation.The music is nice to listen to, and every sound effect sounds just right (Something is really satisfying about hearing my agents tase the crap out of a guard).  Everything compliments each other very well, and it definitely adds to that stealthy feel. I actually can't find anything big to complain about with this game. It's been finished and polished very well, and I haven't seen any bugs or glitches on my end. The biggest problem in the game is that as a consequence of the level generation, security is occasionally placed in nonsensical locations with strange schedules, such as a guard that spends the entire level staring at a blank wall, and that's a really small problem. The game is terrific on every front, and in my opinion it's definitely a game that money is well-spent on. This is definitely a game that belongs in the library of any true stealth game fan.			"

												This game is a tactical steal-em-up set in the not-too-distant future. Similar to XCOM, if XCOM soldiers went down in one hit. This game is brutal. Good thing your agents have 360 degree vision, near-perfect information on enemy vision, and never miss a shot. Feel free to take your time planning your turn - you're going to need it, operator.The good:Replayability - levels are procedurally generated, with up to four possible flavors depending on which corporation you infiltrate. Players can unlock tons of agents and programs (and discover many more) so you can try out lots of different combinations.Risk vs reward - what you get out of a level depends on what you put into it. You can play cautiously, staying out of sight, only taking what won't be missed, or you can play balls to the wall, taking out guards left and right, stealing everything that's not bolted to the mainframe.Information - the game allows you to gather information to make a perfect move (or take a calculated risk), and you get to sit back and watch like an evil genius as guards stumble past your hiding places.The bad:Simple mistakes - there's a lot to keep in mind in Invisible, and some of the ones that will bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥are the most tedious to keep track of. Don't forget to activate Fusion! Don't forget to close doors behind you! Don't forget to hack before the firewalls go up! Etc.Procedural irritation - sometimes the level just hands you a plate of♥♥♥♥♥♥Shopcat - what a♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

								Firstly, this game is hard. It will take your lunch money and laugh in your face.As you go through levels, the variety of enemies, equipment etc ramps up, and each level is never the same.You are always ""against the clock"", as new guards and defence mechanisms spawn as the alarm level rises.Experience points gained in-game unlock new agents and hacking programs that can be selected in future games.Even as an early-access, the game is very solid, and Klei have promised monthly updates, introducing new content each update, as well as the expected bug fixes and balance tweaks. Klei have a solid history in this regard - they support their products well.If you want ""challenging"", a game that makes you think about every move, which you can't just roflstomp levels, then this is definitely worth a look.Just watch out for the Daemons....

There are still so many tactics that I still haven't employed yet, and I've beaten (and lost) the game multiple times. Investment is a necessity, but also a significant risk- if your agent dies, all that precious money spent upgrading his stats goes with him. In this game, everything has a cost. You must weigh your decisions, execute elaborate stealth tactics and balance survival with greed. Are you ready?			"

 In short: - Turn-based stealth with AP point system- Addictive, engaging, suspenseful, tense, strategic gameplay -  continuously planning your next moves carefully- Satisfying and deep mechanics (stealth and others) allow you to sneak about, kite and otherwise outplay the guards and security measures- Multiple characters, abilities, gear, augments, equipment and software provide many different approaches- Strikingly stylish design paints a futuristic, covert, secret agent feel- Atmospheric music that sets the right tone of stealth and suspense of imminent detection- Good procedural generation of levels creating non-repetitive, non-impossible levels - Very challenging but fair, with high ceiling for experience and skill- Interesting story and characters, albeit a bit short- Only one campaign but replayability with characters, gear, difficulty levels- Only suffers by being a bit on the short side - addressed by DLC Bottom line: The mechanics are so deep, well built and balanced, the atmosphere is so right (with the visual design and music), the gameplay is so engaging and addictive, and there are so many different agents, gear/equipment and software to use, this may simply be one of the best stealth games ever made. In detail: Invisible Inc. is a turn-based tactical stealth game which I feel has inspirations from XCOM Enemy Unknown and F.T.L. Gameplay is divided between the world map, where you manage your agents/equipment and choose between the different available missions, and inside the missions themselves, where you control your agents in a grid-based map with a AP (action points) per turn system.In the missions you spawn at a random spot and must explore and find your objective and the exit, taking advantage of anything you find along the way. Stealth is the absolute key, since your agents are knocked out in one shot by guards and robotic defenses, not to mention that any suspicious activity raises the alarm level. There are deep and diverse mechanics at play and you’ll “dance” unnoticed around or divert/kite guards, bypass electronic security measures or even use lethal tactics if necessary. You’ll want to be constantly analysing your surroundings and planning how to move, taking care to notice guards’ movements. You can and will be knocking guards unconscious to make progress, though they wake up (more alert) after a few turns if no agent is pinning them to the ground. You only have 2-4 agents, usually, so you can’t KO every guard, but you can grab and move them out of sight. Other than your agents you have your AI available to you, which uses power you drain from on-site consoles to execute programs in order to break firewalls on other devices such as cameras, security gates, turrets, safes, mainframes, that will allow you to access them. Power is a limited resource, however, so you’ll need to plan its use carefully as well. Also, each 5 turns the alarm level goes higher introducing some new measure of security: a new guard may spawn, firewalls on enemy devices may increase, previously disabled devices can be rebooted, and even daemons (enemy software) may be implemented. Whatever way you look at it, it’s a race against time, and either rushing or extending your stay to explore more will make it much more likely to be detected, and a full alert will make it virtually impossible for you to exfiltrate your agents alive, let alone complete your objectives.All this makes for a tense, suspenseful and exciting strategic turn-by-turn gameplay. Will you risk overstaying your welcome to fully explore your surroundings, possibly getting more of that precious loot? It’s always on your mind, since it is badly needed as any credits, items, software, gear or augments you find, will allow you enchance your agents’ capabilities. Also, you can level up your agents’ attributes with credits.It can be said that the locations start to feel a bit samey after a while, but in regards to gameplay the procedural generation is spot on: I could never rely on any previous map knowledge, I always had to assess the situation I was currently in. And never did I encounter a situation where the level was unbeatable due to bad placement or impossible patrol routes. It’s always of question of not getting yourself into too difficult missions if you are not ready (with better gear or software, leveled-up agents, etc), and analysing and your current situation, determining how to best to move and engage to accomplish your objectives.The game is very challenging, but you can tailor the difficulty with the different difficulty levels, in particular with regards to the number of “rewinds” to the previous turn you have. I found that experience, most of all, made me improve my skill from mission to mission and run to run, making for a high skill ceiling and an engaging and deep game to try and master. The presentation is unique and striking, both visually and in the writing, with spot-on hi-tech secret agent jargon. The soundtrack is excellent, featuring suspenseful music that actually “evolves” as the alarm level goes up, building a crescendo in tension and excitement as you play. All of it is just so engaging I found myself losing track of time as I played.My only regret is that the main story isn’t a bit lengthier, although the Contingency Plan DLC addressed this, essentially doubling the campaign length.

 One of the best strategy games I've ever played First and foremost; fantastic art style. As soon as I begun playing, I fell in love with it. Not especially unique, somewhat similar to Boarderlands (in my opinion), but very enjoyable and suits the game's dystopian theme down to a tee. The versatile 'customisable difficulty' mechanics are superb, allowing the game to be as challenging or not as you want. A casual experience for those who want it, but it can be brain-crushingly hard as well. The campaigns are short (unless you play endless mode), but have a lot of replay value; as someone who likes a challenge (playing with no mission restarts) I've yet to 'beat' the game, but it's not at all upsetting or frustrating. The game itself plays a lot like the board game (or video game equivalent) Space Hulk; turn-based with grid-based movement. In game, every decision, move and action counts, something which is handled very well. The money, resource, upgrade and item systems are all very well balanced (assuming you have conventional settings). All of which accumulates into a very well designed, stimulating and challenging game. It's a very gameplay based experience, so the lack of story, exposition and character development shouldn't be a bother (and if it is, you're looking in the wrong place).Conclusively, this game is some of the best value for money on the market, I would happily pay more than £15 pounds for it. (19/20)			"

Product received for free
												It is one of the best stealth games so far, I got the Contingency plan DLC as well so both are so worth the price. It feels like an xcom 2 base game but obviously not the same because of the gameplay, you play as the agents from invisible inc. completing your objectives and rebuild your lost HQ that somehow they got compromise. The cut scenes of the choice of art style I really like, I just wish they add more cut scenes instead of only two and more like Mark of the Ninja that has several shorter cut scenes. I want to have a small connection to my agents and the head leader, maybe the villains I want to hear their objective in these whole missions we were task on. Yes there is some brief history each of the agents including the leader, but what I meant was having an interaction between my agents as they are doing their brief missions. (After they finish talking to the main objective)Each mission is important depending on the resource you need and depending on the objective the level will be increasingly harder as you progress into complex buildings. You have an alarm meter that fills the alarm bar each turn and each level of alarm will get the level harder which adds more tension to the game and leaves you an adrenaline feeling when you're trying to complete your objective and will say to yourself of ""oh shoot I got to get out of here, level 3 has been activate too many guards.""It leaves you the same excited feeling when xcom did this and invisible inc. nail it right out of the park for the creation of stress (in a good way) of either gambling to stay and get more loot or leave as soon as possible, not to mention the soundtrack they have is suburb when guards spotted you or when you just got to get the hell out, each action counts. You can't kill guards unless you have lethal weapons but if you do kill them the alarm level will be increase by two so watch out if you do. Is all about stealth and is better to not stun them then stun because that means you have to watch over the body so that he won't wake up and start searching for you.There's your companion AI Incognita which she is a huge life savior at times through hacking, distractions, all kinds of cool gadgets but each skills require power which you need to hack into terminals in order to get more power for use of Incognita. Each agents has its special abilities and I feel frustrated that you can only carry 2 agents at the start but later when you do rescue hostage you can get additional agents, although the only negative thing about the hostage rescue mission is that you can't get their ""unique"" gear that he/she is special of using it, so you are stuck with a basic ""normal"" agent until you buy their gears back from shops that you can hack in buildings from your objective.The game is short roughly around 6 hrs to complete but the modes is what kept the 20 hrs as of this review going because it adds more challenge into the game and having good replay values. The ending is a brain scratch for me and is obviously building up a sequel or hopefully an expansion pack which in my opinion I don't ""mind"" much because I sort a want to expand the game more to have all new challenges to play.CONCLUSSIONDon't let my mix expression toward the ending stops you from buying this game, this game is mostly for gameplay value and it is excellent, the story yes could use some more in depth storytelling to really earn an upcoming sequel pack, but the extra modes to fill in the extra hrs is still worth the price to buy. 8/10			"

												Warning: boring, sentimental stuff.. jump right on to the end for a more objective evaluationOkay. This is extremely hard for me. I've been around for quite some time in the gaming field. To give you a clue, I would say the first ever game I played must have been the C64 ski. There and than I got hooked on gaming and never ever quit since. Throughout the years I met ups and downs, one-time hits, instant classics, hidden gems and terrible disappointments. As my taste in playing was forged it hit me that the deepest extent that I can get absorbed by a game always occured in turn-based strategies. I grew to love the genre, where you're lost in your own endless and twisted plottings, where nothing can hurry you and where it does not matter, if you take hours to finally give command and hit the ""end turn"" button. Oh and it practically doesn't raise your attention to the fact that you got aaaaancient next to younger players of today :D  As a graphic artist I used to adore certain graphic styles I have met during the years and started to collect my ideas of a turn based strategy game of my own, that would include all the neat stuff that makes a great, instant classic of the genre - graphic and gameplay wide. And there - with all the experience I gathered, all the stories I lived through, I dare say a veteran player of turn based strategies - in 2015 I meet Invisible Inc. And it blows me away. Just when I thought that there is no hope for any of the game aspects that made up the good-ol-turn-based-fun to return, the masterminds at Klei come forward with the title, that puts together everything I ever dreamed of having in a game  of this sort- and that I hoped to incorporate in my own game in the future. The individual characters with their own set appearances and stories, the nail-biting stealth action, the endless possibilities to still try and save the situation that already seems hopeless and the thrill to push ever forward, they're just all there with the most butiful artististic appearance I could have wished for. My dreamgame came true. When I said this is hard for me, I meant writing a review of my favorite_game_ever. I really have took my time before deciding on this :DSo what exactly do we have here?This game is hard and unforgiving. No, not the hard you think now, harder! It gives you a pretty decent challenge and beeing rough-like that can be a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for some people. Keep that in mind.The game guides you through a main story - with that being linear - but you have several decisions to make while you get there.The arsenal of awesome unlockable characters is great, with them all being different in some ways, but later on you may also get new abilities and thus further develop the way you wish - or can that is.I love the aspect of hacking with Incognita, this gives a whole new level for the action in the game.The more time you spend on a level, the harder it will get for you to escape eventually. But wouldn't you just want to discover and loot everything you can? What I disliked? Maybe one thing. But that's not an aspect to ruin the overall experience of it all and I'm not gonna tell here, you'll know what I mean. I highly recommend playing through with the Contingency Plan, which doesn't dully add more missions, instead it builds into and extends the main story with countless exciting extras.I would say even the full price is absolutely worth your money, but now you can get an exceptionally neat discount during sales. You can expect a total of around 70 hours of gameplay and replay value at its best.Best game ever. Go for it.			"

rating: worth buying at sale price (<10€)score: 7.5/10 - goodsimilar games: Xcom, Mark of the Ninjatags: stealth, turn-based, replayability, unique artstyleThere is not much I can criticize about this game, there wasn't just enough to give it a higher score. I usually like games which focus completely on a few mechanics, but obviously that only works if those mechanics bring a lot of depth. Invisible Inc. has depth, but it doesn't take long to understand every mechanic of the game and learn how to play the best. Because of that the only thing which kept me motivated was the unlocks. I started my first playthrough on easy and beat it in my first try, then started my second playthrough on hard (or whatever the second difficulty level is called) and beat that also in my first try. Then I already unlocked every agent and I guess almost all programs, but there are still alternate loadouts I can unlock I think. My third playthrough I played on extreme difficulty and here I failed like 2-3 times now and the game had some frustrating moments. It also has some really nice ""Aha!"" moments when you manage to complete the mission with all your agents while getting surrounded by multiple agents and cameras and drones reactivating.I like that the game does not have anything with chances. When you attack an enemy, your attack will hit 100% of the time, if the enemy attacks, he will hit 100% of the time. That is very important for a stealth game, because the moment you get spotted it gets hard. What I like is that its not completely over when you get spotted, if you have a good position. Instead of alarming every guard in the building of your presence the game just increases the alarm level by 1 and you still have that one guard watching you. The thing is that there aren`t that many decisions you have to do as the player. When you get spotted there will probably one or maybe 2 spots where you could evade to and the choice is obvious most of the time. The way you move through the levels, engage guards, hack mainframe devices is the same most of the time. That is why there is not much depth in this game.What is fun is the resource management though. Deciding on what you want to spend your money on is crucial, you could spend it on gadgets, leveling your agents or on programs. All of these options make sense and some things have nice synergies or you can compensate with some things for the lack of others.If you expect a story or something then you should know that there isn't a story in this game, just a premise which sets up the game and explains your situation and the systems behind the game. You will have to dig really hard to find something which tells you about the world or characters and most of it is just flavour text of agent descriptions or items.Also I don't understand what the point of the ending is. If this was a traditional game with a start and a finish (without the rogue-lite elements) then I would understand why you could have an ending like this. But for a game like this, which is designed for multiple playthroughs, the ending doesn't make any sense and conflicts with the design of the game itself and I really hate that.The artstyle and character design is really beautiful and unique like in most Klei games. The voice acting is good enough and the music is nice and fits the game. The framerate is weird sometimes, but that isn't a problem, because this is a turn-based game. If you can get this game for less than 10€ you won't regret the purchase, for higher than that it might still be worth it, but I can't guarantee it.			"

												Invisible Inc. is billed as ""stealth X-COM,"" which isn't entirely off the mark if X-COM had two types of enemies, every mission lasted five minutes and you lacked the time to get attached to your team. The randomly generated levels feel dull and same-ish within about three(and several types of mission WILL require you to break stealth and start tazing or killing people, not counting the times where the randomly generated levels force it aside from that), you'll never really need any weapons or gadgets aside from one EMP thingummy, some tazers and a single armor-piercing weapon for the occasional heavy guard. I usually forgot I even had the rest.There's also some twelve agents but they're not really particularly different, aside from Banks and Internationale, both of which are great for having a far less annoying playing experience. Start with any other team if you hate yourself.Some people praise the shortness, but to me the shortness just made me lack any sort of investment in what I was doing. It was all going out the window by two missions down the road, anyway, and the game lacks the variety in either player   options or challenges that'd make it fun to replay more than once.The intro does look gorgeous, though. Bit of a shame that everything in the actual game is so zoomed-out that you never really get to enjoy the art style again.Buy Invisible Inc. if you feel like watching a trailer for a better game that they chose not to make and enjoy repetitive exercises without variation.Don't buy Invisible Inc. if you like varied challenges or interesting challenges.

In a nutshell that's what it felt like the first hour and a half.  And randomized levels? Nice.If you want to be sneaky, do some hacking and whatever else this game offers (which I look forward to).. see if you're up for the challenge. I dare you. You will be tested.			"

Early Access Review
								My personal game of the year. Played the alpha...liked it, played a little after each update, but there wasn't enough content to keep playing. Now I'm playing the beta and I can't stop. The game is so addictive, each run is different, there's already a lot of ways to build your run (since it's kind of a rougelike game) and the gameplay in itself feels deeply rewarding. Making it out of a building on alarm level 6 with loads of guards chasing you with all agents alive makes you feel like the ultimate tactical badass...As for the game being early access: Since Invisible Inc. hit beta it feels like a finished game. There's of course the odd bug or two, but other than that the only thing that's missing is more content. And that's coming through updates every two weeks.If you already played another game from Klei - this one's as great as Mark of the Ninja and Don't Stave.If you didn't: Buy this game, then buy Mark of the Ninja and Don't starve.

								It's fun but it gets insanely hard, very quickly.Most rogue-likes give you half a chance, and after about the 4th mission in during the story mode all bets are off because the alarm level steadily ticks up even if you havnt been seen or noticed, tons of guards swarm in which get faster, stronger and more aggressive.I would like to see a buff to the knockout duration or at least a chance to kill guards when they are down if you dont have a weapon. 2 turns is really not long enough before they wake up and run like wild animals around the map, paralysing injections are far too sparse and the need to keep one of your agents holding down a guard is far too crippling, slowing you down encredibly.Yeah it's a solid game but I hope it gets much needed balancing in the future to make runs last longer than 30 minutes - 1 hour.

								Invisible, Inc. is both frustrating and a ton of fun. First, you have to accept that you will die, and you will fail. Like many rogue-like games, it rewards multiple playthroughs and doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the situations you are put in. You will be outnumbered, you will make mistakes and you will accidentally walk into a group of guards with no way out.What you will also do is learn. You will learn when to be cautious and when to run like a maniac. You will learn when to take a guard down and when to sneak by quietly. You will balance the rewards of exploring the whole level versus the lives of your agents. The game is well developed for an early access title and Klei once again doesn't disapoint. Graphics are sharp, mechanics work well and the interface is easy to use and intuitive. Updates are made regularly and the developer does an excellent job of keeping the community in the loop the way an early access title is supposed to be.If you like turn based strategy, stealth with a more realistic approach and a challenging game, definitely pick this up.

												Game is unbelievably tight. Almost too much so. I don't think I've ever played a turn-based strategy game that comes this close to being an outright puzzle, and is well-balanced enough to get away with it. I think it might be more likeable if it were more generous, honestly, but it's really really well done as is.			"

												I've gotten this game on early access and having spent some time on it, I must say, I recommend it to anyone who would be even remotely interested in what the game has to offer: turn based stealth mechanics (as odd at it may sound - trust me, it works), squad management, with a dash of roguelike gameplay.Klei, the studio responsible for Invisible Inc. has a pretty good track record of delivering games that are well thought out,  charming, genuinely fun and challenging. They may not be obvious blockbusters or cult classics, but the game's a gem nonethless.The game is challenging, but it also offers a load of options which allow tailoring it to your playstyle. You can make it as easy or hard as you want it, it's also possible to entirely switch off some of the features.The game gives you control over a clandestine organization tasked with infiltrating corporate facilities. First you select a team of two agents (each with unique skills and equipment) and a set of hacking programs to help you bypass security (cameras, locks, robots). After that, it's your job to intelligently select your assignments to gather enough resources to keep your operation afloat. The game is essentially a stealth game, so it pays to avoid direct confrontation, sneaking past security guards and resorting to non-lethal takedowns when it's unavoidable. That's not to say it's not possible to go in guns blazing; however, you will find this option to be quite hard... on your finances. The cleanup costs get pretty nasty.The game has two modes - story and endless, the first one gives you a certain narrative framework and 24 hours of in-game time to prepare for the big mission. On endless, you just keep playing until you feel that you're done.It's worth mentioning that the game is essentially a roguelike - each level and each playthrough is randomly generated.While this can produce extreme arrangements that are either very difficult or near impossible to beat, learning through failure is part of the game's enjoyment, and it's worth noting that the easier difficulty levels give you the limited ability to rewind your turns (or even regenerate the entire level) to ease the learning process.Still, even if you fail, the game rewards you with experience which is used to unlock new agents and programs. Perhaps the new ones will better suit your style?All in all, I'd recommend Invisible Inc. to any fan of the turn based genre with a touch of squad management seeking to scratch that itch.			"

Early Access Review
								A randomly-generated turn-based stealth game is exactly what the world needed.Unfortunately, the randomness here is off. In Spelunky, every random thing you run into makes the game more fun, even if it kills you. In this game, it's just a coin flip, with some outcomes good (pick up a new agent, get a useful augment) and most bad (pick up a bearded dude, get a useless augment).And in Spelunky (which yes, I mean to suggest is an excellent game), you can choose to play it safe, avoiding much of the randomness if that's your style. The same is true in this game in a sense: within a mission, you can always leave early, taking the exit elevator as soon as you can reach it. However, the kind of randomness I have a beef with is unavoidable -- you typically have little choice but to take a mission with a coin flip at the center (a detention center or cybernetics lab).  Even the other mission types are pretty lame, for example requiring a wad of cash (server farm, nanofab), I think they should just take out the bad outcomes (useless agents, permanently grafted augments) as well as the information about mission type. Let it just be described as industrial (which will prove to be cybernetic, server, nanofabs or a combination) or a bunker (containing either data on other locations or money) or something else that entails learning about the nature of the facility only by exploring it. Picking up agents should be incidental to the missions you choose: some might be mercs or prisoners found on missions; some might approach you in the strategy layer; and some might pop up as special limited-time rescue missions from MONST3R (your fence in the game). Anyway, the tactical game is very fun even if the strategy layer isn't, so I'd recommend it.			"

After finishing story mode, and turn dead after 5 days in endless mode for a countless time, i have to say - this game will be one of the best games on steam. Its not easy even on easy difficulty. And if Klei will add a lot of other stuff, as weapons, hacking devices, characters, perks, etc. it can be balanced on a really high level. I really really recommend this game, cos it has great gameplay, beautiful soundtrack, and you will spend a lots of hours playing it, even after your agents die - just, again and again and again.

												I grew up playing the original X-COM games (yes, even Interceptor) and other turn-based strategy titles such as Odium and the Heroes of Might and Magic series, and I've always had a soft spot for the genre. I picked up Invisible, Inc. due to the genre and the merits of Klei's last game Mark of the Ninja. Several sleepless nights later I can tell you that this game is fantastic. The world and art style is great, the mechanics engaging, and the replayability factor is very high. The higher difficulty levels of the game will really make you think about each turn, future turns, and how to spend resources upgrading your team between fights.If I had to nitpick, I would say the one shortcoming of the game is the length of the main campaign. It can easily be completed in one sitting on the easiest difficulty, although the game is designed for multiple replays which in turn unlock additional characters for use in future playthroughs. The story and voice acting are really well done and I wish I could have experienced more. If you are a fan of roguelikes, turn-based, and/or cyberpunk games then this is one you'll definitely want to start playing immediately. 9/10			"

Klei has again proven that they can be trusted in dealing with early access.The game itself is quite hard, with many people failing even the first mission. Combination of the difficulty and the severity of mistakes really captures the feeling of a heist, to sacrifice an agent to save the team or to try breaking into the vault after being caught. I highly reccomend the game even with the reduced content and wait with bated breath for the full release. Good job klei			"

								In game tells you the rough idea of when the next build will be, which is great for a early access game. I personally love the game, it's fun sneaking around and complaining about mistakes I make that led to me killing everyone on the floor. Of course you shouldn't, since this is a stealth game. Always good to know when you make a mistake later on you can just slay everyone.Of course the game will be hard at first, but after you get used to it it's enjoyable. Standing right next to a guard as you steal from him and watch him walk away. This game won't get repeatitive compared to other stealth games because it's randomly generated levels. Of course there's that chance you get a level you can't sneak past, but that's why we get guns and stuns. Thus far most levels I have been able to sneak past, I can only recall three levels I had to murder the whole floor to search it. And that's after 60 hours of gameplay.In conclusion, if you like stealth and rogue, good idea to consider this game, not expensive either. And after that wonderful early access for Don't starve, I do believe we can trust these guys to handle this one as well. This game is pretty much done honestly in my opinion. I've yet to run into any major issues or bugs, and the one time I have few hours later there's a hotfix for it.			"

Early Access Review
								WHERE HAS THIS GAME BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?I was hooked on this game from the first ten minutes of playing. The gameplay is intense, it leaves you thinking of up to three or more future moves. The multitude of equipment and augmentation gives this game a great feel and want to repeat the game all over again. It is an almost unforgiving strategy game and it gives a thrill that many games just don't.The maps are randomly generated and give a feeling that although some rooms are almost similar, the placement of the rooms make this game endlessly playable.This is my only criticism and I am aware that improvement on storyline is planned but at the moment it is very bare. You aren't really motivated by any larger goal and you aren't sure what the agency really is at all.I would recommend this game to anyone and keenly look forward to further additions.20/10(Would rate higher if I could)			"

												I'm writing a review for this because I feel Invisible, Inc. is criminally underrated. It has a great amount of depth to it and requires more longterm strategy than any other rouge-like i've played.The game plays like a stealth orientated x-com, where instead of shooting the aliens, you're sneaking past and pick pocketing guards. Of course there is the option to knock out/kill the guards as well, but those options come with their own consequences.What I really love about this game is that every turn you play requires thought: deciding where you're going to end your turn to keep out of sight, deciding what order to hack the electronics, whether you want to knock that one guard out or wait a turn for him to walk past. As I mentioned before, there's also a lot of long term planning as well, specifically deciding how you're going to upgrade your operatives and the tools at your disposal. At the end of the day this is a really fun game and if the three words ""Stealth Strategy Rougelike"" appeal to you, than I couldn't recommend this game more.			"

								I haven't played through the game fully yet but can already see this challenging stealth game is going to keep me coming back for more.  Even knowing you have next to no chance of completing the level sometimes doesn't stop you from sneaking that one room further.  Great work from a development team that keep producing titles I'm enjoying.			"

												I love this game. Letting you choose a two-man team from an interesting and diverse group of characters goes a long way towards replayability, but also lets you build your own story. Who you choose to work with has a deep impact on your strategy for this iteration of the agency, which in turn shapes your game experience.My favourite kind of game is where the game creates a space for you to imagine your own stories playing out inside the overarching plot. On one of my last playthroughs of Invisible, Inc., one of my team members -- the one with the best weapon -- was surrounded and captured. I got the detention centre mission immediately afterwards, so rather than give up I sent my remaining agent back into the field to rescue her comrade. It was touch and go, but she effected the rescue, cementing their partnership. Your agents aren't just pawns, they're people whose stories you're creating.Also neat art style, music, appreciate the challenging strategy, support the good folks at Klei etc. etc. etc.Definitely recommend, must-buy if it's on sale.

								Invisible Inc. is pretty awesome turn-tactical spy game. After finishing story mode, and turn dead after 5 days in endless mode for a countless time, i have to say - this game will be one of the best games on steam. Its not easy even on easy difficulty. And if Klei will add a lot of other stuff, as weapons, hacking devices, characters, perks, etc. it can be balanced on a really high level. I really really recommend this game, cos it has great gameplay, beautiful soundtrack, and you will spend a lots of hours playing it, even after your agents die - just, again and again and again. GREAT JOB KLEI! - keep on with updates.			"

												I am very impressed with this game's challenging tactical stealth gameplay, stylish art, and charming voice acting! The short but replayable campaign, generated levels, and approach to failure as ""part of the game"" make this a great ""rogue-lite."" The high difficulty and possibility of ""unfair"" scenarios may turn away some players, but the challenge is quite rewarding for those with the patience to persist.			"

								A randomly-generated turn-based stealth game is exactly what the world needed.Unfortunately, the randomness here is off. In Spelunky, every random thing you run into makes the game more fun, even if it kills you. In this game, it's just a coin flip, with some outcomes good (pick up a new agent, get a useful augment) and most bad (pick up a bearded dude, get a useless augment).And in Spelunky (which yes, I mean to suggest is an excellent game), you can choose to play it safe, avoiding much of the randomness if that's your style. The same is true in this game in a sense: within a mission, you can always leave early, taking the exit elevator as soon as you can reach it. However, the kind of randomness I have a beef with is unavoidable -- you typically have little choice but to take a mission with a coin flip at the center (a detention center or cybernetics lab).  Even the other mission types are pretty lame, for example requiring a wad of cash (server farm, nanofab), I think they should just take out the bad outcomes (useless agents, permanently grafted augments) as well as the information about mission type. Let it just be described as industrial (which will prove to be cybernetic, server, nanofabs or a combination) or a bunker (containing either data on other locations or money) or something else that entails learning about the nature of the facility only by exploring it. Picking up agents should be incidental to the missions you choose: some might be mercs or prisoners found on missions; some might approach you in the strategy layer; and some might pop up as special limited-time rescue missions from MONST3R (your fence in the game). Anyway, the tactical game is very fun even if the strategy layer isn't, so I'd recommend it.			"

												When you have spent 300 hours on the Beta version you think there is nothing that can surprise you in a game any longer. ... But what a surprise !! Not only did the cut scenes and story were brilliant, but the game balance was completely changed (to the better) as well as new items and agents introduced.I already spent a lot of time on this game that was, to me, the best infiltration game since .. forever, but I think I am going to spend a lot more time on it to explore all the nice novelties it has yet to offer.Thank you for making this playing experience so nice.And if you are reading this in order to determine if it is worth its price well, I'll make it easy for you : Hel yeah.The main story is quickly done but the endless mode and different challenges will give you hours after hours of a nice intellignet infiltration game that will grow on you.

												I grew up playing the original X-COM games (yes, even Interceptor) and other turn-based strategy titles such as Odium and the Heroes of Might and Magic series, and I've always had a soft spot for the genre. I picked up Invisible, Inc. due to the genre and the merits of Klei's last game Mark of the Ninja. Several sleepless nights later I can tell you that this game is fantastic. The world and art style is great, the mechanics engaging, and the replayability factor is very high. The higher difficulty levels of the game will really make you think about each turn, future turns, and how to spend resources upgrading your team between fights.If I had to nitpick, I would say the one shortcoming of the game is the length of the main campaign. It can easily be completed in one sitting on the easiest difficulty, although the game is designed for multiple replays which in turn unlock additional characters for use in future playthroughs. The story and voice acting are really well done and I wish I could have experienced more. If you are a fan of roguelikes, turn-based, and/or cyberpunk games then this is one you'll definitely want to start playing immediately. 9/10			"

												The biggest problem I had with this game is the short time frame the main story mode campaign is based on. You have 72 hours to gather your forces and prepare yourself for the final showdown, and the very first mission you do takes 10-12 hours off that clock.While that doesn't exactly lend itself to in depth gameplay, allowing you time to figure out the game, that doesn't matter. Every time you fail, and your spy agency is destroyed, you gain experience. Enough experience, and it unlocks new Agents and Programs.What I found worked very well for learning the game though, is the Custom campaign mode. You can use it to configure just about every aspect of the missions, from the number of safes and consoles available to hack, to the number of guards on duty, and even what the alarm does. You can even set it to Endless mode, which takes away the three day time limit.I don't recommend sticking to Custom though. Changing all these options is great for learning how to play, but it does take away the actual storyline.As for the style of gameplay, it's like a cross between Evil Genius, and XCOM. Evil Genius in that you have the world map, and select your missions on there, and XCOM in that the missions themselves are turn-based and have the same top down view that XCOM has. Unlike XCOM though, you are not there to shoot stuff. In fact, if you have to shoot stuff, chances are you're losing. Killing, or even tasering, is an option of last resort. You really want to stealth it, sneak around behind the guards, picking their pockets as you go, but try not to kill them, and if you stun them, they wake up after a few rounds and go hunting for you. Not the most ideal situation to be in.All in all, a very fun game that offers something a little different.			"

												HOLY CRAP.......this game is awesome! I am one mission from the end and that last one persuaded me to leave a review. I knew I would like this game since I loved what Klei has done before with Don't Starve. This game is half like Klei's Don't Starve and half like XCOM. Both of those games I have sunk MAJOR hours into. Basically anything can happen...and you're punished for it just like Don't Starve. But you learn from it and it makes you want to keep trying (Till you become a PRO secret agent). There really is no checkpoint system unless you use ""rewinds"" to go back a turn...but even those are limited. But the game requires ALOT of strategy if you're trying to be stealthy. It is not an unforgiving Stealth game though...it gives room for some FUN if you need to blow up some robots / doors / or evil secret agents. Its amazing. Try it out if you liked Don't Starve or XCOM. The turn based strategy & the random FUN/anarchy the game offers is F'ing Brilliant.....buy it / try it!!!			"

												I love this game more than I have time to explain. In fairness, turn-based anything is my favourite game style, but this game  puts that formula to one of the best uses I've ever played.The game offers so many different way to feel an utter thrill. Getting through a level virtually undetected having raided almost everything there is to grab is a joy. Tripping alarms, creating a seemingly impossible situation and still getting all your agents out without missing an objective is pure refined joy. Never has a stealth game felt so satisfying.It's also one of the best randomly generated games I've encountered.  Invisible Inc. does a great job of using a library of fairly simple rooms and rules to create endless variety and only rarely creates a set of rooms which seem unfair or unwieldy. The rogue-like template for this game is perfect, tailoring the experience to regular restarts and false beginnings.There are a few gripes I have: there are some inconsistent rules. Sometimes a character can move diagonally for 1AP and sometimes it costs 2AP. I can't figure out why this is. Also (and I'm using the character with the Holo-camouflage) Prism sometimes gets unmasked when a guard walks past and other times not. One time she got revealed while standing in the stealth spot behind a door when the guard was in the doorway. Additionally, it's annoying that guards react to the presence of a downed agent every time they re-enter a room. Surely if a guard has seen a body already, it's no surprise the second time? It makes it hard to predict guard movement in rooms with a lot of bodies. A few more filters to view layout would be nice too, as sometime there are so many floating icons and bits of information it's hard to actually see the state of a tile or select it.Also, I was shocked that on the tutorial difficulty the end of the game can be reached and revealed so quickly. The game has a nice plot and it's a pity that the end is blown after a first 5-hour playthrough. Admittedly, the great value of this game is the endless replayability and ongoing challenge (I just skip the plot sections now) but I would have liked the big ending to be saved for the higher difficulties, or if there were different outcomes for different tiers.But those minor issues are almost nothing in comparison to the fun and endless free choice this game offers. No two playthroughs are the same, with reconfiguration of agents, items and cyberspace hacking tools. For reference my favourite combo is Dr Xu (file) with Prism (archive) with Dynamo and Parasite tools. Those are a great combination which stack abilities well together - I just have to remember not to be too blase with Prism's holodisguise.One of the best turn-based games ever made and one of the most satisfying stealth adventures, too.

												Invisible, Inc. is brutally fun. I had to take a break after the first mission because my blood was pumping so much from my narrow and daring escape against impossible odds.If you're even remotely interested in squad-based turn-based strategy games (X-com, Jagged Alliance, Silent Storm, etc.) then this should be an immediate buy.I have to say I wasn't convinced when I heard ""turn-based stealth game"", because I thought stealth could only work well in real time. Turns out I was wrong and this has immediately become one of my top 10 favorite games. One thing I particularly love is that there is almost always a way to overcome those mounting odds. This game's random number generation (RNG) seems a lot more fair than other Roguelites.Just don't go in expecting some sort of elaborate story campaign or you will be disappointed. If you've played FTL, Ziggurat or other Roguelites, then you should know what to expect storywise.Invisible, Inc. is about 10%  story, 50% style and 110% gameplay (deliberately doesn't add up, it's just so good).

												This is a great game that is just the right amount of difficulty. I bought it in alpha and have watched it grow. The finished game is very well polished and added in just enough story to keep things interesting without bogging down the game play. Speaking of game play, the game play is fantastic and engaging, the enemy AI is great. However as much as I said the story was good, the ending was lack luster unless they intend to create a sequel or some sort of dlc to continue the story as the ending is a bit of a cliffhanger and while it wraps up one story it starts another. Klei is a good studio though so I am sure that they will have something of the sort up their sleeve. 8/10 Very good, nice graphics, good story, engaging game play. It's a good game with lots of replay value.			"

												Unique tactical base game with an innovative system. Use any tactics you can think of as a spy Stun,hide,Distract etc.    Begin as a Rookies and End up to be a Super spy !.  Any mission you finished give you a Credit or item to customize you spy.     Even you have a super stronger Chuck norris as unit The Time is still your worst enemy !. You need to think and act fast !. The more turn you play The more strong enemy are.     The Hacking system in this game play a big part as a Spy !. You need To crack every damn computer or system to get your job done. ""Incognita"" our Hacker tools use a parallel turn of you to Crack,Slow,Hack etc to get the job done.    You will enjoy to be a spy. Try it ! if you like stealth genre. Try it ! if you like turn-base genre. Enjoy it if you like both !Pros+Many creative way to finish your mission+Nice visual and music+Challenge is brutal and satisfy+Fresh tactics gameplays with stealth styleCons-Many thing rely on luck such as your agent,shop,map etc-Content too short for a story mode-Repetitive map layout and mission because you always in the building most of the time			"

												Really fun game so far. Great visuals (similar style to Mark Of The Ninja) and sound effects. The gameplay mechanics are really interesting and unique.Missions are randomly generated and increase in difficulty the longer you spend in the building. You can complete side objectives to earn extra money but you risk stronger enemies appearing and harder security measures being activated.I really like the way enemies react when they spot you - you have to use your next turn move your agent behind cover to break line-of-sight or they'll fire. You can predict guards' movements and use that information to plan your attack (or evasion).You can also upgrade your agents and anti-security methods between missions. You can change the way agents are used by upgrading particular aspects over others (Do you want them to be speedy, or strong? Do you want them to be a good hacker, or better at stealing from enemy guards?).Definitely recommended! Very unique and fun!			"

												If you enjoy roguelikes, this game is one of the best designed and polished titles I've come across in the genre. It's incredibly tough and brutal, pulls no punches, and maps might not always seem fair. But everytime you pull off that challenging heist, when every little gear clicks in place in your grand plan, there's an incredible sense of accomplishment and the feeling that you've done something phenomenal. The triumph feeling which is commonly missing in games nowadays.			"

												If you're attracted by all the good things written about this title in the Positive section, you should read this review of mine. Why? Because I've read those positive reviews before making the purchase too and I'm very disappointed.Invisible, Inc. mixes oldschool stealth mechanics with innovative ideas. You move around sticking to the areas out of sight of the Corporations' security agents and robots and your goal is to hack or hijack as many of their installations as possible. There are multiple kinds of hackable objects and each of them gives you different rewards - from simple credits, through cutting off the power to electric blockades, to giving you access to bionic labs and shops of different sorts. It's during the missions that you will both earn and spend most of your credits. You can also use your cash to upgrade your spies' abilities and occasionaly buy something from Monst3r's black market. Hackable close-circuit cameras will help you uncover what are the badguys planning against you and what patrol routes are they on.Although the basic security will not give you much trouble, the elite patrolmen later on will really make you think twice before you decide to open fire or attack them with your power winches. They come equipped with a lot of gadgets that allow them to quickly track and take you down. Same goes for the robots that you're going to face. They are all hackable, but you won't be able to operate them for more that a couple of turns. While the easier difficulty levels allow you to experiment with different strategies (you can invest your money and bio-enhence your spies in 'heavy approach', stealth, more effective hacking and so on), the harder ones will leave you no choice but to go for speed and invisibility - the only way to beat the hardest levels. SInce the game is based upon replayablility (on this later on), it is a bad ballancing decision and probably a design flaw too. One of the mechanics that really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off is the need to open doors to peak into the corners of the rooms behind. Now, why on earth bionically enhenced futuristic spies are not equipped to deal with this issue is beyond me. Even modern portable optical-fibre cameras could do that. Invisible, Inc. spies can feel the virus programs and see electrical circuits through walls, yet they must open the door to see what is in the corner of the room behind them. I wouldn't even mind, if this mechanic would not be a gamebraker on the highest difficulty levels, where you cannot see danger zones if you don't see their sources. Often times you will start the level only to find yourself in an impossible situation and lose right away. And remember there is permadeath in this game. That is the price we pay for procedurally generated world + this one bizzare mechanic.The levels are generated rather nicely and once you lived through the first couple of turns, you'll most probably never find yourself in an impossible situation. There is always enough cover for the team and various objectives are usually guarded by the Corporations' security in a sensible way. Definitely extra points for that. The hacking UI itself is very clean and done with a lot of thought. It's fun to fight the enemy firewalls and it adds to the general feeling of the game - this aura of people being totally dependent on computer programs. It all does sound rather well, doesn't it? Well... here comes the reason why I cannot recommend the game. It's too expensive for what it has to offer. The main storyline takes 3-4 hours to finish and then the player is rewarded with new hacking programs and unlockable spies. Sounds great? Someone has already mentioned that the Invisible, Inc. is a mix of FTL with X-COM. The problem is, that FTL was fun every replayed time and X-COM had a nicely driven story line that kept player occupied and interested in upgrading the team. Invisible, Inc. is somewhere in between, with nice, but very short story and a couple of good mechanics, and replayability-based gameplay that isn't really all that fun to try again. After beating the game in different game modes and difficulty levels I found that 90% of unlockable stuff is useless and does not help you getting better scores. Finally I dropped the game entirely after maybe 7-8 hours of gameplay simply, because it was no longer fun to play it. During that time, I used found only one unlocked program and one unlocked character to be of any use for the team. The rest was just... bad. I see a lot of potential in this game, but cannot recommend it for more that $5 on a sale. It's not worth the price its tagged with. If only the devs would have taken more time to create a longer story mode and ballanced the game to allow for different playstyles it could have been fantastic. Unfortunately, in its current stage (and it is not an early access title) this game offers somewhat frustrating gameplay experience, inconsistent universum and not a very entertaing replay-grinding. It's not enough for me to recommend it. I hope you found this review informative enough. I don't often write reviews here, but when I do, I'm doing my best to help you guys make an good decision for yourselves ;-)			"

Fair price-point at 20 bucks...--------------------------------------------------------------------After re-visiting this after a year (finally bought the dlc which is well worth the cost at full price), I can honestly say it has some great features added for replayability). Procedurally generated maps, new game modes, agents to unlock, high scores to beat, pretty good story and great art and music to boot. It's really a great strategy game in a sea of 20.00 games that don't aren't nearly as fun. This is a well designed game and I've become a huge fan of Klei the last several years.			"

												Just played it at beginner difficulty that doesn't show all the gameplay, and because of variations I only saw a part of what's really the game. On that base, I enjoyed it a lot, it's a big surprise particularly because I'm not used to be very fan of stealth games, but that one is great. It's like it setup a new game genre, the gameplay is just great and quite original.Be warned that one play is rather short and it's a pure Roguelike approach more centered on replay and try new teams, new characters enhancement or items, and experiment higher difficulty level. Don't let that stop you it's a great game, even rather amazing of originality and very fun. Take care that eventually beginner difficulty which is the default will be too easy for your taste, so remind consider at what difficulty level you want play it.			"

												Disclosure: X-COM, which this game draws inspiration from, is one of my all time favorites, as is Klei's Mark of the Ninja. As a team, Klei Entertainment has made indies that are are both innovative and fun, and I respect that. However, I really wish this game could have been better...My actual rating is: Mixed, but in absence of that option, it leans towards negativeInvisible Inc is a gameplay mechanic driven roguelike that holds a huge amount of promise, if only the game didn't feel like it was made entirely by the gameplay mechanics and graphics teams, two areas where the game shines. This is a game that was designed to be replayed a lot, and to remain challenging each time. Unfortunately, the weak story deprives the player of a lot of motivation to invest in that content. Let me elaborate:The Pledge: A stealth driven random generated roguelike where confronting guards heads on is infeasible, the objective is to build the best team you can in 72 hours, like FTL. Excellent cutscene introduction sets expectations high for great visuals and great plot points. This game had one of the very best Pledges, setting my expectations really high given the slick execution of the first two hoursThe Turn: Tense game of Cat and Mouse, with each action decidedly a calculated risk and the ever increasing security timer forcing an aggressive play style. Difficult to get new items, and soon PWR is a scarce resource to be rationed. New guard types (thankfully no dogs), viruses, and new goodies to buy keep moderately interested but lack of any story content during missions / barely any between missions is a gigantically big missed opportunity. Feels more like an elaborate puzzle than an actual strategy game due to the limited patrol areas of guards, and the extremely strange rule of sitting on top of guards as the only way to prevent them from waking up, while taking them out comes with strong penalties. Strategic decisions are related to which missions to pursue (each provides different boosts dependent on the type of mission), and where to invest your limited cash reserves (augmentations / gadgets / skill upgrades).The Prestige: Where it all falls apart, only one ending, though the level map and specific enemies & locations are randomized. Due to a lack of context due to a dearth of story content, the ending feels both abrupt and all too sudden, with no fair visibility given on what will happen next in the series (beyond the very obvious). This was the point where I started questioning my purchase.The Aftermath: Where the bulk of content is held, new agents, alternate agents (different abilities), and new abilties for your AI. Unfortunately, due to a lack of new story it came across as less appealing than it probably is, and I doubt I'll be investing a lot of time in it in the future. For specific demographics:Price sensitive: If you enjoy the Aftermath, it's worth the price, otherwise you're out of luckGenre sensitive: Lots of throwaway cyberpunk joy, but never synthesized in any way that makes sense. Tons of tidbits but no overarching narrative that puts the pieces into context, major letdownStrategy gamers: Frankly the game feels a lot like a puzzle but does have meaningful strategic choices, so it's worthwhileDiversity seekers: Good premise, decent gameplay, fair variety in Aftermath. If you don't mind a weak story, go for itThose with older systems: Game worked and ran beautifully and smoothly on my humble laptop, should run well anywhereArt lovers: This, like Transistor, is a treat to the eyesFinal verdict: Great potential, if only it had invested more in story, this version feels incomplete. If you like mechanic driven games or particularly Turn Based games, go for it, it's a great product. For others, check out videos first and then take a call.

												Just finished my first play through on easy, firstly this game is not Xcom as some have suggested. Being an Xcom addict it shares a few minor similarities, but nothing that a hard core Xcom player would immediately make them love this. So the reason I would recommend, re-playability and the opportunity to unlock more options/characters with each play through. It’s a quick jump in and out chess style turn based stealth/small team tactical game.I would also suggest those who enjoy and deep and long drawn out story may be disappointed, story development wise it’s quick and enjoyable but not something you would rave about. Once you've played once you would only play again just to see what the different combination of characters/equipment and programs would do, but that would keep you going for a fair while longer.			"

												If you're like me and you enjoyed METAL GEAR AC!D when it first came out on the PSP, then you'll love Invisible Inc. Sure, there are no card decks here, but the turn based stealth strategy core mechanics are there. The difficulty level can be customized to your tastes, but even on the easiest setting, it can be very challenging and fun.The levels are procedurally generated giving it a huge replay value. The game contains RogueLike elements to it, so do not get disencouraged if you fail a few times, you get valuable exp that unlocks more characters and items, that will make your next walkthroughs a bit easier. The music is outstanding and it really makes the tactical espionage theme of the game shine. The whole graphics style is also really cool on a futuristic corporate world.8/10			"

I tend to look down most of the time when moving or checking player stats.Very short story - for me this is bad although not the selling point (great stories = great content = great value to money = incredible replayability!)I'd rate this a 4/5Verdict:Go buy it - if you like xcom, jagged alliance or any tactical turn based strategy gameDon't buy it - if you get easily bored.

												I am going to be honest when I first saw the game I didn't know if I was going to like it or not, I don't usually like turn based games so I was going out on a limb when i bought it. Now this game is one of my favorites to play when I want to pass time It is creative well balanced and it is just fun to play. If you are on the edge of buying this game just for the pure fact that it is a turned based game go for it buy it, it is a great game! The dynamics are put together well and it is challenging but not over challenging where it feels immpossible to beat the levels. The rooms are randomly generated so it forces you to get good at the game and not just the levels. There are many different modes for the campagin, altough it is farly short you can start in endless mode and that is always fun :D.			"

												There has been several changes from its beta design but the release version seems to work quite well. The good news, its fast paced and encourages the players to move fast and plan for a quick insertion and departure. The opposing force can be tricky and depending on the difficulty level, overwhelming. Settings can be customized to remove detection cones, increase play time, increase guards, etc. Time is of the essence so sometimes its better to grab as much cash as possible and bug out even if the objective isn't finished. The bad news is that I had expected something story driven like Mark of the Ninja. This is more like a tactical game like Masters of Orion. That's not a bad thing, just wasn't what I expected. There are other modes and if you want a rogue like game with endless levels they do provide that. There is a respectable difference between beginner and experienced. Beginner shows you the ropes while being engaging as you learn the basics. Experienced builds upon beginner in that you need to pay attention to what corporation defenses are present on a mission. It makes a difference whether you can expect drone armies, automated turrets or armored guards. For new players I'd recommend saving some money for speed and anarchy.			"

												Wow... I didn't think I was going to beat this mission. Barely recovered another MIA agent.. Was only able to hack the turret providing overwatch to the entry to the interrogation room, to neutralize the lethal threat, before moving in. Had to leave surveillance cameras active in order to have the remaining power to break open holding cells. Brought maximum security alert up pretty quick.Through a combination of using the turret (until it ran out of ammo), hiding under cover, intentionally catching the attention of the cameras for distraction, and carefully placing an unconscious guard as a lure, we managed to get out of a cornered situation in the interrogation room and evade the elite guards and heavy security closing in on us. After 10+ terrifying turns at maximum alert, we reached the exit. It helped that I left 1 agent out in the other rooms to act as eyes and a decoy while the other 2 broke into the interrogation room.There were a couple really close calls too with agents tossing what few stun weapons we had between each other when we were almost overrun. Only one of our weapons was able to penetrate light armor, and nothing we had could have dealt with the heavy security. Cleanup cost us a bit with 2 destroyed turrets and 4 dead security guards, but got the whole team out alive. Only missed one safe. Made me feel like a total badass when I had all 4 agents assembled in the escape room.But never again do I want to put my team in that situation.I had to think about it beforehand, knowing through early scouting that I'd have to trigger high security to make it into that room. I seriously considered aborting the mission for the first time. Figured rescuing an agent outweighed the risk.AND there were 2 surprises (stationary guards in highly inconvenient places) that I could have only known about after committing to infiltration. Did I mention I took a huge risk...? 3 surprises, actually, if you count not knowing who I was breaking out of there until we made it to the holding cells.Turned out the captive was Central's bodyguard/head of security, so it really helped that she knew hand-to-hand combat during one of those close calls. If it had been some kid the corp picked up off the street for ticking them off (which has happened), he would have been enough baggage to be left behind or even lose two of my agents.Still coming down off the adrenaline 25 minutes later.Do I recommend this game? Hell to the mother f***ing yes, I do.			"

												Invisible, Inc is awesome.A turn based stealthy dungeon crawler where you will pick a team of agents to infiltrate locations and snatch some goods on your way. But watch out, defence system will improve as you progress inside each location and spend more time exploring. And you have a limited amount of time before the final mission arrives and you have your final level (optional end to the game, as you can also chose to just infiltrate again and again and again these random generated dungeons).Graphisms and animations are really nice and comic books fun.Voices and  sound are really well done and help a lot to immerse your self in this spy game.It has the flavor of boardgames like Heroquest or Space Hulk, but the AI is cleverer and more diverse.Addictive enough that you will get back to it, even after ""finishing"" it. Yet, you can pause and quit whenever you need to get back to work... I meant real life. :)			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game without knowing too much about it based on how much I loved Mark of the Ninja from Klei. After playing regularly for about a week, I know I'm going to sink dozens of hours into this game. Prior to playing this I had invested quite a bit of time in XCOM Enemy Unknown and this game reminds me a lot of XCOM from the isometric perspective to the idea of leveling your squad and purchasing them upgrades and weapons.I highly recommend this game, even in its Early Access form. It has some minor bugs but nothing that prevents enjoying the game. I'd continue to play this game even if it never improved from its current form. But knowing Klei, I have no doubt it will continue to become more polished and enjoyable.			"

								I've become quite addicted to this game in a short period of time and am eager to see what comes next for this game.FYI the Story Mode is quite short (3-4 Days of Missions and then a Codename Mission). It really lives up to its homepage claim of a TBS stealth-em-up that gets you thinking ahead. Getting spotted by enemies can be so easily done and drastically counter productive to the mission that you have to put a lot of effort in to not getting caught.They also cater for your missions with an array of nifty gadgets and weapons so that the ways of infiltration never end up being just a linear game of Grandmother's footsteps.If there was any complaint it would be that while I play Endless Mode setpieces tend to repeat themselves, and the missions do not vary enough for continual use. However I'm sure that this is something that will be addressed in the updates. Great game with a unique and inventive theme.			"

Early Access Review
								Invisible, Inc. is a challenging, turn based strategy game that has you move your agents through extensive randomised levels to get valuable money and resources off powerful corporations. Every level is guarded with guards and CCTV cameras, with an alarm level that increases over time to send in more units, activate more cameras and make hacking more expensive.I’ve had had a mostly positive experience with Invisible, Inc. However, it can be frustrating when you fail, as you have to start again. Invisible, Inc. has many unique features: hacking, strategic combat, stealth and looting.-Hacking                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A massive part of the game is hacking. You will need to hack a lot to progress through the game. Among the things you need to hack are: CCTV cameras, laser barriers drones/robots, Corporate safes, turrets and generators, executive control panels, console/camera databases and nano-fabricators (shops).These are the most important thing you have to hack but there are many more. To hack you will need Power (PWR). You will slowly get power through ‘Power drip’, a program provided to you by your agency. You can also get power by hacking console, which usually give you 2-3 PWR per console, but be careful, some consoles are monitored by security.-CombatTo take care of security guards, you will have a Neural Disrupter by default. The Neural Disrupter is a melee weapon to stun enemies for 2-3 turns. You can get upgraded versions from some nano-fabricators. Other weapons include pistols, dart guns and rifles. Killing guards with heart monitors will raise the alarm counter by 2 bars. An agent can go into melee reaction so if a guard goes past, the agent will knock them out and keep them pinned. Alternatively, your agent can go into overwatch, so if a guard/drone goes into it’s line of sight, He/she will shoot it. If your agent is firing bullets the guard will be killed. If they’re firing darts, he will be knocked out. Drones cannot be knocked out and are unaffected by darts/ Neural Disrupters, but some can be hacked.-StealthStealth is vital to the game. It is nearly impossible to go in guns blazing and succeed. You have to stay in cover to avoid the enemy’s line of sight, otherwise your agent will be shot. If your agent is shot, He/she will be critically wounded, however, the other agent can still get to the elevator to exit the level or revive the wounded agent with medi-gel. By default, Deckard will have a cloacking rig, enabling him to be invisible for a turn if he’s out of sight. An upgrade version can be bought from some nano-farbricators.-Alarm CounterThe alarm counter will increase over time but certain events such as a guars getting killed or a security-monitored console being accessed will increase it too. As the alarm counter rises, it will reach levels (1,2,3,4,5,6 etc..). At these levels, the mission will get harder as hacking will cost more PWR or more guard are called in.I highly recommend this game as it’s a lot of fun to play, But I suggest that you play the tutorial as it teaches you a lot and without it you’ll probably fail the first mission.

Yes, that is the name but you can stay hidden and still trigger the alarm. The only issue I have right now is sometimes the random maps just make it crazy difficult. I have to hack my way past three guard turrets and sneak past two stationary guards (who are both loking at the only two doors into the room) to get to the exit, nevermind getting to the goal.			"

												This is a Rogue Like Stealth Game: Meaning there are no saves and if you not have the tech or the buffs for the later stages you might as well quit.  The only thing you can do is reset the turn before.  This game is intense because you cannot fight head on the guards and even if you could it brings up a set of issues for each guard you take out.  Every fix turns the game adds an element on the map, more guards, hard to hack computers, or alert the remaining guard to your location.  I really enjoy this game it is very intense and the game play is very tight.  However, this game is very short, it gives you a lot of options for replay however the main reason I play was for a bit of a story and building my base back up.  I thought at a certain point you could rebuild your base.  (spoilers) (No you can't)  I am left with a bit of wanting more after I beat the game in experienced mode on my 4th run.  Because after my 3rd run, I knew what is useful and what is not and which missions to take.  Part of how hard this game is, is the learning curve and once you get pass that the levels do not get harder.  Besides the last mission.  I feel and suspect the designers knew their game is too short and wanted to make the last level as hard as possible.  And the last level puts up turn sinks where you have to waste turns on a spot.  Thus making the level harder, I think this is a cheap way to force the time spent on your game.  I would like a free DLC, maybe there will be one I haven't read the forums but this game leaves you hanging.  Anyways, 2 more days until Witcher 3.  This game was a nice distraction.			"

												Sneaking steadily into the future, Invisible Inc. is sure to please fans of both stealth and turn-based strategy. A steep learning curve can make it difficult to warm up to, but impressive depth, customizability, and replayability easily make it worth the time.The major highlight is the variety of abilities, both for your agents and hacking entity “Incognita”. They give the player a great degree of control and flexibility – essential for the high difficulty and occasionally unfair procedurally-generated maps. I also like the moody visual/audio presentation, which aptly depicts the oppressive corporate-dominated sci-fi world. I have an issue with the length, though. The last mission in particular feels less like a finale and more like a turning point, after which I was expecting the story to begin a new arc. But...then the credits started rolling. It's a shame, because the way the game is designed would have made it easy to write a longer, more thought-provoking story. Thankfully, the replay value of the 5-hour campaign is very high; it's fun to play around with different abilities and character builds. As it is, Invisible Inc. feels like second-tier turn-based strategy, behind XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Valkyria Chronicles. As a fan of stealth games, I love how unique it is, and how deep it can be at times, but I also feel that it could have been much better. No regrets picking it up, though.(Rating: 8/10 “Very Good”)			"

												When I got my newest PC and joined Steam as a serious PC gamer, Invisible Inc. was one of the first games I spotted and added to my wishlist. When I finally bought it, it was another month before I actually sat down to play it. Oh, the time I wasted before unearthing this Gem.I've always been a fan of a strategy games, both turned-based and real time. I've sunk many hours into Final Fantasy Tactics, Vandal Hearts, StarCraft, WarCraft, Commandos, XCOM, Shadow Run etc. etc. And as much as I love all of these titles and as similar and diverse as they are, Invisible Inc brings something to the table I have yet to experience in a strategy game and that's the Stealth. It's different from Commandos though in part because of the turn based play. But there's more to it than that.When I play Strategy games what it really comes down to is, ""How can I deal the most damage in the least amount of time?"" How do you take the most pieces of your opponents chess board? Sure, there is strategy to that and dependant on your skill or intellect you can look 1, 2, 5 turns ahead, but it's not usually a nessecity. I constantly found myself planning 3-5 moves ahead and considering multiple moves depending on the AI's choices.More than that, the levels often offer you extra incentives in the form of optional objectives. But you a finite amount of resources to be able to get these sometimes and a limited amount of time before the difficulty increases substantially. The twist is that in most cases you won't know if you have the resources or not until it's too late, but that's not a downside. When this happens you've either already attempted to go for the added objective and now have to decide on a hasty and dangerous retreat. Or try to pool more resources in an ever increasing hostile situation. In spite of deep and complicated a lot of these mechanics may seem, it's a very easy system to pick up and is pretty intuative.The trait of this game that really drew me in and was the main reason it caught my eye to begin with was the aethetics. The art design and direction of this game is unique and unlike any other game I can recall in recent memory, the closest being perhaps Sly Cooper. This is a sharp, well-design, beautiful ♥♥♥♥ing game.Buy it. Play it. Love it.If you're curious, I streamed my first 2-3 hours playing this blind and that can be found here, http://www.twitch.tv/finalencountercast/v/30115818 "

												Excellent game!Turn-based, tactical stealth game. If xcom was a roguelike. You have a squad of spies and go on missions to complete objectives. Your spies have special abilities, can be upgraded and can use a variety of items that you can find or buy. You also have a computer AI that you can use to hack cameras, terminals, robots etc.Pros- randomly generated level maps- actions are permanent, death is permanent- ironman mode by default (no save loading)- tactical to the max. There is no RNG in combat, attacks always hit. If you have a good plan it will work and you won't miss an attack. Equally if you put yourself in a bad position only tactics and abilities will get you out of it, guards won't miss their attack.Cons- short campaign. The intention of the game is that you play one playthrough in easy or normal to become good at it and then come back to play the campaign again in hard or with custom settings. I can see this working because of the randomly generated levels, am now playing on hard after beating the campaign on easy.- no multiplayer. It is inherently a single player game and I can't see how a good multiplayer mode could be added. Not really an issue for me but people seem to want multiplayer in everything.I am enjoying this game a lot.			"

Early Access Review
								Invisible Inc is a very polished game, more so in fact than many of the games that get released on steam without early access. It has a beautiful art style with audio lending a fitting ambience to your teams role as corporate infiltrators. Furthermore there are little to no noticable bugs in the current content, a notable achievement for an early access game. That does however bring us onto the point of content, of which there is remarkably little at the moment. Currently the game relies heavily on it's procedural generation to extend the gameplay experience with few options in terms of mission or agent variety available to the player. Furthermore one could argue the punishing difficulty the game demonstrates is based on the random element of the levels rather than any true difficulty with some missions being extra punishing due to at most 1 room in which 3 or more guards may have by chance built their route. I personally encountered a situation where an obbjective room was filled with 3 seemingly stationary guards which made it effectively impossible to access any of the items in the room forcing the mission to be scrubbed.   Furthermore noticable usability features such as a undo button remain absent from the game with  1 misclick representing the possible loss of an hours worth of missions. A lack of a between missions inventory screen or shop makes inventory management awkward and makes early missions excessively punishing as the game may make it impossible to effectively access a shop for several levels.  I'd say invisible inc represents one of the highest quality early access games available, it tempers the developers ambitions in the name of polish and stability while leaving room for those ambitions to be added later down the line when they can be added in such a way that maintains the high quality gaming experience. This is the level of product early access games on steam should be held too rather than the overly ambitious bug ridden messes that populate most of the category.			"

								True stealth games are hard to come by, most are faux sneakers and often enforce a shooter game play. Invisible Inc. is not one such game, it punishes violence. Not familiar with turn based games, the learning curve is fairly steep, but having an affinity for stealth gameplay helps in learning the game. The noir atmosphere and graphics are gorgeous and traditional stealth gameplay elements are adhered to strictly. There is no apparent story of import, but that doesn't bother me, however there are some flaws. Pop up features (peek/door) block other pop ups (# of turns) depending on camera angle. A limitation that is presumably found in turn based games is the need to change the camera angle often, and sometimes to no avail as the rooms are very difficult to see and observe where your character is. There is no restart button or in-game saves so you must fully commit to a mission until completed which is very difficult in these fog of war maps. Most of these flaws can be forgiven as it is an independent game with a small development team. Invisible Inc. is an ambitious, but flawed, early access sneaker that pushes new boundaries for the genre.			"

												Invisible Inc is a really well built game. Featuring a clean gameplay, art, animation, great color palette and isometric-style camera.From start to finish you're in for a good amount of stealth tactical combat on random-generated levels. Squad-building and spending strategies as main premises for success as well as an overhaul of options (on how hard you want the game to be) and few unlockables make this title have a good replay value. It's similar to original X-COM's concepts.			"

												I don't normally write reviews for early access games but in this case I will make an exception as, even in alpha, Invisible Inc is a blast to play. It is both one of the best roguelikes and best stealth games I have played.Invisible Inc is a procedurally generated, stealth-oriented, turn-based, science-fiction roguelike set in a world run by corporations. The player is tasked with leading a team of secret agents on a series of missions to steal and hack everything they can from the corporations. As each mission progresses it becomes more difficult, with additional security being added in the form of more cameras, more guards and better software firewalls. The player must make the choice of staying to get extra loot or leaving while it's still safe.Invisible Inc is an alpha in the purest sense; it is largely feature complete but missing a lot of content. While the mechanics of the game are mostly in place and polished to a fair degree, there is still a lot of content to come, like new agents, new corporations, more tech and more programs. Even so, what is currently in the game is very fun and certainly enough to keep you going for many hours.Buying games in early access is always a risk, but going on Klei Entertainment's previous track record this is much less of a risk than most. Klei are a company who have proven their ability to make quality games, with regular updates, and to ship on time, many times over.			"

Early Access Review
								Invisible, Inc. is a challenging, turn based strategy game that has you move your agents through extensive randomised levels to get valuable money and resources off powerful corporations. Every level is guarded with guards and CCTV cameras, with an alarm level that increases over time to send in more units, activate more cameras and make hacking more expensive.I’ve had had a mostly positive experience with Invisible, Inc. However, it can be frustrating when you fail, as you have to start again. Invisible, Inc. has many unique features: hacking, strategic combat, stealth and looting.-Hacking                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A massive part of the game is hacking. You will need to hack a lot to progress through the game. Among the things you need to hack are: CCTV cameras, laser barriers drones/robots, Corporate safes, turrets and generators, executive control panels, console/camera databases and nano-fabricators (shops).These are the most important thing you have to hack but there are many more. To hack you will need Power (PWR). You will slowly get power through ‘Power drip’, a program provided to you by your agency. You can also get power by hacking console, which usually give you 2-3 PWR per console, but be careful, some consoles are monitored by security.-CombatTo take care of security guards, you will have a Neural Disrupter by default. The Neural Disrupter is a melee weapon to stun enemies for 2-3 turns. You can get upgraded versions from some nano-fabricators. Other weapons include pistols, dart guns and rifles. Killing guards with heart monitors will raise the alarm counter by 2 bars. An agent can go into melee reaction so if a guard goes past, the agent will knock them out and keep them pinned. Alternatively, your agent can go into overwatch, so if a guard/drone goes into it’s line of sight, He/she will shoot it. If your agent is firing bullets the guard will be killed. If they’re firing darts, he will be knocked out. Drones cannot be knocked out and are unaffected by darts/ Neural Disrupters, but some can be hacked.-StealthStealth is vital to the game. It is nearly impossible to go in guns blazing and succeed. You have to stay in cover to avoid the enemy’s line of sight, otherwise your agent will be shot. If your agent is shot, He/she will be critically wounded, however, the other agent can still get to the elevator to exit the level or revive the wounded agent with medi-gel. By default, Deckard will have a cloacking rig, enabling him to be invisible for a turn if he’s out of sight. An upgrade version can be bought from some nano-farbricators.-Alarm CounterThe alarm counter will increase over time but certain events such as a guars getting killed or a security-monitored console being accessed will increase it too. As the alarm counter rises, it will reach levels (1,2,3,4,5,6 etc..). At these levels, the mission will get harder as hacking will cost more PWR or more guard are called in.I highly recommend this game as it’s a lot of fun to play, But I suggest that you play the tutorial as it teaches you a lot and without it you’ll probably fail the first mission.

												I like Invisible, Inc. quite a lot. It's an excellent turn-based tactical game along the lines of XCOM, but without as much of that game's strategic overhead and randomness.  More than being like XCOM, Invisible, Inc. is a stealth game that encourages you to avoid guards, cover your tracks, hack and pickpocket rather than hunt enemies, set up shots behind cover, and kill.This difference creates a great deal of tension and excitement. The moment-to-moment decisions are suspenseful because of good tradeoffs between exposure, the costs to move and peek, and the ever increasing security level. You can take out guards, but only for a little while. All your decisions are important and deliberate. You don't feel screwed by the game because it has hidden outcomes and costs behind dice rolls: If you lose an agent in Invisible, Inc., it's because of the tactical choices you made, not because they missed an 80% quick shot!The levels change significantly, as they're generated procedurally, and provide a good variety of situations and challenges. The look and sound of the game is great, with a light cyberpunk theme and sharp, stylish character art. It's currently playable only with the mouse and/or keyboard; adding controller support would make this easier to enjoy while on the couch in Big Picture mode—but that's wish-list stuff. I've enjoyed my time so far with Invisible, Inc. and am very happy to have given it a shot.			"

												Excellent game!Turn-based, tactical stealth game. If xcom was a roguelike. You have a squad of spies and go on missions to complete objectives. Your spies have special abilities, can be upgraded and can use a variety of items that you can find or buy. You also have a computer AI that you can use to hack cameras, terminals, robots etc.Pros- randomly generated level maps- actions are permanent, death is permanent- ironman mode by default (no save loading)- tactical to the max. There is no RNG in combat, attacks always hit. If you have a good plan it will work and you won't miss an attack. Equally if you put yourself in a bad position only tactics and abilities will get you out of it, guards won't miss their attack.Cons- short campaign. The intention of the game is that you play one playthrough in easy or normal to become good at it and then come back to play the campaign again in hard or with custom settings. I can see this working because of the randomly generated levels, am now playing on hard after beating the campaign on easy.- no multiplayer. It is inherently a single player game and I can't see how a good multiplayer mode could be added. Not really an issue for me but people seem to want multiplayer in everything.I am enjoying this game a lot.			"

												This game is easily worth <$30.  I have spent much more time in it than expected, striving for achievements, cracking every safe, and pining for better loot.  The game is forgiving but is capable of being ruthless when you're ready for it.  + The turn-based gameplay allows you to carefully make each choice.  If you find yourself in a jam, it's because YOU made a mistake. + Very stylish visuals and decent voice acting.+ The mechanics are easy to pick up but take a while to master.  By the second mission, I was eager to try every mission type.- The ending comes up quick and leaves you wanting more.  However the game is very replayable.			"

Early Access Review
								Already a really good game. Pleasant, challenging, and requires some real skill and thinking, The universe and atmosphere are not fully fleshed out yet but already feel really nice.I don't really understand why that game gets compared to XCOM. Maybe it is just that there is no better comparison to make, but IMO it does not feel much like XCOM (the 1994 original game) and possibly even less like the modern sequels and remakes. Invisible, Inc. is not a game about fighting enemies. It is not even completely a tactical game in the classical sense. It is a game about taking the right decisions to achive an objective in a constrained situation.In my opinion, the defining feature of the gameplay is that nothing is free and every decision you make has a cost.You stunned that patrolling guard? He will wake up in a few turns and investigate.You killed him? That will quickly increase the security tracker (and eventually spawn more guards)You used an item? It will be on cooldown for a few turns when you may need it.You shot a security drone? You will have to buy some ammo now.You hacked that camera you could have walked around? Maybe you should have kept your hacking power for the one in the next room.You unlocked a door? Now the guards can open it too.You did nothing and stayed hidden for one turn? You wasted your agents' action points, and the security tracker is rising.If anything, the game reminds me of chess and other abstract turn-based board games. Every turn, you are confronted to a new situation and have to take the right action. Should I stun that guard? Kill him? Let him walk away without noticing me? Lure him away to another room? Each choices has different merits and drawbacks, and you constantly have to consider how the overall situation will evolve. It is challenging, sometimes frustrating when you find yourself in hopeless situations or when you forget a minor detail that turns your masterplan into a disaster (how many times have I ended up with my team dead just because I forgot to press the ""Melee reaction"" button for one agent?), but usually lots of fun.The current early access phase means the developers are still adding content, balancing the game and refining the gameplay. The technical part is already very good; the game runs smoothly and is very stable (stabler than many ""finished"" games).			"

Pleasant, challenging, and requires some real skill and thinking, The universe and atmosphere are not fully fleshed out yet but already feel really nice.I don't really understand why that game gets compared to XCOM. Maybe it is just that there is no better comparison to make, but IMO it does not feel much like XCOM (the 1994 original game) and possibly even less like the modern sequels and remakes. Invisible, Inc. is not a game about fighting enemies. It is not even completely a tactical game in the classical sense. It is a game about taking the right decisions to achive an objective in a constrained situation.In my opinion, the defining feature of the gameplay is that nothing is free and every decision you make has a cost.You stunned that patrolling guard? He will wake up in a few turns and investigate.You killed him? That will quickly increase the security tracker (and eventually spawn more guards)You used an item? It will be on cooldown for a few turns when you may need it.You shot a security drone? You will have to buy some ammo now.You hacked that camera you could have walked around? Maybe you should have kept your hacking power for the one in the next room.You unlocked a door? Now the guards can open it too.You did nothing and stayed hidden for one turn? You wasted your agents' action points, and the security tracker is rising.If anything, the game reminds me of chess and other abstract turn-based board games. Every turn, you are confronted to a new situation and have to take the right action. Should I stun that guard? Kill him? Let him walk away without noticing me? Lure him away to another room? Each choices has different merits and drawbacks, and you constantly have to consider how the overall situation will evolve. It is challenging, sometimes frustrating when you find yourself in hopeless situations or when you forget a minor detail that turns your masterplan into a disaster (how many times have I ended up with my team dead just because I forgot to press the ""Melee reaction"" button for one agent?), but usually lots of fun.The current early access phase means the developers are still adding content, balancing the game and refining the gameplay. The technical part is already very good; the game runs smoothly and is very stable (stabler than many ""finished"" games).			"

								This game is brilliant, stylish and hard. I'd like to describe it as ""Turn-Based Tactical Espionage Action"" if you know what I mean. But don't expect any kind of plot twists or even plot itself. And great soundtrack makes me think of some Alex Brandon's tracks from Deus Ex.P.S. I have read all the negative reviews. And I have only one question. People, do you even read in-game messages? There are explanations why alarm level is constantly raising, why you can't purchase all equipment between missions and other stuff.			"

								As of the time of this review, this game is a great taste of what to expect from the finished product, but there's still a lot missing. Still, compared to other Early Access games it's hard to complain - it's stable, balanced, and you get a great idea of what the gameplay is meant to be like. There's just a lot of content and depth missing which will hopefully give the final product more lasting appeal. Right now there's not much reason to play through more than a few times, aside from just getting better, since you can reach the level cap and unlock everything after probably 10 runs through, even when you never beat the game.Oh and play on easy, it honestly feels more balanced.

								A true spiritual successor to the old game Syndicate, this might become Klei's new stealth game masterpiece since their amazing Mark of the Ninja. Right now the game is pretty barebones in content and variation in strategy/character building, but it has a very solid foundation to become an epic game of tension, suspense, and really cool Noir/Art Deco/Slick cyberpunk design/Blade Runner-esque aesthetics.Among the few games that can compete with XCOM with the whole 'every turn matters' sort of deal.Klei seems to love doing the Early Access thing, too. By judging their past E-A project, the cool 'Don't Starve' game, then we can actually hope for a lot of cool stuff being updated into this thing.			"

								NOTE: If you want to see the game in action, I have an extensive series on YouTube at:  Discoismyname on YouTube I've been playing Invisible, Inc. now for around a month and I must say that for an early access game it is well polished.The game play itself is very addictive and tense with a ton of moments with brows furrowed wondering what the next best move is. Expect to die a lot.  The game is rogue like - if your team dies its game over - and rock hard but despite the simplicity of the game there is a lot of replayability. I've logged over 20 hours and I've still to delve deep into the items and gearI really recommend this game if you love a bit of strategy or stealth. The missions can range from 5-10 minutes up to epic 40+ minute tension filled runs, so you do get a big bang for your buck.Currently the price is around the $16 mark and it is well worth the money. With constant updates (usually fortnightly) this is a game that continues to grow.			"

Having amazing cyberpunk style and atmosphere the game is easy to learn but is also very challenging. Even though it is in Early Access, it is already playable and updates that bring lots of new cool features are getting released every few weeks. I'll recommend it to everyone who loves Blade Runner and Netrunner tabletop card game.			"

												Held off on my review until after this came out of early access. I jumped on this early for a few reason: I loved Mark of the Ninja, I love turn based games, I love stealth games. Seemed like a win. I have to say I wan't impressed with the early access builds but that it was definitely worth it in the end. The new mission structure and tutorials really helped bring it all together. It's pretty darn hard and designed to be replayed. There's a very definite time limit to the game and moving from one mission to another eats away at that time. So you'll need to pick missions and skip missions and it's possible to complete a mission and yet also fail it. That results in lost time and no redo. It's not damning but doesn't help your end game at all.The core gameplay is a solid turn based tactical strategy game with a huge focus on stealth. You can kill guards but it will bring more guards down on you so it's an emergency tool only. Knocked out guards wake up in a few turns and aren't happy. Most of my levels ended with me trying to dodge a bunch of guards I had knocked out earlier and who were now hunting the level for me. It's possible to sneak past some guards but there will be others you won't be able to avoid. There's a decent cover system, peeking system and ambush system, all of which make the turn-based stealth quite enjoyable.There's also a vaguely shadow run like cyberspace hacking system. It's simple and easy and adds a nice twist without over-complicating things. You can pop in and out of cyberspace to hack things (power supplied, safes, cameras) and then pop back to real life. The action points used in each are completely independent. The story is interesting and well animated and voice acted. If you like turn-based strategy at a squad/individual level I highly recommend this. It's a nice change from the ""kill everyone"" tact that most strategy games take.			"

												I've said a number of times that I might not have that much to add with a game review, and this is a rightly popular game, so I'll keep this one short. Honest.Invisible, Inc. could be called X-COM Except You're Burglars: The Roguelike-like. It has a cyberpunk aesthetic and soundtrack to die for. The turn-based gameplay is genuinely tense and compelling, yet intuitive, and it presents a solid array of tactical factors at nearly every stage. What makes it so tense is that unlike most stealth games, the detection system is pretty much already tripped for every level and you're more or less on the run for almost the whole game.More often than not, you'll have to choose between scarce resources and safety. One misstep could blow your cover or even the whole operation if you don't deal with it effectively...and if you configured the difficulty to have less or even no rewinds, you'd better think fast.Invisible, Inc.'s campaign itself is short, but has great replay value, and there's an expansion pack (it's a bit too substantial to call it DLC) that lengthens the game anyway...and that's not counting Workshop support. The characterization & banter between the agents, and the nature of the Invisible, Inc. they're working for, make for an economical yet intriguing story. Difficulty levels are extremely customizable, which is great for challenge-oriented people and their opposites as well.There's two main issues I can find. One is that the UI can become somewhat cluttered; be prepared to scrutinize and scrutinize some more when corporate security guards are bearing down on your agents. Levels are also randomly generated, which can occasionally result in unfair situations in an otherwise highly-strung yet fair game. In fact, the game is tense enough that, as good as it is, this is decidedly not a 'relaxation' game in any way, shape or form. Not unless you consider sending agents to their doom relaxing.I'd still absolutely recommend this if you want great stealth and/or dislike corporations in some form.			"

												I am a turn-based rpg lover, and I had a good feeling about Invisible Inc, despite I was not sure about randomly generated maps. I normally like when great turn-based combat mechanics meet right challange and a good story.Despite this, I REALLY enjoyed Invisble Inc and cleared the campaign in approx 15 hours. It's definitely a nice game require good thinking, with nice arts and didn't encounter any bug.Only negative point I may say - A.I. could be a little smarter, and ( !! minor how-to-beat-the-game-easily ahead !!)it was enough to get the cloak augment with the other one of KO any enemy in close range to always get out alive from this situation. I had it on 2 agents and was enough to always survive with just a little planing. Should be used max one time instead of giving a cooldown of 10. It was just too easy to KO all enemies with very high armor making the other items/weapons not so important.Anyway, suggested, even at full price, very fun to play! "

												If you're like me and you enjoyed METAL GEAR AC!D when it first came out on the PSP, then you'll love Invisible Inc. Sure, there are no card decks here, but the turn based stealth strategy core mechanics are there. The difficulty level can be customized to your tastes, but even on the easiest setting, it can be very challenging and fun.The levels are procedurally generated giving it a huge replay value. The game contains RogueLike elements to it, so do not get disencouraged if you fail a few times, you get valuable exp that unlocks more characters and items, that will make your next walkthroughs a bit easier. The music is outstanding and it really makes the tactical espionage theme of the game shine. The whole graphics style is also really cool on a futuristic corporate world.8/10			"

												Unfortunately, steam doesn't include the hours I played offline on my laptop, I'm around ~60 hours.Anyway, this game it's an RPG based on Stealth. I hate stealth games, I dropped mark of the ninja after the second level because it felt repetitive.But THIS, oh man, it's so interesting, your brain start working and thinks strategies to overcome the guards and finish each level.RPG part and character specialization is very important, it feels like FTL when you have to choose what to specialize on based on the items you find and the idea you have in mind.Don't avoid this game just because it's marked stealth: it's a great rpg and possibly the greatest stealth game I've played so far.One note, main story is short, but there is endless mode available for you to explore most weird builds for your characters			"

												For those that love the idea of XCOM but are driven batty by the dice rolls making your best laid plans fall on their face, this is the game we've been waiting for.  As you explore the facility with the alarm dial gradually rising it gets satisfyingly tense and with only the limited use rewind system to fall back on every action actually does count.  The amount of different guards, tools, augments and agents is also large enough that repeated plays are well worth it.I believe the lack of substantive story has been criticized but for me there's just enough to keep things rolling without bogging you down on needless character development.  You'll become more than attached to your characters over the course of a campaign as they come ever closer to getting discovered by an army of armored security personnel and murder droids.Only thing I want from this game is more!  I believe they're planning DLC that will expand the already extensive list of options and I can't wait!			"

												Invisible Inc places the player in charge of a futuristic spy agency, fighting against large multi-national corporations. Gameplay is turn based, as you move your agents around office style environments that are divided up into a square grid. Movement distance is limited by Ability Points, and most weapons and gadgets have cooldowns. Its a system that has been growing in popularity over last couple of years, so if you've played games such as Xcom, Shadowrun or Wasteland 2, you'll instantly feel comfortable.There is more of an emphasis on stealth, rather than direct combat. Ammo for lethal weapons is rare, so most weapons simply knock out guards temporarily. Its best to avoid confrontation for as long as possible. The security alarm increases each turn, and any time you're detected, or you kill a guard, the alarm rises even faster. Higher alarm levels bring more tech online (surveillance cameras, firewalls, drones), and summon more guards. There's always a tough choice between exploring the map for more loot, and getting out fast, before the security level becomes too high.Mission locations include prisons, where you can rescue an agent (you start with 2 agents, maximum squad size is 4), bank vaults which obviously have lots of cash, finance offices where you can find special key cards to use at bank vaults, manufacturing plants where you can find advanced gadgets (such as cloaking devices and stun grenades), and server farms where you can acquire programs to help you hack and disable security tech. You have limited time to prepare for the final mission, so again there are some tough decisions to be made when prioritising which missions to play. Maps are randomly generated, which adds a lot of replayability. There's also a form of permadeath. If all your agents die on a mission, its game over. I think any game that combines these two elements needs to be careful with the difficulty balance. Getting screwed over by a particularly evil random map could be frustrating. Thankfully, Invisible Inc seems to have good balance. There are lots of options where you can customise the difficulty level, including allowing the possibility of rewinding a turn to undo a mistake, or even replaying entire missions. And the various gadgets and abilities can help get you out of some really tough situations. Its also worth mentioning that there is no random chance relating to combat. If a weapon is able to hit an enemy, it will hit every time.My biggest complaint is that the story is very basic, and unfortunately its the same every time. The game is designed to be replayed multiple times (a complete campaign will only take around 4 hours), so it would have been nice if the story allowed for some branching based on player choices. As it is, you'll listen to the dialogue once, then hammer the skip button on every subsequent playthrough. And its not really that interesting first time around anyway.Overall, Invisible Inc is a really good game. If you like tactical gameplay you should find alot of enjoyment here.			"

												Just finished my first play through on easy, firstly this game is not Xcom as some have suggested. Being an Xcom addict it shares a few minor similarities, but nothing that a hard core Xcom player would immediately make them love this. So the reason I would recommend, re-playability and the opportunity to unlock more options/characters with each play through. It’s a quick jump in and out chess style turn based stealth/small team tactical game.I would also suggest those who enjoy and deep and long drawn out story may be disappointed, story development wise it’s quick and enjoyable but not something you would rave about. Once you've played once you would only play again just to see what the different combination of characters/equipment and programs would do, but that would keep you going for a fair while longer.			"

You'll spend your time sneaking around, peeking around corners and in doors, using gadgets and hacks to disable security, and sneaking up on guards to knock them out.  There isn't a ton of variety in the mission objectives.  Generally you'll go in, steal something, and get out.  Each mission is also supposed to be done in a small number of turns because every few turns, security gets tighter, even if you didn't cause any disturbances.My only real complaint would be that the game rushes you to complete it.  Not only within the missions but also in the campaign.  There are a lot of optional missions that you simply don't have time to undertake.  I guess that's okay since it's designed to be replayed, but I don't like being rushed.			"

												tl;dr : The best stealth game I've ever played. Buy it with the expansion.Invisible, Inc. is a rouge-like turn-based stealth game where you're controlling several agents through procedurally generated maps filled with guards, traps and loots. Its turn-based nature make it sidestep the central problem with stealth genre : The fact that waiting is boring. In this game, you never needs to wait since your agent is the one observing enemies for you. So instead of wasting your precious time, you're using an agent's action point to make a strategic decisions on whether it's worth it to determine the guards' patrol route or peek through doors.Since the game is turn-based, it only make sense to make the map procedurally generated. So I guess they just went all in and made the game a rogue-like. And it works. The only time I got bad maps that I'd rather not deal with is during early game of Expert Plus difficulty runs which includes more guards. Every playthrough also feels different since there's a lot of variety with agents, programs and items. Extra point for making the unlock painless, 2 successful campaigns and I already unlocked all agents.Last but not least, I strongly recommend playing the game with contingency expansion. The campaign on base game is short (around 9 missions, compared to around 16 with contingency) and it feels weird since it's basically just several early game missions before jumping to the end mission. Endless mode fixes that by adding exit pass, but I bet people won't be able to guess that there's some unique mechanics in endless mode. Also, Endless mode is improved with contingency too, so there's no reason to not grab it.In closing, if you have any interest in stealth games, Invisible, inc. is a must buy. It's a solid blend of stealth and rogue-like, bringing forth the strength of both with many customization options if you find some aspect undesirable.PS: I strongly recommend playing endless mode until 3rd week after you got decent at the expert campaign. Your stealth experience is incomplete until you got Fractal 2.0 in an FTM facility full of Omni guards with 4 routers and 2 Scanners.			"

I've never played a game that was so perfectly tuned to put me into mortal peril, and yet always leave me a thread of hope that I can achieve total victory. Extremely intense, and yet also possible to play with a baby on your lap.			"

												I've been playing this game since Alpha, and it has gotten better and better every time. As one of the more unique takes on the stealth genre, Klei should be applauded for its bold approach, all the while maintaining that same sense of urgency and/ or dominance the player feels when playing the standard stealth game.      My only qualms with the game itself is its repetitive nature. While fans of XCOM or Fire Emblem understand that this repetition in map design and enemy types comes with the territory, other people just jumping into a game like this will probably be bored of having only three to five different types of objectives. stun the CEO, steal the map plans, rescue that one guy from the detention center, hack the database or genetics lab for upgrades... oops, you lost, now do it all again. How about plant a bomb? Tap a line to listen in on communications? Assassinate a dictator? Protect an asset?     Regardless, a fine gem of a game, one that has refreshed the genres that it associates with. 9/10			"

												A pretty incredible stealth game which has a very strong aura of ""Chess"" toward the latter half of missions when♥♥♥♥♥♥starts to hit the fan. You're thrown into missions which you choose from a limited handful each playthrough to build yourself up to a grand finale.At the beginning of each mission, you're thrown into a facility with no idea where your goal or your exit is, and control up to four agents at a time to achieve it. With the clock ticking, things get crazy fast. Real fast. Often a step ahead of when you expect, which keeps things constantly exciting.The story is very simple and wont single handedly hold you through more than your first playthrough, but that's to be expected. It's just vague enough to set the stage without being so detailed that it's obnoxiously repetitive. Good for a rougelike which is primarily meant to be played multiple times from start to finish.Character bios are significantly more indepth than the game ever fleshes out which was a disappointment but a mild one at best. Don't Starve has similar indepth lore without much in-game use, so consider lore a bonus to the game, not an essential detail.All and all, if you enjoy turn based games and stealth, you'd be hard pressed to find anything to be truly disappointed over in this game. Highly recommended.			"

												I will use the words I read of another review out there: Invisible Inc. has the courage to STAY in the realm of stealth.So if you like to play the game your way and would like to go in guns blazing like its Shadowrun... you better be a grand master at the game and even then it will be a rough ride.Invisible Inc. is something I felt like a stealth version of X-Com. Turn based stealth in randomly generated levels rouguelike.You play as the ""Operator"" under the command of the chief of Invisible after they got ambushed by the corporations, a thing that will baffle your two main characters Monst3r, a broker with an income ""bigger than a small countries GDP"" and Olivia Gladstone, the aformentioned chief.As the operator you guide your agents and a computer AI, Incognita,  through the corporations in hit and runs to get info and gear, preparing for the final mission.The game starts with a tutorial on all the main mechanics with Decker, your modern day Noir agent.here you will learn the most important thing about Invisible: getting seen is the first step towards failing the entire mission in many occasionsMain mechanics are:-Walking and taking ""peeks"", your most important tool in my opinion, with your AP. This includes using camera and guard blind spots-Knocking out enemies who will NOT stay knocked out for the entire mission-Using your AI to hack and manipulate the electronics in the enviroment-Opening and closing doors a surprisingly useful tool to block vision and lure guardsI could go on and on how many cool little things and items there are in the game but I find its better to experiment and find out. This IS a rouguelike, so its designed to be played again after failing.The most interesting part of this game is the capability of choosing your missions. You have 72 hours to prepare for the final mission. Invading certain sites will give you certain benefits (money, gear or even the possibility of unlocking a site of your choice).You have to roll with what you get and that is fun e.g. I got a very high level item and had a choice of selling it for some cash or using it even though I never had before. It worked out well.The thing you will also notice it you are on the clock. Every turn the alarm will go up and the level will slowly become harder.Here the stealth comes in very nicely. Getting spotted advances the tracker prematurely as well as killing guards among other things so being expertly sneaky you will make it actually easier for you.And yes, the game reminds you. You have NO CHANCE in a stand-up fight against the corps. EVERY guard is a deadshot and will down your agents in ONE shot if they see them and you move or take another action except ducking for cover or taking them down.Here I would like to gush how this game reminds me of Shadowrun. There are 4 megacorps: FTM, K&O, Sankaku and Plastech. They all have different guards, Sankaku will have bots in their sites others will have special units of other kinds. I still have not been able to figure out all the specifics, but you will soon figure out which corp you hate the least to invade.Like many roguelikes if you die or complete the final mission, your experience will unlock things for other playthroughs like agents and programs for IncognitaAnd having learned from Don't Starve: The modes you play are fully customizable to insane levels of painfulness so there is no real end to your challange, but as well as making the game a LOT easier should you have trouble with it.The game has its flaws im sure but the only real one I could figure out was that sometimes it can be hard to see where you are going and clicking on squares for your agents to move which can be countered by camera rotation mostly but it nags me a bit.Enough rambling if you love stealth you will enjoy this game because instead of planning an attack you will plan a movement and action strategy to evade.Thanks so much for reading!Tip: I recommend your agents have something I like to call ""saving grace items"". Cloaking rigs, flash grenades a tranq gun or in an emergency a lethal gun to make sure the agent can deal with being spotted by one guard as ducking for cover is sometimes not possible. Decker has one of those items making it a good reason for him to be a starting character.			"

What's it about?Invisible, Inc is a turn-based, rogue-lite, tactical stealth game from Klei Entertainment, the makers of such delights as Shank, Mark of the Ninja and Don't Starve. You direct agents on missions in a number of randomly generated levels in order to build up enough power and resources to take on the final mission, all over the course of three short days.How does it play?The closest comparison one can make for Invisible, Inc is the XCOM series. While there are some obvious similarities, flying between missions in your own Skyranger-type aircraft, unit customisation, perma-death, steep difficulty curve etc, there are some equally significant differences. For example, there is no hit-chance RNG that made me give up on XCOM. If you make your agent ambush a guard, or shoot at them, they just do it. It will always succeed unless the guard is armoured and your agent is equipped with a weapon that does not pierce armour.Apart from the XCOM-style unit direction, the main mechanic of the game is manipulating the field by using Incognita, a powerful AI, to hack into the levels mainframe. You can take over security cameras and robots, disable generators and unlock terminals with which to buy new items or programmes for Incognita. Some devices in later levels have Daemon programmes, which cause negative effects when the device is hacked, so caution should be exercised at all times.The game is very fun to play. The controls are very fluid, and the gameplay is smooth. The UI can tend to get a little cluttered if  a lot of things are close together, but since the game is turn-based this rarely matters too much. Much like indie hit FTL: Faster Than Light, Invisible, Inc is a game that hinges on your ability to make decisions and manage resources. Since you have such a limited amount of time to prepare for the final mission, you must decide how to spend your money, how to assign roles and if it would be worth risking that high-security firm for the promise of a rare item. When things are going well, you can get a real sense of power as you disable half a facilities security measures, then move your agents in to take down two guards at once. Of course, if things start to go wrong, it can become a heart-pounding game of cat-and-mouse as you try to keep your agents alive and get as much out of the level as you can before (hopefully) escaping.Also like FTL and XCOM, Invisible, Inc gets very hard, very fast. The difficulty ramps up rapidly throughout each campaign; armoured guards and weaponised drones become more common, and mainframe devices require more power to hack. Despite these spikes in difficulty, however, the game is never completely unfair. If one of your agents ends up getting caught and gunned down, more often than not it's your own fault for not making sure you were adequately prepared, or for putting your agent in a silly place. The game is designed to be played through multiple times, with random generation, different characters and a persistent XP and unlock system providing the motivation to keep trying again. Kind of like Don't Starve, really.How does it look?Klei Entertainment are noted for their use of unique art styles across all of their games, all grounded with design and animation that is distinctly 'Klei'. Invisible, Inc is no exception, sporting an incredibly sleek and cool-looking pastel-colour, posterised aesthetic that suits the cyberpunk setting down to the ground. The clean and clear character and environment design lends itself to the gameplay, with the various guards looking different enough to allow you to sum up a situation at a glance, and also allowing for routes to be planned in no time.How does it sound?Invisible, Inc's sound design is very good indeed, with lots of atmospheric music and crisp sound effects. The guards, who appear to all be Canadian, have just enough different ways of saying ""Looking around"" to avoid it becoming tedious, and the voice acting of the main characters is charismatic and engaging. Incognita's little sound bytes also give the impression that you are in control of a powerful, emotionless AI. Just like their art direction, Klei have always done sound very well, and Invisible, Inc is no exception.Long story short...Invisible, Inc, apart from having an amazing title, is a great little game. Well put together, smoothly executed, and neatly presented. It would benefit from some DLC offering more agents and items, but that could come later down the line. For now, Invisible, Inc is a superb, inexpensive game that provides quick bursts of engrossing, brow-sweatingly tense fun. It's appeal is perhaps more niche than Don't Starve, but give it a go and you may find lots to enjoy here. Just don't expect much of a story.			"

Playing at the ""normal"" level? Forget it. I was so frustrated at the game that I was done.I know the counters for this argument. Yeah, yeah. ""Get good"", etc. Whatever. I like a game to be challenging, but this one is just unforgiving to the max. I've never played a game where failure was punished this severely. I've never played a turn based game before. Maybe that was my problem. I had to play this because I'm a stealth junkie and such a fan of Mark of the Ninja.I recommend this game, but I only found it fun on the lowest level.			"

												Very cool tactics strategy game with tons of style. The art direction is really, really on point...the character designs are soooo good. I want to see Genndy Tartakovsky turn this into a series for Adult Swim. As for the gameplay itself, it reminded me a lot of Commandos, XCOM, and other PC strategy games from the 90s, with an extra dash of polish and flavor. It's pretty difficult at times and can be kind of maddening, especially in those stages where you have to find one specific item. The only problem is that things can get a little repetitive. There aren't many mission types, so you end up doing the same thing over and over. You'll get bored kind of quickly. I hope that you like shutting down security cams and knocking out guards, because that's going to happen a lot. The Contingency Plan DLC adds in some twists and a few new agents, but it doesn't drastically change things.Despite the game's repetitive nature, I'm still going to recommend it. The core gameplay is just classic, and it brought back great memories of gaming in the 90s. The art style is fantastic and it's really nice to look at (the cinemas are also excellent, and the voice acting is flawless). Just realize that it gets repetitive pretty quickly and is also kind of short for the price. Buy it on sale and you'll be happy. I picked this up last Black Friday for 10 bucks, the DLC included, and that seemed fair to me.			"

Being made by klei it is an indie title that feels very indie, but these guys do a good job making a game feel polished. It takes advantage of its smaller budget by being very simple and easy to play. Though I cant scratch the feeling that the game could have more content, I do have to admit that I continue to find new items and new tactics almost every time i play it. any other stealth game can learn a thing or two about creating suspense and a powerful since of gratification. I have played through this so many times I cant count, but I will have to say that the only way they can improve upon what they accomplished is by giving the sequel a solid budget.			"

												Invisible Inc. is one of the best games I've ever played.  I love every part of it, even the awesome pun in the game's title.  The gameplay is very tightly tuned, the graphics ooze style, and the UI and game mechanics are so polished they're practically iridescent; and the atmosphere, oh man, don't even get me started on that.  After all the time I've spent with the game (200 hours and counting), each mission's pervading sense of tension and disquiet still makes my body pump out adrenaline without fail.Klei, the game's publishers, are the defacto demigods of stealth games (just play Mark of the Ninja to see why) and this game only adds to their distinguished pedigree in that regard.  You start each game with two unique agents (as well as an eccentrtic AI) and minimal gear and finances.  Your main task is growing, developing, and upgrading your team by doing tactical missions while racing against a 72 hour clock which when reduced down to zero will make you face the final mission - ready or not.  The tactical missions are all turn based and take place in isometric 3d on various randomly generated levels of four mega corporations (each with unique enemies and challenges).  Each mission gives you the opportunity to gain credits and equipment, but they also have unique objectives (rescuing a new agent to add to your team, implanting your agents with new cybernetic augments, purchasing new hacking software for your AI, or hacking a corporate executives brain for access codes to corporate vaults amongst others).  With a turn tracker constantly increasing alarm levels (which in turn increase the challenge of a level by activating cameras, increasing the difficulty of hacking devices on a level, spawning new guards and drones, and even pinpointing the location of your agents) it is imperative to complete each mission as quickly and quietly as possible.  To aid you in that regard, there is a huge amount of weapons/gadgets/items (stun rifles, cloaking devices, speed stimulants to name but a few), permenant augments (which let you punch through enemy armor, kill guards without activating their heart monitors, or reduce the cooldown on certain items to name a couple), and new programs to aid your agents and your AI.The game's replayability is incredible, and it will take you at least a few playthroughs to unlock all the possilbe starting agents and programs in the game.  There are also very challenging Plus modes for masochists and veterans of the game mechanics.  Finally, there's an Endless mode where you can keep doing missions to try and keep your team alive for as many days as possible.Go play this great game!			"

												Its quite fun, really challanging and its got a great art style. With that said, it doesn't have the replayability you'd expect from a turn based stratagy game, after finishing it twice i feel content with not playing it for a while, which wouldn't be bad, if it didnt take about 2-3 hours to beat it. One thing to look out for are mods as the mod does support steam workshop. "

This game is fun and uses a turn based strategy mechanic that is intense and quite pressuring at times.

												I'm not saying it's like chess, but it's like chess. A turn-based strategy game on a time limit; think Shadowrun with a bit of FTL thrown in for good measure. Where one wrong move can end your mission, luckily you can rewind if you screw up and get an agent horribly murdered. Collect what you can in 72 hours or die trying, either way you progress towards new unlocks to start the process again. The game is fully fleshed out and is set to receive more content in the future, highly recommended (especially on sale.)			"

												Invisible Inc. is one of the best games I've ever played.  I love every part of it, even the awesome pun in the game's title.  The gameplay is very tightly tuned, the graphics ooze style, and the UI and game mechanics are so polished they're practically iridescent; and the atmosphere, oh man, don't even get me started on that.  After all the time I've spent with the game (200 hours and counting), each mission's pervading sense of tension and disquiet still makes my body pump out adrenaline without fail.Klei, the game's publishers, are the defacto demigods of stealth games (just play Mark of the Ninja to see why) and this game only adds to their distinguished pedigree in that regard.  You start each game with two unique agents (as well as an eccentrtic AI) and minimal gear and finances.  Your main task is growing, developing, and upgrading your team by doing tactical missions while racing against a 72 hour clock which when reduced down to zero will make you face the final mission - ready or not.

												If XCOM and Shadowrun Returns had a baby, it would be Invisible Inc.  The art style is timeless and the animation is smooth and rewarding.  No mission and replay is the same thanks to random mission layouts, except for all the tasing (zzzoT!  mmm, creds).  A handful of turn rewinds keeps you from being tempted to copy/paste on actual save files.  Live with your mistakes.  Your agents will die.  Deal with it.  Go on the next run.  All the XP stacks up, even on failed games.Good action in small chunks for the busy 9-5 cubical slave.			"

												this is my first review but I have plenty of time on this game. Simply put, it is one of the best stealth games I have ever played. I play allot of stealth games. Being made by klei it is an indie title that feels very indie, but these guys do a good job making a game feel polished. It takes advantage of its smaller budget by being very simple and easy to play. Though I cant scratch the feeling that the game could have more content, I do have to admit that I continue to find new items and new tactics almost every time i play it. any other stealth game can learn a thing or two about creating suspense and a powerful since of gratification. I have played through this so many times I cant count, but I will have to say that the only way they can improve upon what they accomplished is by giving the sequel a solid budget.			"

												(46 hours played so far)This is the best parts of FTL, XCOM, Frozen Synapse, and Netrunner. Turn-based, strategic, square-grid, isometric, cyberpunk, stealth roguelike puzzler. Like FTL, you can be utterly screwed by the random generation of the levels, and can spend hours getting to the end fight, only to lose horribly because you just couldn't get enough of the right equipment, or the mission targets were impossibly placed. Other times, you can approach it like a puzzle game, where there *has* to be a solution if you just think about it hard enough. Or like chess, perhaps? And then other times you find yourself roleplaying the agents and their different strengths and personalities.FTL's biggest drawback was the limited campaign length, where just about the time you felt that you had gotten things under control, you had the boss fight, and were either prepared or not. And then the game ended either way. XCOM had a limited campaign length, but ended right before you got tired of it. Invisible, however, offers you an ""endless"" mode, once you've gotten the hang of the campaign mode. It has custom options for all of the cool bits, so you can make it as difficult or easy as you'd like.I highly recommend this one. It's good value for your money.			"

												If you're a fan of stealth games like Mask of the Ninja or tactical turn-based games like XCOM, you'll love this. You control a team of special agents who are trying to infiltrate a number of high-security corporation buildings to gather intel and gear. After 3 in-game days (approximately 8 missions), you're thrust into a climactic final mission that is nail-bitingly difficult, even on Beginner mode. Difficult, but not unfair.That's really true of all of Klei's games. Every time you ""fail,"" you learn more about how the game works. And in this one, much like Don't Starve, you also earn XP toward unlocking new agents and AI programs that make the process easier.Maps are procedurally generated, there are lots of unlocks and several difficulty modes (including an Endless mode) so there's the potential for 100+ hours of fun gameplay here, easily.If you like these kinds of games, you really can't go wrong. It's an amazingly polished experience all around, extremely challenging and tons of fun.			"

												Invisible, Inc. represents a retake on the tactical turn-based game.Set in a dystopian future ruled by mega corps, you represent a convert group fighting corporate interests. The game opens with your HQ being attacked. Barely escaping and left with barely 72 hours, you're expected to get to the source of the attack and neutralize it, and save your organization's AI asset - Incognito - in the process.Make no mistake here - unlike most turn based tactical games, Invisible, Inc. is designed to be very fast paced. Emphasis is placed on making strategic decisions on whether to explore each procedurally-generated map and harvest maximum resources, or achieve mission objectives with minimal risk. All the while, the Security Level rises at the end of each turn, and stacks more and more opponents against your agents. Being the underdog, you'll find that fighting the enemy head-on isn't going to get you far. Stealth and speed is the mode of play here.The game is also designed to address the propensity to ""save scum"" - instead of being allowed to save in game, players now have a choice to rewind the game a limited number of steps instead. ""Beginner"" difficulty also allows you to retry the level (regenerate map and start again).Campaigns will not last more than a day's worth of play. Yet the game has great replay value - other than procedural maps always keeping you guessing, each agent made available to you comes with special abilities and you should alter your gameplay to exploit fully.In a way, Invisible, Inc. tries to improve on turn-based tactical games and add a mix of roguelike. The result is interesting and definitely worth a try for those who enjoy turn-based tactical games.As always, developer Klei did a good job with sounds and graphics to immerse the player into the world. Pros:- Turn Based Tactical game done properly.- Replay value from different agent capabilities/upgrades, and procedurally generated maps.- Fast paced game and incremental Security Level makes the end-phase of each map exciting (instead of boring).- Rewinds offer a different way to avoid deadlocks/mistakes.- Excellent visuals and sound.- Good value, considering the cost.Cons:- Randomness and short game-length can be an issue - difficulty can spike, augments/tools you want may not be always available, etc.- More back-story would have made the game more engaging for replays.

												This is what you get when stealth meets tactical turn-based squad combat. The way the game handles is practically the same as XCOM, with the twist that it's focused on avoiding combat rather than eliminating everything in sight. What's interesting is that the authors removed pretty much all RNG related elements, if you can shoot an enemy, you will hit them. However the trick is that killing enemies is often more hassle than it's worth and in the long run using weapons unless absolutely neccesary will hurt your chances, as you have very limited ammo and things get more intense the more violence you use.The strange thing is, stealth works really well here, the game is extremely fair, pointing out for you what each enemy can see and where the safe spots to stay out of sight are. It shows you patrol paths and allows you to easily predict how to avoid enemies without ever coming into contact with them. It makes the stealth portion really enjoyable and combat turns into a last resort meassure when you really can't afford to be waiting for an opening to slip past the guards. It also works really well in a turn-based format, as most of the time you're needing to plan your next move, having the time to think things through really helps when deciding on the optimal path to your objective.Missions are to a large part randomly generated, while this can result in a pretty large variation in difficulty on its own, you usually have the resources with you to take out a particularly hard obstacle, it never felt like the randomly generated map system created a room that couldn't be either avoided or forced through.All in all, a unique stealth games and one of the most enjoyable ones around.

												I enjoyed this game while it lasted but as far as I could see, this was like a quick play missions. When I first tried to play, both of my agents were down in just a few turns. I eventually ended up making a custom game, turning down the alarm level sensitivity to allow myself to explore and basically changing the entire game. While this did make the game more bareable but still just as hard IMO, now i couldn't get any achviements. Between hacking with incogneta  and waiting for her to charge up and trying to wait out guard patterns with the alarm level ever increasing, there is no reason to explore. It seems the only way to win is to quickly find the target in the room next to you, hack it, and escape, or you've alreay lost. More cameras will activate causing u to spend more power hacking them. enforcers will spawn, and they will have more armor. And guards you manage to hit down stay down for 3-5 turns, Meaning, if you take down a guard, you have now created an anchor point that you cannot go too far away from or you will lose as he will start searching, and raise the alarm level. (I changed the number of turns KOed to a much higher number for my custom playthrough). Also, as the game progresses, you find that you will collect a massive amount of credits, which then pile up since monster rarely selling anything. You can sell items to him, but with your massive amounts of credits, it makes sense to just have him hold the items. I wish there was a store between missions, so that I could actually buy things. Maybe make the store more expensive than the one in levels, but still a store in between would make sence. Im summary, this game still feels like it could be worked on to be inproved. I feel that when you first start the game (after the tutorial) you will keep failing for a solid number of times, since you have no starting upgrades. Once you have tried starting a few time, you will get a starting advantage, or you can realize after the first try, maybe customizing the gameplay might be better, first win with custom settings, and then run on beginner and work your way up. No matter what, There is definately room for improvement for this game, and I hope the developer listens			"

												Invisible Inc. is a little gem of a game.""Little"" because I completed it in less than 10 hours. It's true that the devs try to create a bit more replayability by having additional agents who can be unlocked, different (harder) levels, etc. but it all still feels like the game falls short on the ""depth"" bit.Despite that, I really like this game: It has decent graphics, a good storyline, engaging music and a very capable turn-based combat system. You're basically an ""operator"" in charge of 2 agents whom you use to conduct covert missions. In these missions, you get to score cash, loot, and upgrades for your agents. It's undeniably fun and addictive.Here's the best part: The core strategy in Invisible is stealth. IF you jump in, guns blazing, or trigger happy, killing every guard you see, I can almost guarantee you'll lose. And the game does not allow you to save progress while on missions. You only get one save game before and after the mission, though you're permitted limited ""rewinds"" (reloads one turn before) per campaign.What could be better: I think the strategic layer of the game could be improved. Basically on the world map you get to choose missions, upgrade your agents (if you have cash, which is always in limited supply) and read some dialog. That's about it. Monst3r should have an expanded role -- you hardly get anything from his black market contacts.If there were 2, maybe 3 more chapters after the initial 72 hours of in-game time, I think it would be exceptional (especially if you're paying full price for the game, about $22).Invisible was really fun to play. I recommend this game -- I just wish it was longer.7.5/10			"

												A sneaky turn-based espionage game where your goal is to play the role of an infiltrator rather than some James Bond-esque character. You can only knock guards out and only temporarily. But eventually they will come around and, having just taken an enforced nap, will proceed to hunt you down relentlessly. So... really this game is best played to ensure that the enemy does not even know you are there at all, or not to know until you are already escaping the area.Oh, and it's made by the same people who did Mark of the Ninja.

												Invisible , Inc. is a turn based stealth rpg and a really good one at that. The first thing i noticed that really interested me was the fact that you could trick the guards with false leads like leaving a door open you did'nt go through. Secondly it is very stealthy and special in its own right, but one thing I did keep feeling the whole game was ""man this really gives an X:com'y feeling."" Wraping everything up though it's a really good game with a decent amount of unlockables and replayablitiy and a pretty cheap DLC that in my opionion adds a lot to the game. (If you're a dlc kinda person.)			"

												Invisible, Inc. is a turn based game of stealth. The various components of Invisible aren't anything new. There's no new ""wow"" factor here. We've seen this before.But it is an exceptionally well crafted experience. The mechanics of the game are simple - hide from your enemies. As a general rule you really can't kill them. But you can knock them out for 3 turns. All the while you're avoiding patrols, cameras and bots. You can instruct your friendly AI to turn off security systems and open safes, but you're always limited by power as to how much help the AI can provide. Meanwhile, there's a clock ticking that makes security get tougher every 5 turns, so you need to move with haste. Your operatives have limited skills, limited inventory slots and even more limited funds, so you're going to have some hard choices.Put this together and you have a very tight package of gaming goodness. It's not hard to pick up but it does get difficult to master. Even on the easiest level the game is a challenge. On higher levels, you simply can't make mistakes and there's no save function here. You have a very limited ability to rewind to avoid a screwup, but limited is a key word in that sentence. The ""campaign"" isn't very long - you'll finish it in fewer than 3 hours. But you mayl want to play this again and again since all levels are randomly generated and the various difficulty levels will always provide a good challenge.Now my biggest problem with the game really revolves around the longevity. Even knowing the levels are random doesn't help what become some fairly simple gameplay mechanics. So while I found the game exceptionally well-crafted and worthy of your dollars, I'm not going to see a lot of long-term gameplay from this title in my experience.			"

												Spectacular game for lovers of stealth and turn based strategy in a roguelite format. This XCOM meets Mark of the Ninja title succeeds in creating tense moments where every square you move could mean the difference between getting caught or getting out alive.For those worried about the difficulty/RNG aspect of the game, be warned. You are not supposed to beat this the first time around. Rather, at the end of each run, you gain XP which then unlocks new programs and agents.- You will die to lack of planning- You will die to a misclick- You will die because RNGesus wills it.But it's alright! Dust yourself off and have another go. Learn from your mistakes and become stronger! This is the nature of the beast and you will have a bad time if you take each loss as a personal insult to your skills.Klei entertainment deliver on the voice cast, art style and narrative as per usual. Fans of Mark of the Ninja will know what I mean. All in all, a solid game and a great purchase in the current developer deal!			"

								So, I just finished the tutorial. Leaving with the basic tools of the trade, I selected a ""Guarded"" mission - from what I could tell, this was the one that was least likely to hand my♥♥♥♥♥♥to me through use of an industrial bacon slicer.Spawning in with instructions to find the elevator and maybe steal a few priceless artifacts if I felt like it, I quickly explored the area with my two agents. They already felt very different - Mr Bond 2.0 galloped about the level like a majestic stallion in padded socks, crossing rooms in a graceful yet silent leap, whilst our resident lady-spy hacked computers from a mile away to fill the battery to doxx n00bs, celebrities, and any security cameras and safes that were unfortunate enough to find themselves in our randomly-generated path.Flash forward - lady-spy was in the vault hiding behind a safe having disabled both layers of laser trap, waiting for the battery to fill just once more level to unlock the safe. James was racing for the elevator, dodging irritated patrols that had been knocked unconcious one too many times through a combination of electric shocks and homoerotic terror (disregard for lady-spy). It was halfway through the final room when I froze - fiddlesticks, I thought, lady-spy has the keycard for the elevator! In my haste, I had neglected to open it on the way, out of a combination of ignorance and moderate stupidity.With the alarm level raising continuously, I had to double back. I carefully guided James to the safe, hands shaking, nose pressed up against the monitor, and brought lady-spy to rest behind a desk in the elevator room. Battery having charged, I grabbed the final priceless treasure and hustled my trench-coated♥♥♥♥♥♥back to the main room. Suddenly, the alarm level escalated once more, and a new guard was brought up into the elevator.♥♥♥♥♥♥The new plan was simple. Lady-spy would run to the now-open elevator, knock out the guard inside, and James would then join her - his extra movement abilities would allow him to bypass any possible guards that noticed the commotion or turned around to view the kerfuffle taking place. Palms sweating, I navigated lady-spy to the elevator, in position to knock out the guard. However, much to my dismay, there was a second guard in the elevator whom I could not see, but immediately saw me and moved to shoot. I had one square of movement for cover, and ducked behind the elevator door for cover, readying for combat if a guard moved to my square. James was placed next to her, also ready to attack. They could take out both guards, and we would be free!Alas, t'was not to be. Unfortunately, a third and fourth guard had heard our bickering. Elevator guards one and two were knocked out, leaving us with no defence when three and four riddled us with more holes than a swiss cheese at a double penetration party. I swore loudly at the computer.Buy it. It rocks.			"

												No se puede decir a menudo que en videojuegos se ha inventado un género nuevo, pero ciertamente es lo que ha ocurrido con Invisible Inc. Es cierto que los juegos de sigilo ya existían anteriormente, y la estrategia por turnos también, sin embargo nunca se habían fusionado y, en este caso, lo han hecho con mucho éxito. Quizá el sigilo es un poco light y la estrategia por turnos también, pero es la toma de contacto con un género nuevo y es inevitable que en sus comienzos sea un tanto rudimentario. Pero el resultado funciona muy bien en su conjunto, creando misiones donde la tensión se palpa en el aire y donde el tiempo (paradójicamente) es un elemento fundamental. Gráficamente, el juego no está mal aunque no es impresionante y el que los mapas se generen aleatoriamente hace que, en muchas ocasiones, los entornos den la sensación de repetirse un poco. A nivel sonoro las voces están bien y la música cumple, pero tampoco es el aspecto principal del juego. El resultado es que no se trata de un juego insuperable, pero si un comienzo muy prometedor para un nuevo género y la innovación, a esa escala, es doblemente valiosa. Un 8.			"

												A lot of people seem to be enjoying this game, that's not surprising to me in the least. In the past few years, gamers have grown fond of games that hate them and throw random BS in lieu of actually developing a game that has craft and design behind it.Played through this game on Beginner. Beat it on dumb luck. Started up again on Intermediate, had no idea what to do. Thrown into a room with no escape about a minute into my second mission. Couldn't have gotten out of it at all, rewinds were pointless. Tried again, this time the exit was right next to the room where the guards come out of. Totally screwed.

								Invisible, Inc. is a TBS game set in the near future. You are an elite team of stealth operatives. Your goal - get the most money you can. You can choose what kind of enemy bases to infiltrate and can choose to go after advanced technology, additional characters to join your team, programs to upgrade your hacking ablilittes, or a vault to score huge amounts of money. However, the longer the game goes on the harder it gets; you will have to build your team to be able to even escape at the later levels. The levels are procedurally generated, so every level brings a new tactical sitation that you will have to conquer. This procedural engine is very clever though, it will try to screw you over at every turn. This is what makes it fun. Very fun game, even in beta, don't blame you if you wait till full release though. All in all a very good game, highly recommended, belongs in everyones library.			"

												I should have liked this game...Turn based - Stealth - Cybertech - Great publisher (LOVED Mark of the Ninja).  But after a playthrough (with DLC) I turned it off once I was deep into Day 4.  I kept waiting for the game to get interesting... finally I gave up.There was just nothing that was grabbing me.  Again, I am having trouble figuring out why I just couldn't get my excitement level up - instead, I was frustrated that the publisher clearly had a specific method (Stealth, no stun, no kill - but move quickly) and other thought processes eventually fail.Compare this with Mark of the Ninja where stealth was clearly rewarded, but the player could choose any number of routes and skills - the player could also sit and watch the patrols, figure out a good plan of attack.  Here the turn counter is so aggressive that the game lost the fun you normally associate with turn based play.The quality is fine - I am sure that the folks who enjoy this are getting their moneys worth - not me in this case.

												This game has really cool aesthetics, but it's repetitive and constrictive.  I gave it a good shot, but after about 8 missions I just can't play it anymore.  It's so frustrating that ammunition and useful melee weapons are so expensive, and that killing guards penalizes me so much.  Look, if my character uses a taser on a guard to knock him unconscious, that character should be able to pull out a knife and finish the job.  Heart monitors are not a valid (lore?) reason not to have that option; this is a futuristic stealth game where you have an artificial intelligence fully capable of hacking into the system and making it look like a heart monitor is still on.I like games that are challenging, but I don't like to feel like I'm powerless.  That's essentially how this game makes me feel: everything is ridiculously expensive, and I can't kill anything without being super-penalized.  I don't need to play a video game to experience living paycheck to paycheck.  That's how this game feels.  Okay, I get the limited resources thing--but why does a firewall-protected safe have less money in it than I need to buy a single bullet?  If all these corporations are running the world, where's their real money?  Because I feel like every mission I'm the brokest person on the block, breaking into the second-brokest person's house.

Bur around the mid, the bad sides showed up, when the random level generator created just ridicilous levels. Either seemingly impossible, the next try the mission runs by itself when the guards are spawned totally off the route. Furthermore the ""campaign"" is very short.

												It's great. I really like it.But it's so short, if you have a free afternoon, you'll likely finish it in a single playthrough.That'll unlock some new stuff, so your next playthrough will be slightly different.But having another shot at the campaign will reset your ranks and choices, making you lose some sense of progression.It's hard to feel invested in your decisions if you know that they'll only matter for a little while.The story, cut scenes, voice acting, they're all really cool. But they're not that appealing when you know where the story's gonna go.Where does that leave me?Invisible Inc. is good. You'll enjoy it. But it's twenty bucks at the moment. The upcoming DLC will add to the campaign, but it won't be free. As such I personally wouldn't recommend you buy it.That isn't to say that if you don't really care about the price, you won't have a great time.Because you will.			"

												At this time, I probably have 40-50 hours of offline play in this, and nearly everyone unlocked.This really isn't a team based tactics game.  It's a resource management game, and you'll never have enough.  The game ramps up its difficulty pretty fast, and the higher alarm levels are just stupid.  The fact that you have to unlock things isn't a bonus, it's a negative.   Once you do run through a few missions, you'll max all of your stats (which you buy with cash from safes), and after that, there's really no point in money.  The game will then just start putting more and more armor on the guards that it sends at you, making all of your previous things obsolete, but not giving you enough new items to compensate.  It won't matter that you have +3 armor piercing when the guards have 8 armor.Unless you tweak the settings so that your guards stay knocked out for +99 turns, they'll just keep standing up, and the alram level will just keep rising, with an unlimited number of new guards being brough into the level.  This makes it seem like you should be rushing the levels, but you really can't.  There are stupid ""tricks"" the game throws at you where it will just reveal the location of your team members, wherever you're hidden, simply because it can.  The more I play this, the less fun I have with it.			"

												This is by no means a bad game. But I disagree with some of the design choices in the game, which I will highlight and let others decide if this game is what they want.The game is touted as a stealth game, but it forces you to go fast with the security level increasing EVERY TURN. Which completely defeats the purpose of a stealth game. A stealth game should give you as much time as possible to study the map layout, observe enemy patterns, come up with a plan and then execute it.The game teaches you to knock out guards or avoid them in the tutorial. But honestly, knocking out guards is not a very viable option. They guards simply wakes up after a VERY short number of turns and goes into high alert patrol mode. Which means avoiding is a far better choice than knocking out where possible. What's more, knocking out enemies has a cooldown on 3 turns. This limits your choice as a player. And because you don't have option to kill at the start, it gives you even less to work with. I prefer stealth games to be open ended, with choices at the player's disposal and allow you to proceed in a slow methodical manner. This is NOT such a game.I wouldn't even call it a stealth game. It's more like a run-carefully game, cause you simply can't afford to take your time.			"

												I’m not good at writing reviews so this is more of a personal opinion of the game that I feel I have to share with you if you are still undecided whether to buy or not to buy.Invisible, Inc. is simply an amazing game. While it was still in early access I purchased it but only after I thought it through for a long time. So when I finally did the deed and started playing I started to doubt my decision. The result was that I did not spend much time playing this game at all.And now it is finally released from EA and I have played only 9 hours according to Steam. And it is truly an enjoyable 4 hours. This game is very addictive to play. At first it might seem difficult to play but it really is not. As soon as the game mechanics is grasped the game starts to flow. It can be challenging but not in the extreme. O and there is a handy rewind button for mistakes you make. Although limited it is very handy. The movement of the characters are unique and sort of funny. At first the walls in the game was a bit of an obstacle when moving the characters but with a press of the ALT key they disappear for a better overall view. And if you’re put off by the graphics, don’t be. The graphics, fun characters, upgrade system and easy to grasp turn-based gameplay all adds up to the overall character of the game and a very enjoyable experience.I will without a doubt recommend this game. I’m sure you will not regret it. This is a Klei Entertainment masterpiece. I love it.So this review is taking up valuable game time so I'm done. Its invisible time now. Cheers and happy gaming.			"

												First of all Invisible inc is a really good game, and could with some higher funds and more love been something truly great. It is a really good strategic game, that borrow a a lot of it´s game play from X-Com, I don´t mind that. And at a start it is really hard, and makes you think two and three times, but I do lack some thing extra to lift it in the genre. As it is now it´s is really fun, but the campaign is really short took me about 2 hours to finish it from start to goal, and then I took my good time with it, to really try to do everything on most lvls. But hopefully the creators get some new materials in quickly and prolong the campaign (which the end invites too at current date). Would mainly wanna see some more interaction and stuff to do while off mission, maybe in the case of more moral choices that will effect the game play and so on. But it´s kind of cheap, got potential and most important have a good game concept that just need that little more extra to become great.			"

												This futuristic strategy/stealth really blows you away with how much detail that went into it. They have polished everything nicely, and the cut scenes are incredible. It looks like a proper cartoon and not like a actual cut scene from a regular game. The style of the characters and the backgrounds is incredible, and it suits the game well. Another fact that I liked about the game is that the levels, even in the campaign are randomly generated, so every run you go through, it won't be the same as the last. One thing this game could use is a online multi-player campaign mode. Klei have really pulled this game through and have made this game shine in the spotlight. If you're looking for a game that makes you work hard for a victory and not just by force, you'll love this game. I'm giving this game 4.5 out of 5.			"

												Amazing tactical stealth game. Options allow you to play ironman with permadeath or you can take it easy and everything in between. When you first begin you get two agents to use but there is a total of 10 which the rest being unlocked by how well you did in your previous playthroughs. Characters can be progressed and upgraded, and you really feel like your playing high stakes with a single bad decision being able to lead to the deaths of your agents. Highly recommend.			"

												Klei is involved with some excellent games with roguelike elements,(Darkest Dungeon, Necrodancer, Don't Starve) and Invisible is no exception.The asking price is pretty steep, in my opinion, because roguelikes inherently reuse content. You only get the thrill of hearing the music, seeing the visuals, and watching the story unfold once. Things only become worth it because of the replayability.It's pretty damn good, but don't expect a Shadowrun: Dragonfall without the magic. (Or any RPG elements)Invisible feels very high stakes and is quite short. The roguelike-ness makes it a replayable puzzle,like a game of chess played on a rubiks cube.Buy it if you like hardcore challenge and strategy, or wait for a decent sale.There is no praying to RNG here, only cold hard calculation.

												This is a great game! I feel it's important to state up-front that this is a rogue-like game. Some people are calling it ""rogue-lite"" because there are options to allow single-turn rewinds and level replays, but expert mode (the intended mode) only gives you a single rewind per level and no level retries. This is only barely more forgiving than iron-man mode which is effectively full rogue-like mode with no rewinds. It is very well done if you like the genre.Playing this game feels like a hybrid between FTL, Dungeon of the Endless (DotE), and Monaco. Upgrading your character with augmentations and items feels very much like FTL's ship upgrades (minus the energy requirement). Level play has similarities to DotE in that room control is important and you sometimes leave a man back a room or two to keep a guard occupied. You also find ""merchants"" within levels to upgrade rather than in between levels (mostly). Evading guards reminds me of Monaco's playstyle.In other words, it's stealth X-COM in a rogue-like format. Amazing game. Very well done!			"

								This game, thus far, even though unfinished and still being worked on, gives me warm and fuzzy feelings. An absolutely unforgiving style of gameplay reminiscent of XCOM paired with the artistic style of Shadowrun Returns and with its own, unique gameplay characteristics that just overall makes a fun game. If you liked XCOM or Shadowrun, I'm pretty sure you'll like this, especially if you're big on the whole stealth thing, and you like challenging games (i.e., playing on easy is still challenging and unforgiving if you're not careful).My only advice is... if you get it, and you get your♥♥♥♥♥whooped, don't give up. Swallow the sadness and frustration, and get back in there tiger! You will get better.			"

												Pretty slick stealth game with survival elements, like a sexy sexy sneaky XCOM. It's not so much cyberpunk as spy movie with movie-hacking. The only thing missing to make it a Bond game is several martinis and hook-ups. In my imagination, when a team of superspies get down to business, this is what it feels like.			"

												Very very very very strong recommendation. I am a big fan of stealth, team based tactics and turn based strategies so this game is all I could ever wish for.  While it is an unusual combination, Inv. Inc. is a kind of game, which makes me wonder why has no one done that before. Inspirations for this game are quite obvious – there is a lot of XCOM in there, as well as FTL and other rogue-lights. Don’t be misled though, as it is a game of its own. If you long for a lengthy XCOM campaign with base building, you won’t find it here. Also at the moment it is not a brilliant rogue-light. The score system has been removed from the final release, as it wasn’t well polished and forced players to play in very specific (often not practical) way. If you hope for leaderboards you won’t find it here (at least right now). Also the progression and items you get, while very well designed, does not have the FTL wonder and variation.But let’s talk about the really good stuff. If you are into stealth, all you need to know is that it is the first game I have ever seen to expand (and not only replicate) mechanics introduced in Thief: DP and Thief 2:TME. Stealth is great but it did have some unresolved issues for years. Games’ quality mostly depended on the quality of level design. Way too often stealth’em ups were an exercise in patience and didn’t actually require skill. Often the most fun way to play was sneaking but either it was just easier to shoot your way through the levels or being revealed was punishable in either instant failure or unavoidable death. On the other spectrum, sometimes there really wasn’t much repercussions from being discovered, and sneaking felt kind of pointless.Inv. Inc. solves those issues with a simple, elegant mechanic called alarm meter. As you infiltrate enemy territory the automatic alarm system detects your presence. With every turn alarm meter fills up by one point. Every couple points alarm level rises and new counter measures appear: extra cameras, new guards, higher level of security (hacking.) This forces you to be efficient, as the more time you spent on the level, the more dangerous it will become. Once you get to alarm level 6 you’ll be better running straight for the elevator.But this is not all. Get spotted, kill a guard and the alarm rises as well. Thanks to that, your failings have repercussions and game punishes you for mistakes, but it is never an instant gameover (unless you do something really careless.) As a matter of fact my best experiences with the game were when things got hairy. Add to that the way guard work – they follow their own stable patrol routines until you disturb them (be spotted or stun them – stunning does not take guard out of the game forever. He wakes up after couple turns.) When alerted they will be actively looking for you. They become unpredictable and dangerous. The ideal way is to ghost through the level. Even stunning a guard (and you will probably have to do it almost every mission) carries consequences. That is about stealth mechanics. They are absolutely brilliant. The story is serviceable, mostly explaining, why you do what you do, but it does have some nice touches and is supported by great art-style.There are a few game modes to choose from. There is the story mode, which is the main meat of the game. It has couple difficulty settings, to allow new players to get to know the game, without tearing their hair out, and some tough ones for those who crave for extreme challenge. It is a 72 (ingame) hour campaign, with a final mission at the end. You take on different missions and build up your squad in preparation for the final level.There is endless mode, which removes final mission, allows you to go forever but the difficulty spikes beyond this of the story mode.Time attack gives you a time limit on your turns forcing you to think quickly and make snap decisions. Sandbox allows you to modify rules of the game (even remove the alarm system, which I don’t know why would you want to do….) and create as easy or as difficult experience as you wish. It might not seem like much but between excellent procedural generation, roster of different agents and their alternative versions and programs to use (ha I didn’t even mention hacking! It is basic but well designed. Has more depth than seems at first and adds to the ever present resource management) you will be able to sunk hours upon hours into this game on a story mode alone. It is a game for those who like PLAYING games, and not only BEATING them.			"

												One of the very very few times someone has designed a game with actually deep solid gameplay - better and tighter than any roguelike I've played (and I've spent a lot of time on famous ones such as ADOM and NetHack). It has the random map generation and permadeath of dungeon-crawling roguelikes, but instead of mindlessly mashing through weak popcorn enemies most of the time you have to cautiosly sneak past guards and manipulate your enviroment while carefully calculating your every move. You'll encounter many tough close-call situations that test your planning and improvisation skills. The game also is almost never unfair, as the gameplay is deterministic and everything is avoidable if you think far enough ahead. This game is excellent and definitely recommended if you want a tactical challenge.			"

The rules are fairly simple, and the procedural design means it doesn't get too old too quickly - I can play it for an hour or two at a time before feeling the need to change it up.This is a hard game and you lose a lot of the time, but it doesn't take long to get better and there are many new options for difficulty and to help ease you into being thrown in the deep end :)The new release system is a bit different to what i am used to playing, but it is a lot, lot better!If you don't already own Mark of the Ninja - get that then get the 20% extra discount. It's worth owning both games!The artwork is cool, and the new story and campaign premise make it pretty exciting!Don't feel bad for killing characters in the game - even though it is kinda punished, sometimes it is necessary :pDo feel bad about going out peacefully with last words..!Last words are only cool if they come with a suicide grenade :)			"

												If you like stealth and/or turn-based strategy, Invisible, Inc. is an absolute must-buy. The gameplay is sharp and tactical: the game never misinforms you or tricks you, every mistake you make is definitely your own. This combined with the cutting throat nature of losing agents extremely easily when you get caught out makes for a thrilling permadeath experience.The core gameplay itself is simple: stay out of sight and steal a lot of dollars. But of course there's much more to it. The hacking aspect is sublime, forcing you to manage your power as a resource is as huge a deal as putting your agents in the right spots. The choice between full-on ghost stealth or a bit more aggressive (but smart) use of weaponry to kill guards is balanced well: weapons make a lot of noise and you have to pay a clean-up cost at the end of the mission for every bodybag. A vast array of items and hacking programs mean pretty much every playthrough is different since you never know what you find this time. Combined with the progression of receiving XP from every campaign you complete or lose and unlocking new agents and starting programs gives the game a ton of longevity.It should also be noted that this game has a great set of options, including colorblind mode. Also, you can customize your own difficulty or choose from presets: if you find that some aspect of the game irks you in a particular way, chances are you can tweak it to either be easier or harder. These options are available from the start, which is really cool. No more banging your head against the wall trying to beat the game to unlock second wave options.I absolutely recommend Invisible, Inc. The game was good in Early Access when I played back in September 2014; in full release, the game is just stellar.			"

And it is awesome. If you're a stealth buff with a taste for strategy, this game is ADDICTIVE. More so (dare I say it) than Mark of the Ninja. I was put off at first at the turn based thing, especially after MotN's real time action, but I have since retracted that feeling.

												Highly recommended for anyone who likes turn-based games. There are some gameplay elements which were somewhat counter-intuitive at first, but it's easy to get over that hurdle. (Or you can even modify them, thanks to the impressively customizable difficulty levels.) All in all, this game has excellent design, be it gameplay or graphics.Really, the only negative thing I could say is that it'd be good if your agents had voice acting as well, even if they only ever say a few lines. But the characters who are voiced have good VAs.All in all, this game is not very expensive, so if you're curious about it, you probably should give it a try.			"

												Very cool game here. It reminds me of chess, in that it is really about player positioning and movement. The RNG is real also in this game and find some missions impossible to beat and others a breeze.  A little bit of luck can help but its not needed to beat this game, RNG will not ruin the game for you. If you got the cash full price is still a good value for this game.			"

												This game is extremely difficult at times, which makes it all the more rewarding. Klei Entertainment has done it again. This is an XCOM-esque strategy stealth game with a cyberpunk twist. I feel it is well worth your time. The procedural generation aspect as well as the custom difficulty settings add infinite replay value, as well.			"

												A great tactical turn-based stealth game.Invisible Inc is kind of like XCOM, if XCOM was based around stealth and not combat. You start the game by selecting 2 agents and then you have 72 hours to prepare for the final mission. You see a map where you can choose the type of mission you want, for example, if you want cybernetics, credits, items e.t.c. Each mission takes a different amount of time depending on how far away it is, but there's a max cap of 12 hours. For each day that passes all the missions gets harder.If you die, or win, you will get points and unlock new agents and softwares. Note that each agent has its own backstory, skills and starting equipment.Anyway, once you start a mission, a level is randomly generated. Therefore you need to explore carefully since you don't know where everything is. Normally you're looking for the exit and the objective. This while evading guards, robots, cameras and other fun stuff. There are also objects you can interact with throughout the level, such as safes that contain money, consoles you can hack for power, a resource used by your AI, Nano-fabricatos which are basically shops where you can buy stuff and other things.Each turn you spend in a level increase the alarm meter by 1, for every 5 the alarm level goes up by 1 to a maximum of 6. It can also go up from other thing such as you're spotted by a camera or guard or you kill a guard without disabling his heart monitor. For every alarm level something bad happens. A new guard might spawn, firewalls get stronger, they detect one of your agents. None of these are random though, you know what will happen before hand. In fact, there is very little RNG in terms of game mechanics. For example if you attack a enemy you will always succeed, there is no random factor involved. This makes the game very tactical and less based on luck which is a good thing.Unlike other stealth games Invisible Inc has a big focus on staying undetected, by that I mean you don't even want to knock out a guard. Because when he wakes up he is not going to return to his patrol, moving from A to B and B to A, instead he is going to actively search for you in the entire level.I should also mention the game has several different difficulty modes and also a custom mode where you can select anything from the amount of rooms in a level to disabling the alarm meter going up by itself every turn. There's also a endless mode that doesn't have a 72 hour time-limit and a final mission.As for the game length it has taken me about 18 hours to beat the game on Beginner, Experienced and Expert Ironman. But I didn't lose once for those playthroughs so you should take that into account as well. Don't expect to rush through it like I did, the game is not easy and I had a lot of practice with old-school Roguelikes. Even if I've beaten it thrice I still continue to play it, this time with the endless mode and 2 agents I haven't tried yet.The game is really meant to be played over and over.The final verdict is a 5/5. That does not mean it is perfect, no game is perfect, but it doesn't have any glaring flaws and the mechanics is well thought out. Get this if you enjoy turn-based tactical games and you like analyzing/thinking.			"

												Very rewarding turn-based stealth strategy game. I'm a huge fan of XCOM-like games and roguelikes like FTL, and this game makes me feel like I'm playing both of those games at once! Invisible Inc. borrows heavily from the mission component of XCOM, as opposed to the base-building strategic layer; it borrows a few key concepts from roguelikes like FTL, and adds a stealth element that I don't recognize from other strategy games. The result is an absorbing game that scratches an itch I never knew I had, and there's enough replay value here to keep me playing for a good long while.I bought this game while it was in Early Access, and I'm glad to say that investment paid off. When I bought it, it was a great game and well worth the asking price, and it has only gotten better since then.Congrats to Klei on an excellent game!			"

												Do you like roguelike games? Do you like stealth games where getting into combat is not advisable?If you answered yes to these, then this game will be for you.To sum it up, you have to manage 2 people (to start) who are very good at hiding behind small objects against guards that have the attention span of an egg timer.Combat is simple as there is no accuracy at all. You either put the the enemy to sleep, or kill them. So your rewind turn won't be wasted on accuracy checks. Also a great function is the ""pin"", where you can keep an enemy asleep as long as you hold him down.As you go through each randomly generated area, you have a hacking ability to take over electronics around the building using a limited power source. The enemy has their own viruses called Daemons that will infect you to provide random debuffs as you go.As you progress into the game, you unlock new agents to play as, and new starting hacking abilities to change out.The game has a few minor flaws, such as you will be able to easily tell which items and abilities are ridiculously useful and the ones that are so specific, they fall under: ""Why is this even in the game?""Another flaw is that without the DLC, the difficulty on Endless may get too easy once you get good at the game.With the DLC, I haven't tried Endless yet. But I'm hopeful that it'll turn out good.If you aren't going for achievements, the game can be played as ruthless, or casual to fit your playstyle. They have all the basic customizable game settings unlocked by default. So if you want to cruise through the game or go ridiculously hard, it's up to you.Just got the DLC, and very impressed by the new side quests that were added in to accumulate a new arsenal of tactics.If you still are curious, google ""Totalbiscuit Invisible Inc"" - Watching his overview sold me to the game.

I'm not sure what's missing however and can't wait to find out. With Don't Starve, Don't Starve Together and now Invisible, Inc. I've become a Klei fan. The Linux support is greatly appreciated.I've had a chance to play what will be the release version of the game. It has plenty of polish, is more challenging, adds new characters, additional game configuration options, voice over and plenty more. A much improved game. Plenty of fun.

												A good, wit-testing game! Even though an individual campaign lasts up to two or three hours, Invisible, Inc maintains extremely high replayability with procedurally generated levels and well as different starting characters and equipment that significantly changes the way the game is play, much like FTL: Faster than Light.For those who don't feel like they're chess grandmasters, that's okay! Before starting a campaign the game allows you to customize many, many different options, all of which can significantly change the difficulty of the game. Feel the game is too hard? You could give yourself a boost in starting cash, or perhaps guards get knocked out one turn longer. Feel the game is too easy? Add more guards to each level. Invisible, Inc has something that can accomodate gamers of all degrees of tactical skill.Worth the purchase, even at full price.			"

The guards are not OP when looking for you and hiding behind there view is really well done. The hacking is great, most the time the power points are easy to find and there are lots of things to hack but I have been on a couple of levels that have too much things to hack and points are hard to come across but as I said most of the time it's fair. I one of the things that annoyed me was that the story of the game was very short. I played though about 5 or 6 levels and it ended. The ending of the story was good and it could be carried on easily by (spoilers) fighting back against the A.I that takes over in the end and started to destroy place all over the world. The game could have easily carried on and been a much bigger and better but other than the short ending and the power points at times being unfair, it's a fantastic game and it's worth playing.

												Charming game. Invisible, Inc. is like X-COM's little brother in terms of presentation (pick a set of agents, go do missions, move in a grid in a turn-based system), but it also reminds me of FTL in how well put-together the risk v. reward gameplay is set up. The more you stick around to crack every last safe / get every last credit, the tougher the environment becomes. If you like either of these games, Invisible, Inc. is a must-buy.While the core and best part of the game is its gameplay, its production values are also top-notch—not that I would expect any less from the devs of Mark of the Ninja. It has very stylised, very slick artwork and a smart choice of decoration that makes you feel like you're in a technobureaucratic society. It even has very well-animated cinematics that are great at setting the mood of the game.One last thing I love? I love how each agent has a personality and shtick of his or her own. It makes you want to take care of them and make sure you can evac them out of a mission. Wish that X-COM: Enemy Unknown had had this.			"

												Alright. I bought this game in early Access. Played it for a good 20 minutes and then put it down until today. I found out it had fully released, and after seeing a youtuber play some of it I wanted to play. Honestly, had a really fun time with it. It's a really cool game, with very interesting concepts. You control your Agents and a hacking system. You use your agents to retrieve different things and complete objectives inside facilities. The hacking system allows you to take control of cameras, disable power grids, and all sorts of stuff. There are many ways to go about beating these levels, since there are lethal and non-lethal weapons. Honestly if you like the rouge-like genre, buy it. I would recommend it. When have I steered you wrong. Really? THAT many times? I don't believe it. Oh... we don't mention that time. Regardless, I'd recommend it if you ever liked playing FTL or a similar game. It is top down perspective so it's more similar to FTL than it is to Rouge Legacy. I have nothing else to say. What else is new.			"

There is a lot to like about this title. I appreciate the fact that it's a game meant for replayability. Sometimes I prefer a game that doesn't drag on, I have plenty of 50+ hour slogs in my library and this is a refreshing change of pace.The tactical, turn based system reminds me of X-Com and the newer Shadow Run games, which are both great in their own right. This game is more about stealth and careful planning. It's even a bit like a rougelike in that the missions and map layouts will be randomized each time you play, and it's possible to fail but still keep some sort of progress if things to go hell.

												Long story short, Invisible, Inc is one of the best games I've ever played. It's absolutely one of the best games available on Steam.This game has it all. The way all the mechanics work together flow seamlessly with the aesthetics and theme of the game. Every single mission you you play ends up very tense, requiring a lot of thinking on each turn to get your agents out alive. They say games are a series of interesting decisions, and Invisible, Inc does nothing but present you with interesting decisions. There's no one way to definitively solve any problem. Randomness is never an issue. There are no dice rolls. Any and all mistakes are caused by your own lack of judgement. I've never seen such a fine game balance implemented, except for possibly 868-HACK.On top of all that, the art and music are beyond fantastic.Klei deserves a tremendous amount of respect for this.

												This game really sticks to it's cyberpunk theme. The stealth makes sense and requires very little unrealistic ""game logic"". It has a wide array of difficulty customization options; so anything you don't like you can change (i.e., turn off frustration). Avoiding detection is methodical and planned. Careful movement is rewarded; run-and-gun is heavily punished. The UI is clean and responsive. It has a very high replay value, and I find myself getting the itch to play a round here and there.

								If you enjoy turn based strategy games, then this might be of interest to you. This takes the idea of tactical, turnbased RPG and adds the element of stealth. There are great inventory options including weapons, gadgets and character augments. The Incognita feature is awesome. Hacking, unlocking, and turning electronics on their owners is a very fun feature. It is in early access now but it still fun to play through a few times.			"

												Invisible Inc. is an isometric, turn-based, rogue-like, stealth game placed in a futuristic world controlled by 4 main corporations (corps). You work as an operator for a corporate espionage company called Invisible Inc. The game starts off with your HQ compromised and your operatives MIA, KIA or worse; in a corporate deprogramming chamber. You are outnumbered, outgunned, on the run and have only 72 hours to launch a counter-attack.You start the game with 2 operatives and Incognita, an AI capable of hacking corporate firewalls and teleporting your operatives into the enemy complex. During your missions you attempt to steal credits, gadgets, and implants for your operatives to use, for Incognita new programs can be downloaded from certain terminals. Occasionally you get the opportunity to rescue one of your operatives who were captured during the raid on HQ. These additions to your team and equipment will prove to be very useful for completing the more difficult missions.The game gradually increases its difficulty by raising alarm levels during your missions, which activate more and more security measures, and globally (on the map view in between missions) as the security levels increase each 24 hours. These security levels indicate the amount of resistance you encounter while infiltrating the corps, this is also where the 4 corps differ from each other. Some corps specialize in security drones or armored personnel; preventing your operatives from taking them down, if they don't have the right equipment. Other corps specialize in tougher firewalls or Daemons, special programs which generally cause bad things to happen when hacked by Incognita. This really helps in giving character to the corps and makes you consider your loadout before choosing your missions.During the missions the key to staying alive is staying out of sight, carefully observing enemy patrol routes and using blind spots to your advantage. As the enemies you will be facing are relentless; they will hunt you down and shoot on sight, so evasion is the key here. However the real fun (and difficulty) starts once you have been detected and you have to think quick to either eliminate the threat or to extract your operatives, sometimes without being able achieve the mission objective.As you play through the game, more operatives and programs for Incognita will unlock for you to use in your next playthrough. This is a nice feature, which allows you to mix up your tactics, as the operatives are all unique in their personal starting traits. These rogue-like elements help to make the (somewhat short) campaign highly replayable. The 5 extra game modes are also a lot of fun for the more seasoned players.All in all, this game does an awesome job of delivering that ""danger around every corner"" feeling. So stay on your toes and peek around those corners to achieve your objectives and keep your people alive!I can recommend Invisible Inc. to anyone who loves stealth games and tactical turn-based games. Though for some people the rogue-like and RNG elements may be off putting, for me it adds to the replay value and challenge of the game.			"

												Great tactical stealth game, quite unique as a result. Knocking out enemies is often not the best option, instead sneaking by them can be more advantageous. The game really requires thinking due to the high difficultyNo real save options are available (apart from on exit), you actually have to live with the consequences of your actions and adjust your tactics accordingly...or simply lose as a result and start over, albeit with new unlocked agents and hacking programs!Highly recommended if you're the tactical thinking sort of person and don't mind mild frustration.

												This is a very good game, kind of a combination of ""Covert Action"" (if you're old enough to remember that game) and ""Syndicate"". The game has good balance and looks great, the developers did a nice job of creating an interesting game with a unique style and the procedurally generated building floors make the game interesting and replayable. Usually, I have many complaints about PC games because they often have major bugs or extremely bad AI's or are missing major components, but my only complaint about this game is that it's too short and limited in scope - I would like more of this game, which is an unusual request coming from me. Plan on maybe 30 hours of original gameplay before you finish and then replay the game. At it's current price ($20) I think it's a good deal since it's quite a fun game.			"

								Finally - the game every aspiring secret agent wanted to play when they were younger. You will easily feel the suspense and tension that this game creates. Almost every decision you make has an immediate consequence, and they've struck a careful balance between limiting your choices each turn and giving you plenty of options. There are some things they could do to improve the on-boarding process for new players; for instance, I'm still not sure what each of the mission types actually are and how they are distinct from each other, but that's hardly a deal-breaker.

												You'll need great tactics and sneaking to make it through each random generated level and find the objective, then make it out in one piece.  From early on in development, the game has grown into the clean smooth experience it is today.  The devs used all the players feedback and you could tell they were hard at work to get it to this point.  This will go down as one of the greats in turn based tactics games.  Pretty much forever replayable since no two missions will be the same.  There is also a customization at the beginning of each new game to set all the tons of parameters to make the game how you want it.  Don't want the auto increasing alarm, want lots of starting money, and on and on.  All your choice. "

												I'm not quite through the (very short) campaign yet, but I already feel like I've got my money's worth with this game.Before I go, I do have one disclaimer: The game is very short. This is closer to FTL than XCOM, and you're obviously supposed to re-play with different starting agents and difficulty levels if you want to get a lot of the time out of the game. I actually like that, as these days I just don't have the time to sink 40+ hours into any game that isn't Kerbal Space Program, but if you've got more time than money, this might not be your game.On the other hand, hour-by-hour this is a wonderful exerience. The mechanics are very simple and easy to grasp, but create a lot of strategic depth. A lot of other people are talking about those aspects, though, so I want to devote some time to the save mechanics. Rather than have either a traditional unlimited save system (which would lead to save-scumming, in a game like this) or having no saves (which would lead to either frustration or cheating and backing up the save file), you get a very limited number of one-turn ""rewinds"" per mission. These are enough to soften the learning curve and keep you out of game-ending screw ups, but not so wild that they feel cheat-y; the rewinds feel like part of the game, so I don't feel guilty about using them.

The hacking is great, most the time the power points are easy to find and there are lots of things to hack but I have been on a couple of levels that have too much things to hack and points are hard to come across but as I said most of the time it's fair. I one of the things that annoyed me was that the story of the game was very short. I played though about 5 or 6 levels and it ended. The ending of the story was good and it could be carried on easily by (spoilers) fighting back against the A.I that takes over in the end and started to destroy place all over the world. The game could have easily carried on and been a much bigger and better but other than the short ending and the power points at times being unfair, it's a fantastic game and it's worth playing.

												Charming game. Invisible, Inc. is like X-COM's little brother in terms of presentation (pick a set of agents, go do missions, move in a grid in a turn-based system), but it also reminds me of FTL in how well put-together the risk v. reward gameplay is set up. The more you stick around to crack every last safe / get every last credit, the tougher the environment becomes. If you like either of these games, Invisible, Inc. is a must-buy.While the core and best part of the game is its gameplay, its production values are also top-notch—not that I would expect any less from the devs of Mark of the Ninja. It has very stylised, very slick artwork and a smart choice of decoration that makes you feel like you're in a technobureaucratic society. It even has very well-animated cinematics that are great at setting the mood of the game.One last thing I love? I love how each agent has a personality and shtick of his or her own. It makes you want to take care of them and make sure you can evac them out of a mission. Wish that X-COM: Enemy Unknown had had this.			"

I found out it had fully released, and after seeing a youtuber play some of it I wanted to play. Honestly, had a really fun time with it. It's a really cool game, with very interesting concepts. You control your Agents and a hacking system. You use your agents to retrieve different things and complete objectives inside facilities. The hacking system allows you to take control of cameras, disable power grids, and all sorts of stuff. There are many ways to go about beating these levels, since there are lethal and non-lethal weapons. Honestly if you like the rouge-like genre, buy it. I would recommend it. When have I steered you wrong. Really? THAT many times? I don't believe it. Oh... we don't mention that time. Regardless, I'd recommend it if you ever liked playing FTL or a similar game. It is top down perspective so it's more similar to FTL than it is to Rouge Legacy. I have nothing else to say. What else is new.			"

Sometimes I prefer a game that doesn't drag on, I have plenty of 50+ hour slogs in my library and this is a refreshing change of pace.The tactical, turn based system reminds me of X-Com and the newer Shadow Run games, which are both great in their own right. This game is more about stealth and careful planning. It's even a bit like a rougelike in that the missions and map layouts will be randomized each time you play, and it's possible to fail but still keep some sort of progress if things to go hell.

												Back in the late 90s I loved a game called Shadow Watch. It felt like Mission Impossible, X-Com, with some RPG leveling elements. It had great music, intriguing characters, and even dialog choices in a decent overall plot. Sadly, it was not marketed well and suffered from an infuriating bug toward the end of the game that made it nearly impossible to finish due to a repeatable crash. Probably because of lack of interest, the support just wasn't there, and it wasn't long before you couldn't play the game at all unless you put together a VM with the exact version of Java and the patch that sometimes fixed the bug.Anyway, I hoped Invisible Inc. was going to be like Shadow Watch, and I am not disappointed. This is exactly what I was hoping for--Shadow Watch updated and improved. I did not expect the Shadowrun-ish cyberpunk storyline, but as a fan of SR, that's all the better.It does feel a bit short, even with the FTL-like repetition and deep mechanics, but it is still worth the $15+. I look forward to mods and DLC. I snatched this game the moment I saw it was available for Linux, and it plays perfectly on my Arch machine.			"

New equipment inbetween stages is scarce, so you have to make use of the ""nano fabricators"" inside the missions to gear up. This is not only much more intense, it also opens up new strategies on-the-fly. More than once you'll find yourself in a hopeless situation only to install a new program for ""Incognita"" (the A.I. that helps you break firewalls) that will bust you out.Absolutely recommended for anyone remotely interested in stylish, stealthy tacticts.

								Finally - the game every aspiring secret agent wanted to play when they were younger. You will easily feel the suspense and tension that this game creates. Almost every decision you make has an immediate consequence, and they've struck a careful balance between limiting your choices each turn and giving you plenty of options. There are some things they could do to improve the on-boarding process for new players; for instance, I'm still not sure what each of the mission types actually are and how they are distinct from each other, but that's hardly a deal-breaker.

												You'll need great tactics and sneaking to make it through each random generated level and find the objective, then make it out in one piece.  From early on in development, the game has grown into the clean smooth experience it is today.  The devs used all the players feedback and you could tell they were hard at work to get it to this point.  This will go down as one of the greats in turn based tactics games.  Pretty much forever replayable since no two missions will be the same.  There is also a customization at the beginning of each new game to set all the tons of parameters to make the game how you want it.  Don't want the auto increasing alarm, want lots of starting money, and on and on.  All your choice. "

								Incredibly adictive, clockwork precision, even in this early access stage. Beautifull art and general design. This is a brilliant game; if you like turn base strategy and stealth mechanics in a rogue like frame, this is the game for you. And if you don't like any of the things I just mentioned, try it anyway because it will probably be the game that's gonna change your mind ;)			"

												When I first heard about this game I thought, ""Procedural, Turn-based, Stealth... How could that possibly work?"" I like all of those things, but together? Turns out, it does work, and work brilliantly at that. I've been playing this throughout early access, which Klei did right. I almost never buy Early Access games, but this game was stable, playable, and fun the entire way through. I've only just started the release version, and I can't wait to see everything new and awesome they've added.			"

I find that I lose usually because of my own mistakes and not because of RNG which is a real plus. Another great thing about this game is the number of options they've chosen to include. You can really customize the campaign to your preferred playstyle. Lastly, there is an endless mode, which I have no tried yet, but looks like it will add significantly to the replay value.			"

												I'm not quite through the (very short) campaign yet, but I already feel like I've got my money's worth with this game.Before I go, I do have one disclaimer: The game is very short. This is closer to FTL than XCOM, and you're obviously supposed to re-play with different starting agents and difficulty levels if you want to get a lot of the time out of the game. I actually like that, as these days I just don't have the time to sink 40+ hours into any game that isn't Kerbal Space Program, but if you've got more time than money, this might not be your game.On the other hand, hour-by-hour this is a wonderful exerience. The mechanics are very simple and easy to grasp, but create a lot of strategic depth. A lot of other people are talking about those aspects, though, so I want to devote some time to the save mechanics. Rather than have either a traditional unlimited save system (which would lead to save-scumming, in a game like this) or having no saves (which would lead to either frustration or cheating and backing up the save file), you get a very limited number of one-turn ""rewinds"" per mission. These are enough to soften the learning curve and keep you out of game-ending screw ups, but not so wild that they feel cheat-y; the rewinds feel like part of the game, so I don't feel guilty about using them.

												Klei puts out incredible games, no matter the genre, and Invisible, Inc. is no exception.It's a rogue-like turn-based stealth game, where you maneuver your team of agents through randomly generated floors, hacking things, peeking around corners, taking out guards, stealing stuff, etc. A campaign only takes a few hours, unless you play endless mode, but there is lots of replayability and it is very much meant to be replayed over and over since you unlock new agents and programs after each playthrough (with an exp-system like in Don't Starve).Great game, can't recommend enough, need to play more now.

												A tech noir spy thriller that plays homage to several sci-fi staples, Invisible Inc. is fun but I found it punishingly hard even on lower difficulty levels. I understand the randomness and difficulty is part of the game's appeal and a selling point but it felt terribly unfair quite often. Even tweaking the difficulty levels (the game provides a robust system to customize things to your liking), you often paint yourself into a corner and it can be unavoidable not to do so.This is due to the random level design, camera placement, item availability, and guard patrol patterns. You can run into a level that has a guard with armor and you never came across armor piercing weapons prior to this level - you're sunk. Yes, you have a rewind feature (a necessary addition to all but the most hard core players) and the option to replay a new randomly generated level if the one you started is just ridiculous. I dislike that player skill can become a negligible factor in your ability to finish a level depending on level layout and what items you managed to find.The randomness is, thus, both a big positive and a big negative. Same with the difficulty factor. It raises sharply for each facility you infiltrate. This keeps you on your toes and you always feel the odds stacked against you. And this often leads to yelling profanity at your monitor.I like the game but all of its strengths are also its weaknesses. The developers did a good job of balancing things, but the randomness can be a killer. Technically, the game is stable, I've never had any bugs or issues while playing. Invisible Inc. is entertaining but it can be annoying for the reasons stated above.			"

								Updating this review after early access. The game works, and good lord, does it work. Short version: If you are a fan of stealth games, exterior strategy games, brutally hard games, or even chess, you owe it to yourself to buy this.Long version: The release update version of the game was pushed, and my goodness, the game essentially remade itself. With new agents, new programs, and even some new mechanics, and the removal of those god-awful RNG events (or was there? A new program combination [Faust or Brimstone, or even just Faust if you're a masochist] lets you risk them, although in a less picky-choosie method], the game is incredibly fun. The initial story mode is easy enough, but each level afterwards gets more difficult, especially if you try and run the aforementioned combination. Each agent and their variants has something special about them that makes the game feel very fun, and the experience to unlock system is fun and tantalizing, encouraging you to actually finish your games instead of RQing when you're trapped. The rewind system means that basic errors you make are easily undone, although you get less of these the higher difficulty you are on. While the sudden spawning of the final mission may cut some gameplay sessions short right when you're just getting competent, an endless mode IS there to play, as well as endless plus for the true heroes.Story wise, eh. It has an incredible setup, and very diverse exposition and characterization, but the final ending is incredibly lackluster, and unfortunately, always the same. In addition, the ending is borderline sequelbaiting, which is something I never appreciate in a game.Overall, this is a serious contender for Game of the Year. Story fans may be a little dissapointed, but  the gameplay is solid, addicitng, and fun. Roguelike elements add a stress to the player without endangering the joy of victory. Overall, I rate the game 9.5/10			"

Usually, I have many complaints about PC games because they often have major bugs or extremely bad AI's or are missing major components, but my only complaint about this game is that it's too short and limited in scope - I would like more of this game, which is an unusual request coming from me.

												I'm not usually one for turn-based gameplay, but there's just something about the way it's handled in Invisible, Inc. that makes it incredibly fun to play. I enjoyed upgrading my agents, infiltrating facilities to make sure they had what they needed, and stressing out over the five armed guards in the next room. If you're into stealth and/or strategy games with whimsical party banter, then definitely give this a shot. The story is sadly short and linear, but the gameplay and character line-up more than makes up for it. You're given enough detail to get a taste of the high-tech world in which the story takes place, though it is regretably just a taste. You're also given a choice between an even amount of male and female characters, and it's a diverse choice of characters. So kudos to Klei.			"

												While being in the excedingly niche turn-based xcom-like stealth game genre, the game provides an amazing tile based stealth system.  Set in a future where Corperations spend an insane amount of money on security and on infiltrating eachother, your organization is on the run after a raid on your HQ as you learn that your group spent the least on security.  And now your group is on the run and it begins the game with only 2 agents against all the mega corps of the world.  The flow of the game itself is even xcom like with a world/planning screen where you choose missions and equipment and a tactical screen  where you execute the missions.  The design of both layers are very tight and usually when you've got a tough choice, it's usually between 2 or 3 choices rather than a complex web of things to consider and every choice feels very powerful when it works out.  Nothing feels too marginal and everything has it's use which is nessecary for a good procedurally generated game.  And building a good team adds another bit of suspense when you start to put your agents in more and more danger with the risk of any of them getting captured.  It only takes 1 shot to take out any of your characters and every 5 turns the difficulty increases in some way as the corp security close in as you run out of places to hide.  The one major gripe I can find is that the game can get pretty visually cluttered at times and can be hard to descifer whats happening and what to do if there are a lot of entities and walls/corners in a small space.Even though the RNG can get pretty brutal especially with some with mission rewards, never had any procedurally genn-ed game give such E M O T I O N S.   Lots of variety and its really good looking to boot and in a setting that I personally love.  An auto reccomend if you like netrunner, a lot of similarities in theme and in progression since the corps get stronger as time goes on making your 'runs' harder to pull off.			"

												Klei delivers another quality game. One of their strengths is that they make you immersed in the theme of the game. They made you feel like a badass ninja in MoTN and here you feel like a mastermind in the craft of espionage in this roguelike turn-based strategy game.Both games share another trait: Despite there being an emphasis on evasion rather than confrontation, the game gives you the choice to go for a confrontational playstyle without it being too difficult to achieve. This playstyle does have a ""skill barrier"" due to the fact that the lethal gear costs a healthy number of credits to obtain and killing guards raises alarm levels by a considerate amount. However, the option is there and that is what's important.The amount of choice you are given from the get-go is lovely. With a roster of 8 different agents (6 of whom have alternate ""archive"" playstyle) with their own unique passives and gear, you can select two of them to start out your missions. There are many little synergies between them, and even on their own they bring hefty benefits to the table. The ability to attack twice in one turn is great for clearing out tough situations, revealing electronic devices behind walls and being able to unlock keycard doors without need said card key are all strong by themselves both early and late game.You are given the ability to take over the enemy's electronic devices with use of Incognita, your intelligent SHODAN-esque AI. Visiting server farm locations to upgrade her is a must, the later missions' electronics require stronger hacking tools to take down quickly. The resource system for hacking is PWR, which is generated via the chosen generation tool at the start of the run and also be lifted in small amounts from enemy consoles within a building. Using hacking programmes costs PWR, and you have a variety of tools for the job. Managing PWR is extremely important late game due to the stronger firewalls and the cap on max available PWR, but it is well balanced. I only ever ran out of power due to my own poor choices.There are different types of missions which hold their own loot for the taking. You can choose missions from a world map which displays the time it will take to fly to that location, mission type, the corporate name and the security level. You need to choose your missions with care. Are you in desperate need of credits? Visit a Vault. Need some advanced gear? Go to a Security Dispatch. Got plenty of credits to spare? Nanofab Vestibule contains stronger items available for purchase. Hacking feeling lacking? Incognita would benefit with tools from a Server Farm. There are additional mission types but you get the idea.Missions themselves are simple at first glance. You avoid guard patrols and cameras, gain access to the mission loot while stealing whatever you can then you find the teleporter and get out before the security level rises so high it becomes impossible to deal with. You can hide behind furniture and machines for cover which allows for sneaking past guards, or you can sneak up behind them and knock them out for two or three turns. I've had amazing fun with this game through Early Access and I hope it has huge success on full release. It's an amazingly designed game that Klei have put their love into, providing a bar which other Early Access developers should strive to come up to.			"

												There are very few stealth games that are actually done properly and worth playing. Invisible, Inc is one of them. The game successfully combines rogue-like elements, such as randomized levels and perma-death, with the gameplay of a turn-based strategy, which results in a great experience. The campaign (although slightly short) and art style give the game a great atmosphere, while the varying difficulties, potential for themed runs, and randomized levels give plenty of replayability. Sticking with the atmosphere, the voice acting is well-done, and the soundtrack gives a good background to the game, which also seems to react based on whether you've been spotted / security level etc.Overall, this is an incredibly slick game that I can't recommend enough. Props to Klei for making something so polished.			"

												If you like XCOM, you'll probably like Invisible Inc. It's fun, it's challenging, and it's polished.Pros: Intuitive gameplay, neat style ,good music, Cons:  Honestly, I'm not sure I can really think of any cons. I guess I wish the story varied a little bit on different playthroughs. Incognitas voice got annoying. I wish there was a ""fast forward"" button during enemy moves to allow for super-fast gameplay. Most these cons are unrelated to gameplay and mostly inconsequential.Great game.4.5/5			"

												I’m not good at writing reviews so this is more of a personal opinion of the game that I feel I have to share with you if you are still undecided whether to buy or not to buy.Invisible, Inc. is simply an amazing game. While it was still in early access I purchased it but only after I thought it through for a long time. So when I finally did the deed and started playing I started to doubt my decision. The result was that I did not spend much time playing this game at all.And now it is finally released from EA and I have played only 9 hours according to Steam. And it is truly an enjoyable 4 hours. This game is very addictive to play. At first it might seem difficult to play but it really is not. As soon as the game mechanics is grasped the game starts to flow. It can be challenging but not in the extreme. O and there is a handy rewind button for mistakes you make. Although limited it is very handy. The movement of the characters are unique and sort of funny. At first the walls in the game was a bit of an obstacle when moving the characters but with a press of the ALT key they disappear for a better overall view. And if you’re put off by the graphics, don’t be. The graphics, fun characters, upgrade system and easy to grasp turn-based gameplay all adds up to the overall character of the game and a very enjoyable experience.I will without a doubt recommend this game. I’m sure you will not regret it. This is a Klei Entertainment masterpiece. I love it.So this review is taking up valuable game time so I'm done. Its invisible time now. Cheers and happy gaming.			"

												First of all Invisible inc is a really good game, and could with some higher funds and more love been something truly great. It is a really good strategic game, that borrow a a lot of it´s game play from X-Com, I don´t mind that. And at a start it is really hard, and makes you think two and three times, but I do lack some thing extra to lift it in the genre. As it is now it´s is really fun, but the campaign is really short took me about 2 hours to finish it from start to goal, and then I took my good time with it, to really try to do everything on most lvls. But hopefully the creators get some new materials in quickly and prolong the campaign (which the end invites too at current date). Would mainly wanna see some more interaction and stuff to do while off mission, maybe in the case of more moral choices that will effect the game play and so on. But it´s kind of cheap, got potential and most important have a good game concept that just need that little more extra to become great.			"

												This futuristic strategy/stealth really blows you away with how much detail that went into it. They have polished everything nicely, and the cut scenes are incredible. It looks like a proper cartoon and not like a actual cut scene from a regular game. The style of the characters and the backgrounds is incredible, and it suits the game well. Another fact that I liked about the game is that the levels, even in the campaign are randomly generated, so every run you go through, it won't be the same as the last. One thing this game could use is a online multi-player campaign mode. Klei have really pulled this game through and have made this game shine in the spotlight. If you're looking for a game that makes you work hard for a victory and not just by force, you'll love this game. I'm giving this game 4.5 out of 5.			"

												After initially struggling to enjoy this game I'm beginning to like it.Unfortunately the game doesn't make it easy to enjoy. As is standard now, there is no documentation, I guess it takes too much effort for indie developers to let you know how their game works. There is a tutorial which is almost useless and a help screen which is also of little help.For the first few hours of play when I made a mistake it was usually because I didn't understand the rules. I prefer games where the challenge lies in finding creative ways to beat the AI using rules that are explained to you. Now that I have struggled to learn the rules I quite enjoy the game.			"

												If Dark Souls was a stealth simulator, this would be it. 10/10Anyway, here's the REAL review:(Please note, this review has some elements prior to 2015 and the most recent update. This was originally an EARLY ACCESS REVIEW.)Gameplay:+Solid! Imagine X-Com mixed with a focus on stealth and espionage.+Lots of replayability.+The ""hacking"" elements are great.+Stealth/Detection is well designed.+The difficulty goes up as your time ♥♥♥♥ing around goes up.-Generic guards.-Missions are repetitive.Story/Quests:+Nothing too special. You're a spy, stop a corporation.+Story will most likely improve.+Backgrounds and the ""Archive"" sets of characters are interesting.-Not a lot of corporation names. (Or so I believe.)-It's a bit lackluster, lacking a proper ending. (PRE-FINAL RELEASE)Sound/Music:+Sound plays into detection, making stealth realistic, challenging, and fun.+-Sound is okay.+-Music is okay. Dystopian/Futuraish/Drama themes.-Some guns sound a bit, ehh.Overall, I loved my short time with Invisible Inc, and I hope I will replay it when it creeps out of early access. Klei is a wonderful developer, and I'm honored to support such a project.9/10			"

Early Access Review
								Invisible, Inc., as a round-based-game is very well done. It has a thick atmosphere, and nice, always new levels, and a well balanced skill-tree. The presentation is technical, and fits very well. If you play heavily guarded levels, you will also experience some nice RPG-reminiscents, like the floating guardian. Reminds me of Eye of the Beholder.So, what is the problem? IF you get to later levels, the guards heavily outnumber your team. It's not 2:1 or 3:1, that could be handable. But in the latest level, I played, I was outnumbered by at least 4:1, and of the guards woke up after one round already - he guarded the CEO of the company to hack. Dealing with a 3 turn cooldown on your main weapon, you are - let's say - always dead. This said, even in easy mode, which i was playing for about 12 hours now, the game always ended after 5 missions. Interestingly, by doing maps randomly, frustration about this is not as high, as expected, as you need to improvise.I know, it's supposed to be a hardcore stealth game, but the difficulty is much to high, even after playing about 30 easy missions, in said 12 hours. However, I'd recommend this game to lovers of round-based, agent, difficult missions.			"

												This game gets me so ♥♥♥♥ing salty sometimes.It's good for a $20 game. Difficult, with levels being generated on the fly. Sometimes you get a good map where guards are humping walls like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or you get a map with guards that patrol into your spawn first turn. Movement is like XCOM, square tile based with a finite amount of tiles or actions you can do per character per turn. Combat is whoever shoots first assuming your weapon is powerful enough to overpower their armour rating, and you will always get a turn to react to the AI should you be spotted, unless it's on the last move of your turn, then that's your own fault.There's a ton of options to customize your campaign with, but the default settings has an alarm meter that auto increments every turn, this gives you a risk of rain type of scaling difficulty where the longer you stay on a level to collect bonus loot, the more difficult it will be to survive. I like having this on as it make's the game truly tense.So what do you do in the game? Well you pick a mission from the world map and you fly there. The distance traveled will drain your ""time to live"" which is a countdown to the final mission. You need to pick missions based on their distance in relation to you and each other, as well as the their mission reward being what you could use to improve your team for the final mission. This creates a system where you need to pick between quantity or quality of missions.Every mission you will be beamed onto a randomly generated map. All maps consist of a series of connected rooms, doors, cover and interactables (including enemies). The specifics vary but most missions are drop in, find objective, find exit, escape. You will want to explore the rooms quickly, as the alarm timer increases and activate defences for each 5 point increment. This means you need to get the most out of every movement point to explore the level quickly. You'll ideally also find safes to loot and shops to spend money at while you are in the level. This is important as you can't aquire items  outside of these levels, apart from the 1 or 2 you can get from monster over the course of the campaign.So balancing with this need for speed is the safety of stealth. When the level is fresh, you aren't being actively hunted. If you knock out or are seen by guard, he will go into hunt mode. He will now run around unpredictably, searching for you. They can still be avoided, but you can't see them all the time (unless you have the great pleasure of finding a TAG pistol). This isn't so bad until there's multiple guards running around like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. And if they see you, you have to break line of sight or you will be shot. Which takes up precious movement points and even turns that could be used for something useful like finding the exit. So stirring the bees nest isn't too great unless you pick a team that can fight well.I get asked what you do in this game a lot so I thought I'd just write up my understanding. I could continue typing but I'm lazy.tl;dr Turn-based stealth strategy mishmash which combines time pressure and exploration to make a tense and difficult game. Pretty good for it's price though I think the game is kind of lacking in equipment options. "

												Invisible Inc. is a turn based game with a ton of flavour, ideas and innovation. Gameplay revolves around sneaking through a base while hacking cameras, diabling guards, hacking safes and reaching (or ignoring) the mission objective.You'll have a team of up to 4 people who have skills of differing usefulness. Multiple playthroughs can be done with different teams, different approaches and different hacking equipment.This is one of the few games that makes you explore every nook and cranny, because it's so unique and versatile. I played it on nearly every difficulty level, beating the game multiple times, and I very highly recommend it.			"

												Definitely one of my favorite games! It's challenging, has an intruiging plot, and offers a wide variety of characters and items that are all unique and create a different game experience for the player. I just finished my first playthrough on Beginner mode and with 99 rewinds because I'm just that bad, but for my second I'm giving myself less slack.It's certainly a very difficult game, so keep this in mind when you purchase it. It's meant to be hard, and it is; at times it can even get quite ridiculously so, but it only adds to the challenge of mastering the game. For those complaining about the difficulty, this is obviously not their type of game, but it surely is mine. It's a turn-based game with very smooth and unique, addictive gameplay. The AI isn't even stupid, which was a pleasant realization on my part. One of my complaints about the game is the length, which, in my opinion, could've been longer, but no matter, because there is a lot of replayability. There's an Endless Mode for those who wish for a longer game. I recommend the DLC, as it adds a lot of new content to the base game. Out of 10, I'd give Invisible, Inc. about an 8. I personally think it's worth slightly less than full price, so perhaps wait for a sale before getting it unless you REALLY want to try it out; in which case buy it. I sure you won't be disappointed.			"

												This game is really cool if you're into tile/turn-based strategy games, and it also throws in the ""roguelike"" components of randomized dungeons, items, and playthroughs.  My first playthrough lasted 5 hours on Beginner difficulty, which seems short, but it's meant to be played multiple, multiple times (with like 7 difficulties shown from the start).  You gain experience each time you finish the game, win or lose (so you always get credit for your work), unlocking more stuff as you move on to higher difficulties.  Randomized hacks and items have been really interesting so far, with me feeling as if my limited choices and combos of those choices really matter.  You also choose what kind of missions you will undertake as you prepare for the final mission, unable to complete them all (and they're also randomized each game as are level layouts and guards/drones/etc), deciding whether you want to steal agent implants, heist a vault of credits (to upgrade your agents or buy items/hacks), rescue new agents, and more.  I didn't think the game structure would be as interesting as it is until I won once and started on the second difficulty.  It was noticably harder and I failed, but felt just fine about starting up again and trying out a different agent's abilities and hacking loadout.Not to mention the awesome futuristic ""hacker"" world and art style, complete with the nice touch of ""demoscene"" music when you're buying abilities from random hacked terminals in a level.  A damn good game.			"

												It's a very good game. Many compare it to x-com but actually the objective here is to achieve your goals while remaining undetected whereas in x-com, you want to be detected by something to win. The game is a lot like the ""Commandos"" series of games that were popular in the late 90's, drawing on similar mechanics.Unlike most games that allow you to save whenever you like and allow you to retry a save if things go bad, Invisible Inc does the opposite. It autosaves on key events but there is no going back except on Custom and beginner settings. It's a spy/espionage simulator, a very good one at that and mistakes are not forgiven. When you win the game, you are rewarded and your save file is Deleted!! But your unlocks remain. However if you lose the game, you still stand to gain some experience and a few unlocks so don't worry. Gameplay: 8/10At first when I saw that you have 72 hours, I was like ""wow, this is going to take awhile"". When I saw how those hours are spent very quickly by going here and there, I was like ""Oh, this is quite a short game"". But when I started playing on higer difficulties, those 72 hours felt like an eternity to me. You have to pick the infiltration spots as per your judgement, guide the agents to victory... sounds simple?? Quite the contrary. I have had several Expert difficulty games ditched at the very last moment siomply because I goofed up in ONE place in the entire playthrough. So if you like that sort of stuff, this is the game for you. It's chess with corporations. To justify the 8/10, In the last mission, I was in a tough spot and there didn't seem to be a way out. And yet... I won!! The only caveat is the poor story and weird ending that I won't spoil. Perhaps hinting at a sequel.Sound and Visuals: 9/10Klei's artsy look goes well with the theme similar to the Mark of the ninja series. It looks great and sounds great as well. Going well with the spy theme.Value for Money: 10/10I got it at about 13+$ on a steam sale. It's worth every penny and more, specially coming from an indie developer.AI: 8/10While the AI can do stupid things sometimes, I'm glad they do since they have saved many a playthrough. But the AI is pretty good and almost simulate a SWAT team.Overall: 9/10 Impressive. A must buy for anyone who likes stealth/spy genre. If they make an Invisible Inc II, I'd be the first to go and get it.			"

What I liked: Unique stealth based turn based game(Think Mark of Ninja meets XCOM) Fair and challenging gameplayWhat You Need to Know: This game can be played multiple times with new tools, upgrades, and agents unlocked each playthrough, some locked behind harder difficulties This is not an action killing style of game. You knock out guards, killing makes it harder, and requires cleaning up, losing money.( You can kill if you want, it will just be harder, gotta buy ammo for guns) Only moving takes up your action points, or peeking around corners which is vital to not screwing up You can customize the difficulty to your liking. if you want to be able to rewind your turn, restart levels, set alarm status, money earned, and more The story is not the strong suite here, much like most of Klei's games. But they know how to make the best games in their respective genres. (Mark of Ninja, Don't Starve, and now this) For a stealth game, it's really good, but very challenging as the game goes on, but once you understand the game you will get better and play more.My Score:A+Price:$8 with DLCCompleted in:7 hoursGames similar:  X-COM Shadow Run "

												More sneakily-random than most games you'll play; it rarely just has a straight up dice-roll-in-your-face. Overall, it's somewhat unique, and feels like a strategy/tactics game, even if ultimately, you don't ever really feel like you have very many viable options. A much worse problem is the fact that Invisible Inc doesn't have a clear goal, instead opting for a ""High Score"" thing.With all of that said, it's still worth a few plays, for sure.			"

What I liked: Unique stealth based turn based game(Think Mark of Ninja meets XCOM) Fair and challenging gameplayWhat You Need to Know: This game can be played multiple times with new tools, upgrades, and agents unlocked each playthrough, some locked behind harder difficulties This is not an action killing style of game. You knock out guards, killing makes it harder, and requires cleaning up, losing money.( You can kill if you want, it will just be harder, gotta buy ammo for guns) Only moving takes up your action points, or peeking around corners which is vital to not screwing up You can customize the difficulty to your liking. if you want to be able to rewind your turn, restart levels, set alarm status, money earned, and more The story is not the strong suite here, much like most of Klei's games. But they know how to make the best games in their respective genres. (Mark of Ninja, Don't Starve, and now this) For a stealth game, it's really good, but very challenging as the game goes on, but once you understand the game you will get better and play more.My Score:A+Price:$8 with DLCCompleted in:7 hoursGames similar:  X-COM Shadow Run "

												An amazing turn-based tactics game. Its roguelike features allow for a great replayability value. The difficulty configuration allows several very valid approaches to it (You can either keep the game's original rules or craft your own; for example, you can set the game so the ""alarm"" that is automatically raised every turn when you're infiltrating somewhere doesn't advance automatically, but in exchange you advance whole alarm levels when spotted).Also, the fact that it's a roguelike whose combat mechanics do NOT rely in RNG at all makes it extremely pleasant to play. A plan fails when it's ill conceived or you didn't take something into account. A good plan will always work, regardless of what you get on a dice roll.All in all, it's a very good game if you like stealth and/or tactics games.			"

												More sneakily-random than most games you'll play; it rarely just has a straight up dice-roll-in-your-face. Overall, it's somewhat unique, and feels like a strategy/tactics game, even if ultimately, you don't ever really feel like you have very many viable options. A much worse problem is the fact that Invisible Inc doesn't have a clear goal, instead opting for a ""High Score"" thing.With all of that said, it's still worth a few plays, for sure.			"

												I just finished beginner mode and I must say I quite enjoyed it!This game reminded me a lot of Shadowrun series by HBS. I mean, it's in the future, where corporations have taken over and there's weird technology to enhance your abilities and also a lot of corporate espionage going on..Also the vision is isometric and it's turn based. There's also a matrix-like thingy which also blends into the gameplay. OK, you don't get different races as there's only the human race available for playing, but I digress.This game is awesome.And I believe ""beginner"" mode is not as easy as one might think.I had to restart a couple of levels and rewind a few of my moves throughout my gameplay.Also, Klei is an incredible game company.Give it a try!

												While being in the excedingly niche turn-based xcom-like stealth game genre, the game provides an amazing tile based stealth system.  Set in a future where Corperations spend an insane amount of money on security and on infiltrating eachother, your organization is on the run after a raid on your HQ as you learn that your group spent the least on security.  And now your group is on the run and it begins the game with only 2 agents against all the mega corps of the world.  The flow of the game itself is even xcom like with a world/planning screen where you choose missions and equipment and a tactical screen  where you execute the missions.  The design of both layers are very tight and usually when you've got a tough choice, it's usually between 2 or 3 choices rather than a complex web of things to consider and every choice feels very powerful when it works out.  Nothing feels too marginal and everything has it's use which is nessecary for a good procedurally generated game.  And building a good team adds another bit of suspense when you start to put your agents in more and more danger with the risk of any of them getting captured.  It only takes 1 shot to take out any of your characters and every 5 turns the difficulty increases in some way as the corp security close in as you run out of places to hide.  The one major gripe I can find is that the game can get pretty visually cluttered at times and can be hard to descifer whats happening and what to do if there are a lot of entities and walls/corners in a small space.Even though the RNG can get pretty brutal especially with some with mission rewards, never had any procedurally genn-ed game give such E M O T I O N S.   Lots of variety and its really good looking to boot and in a setting that I personally love.  An auto reccomend if you like netrunner, a lot of similarities in theme and in progression since the corps get stronger as time goes on making your 'runs' harder to pull off.			"

												Invi?ible Inc. ReviewInvisible Inc. takes the form of moving a group of agents around an isometric map, in order to complete an objective. In essence, these amount to finding a certain location, interacting with it and then seeking the exit to the level.The challenge, however, is doing this in the most efficient manner, while avoiding contact with the security systems and guards that are scattered across each of the maps. The characters have various tools they can use to help them in this task, ranging from short-term invisibility fields to poison dart guns. However, by far the most powerful tool is your Artificial Intelligence program, Incognita, which allows you to interact with various aspects of the environment such as security cameras, doors and remote drones.Learning to manage the resources on hand and thus to slip in and out of a given job without detection is a true joy. The game is often challenging but rewards smart thinking and careful planning. It never feels unfair in how it handles matters, and as such you can learn from your mistakes and adjust how you play. Indeed, one of the virtues of this game, just as with Klei’s previous game Mark of the Ninja, is that it really gets the stealth balance right. Being stealthy is clearly the aim and you are amply rewarded for success. However, a miss-step is never punished too much; there is normally a means of dealing with errors, even if they do cost you.The main campaign is quite short (you get around five or six missions and the finale) however, each mission is more-or-less random with a procedural map. Add to this that there are numerous difficulty levels as well as an ‘endless’ mode and it’s easy to see that the game offers plenty of replayability for the modest price of £14.99.  So in summary, I think this is a great game that is excellent value for money. It fills a niche that is otherwise not really catered for. It looks great, has lots of polish and is filled with smart design and interesting options. I can see myself coming back to this game for a long time to come, and I imagine others will do the same.

												Invisible Inc. is an incredibly enjoyable turn-based stealth game. This game combines certain aspects of my favorite games. Of the most important aspects is a feeling of anxiety when you see your alarm level rise, and you know you're in a bad situation, and the feeling of: ""I need to figure out how to get out of this mess"". The feeling I get when I play this game is matched by no other and is truly exemplary of what stealth games should be.Notes(I feel pros and cons lists are inadequate):-The top-down viewpoint of this game makes it very easy to plan your movements and greatly increases this game's ability to be an effect stealth game.-The characters are very diverse, I found of my favorite things to do in this game is come up with, and create very interesting synergies between your choosable agents, abilities and findable items.-The story is a bit disappointing, and I don't think this game is story-driven in any way. This game is much more based on gameplay-This game is only replayable if you enjoy what I said earlier: ""I found of my favorite things to do in this game is come up with, and create very interesting synergies between your choosable agents, abilities and findable items."" -This game is difficult. I feel guilty writing this review because I have only beaten this game once...on beginner. Perhaps it is because I suck, but this game is very difficult and takes patience.Tips:-Hide. Make sure that you are always hidden behind some structure. You never know when a bad guy will barge through a door and spot you.-Only KO enemies if absolutely necessary. I have found in my everpresent experience that it is best to avoid confrontation, and killing especially. Lethal/loud weapons should only be used if absolutely necessary.-Know your strategy going in to the level. Know what you plan to have accomplished by a certain alarm level and be prepared to leave early if necessary.To conclude, I will say that this is a great game created by a great developer, and is certainly worthy of it's price tag. I would recomment this game to all age groups as it has something in it for everyone.Happy Hiding			"

												A very unique, turn-based cyberpunk / future spy setting. Takes some time to get the hang of, however it can be pretty immersive and challenging as you try to sneak through a level and keep your team alive. The graphics (while simple) have a unique, sleek design to them that suits the future noir-esque setting, while the character abilities further refine and immerse you in the world that's developed. The sound design and music all add to the game's effectiveness as well. I was worried I wasn't going to get into this as I seem to have a hard time getting into ""grid-based"" gameplay, however this with its ability to hide, flank, and ambush enemies while hacking interfaces, control panels, and peeking through doorways before breaching rooms I found to be really entertaining. The game certainly won't be for everyone and I'd recommend checking out gameplay before you swoop it, however I really enjoyed the game, I only wish it was longer! Kind of ends just as it's hitting its stride, but better to leave you wanting to play more than to become repetitive and overstay its welcome. Very unique game.			"

												Klei Entertainment continue to impress me with their games. Invisible, Inc. could best be summed up as playing the new XCOM games completely from the point of view of stealth. You /can/ take on the enemy units, but it's rarely the best course of action. Setting up distractions, traps, or flat out sneaking around when they aren't looking is usually better and far more enjoyable an experience.Campaign without the Contigency Plan DLC is a bit short, but that isn't a negative. The game is designed on playing it multiple times with different tools like you would a roguelike game, which is further enforced by the Iron Man style of gameplay. Screw up a mission? Welp, that agency is done. Try again!If you enjoy stealth games at all this should be right up your alley. Assuming you've already played Klei's other stellar stealth offering: Mark of the Ninja.

The game is designed on playing it multiple times with different tools like you would a roguelike game, which is further enforced by the Iron Man style of gameplay. Screw up a mission? Welp, that agency is done. Try again!If you enjoy stealth games at all this should be right up your alley. Assuming you've already played Klei's other stellar stealth offering: Mark of the Ninja.

												I really enjoyed Invisible Inc. It is an interesting turn-based stealth game where you must infiltrate buildings, fulfill varying objectives, and escape. I preferred a mostly stealth strategy: knocking people out and only using lethal force when necessary; but there are definitely many different ways to complete levels. What stood out to me the most, was the double-layered sneaking and hacking system. You have to balance advancing with your agents and hacking the cameras, barriers, and robots guarding the path. The story was average in my opinion, but the procedurally generated gameplay was very enjoyable and holds plenty of replay value.			"

												Thats how a game should be, easy to learn , hard to master.In addition to that Invisible Inc. has a nice touch of art and a mood fitting soundtrack.Round-based tactic games can be so intensiv, and this is the case with the game Invisible Inc. , a game  from the Creators of Mark of the Ninja.Recommended to all who look for a challanging but enjoyable game , if you like Xcom or Jagged Alliance this is a must have and all of that for a rather cheap price , Indie at its finest.10/10			"

												Invisible Inc. is an incredibly enjoyable turn-based stealth game. This game combines certain aspects of my favorite games. Of the most important aspects is a feeling of anxiety when you see your alarm level rise, and you know you're in a bad situation, and the feeling of: ""I need to figure out how to get out of this mess"". The feeling I get when I play this game is matched by no other and is truly exemplary of what stealth games should be.Notes(I feel pros and cons lists are inadequate):-The top-down viewpoint of this game makes it very easy to plan your movements and greatly increases this game's ability to be an effect stealth game.-The characters are very diverse, I found of my favorite things to do in this game is come up with, and create very interesting synergies between your choosable agents, abilities and findable items.-The story is a bit disappointing, and I don't think this game is story-driven in any way. This game is much more based on gameplay-This game is only replayable if you enjoy what I said earlier: ""I found of my favorite things to do in this game is come up with, and create very interesting synergies between your choosable agents, abilities and findable items."" -This game is difficult. I feel guilty writing this review because I have only beaten this game once...on beginner. Perhaps it is because I suck, but this game is very difficult and takes patience.Tips:-Hide. Make sure that you are always hidden behind some structure. You never know when a bad guy will barge through a door and spot you.-Only KO enemies if absolutely necessary. I have found in my everpresent experience that it is best to avoid confrontation, and killing especially. Lethal/loud weapons should only be used if absolutely necessary.-Know your strategy going in to the level. Know what you plan to have accomplished by a certain alarm level and be prepared to leave early if necessary.To conclude, I will say that this is a great game created by a great developer, and is certainly worthy of it's price tag. I would recomment this game to all age groups as it has something in it for everyone.Happy Hiding			"

												Loved it. You can never get into a perfect spot and even the most expeirienced players can slip up causing mass amounts of thinking to get away from 2 or 3 guards. This game makes you feel powerless but powerful at the same time. The ending i diddnt see coming the first time i played. Detention centers give you junk agents that you HAVE to spend time to armor up for at least 1 or 2 missions. when this was in the early stages, i couldnt get past mission 2... but now im able to actually beat the game and train for the next difficulty by training on the one before, but even then the game is still hard and thats what i love about it.""...We pull no punches.""                      -Hardest Level Description			"

												A superb piece of power-stealth - you feel like the hunter as often as the prey, which is a tough balancing act. It's extremely customisable, thanks to gameplay rules you can switch around pre-campaign, but could do with a deeper progression system - once you've had 10 goes at the campaign, you've unlocked everything going. And the story end is a bit forced...			"

												Due to the misuse of the early access platform, many of us have been wary of trying any game that releases itself as early access. I first layed my eyes on this game and felt in love with the artstyle. I had to instantly get this game and give it a shot. I had no prior experience with any Klei Entertainment games before this.This game was pretty challenging when I first started out but once you get used to it then it is all about your decision making. All I would have issue with is with the zooming of the camera but it was not a big deal. The story is pretty simple, just an excuse to stealth because big corps are doing their usual business and it's time to take advantage. All the characters have their own useful abilities and can be improved as long as you stay alive.The game has incredible customization so if you took a wrong move you can re-do it. You can set yourself a limit as little as 1 per game or as many as 99. You determine your experience, just fidle around with it until you find your difficulty.There's nothing wrong with playing this game as casual as you want it to be. I just want you to know that this game is incredible and if you can play it any way you want.That said, other reviews are written more in detail and bring the real meat of this game. This is just my personal experience and look for this game. All I can say is I have become a huge fan of Klei after this and hope that they keep blowing me away with their games.			"

												Now this game is out of early access. I feel it's time for me to re-review this game:Invisible Inc is a turn based stealth game revolving around a unique hacking & power system. Used to turn the far more powerful corporations weapons against them. Think the emo teenage son of Watch Dogs & Xcom Enemy Unknown.This game is very addictive; I swear it was 8pm I thought ""just one quick runthrough."" died after 4 missions ""that was really short let's try again!"" I ended finishing the game at 10am the next day.Story;♥♥♥♥ yo story fool! You get two cutscenes! The first at the start of the game where it's all like ""Oh no's our company is being attacked!"" then some woman grabs her porn floppy disc or something & run off onto some jet. The ending is the game pulling a Skynet and saying your hacky A.I has gone rogue and is now at full control of all the worlds electronics and procedes to do... Nothing.Graphics;Very nice cartoony/comic book style. Zero performance issues even on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC.Gameplay;Movement is just like Xcom EW. Except with APs instead of just two moves. You get to see the guards line of sight before you move, always helpful. When playing this game remember one thing:YOU ARE NOT Agent 47, Ezio Auditore, Sam Fisher or Solid Snake. Once spotted you can move once or use one fancy gadget before you get shot to♥♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by some corporate♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in insanely OP armour.The game sports a very cool alarm system. Where by each turn your alarm level increases by one; once it reaches a certain point more guards spawn, more cameras turn on etc. Game world;You get to travel from maze of gray corridors to maze of big gray rooms 1,000,000/10In conclusion I love this game, it's very addictive, fun & punishing. I could never truely feel immersed in the story as the actual spies you use range from silent man in trenchcoat to silent man in trenchcoat with a cool hat; and all the dialogue comes from two random bell ends at the dumped into your roster at the end. Thanks game! I spent hours levelling up and equiping my spies then you just leave two of your unwanted deus ex regects (bearing in mind they are level 1 with level 1 gear) and saying ""get them across that maze of sentries traps and immortal glowing devil things for us will ya?""Plus it's impossible to stealth in a really cramped corridor with six guys you know game!

My 595 hrs on record speaks for itself! It's great for tactical stealth lovers, and strategy is key, otherwise, your missions won't end well!

								A turn-based stealth game, Invisble Inc. excels at both. Set in a not distant future, you have to infiltrate various procedurally generated facilities for different goals (5 different goals IIRC). One of the novelties is Incognita, your AI that can hack cameras and other security devices, as well as provide some distraction for the guards. You only start with 2 agents then you can upgrade them, free others, upgrade Incognita, etc... But Invisible Inc. is not for everybody: the game is very hard (even with the ""door exploit""). There's no go back (game saves automatically for you) and every little stupid mistake on your own can mean having to start over, which is sometimes frustrating (OMG I left that door open, ZOMG I calculated the guard trajectory the wrong way, crap this agent was selected, I thought it was the other one, etc...). There's not even an undo button for your moves, so plan carefully. But it is also where the magic of this game resides: the tension of stealth + not allowing mistakes is a good combination if you're not easily frustrated. On the other hand if you have no patience, just skip it or you will end breaking your fancy hardware.EDIT: Devs introduced a new ""Easy mode"" that is welcome for the frustrated masses :D			"

												Roguelike stealth-xcom game that feels a lot like Shadowrun. Brutally hard but never feels unfair, nor does it rely so heavily on RNG as xcom does.I don't think any other game has put me on edge as much as Invisible does. The tension (and my heartbeat) just racks up as the close calls just get closer and closer.I appreciate the customizability of the campaign and difficulty settings, although we all know that real men play on Ironman mode.The ending did make me want to stop playing, though. It didn't just not provide closure on anything, it's also a big sequel tease with a less interesting premise.			"

												I finally survived a full campaign on the easiest difficulty. I love it. my recorded hours are off by about 20 because I played some offline in early access. This game is fantastic. The story is fairly short - if you are playing in the easiest difficulty and encounter no problems you can get through it in less than 5 hours.If you at the least - raise the count-down time from 7 hours to higher then it could take considerably longer. Even without changing any difficulty modifiers you can make the campaign longer. The mechanics alone are worth 10 dollars to me. The wide variety of agents and playstyles, array of campaign options including 'Endless', and perfect execution of the art style make the 20 dollar tag pretty cheap for this thrill ride. Now in my favorites. ^_^			"

												One of the best games I've ever played, certainly in my top 5. It's the only turn-based stealth game in exsistance, and manages to combine the best of X-com and FTL. It's choice of cyber-punk as theme works suprisingly well, and meshes well with the games mechanics of hacking and sneaking around were you aren't welcome.In terms of gameplay, Klei nails the stealth aspect. The line-of-sight mechanic is amazing, the guards have areas that immedtaely put you into danger, and parts near the edge of their sight that only put them guard and make them go off their patrol. There was actaully an article on it in RPS. This combined with the fact that you can ""hear"" guards footprints with little visual bubbles means that you almost always know were guards are at most times. The challenge lies in that the game gives you limited points for action, peaking, hacking, and stealing every turn. Afer you use them up, the guards move around and the difficulty timer goes up. Are you sure that guard was going the other way? If you check, you won't be able to crack that last safe before the difficulty increases and they all get locks. Invisible Inc never punishes you without cause, you can usually trail back your losses to multiple bad descisions. You rarely get hit over the head with RNG like some other games do. Randomized rooms and endless campain mode mean you can play this game basicly forever. My only complaint is that on the easy difficulties, the guard's AI is really, really bad; start on intermedeate at least. That and the fact that you can sometimes unrealisticly juke your way out of danger by exploiting the guard's lines of sight. And as a warning, the campain's ending is really pretty anti-climatic. Other than that, this is game all rouge-like fans need to own. It won't dissapoint.			"

Early Access Review
								Klei Entertainment have proven themselves capable of releasing very playable Early Access games with Don't Starve.I love the easy to learn hard to master turn based stealth gameplay. The difficulty is high and it should stay like that. Never playing the same map twice makes every infiltration a unique one, and other stealth games lack this unique experience.My only negative remark is that the music is not up to par, and that in its current state, it becomes repetitive quite easily.

												Only played the game for a few hours but it's already a firm favourite. The hide and ambush mechanic works really well, and so far the game hasn't generated any unfairly difficult levels.  The art is superb, really enjoyable to look at and I'm enjoying the character and bits of back story that the game is working in. The music direction, although not the music itself, is a bit poor and there are some jarring changes in the score, plus a couple of patchy voice acting moments.  That's really the only bad thing I can say about it, and it's not even that bad.  Definitely worth a buy if you like turn based strategy games, especially if you're into sci fi, cyberpunk etc.			"

												There are few games that hit a sweet spot with me like this one has.  If someone had told me that there was a game out there that merged two of my favorite genres (Stealth and Turn-based strategy) together flawlessly I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have believed them.  Invisible Inc. has done just that.  The story is smart (albiet short), the game mechanics are crisp and tight, and the level of difficulty is challenging but never unfair (if you get wiped out 99% of the time it's your fault).  The procedural map making is extremely well done.  The only minor gripe I can think of would involve the in-map decor (if you travel to New York, Rome, Tokyo, whatever, the office buildings all sort of look the same).  The missions are short but sweet, I personally play turn-based games at the speed of paint drying, agonizing over every move, but each mission still only takes me about a half hour to 45 minutes.  The voice acting is high quality, the spy gadgets are intriguing and effective, and the rather short campaign should get old for as much as i've played it but for some reason always draws me back in.  Very few Indie games make it into my personal Hall of Fame but this one is a no-doubter!			"

												Q: Why do cybernetically enhanced hackers love tactical espionage games?A: Because they're always on the grid!Invisible, Inc. is a revolutionary isometric roguelike stealth game set in a cyberpunk future. The seamless blending of the different sources of tension in these two inspirations (the threat of discovery and permanent death) gives the kind of perpetual thrill one would more expect from a movie theatre seat.It pulls several punches that one would expect a roguelike game to follow through on, though. The beginner setting is something of a joke, and while the game gives you an almost infinite array of options to tweak difficulty to your exact liking, a few of the elements that make the game fundamentally less arbitrary than a ""true"" roguelike cannot be changed. There is no such thing as instant death; being caught in the open or making a mistake is more like being placed in check when playing chess. It is an immediate imperative that demands a response, narrows your options and drives you closer to checkmate, but is ultimately fully reversible if you're lucky and clever. More importantly, perhaps, is that upon arriving at the final mission, you are given enough tools to complete it. Not the best tools, but adequate ones. Furthermore the final mission isn't really that much harder than a regular mission, even before the sudden disposeability of your agents is taken into account. I only enjoy fairly casual games in this genre, so it's mostly a plus for me, but you will have to judge for yourself if it sounds like what you're looking for.All that, combined with its beautiful graphical flare and charming execution mean that I recommend Invisible, Inc. as an excellent choice for fans of cyberpunk and people who want to try out the roguelike genre, and as a temporary diversion to long-time veterans.

												Completely forgot to update this review as soon as I figured out that the stealth element was pressed agaisnt a limited number of turn nonsense.Think you'll be hiding around corners and observing patrol patterns to figure out when to slip past the guards. Oh no you won't, beaucse time is running out! EAch level has a limited number of turns before a full blown alarm is blown.The lore states that although you managed to get in undetected, the secuirty system eventually discovers there is an intruder.This completely ruined the experience for me, in all tactics turn based games, I like taking my time, with leap frog tactics and a lot of observation. This games potential to make this a possibilty was switched to time constraints. Really wish they'd have used another mechanic to create pressure. It feels artificial for me and doesn't encompass what a stealth game means to me.Almost feels more like a puzzle turned based action game. Just wanted to have at least to update my review, as what I was expected never happened and what it was done instead is a complete turn off for me.If you are like me, stay away. Not for you.			"

												I like the concept but the RNG is too much for me. Sometimes the level layouts are just unfair. Sometimes you never get useful equipment. I can tolerate RNG in a game that isnt so strategy focused. This isnt XCOM RNG where I am missing my shots and whatnot. It is RNG of the procedural level system, and randomized progression system.  Strategy with lots of RNG makes it very difficult to actually strategize.  You just never know what gear, ability, party member, cybernetic enhacement, or whatever is coming next.  Even a guard with armor coming up the wrong elevator can totally ruin your game. Sometimes you will load into a level where you literally don't have a way to beat it. I like extreme challanges and don't mind losing them when it was because of a bad call I made. This game I have lost many times because the game said so. Can't do it.			"

												Invisible, Inc. manages the rare achievement of combining two wildly disparate genres - stealth and turn-based tactics - and somehow managing to feel totally mundane. There's not really anything wrong with it, but as an experiment it seems like a failed one, and even when it works it almost feels like the sequel to a more interesting game.I realize that reviewing the plot of a roguelike is at best a questionable activity, but it's worth bringing up here. The game opens by quickly establishing a fascinating world of cyberpunk duplicity, then immediately blows it up to pit you against a monolithic alliance of evil. Then, after you beat the game, the victory cutscene reveals that whoops it turns out you got totally owned. You're then whisked back to the main menu and asked if you'd like to play - and therefore get totally owned - again. The premise isn't wrong, but it's certainly wonky.The gameplay is of course the meat of things, but it similarly smells of missed opportunity. You play as the operator of an experienced espionage organization, yet every mission involves stumbling blindly into unknown office buildings in search of unknown objectives, where even flawless victory might net you nothing of value. The world is full of advanced technology for your operatives to hack, but you do so by establishing line of sight. This makes less than zero sense, which isn't a dealbreaker on its own. But crucially, this funnels the dimension of technology into plain old meatspace. You're not exploring a level to gain access to Network A to gain access to Physical Area B to gain access to Network C and so on, you're just… walking around. It's so fundamentally bad at cyberpunk that I have to wonder why the game uses the trappings in the first place. And the actual sneaking follows suit, relying on age-old tropes of hiding behind boxes to avoid patrolling guards' vision cones, with unique agents who present a façade of individuality but nothing more.As a whole it's… fine. But the alluring premise is almost completely at odds with the gameplay, to the point that it'd work better with an old-timey detective theme than the futuristic cyberpunk one it sports. And the turn-based nature gives the stealth gameplay extra precision, but it doesn't do anything truly new to set it apart from stealth games of the past unless you're really into procedurally generated cubicle farms. Bottom line, you're better off playing Mark of the Ninja (from the same devs) or Dishonored to get your stealth kick.			"

												Here's the problem. The game is amazing, but there is a fundamental contradiction. Random generated levels are very good thing when you have the time to traverse and explore them. But when you have brutally limited time for the whole mission and for the K.O. of the enemies (many of which you are forced to attack, because of generated level setup), and on top of that you have a cooldown on your attacks, the whole experience starts to feel like playing a lottery of what level you get generated and hope for a lucky one, because very often you will stuck on a simply unfair setup.With such pace-pushing time-constrains we shouldn't be limited with attack cooldowns and what not. We don't have time to make a good approach. We need to act fast, but our actions are harshly limited. I think that The Alarm Level should not rise with time (I literally enter two empty rooms and the Alarm Level is rised). It should rise only with actions (when we are spotted, attack a guard, etc.) For example if a guard stands up after a K.O. he should call his supervisors and that will rise the Alarm Level (rise it a lot). Also every hack could rise the Alarm Level. I though about percent chance (of hack rising alarm level), but I don't think chances are a good game-design anyway. So you could go kinda back to the old Alarm System with more points to rise so it could accumulate with more actions. I know the game is closing to release with every day and your design-decisions are more and more permanent, but you shouldn't let your game-development Alarm Level to force you into rushing a room full of media cameras and armed consumers, because this will not be a successful mission. I have a lot of respect for you at Klei Entertainment. You did a great work with Shank (1 & 2). Don't Starve is not my cup of tea, but its genuinely good game nevertheless. And I absolutely love Mark of the Ninja. So I bought Incognita (before you've renamed it to Invisible, Inc.) right away. It was a pleasure to see how the game shapes and evolve. Now I hope you will address the issue somehow and make the game less chaotic and more reliable.P.S.I gave thumb-down only so Klei could potentially see this when they scan for criticism. Otherwise the game have all my fingers up. I just hope it will be improved even further.			"

For your first play through you're not even given an intro about how items work, you're not told you can't charge your weapons/items unless your on a mission. And the team consist of characters, instead of template squad members. that do not feel like your own, Pass on this, too little for 19.99.			"

												I am impressed. Its a well done turn based strategy set in a dystopian world where corporations have control  of all the major computer systems and independant groups of sprung up to return power to the people. Or at least thats what I made up in my head while I was writing this. I like the challange helping me team with the breaking and entering corporate sites to steal goods by making sure my agents avoid security while trying to steal stuff and break into systems. With the ultimate goal of upgrading my agents and overal returning power to where it rightfully belongs, The People.  The character art is very nice and the cut scenes are well done along with the audio and music.I feel like more time should have been put into making the game longer, felt a bit dissapointed when it ended so quickley. But maybe the devs had there reasons for that: Time, Money, Whatever. Either way it was worth it for the price, but I would have spent more money on a longer game. I hate short eposide like games. "

Early Access Review
								""Over €15,- for an early acces, turn-based spy game? Nah... I don't think so."" My thoughts exactly. That thought turned out to be very, very incorrect.After reading some reviews and figuring out I could miss the money, I decided to make the purchase. Boy, I am happy I did.The game starts with a very simple tutorial which shows you the basis structure of the game. After completing this, you will see a world map with some locations on it. All of these locations are randomly generated maps filled with cameras, guards and other stuff which will work in your advantage or disadvantage, but most of all: loot. In each of these maps, the objective is to find the elevator, so you can escape and choose another area on the world, upgrading your characters and items and earning experience along the way.My first couple attempts resulted in quick and merciless death, but after unlocking my first two rewards, I found myself getting further and further. And each time I played, I felt more rewarded by my actions.I am not a huge fan of turn-based games, nor stealh games, but this game has already surprised me in a very, very pleasant way. I have never thought that turn-based could feel so stressfull.Seeing that this is only the Alpha, I highly suggest you pick this game up. If you like to give yourself a fair but tough challenge, this is a must-buy.(I highly suggest turning on fast mode, else you will be watching walking animations 30% of the time:)) "

												Story's quite simple, i would expect more dlc or future updates and see where does it bring the characters.Get caught in a sticky situation and you're kinda in hot soup for the rest of the mission. Even if one manages to salvage and escape, the missions will only get harder and harder. Rate is a 8/10 , due to my favoritism in the strategic genre. Taken 2 off because of the story, i wished there was more to this whole game.			"

												This game is much less of a turn-based combat/stealth game than it is, perhaps, a rather aggressive piece of choreographed contemporary dance. And much like a dancer, both the intense satisfaction of completing your routine and the sweat dripping from your brow as a result of doing so are key reasons why I recommend this game. Invisible Inc. is produced by Klei Entertainment, which should hopefully bring a smile to your face - they are the creators of the superb ""Don't Starve"", and I can confirm they haven't disappointed here either. I won't go into every reason for this game's success, but I will say that the gameplay, the style of which I have never really been a fan of, is tremendously fun and challenging, there is, much like Don't Starve, plenty of replayability due to the procedural nature of its level generation, and the visuals/audio are beautifully sublime, or sublimely beautiful, whichever you prefer. It also had the odd effect of instilling me with some sense of morality - typically a ""tank"" style of gamer with little regard for the fleeting lives of my computerized opponents, I completed my first playthrough without killing a single guard (with the exception of a walking-camera-droid-thing, and really, does that even count?), and actually frowned at the unlocked character I received afterwards, Shalem 11, because his special ability is the use of a sniper rifle. Life changing game. Thoroughly recommended. Now I'm off to watch all eight seasons of Dexter, back to back, to regain the complete desensitization to violence this game stole from me.			"

												I bought this game because I'm a big fan of two of their games, Mark of the Ninja and Don't starve. I would recommend this one, but not at its current price. Here is why :It's a good little game, with  a great concept, that relies on a series of X-Com-like tactical missions that help you beat the final one. However, you cannot rush into the missions with heavy weapons and grenades. Here you have to reach the objectives by being stealthy and hacking into the mainframe accesses as fast as you can, because every 5 turns the security level increases.I've had fun with it, and I liked the initial challenge, but ...The campaign is far too short. I finished the Beginner campaign in less than 6 hours, in 4 attempts. What I liked in X-Com games was that you had to slowly improve your equipment, level up your roster and finally, after several hours, defeat the enemy against all odds. Here I finished the campaign in 2 hours, and some 6 or maybe 7 missions and with only one agent (the other one died in the third mission). I would have preferred a more rewarding game.Also, each failure gives you experience, that will help you unlock new programs and agents. I've been a bit disappointed by the agents and more so by the programs I've unlocked (I've unlocked 4 agents and 2 programs).There are a full set of options you can play with to increase the level difficulty, and the number of missions you can do before finishing the campaign, but now I have finished it, it seems a bit spoiled.So yeah, I recommend it, but if you can find it at 5€, no more.

The art style and voice acting are all top notch.  I'm excited to check out the harder difficulties and unlock more agents!  This game really reminds me of XCOM: Enemy Unknown mechanically (tactical turn-based, squad members with different load-outs and attributes, a leveling system, strategic choices between missions, etc); so if you liked that, you might want to check this out.

												I am not a big fan of rogue-like game. This how ever is truly something speshal. Its roge-like yes but its also like MSG, Cyberpunk and Fantasy Flight Games's infiltration. I did take a chance on it about half a year ago in early access and found plenty of game there. Now there more then i thort posebal in a game of this style. There are plenty of settings to custom you challenge level but the defolt settings have a very good curve. Its terun basted and like other rogue game you start off with only a small amount of stuff. As you progress and die / quit, you get XP that gives you more stuff. You only start with 2 agents and 2 programs how ever you can get as many as 10 agents and 6 alternate setups and more programs for your computer AI. The storey is short but its very good and you keep coming back for more. The graphics relay work for the setting and with the amonlt of polish in it now it relay is  game to be prode of. As I said am not a big fan of rogue-like game and I only have two on my account Faster then light and this one. I think it is worth the price tag and am not saying that because I got it on early access, I think that if I had not got it then I would defanlty get it now.  I do think you get a hell of a lot of game and a good quolaty game at that.This should appeal to rogue-like gamers, tern bast strategist, and my wife who is a casual / low gamer loves it. Low violence and no real mature content its a winner for all, in my eyes.			"

So I ignore every safe, 1/2 the cameras get to level 5 alarm in no time, shooting and not caring about guards at all. Find the Elevator, great now were talking but wheres buddy at? Some how as all this is going on i reversed pick pocked my empty gun for a passcard (Tho i'm sure i taz the same guard before i used it anyways lol).. Hmm chuckle after looking at what i havn't explored.. only two places he could be 1 a worst death trap then what i have made for myself as it is and the other semi close to the elevator if the guards behave how i want... found him!! die with my rewind in tack and managed to fix my mistake to win.. sorta (rewind) first try!gonna try endless before i risk the other save file of 3 agents...10/10 it's your own fault when something goes wrong there should always be enough turns and distractions in your favor			"

												This game should be knows as ""Beyond Challenging"". Even though it is turn-based, There is always SOMETHING you dont account for. Things can go so wrong but there are also moments where everything goes STRAIGHT according to plan. Also since there is a bit of a subtle progression system you almost KNOW that the first run will eventually be a disaster. But every time you play through and fail you unlock some new characters and programs to work with. Improving your chances of success.I really doubt there is ANYONE who can clear this game first try. But this is a game that is recommended for people who LOVE stealth and look for a massive randomly generated challenge.			"

Early Access Review
								Turn based strategy games are always good fun and this game is no different, this game is the same as XCOM: Enemy Unknown in mechanics but the style is different with the fact that the game is a stealth based game.The game is said to not be at it's final product and many patches are going to be going down from the date of this review being written but at the moment it still works great and plays well.You are forced to think tactically in your movements with the game having no problem with punishing you for wrong movements, with the different type of enemies you can simply knock out every guard you come across which forces you to think about who you take down and who you leave alone and some other opponents can't be taken down at all.It is a great game and I recommend it to any fan of turn based strategy games.

												Great turned based stealth game it is unforgiving when you make a mistake. Taking your time will force more guards to spawn in with it's alarm system every 5 turns increases the alarm level from 1 to the highest level of 6 at that level the maximum amount of guards have spawned in. Forcing you on each new heist to choose either taking what you can find right away and leaving before it gets too challenging, or exploring the whole map finding everything you can loot/use before heading out while you are very outnumbered and your chances of escaping are very slim, but can be done with pure tactical patience and strategy.

Abstract: Short game, short review. When I first saw this game, I was pretty impressed by the art style and the idea of a cyberpunk future where you infiltrate places for...stuff (though I'd argue teleporting is more sci-fi based). The more I played, the more I became bored. While its all randomly generated, it all felt very samey to me. The only times it felt different was at the very end, on the last level. The voice acting was more akin to reading straight from a script, the wide array of characters mean nothing when only 3 or 4 of them are useful for anything. It just feels like this game was more of an artistic representation over the gameplay. The times the game becomes interesting is when the game becomes overwhelming with 6 guards buzzing all around you like rabid dogs. Oh, and a lot fo this game is RNG. Guard paths, level rewards, all of it is RNG, which means you can be legit boned by the RNG. While its a 'rogue-like', it...isn't engaging like one. I could never finish the last level due to the overwhelming amount of heresy the game continued to throw at me, forcing either a level restart or game over.Overall, I'd give this a pass. Artistically, its phenomenal. Gameplay-wise, it plays like potato in your hands: makes a mess and hungry for food.			"

The adrenaline rush was unreal. If you like turn based strategy, stealth, spies and/or cyberpunk, definitely pick this up!			"

												This game is great on replay value. Reminds of the great games of the 80's for that reason despite the fact that it is a fully modern game.I love that the story is not overly dominant, and that most of the game is about solving the puzzle of each mission. Turn based so if you need to pause and come back later its no big deal. I would prefer less of the story actually. Its nice having the alternate tasks and missions that come up within that arc, but all in all who cares about the story? Just give me more puzzles.I am also not very good at it which keeps me interested. I put it down for awhile then come back to it. Addictive. Played more of this game than I normally play anything and I still am not quite finished on the middle rating of difficulty. Expert or something with only one redo allowed.Perfect game. I'll probably still be dropping in on it after I've put in the same amount of time in which other games become tired or tedious. As much as I like and have played Civ. It gets tedious after awhile. And play is more obsessive than all fun. This one is always right on that edge. Solving the puzzle. Getting in hot water when agents are knocked down and the map is flooded with enforcers. And you just get more into it trying to see if you can still pull the mission off. I'll be looking forward to the next level of difficulty and losing game after game until I develop the skill to handle more difficult situations. Its all fun. And it is refreshing to lose for a change.Great game. I wish I had designed this.			"

												the whole beginner's mode took me 1.7 hrs including toilet breaks and snacking in between.the ending was very abrupt and predictable.The graphic looks great.You get very small amount of background and characteristics of the agent. The only thing that seemed to vary them was what kind of body augmentation they have eg. sensing♥♥♥♥♥♥with their skin and unlocking♥♥♥♥♥♥automatically.Getting enough credit (acts like money) to buy different skills were stressful as the story of the game gives you like 60-something hours and you have to spend travel time of eg. 12 hours to start a mission. Everytime I played a mission the difficulty increased as well.Well one of the biggest reasons that I do not play time-limiting, random-maps games is that I like to play games slowly and on my own terms. I am the kind of person that has to break every ♥♥♥♥ing pots and open wardrobes in strangers home in games like Dragon Quest and talk to every NPCs. If I don't like the way a certain mission turned out then I will reload and perfect it. When I play Witcher 3 or Skyrim I have to get every weed/flower and loot absolutely everything I lay my eyes onto and I save religiously so I can win gwent because I can never have enough money. I am the kind of person that has to catch all the ♥♥♥♥ing pokemons.If you are like me, this is not the game for you. Go play Hard West or some sort of turn-based tactical breaching game.Character selection: You get two new agents after you finish the beginner's mode. So I'm guessing you'll get two new agents everytime you break a different mode?Randomly generated world: it means there's no messing up and reloading the mission to have a better approach. I am used to a gameplay that I can restart a mission when I mess up so this is subjective.Fully animated cutscenes and voice over: They are not that long.			"

Klei EntertainmentKlei are a company I trust and seeing how well they interact with and involve their community fan base, puts faith in everyone they will deliver. If you haven't already heard of Klei then check out their official site and look into some of their games such as Don't Starve, Shank and Mark of the Ninja. What is Invisible Inc?Their most recent title to hit the steam store comes in the form of a turn based tactical espionage thriller. Invisible Inc puts you in the role of the ""Operator"", giving you full control of highly trained agents set on infiltrating corporation controlled facilities. In short, your job is to ""get in and out"" as quietly and quickly as you can. If you've played turn based games before you'll understand the concepts fairly quickly, if you're new to the genre, the easy to follow tutorials and animated pop ups help out a lot. The basic concept involves you moving your agents around a randomly generated grid based map, once you've made your move you end turn and the NPC controlled corporation guards make their move. Things are made tense with an ever increasing alarm system. So even though their is no time limit, you are always conscious of the alarm level and the the difficulties it brings the higher it gets. More to follow....			"

												This game was on my wishlist for a while and I was very excited to be able to try it for free during a weekend deal.  I really expected to play it, love it, and then buy it.  I am a big fan of XCOM and other turn-based games.Invisible Inc. left me very disappointed.  The stealth mechanics made me laugh... not in a good way, more like in a 'why can't this guard move his eyeballs one millimeter to the left and see me standing like RIGHT NEXT TO HIM?""  It was just so silly.  The guard AI when they are searching for me appears to just be random movements.  They walk up to walls and go in random directions.  The ""hacking"" is just stupid.  You just press a key and it puts you in 'god mode' and you just click on what you want to disable, using a type of game currency that is as easy to find as dots in pac man. It was fun to play for about 10 minutes, and then I spent another few hours playing it in complete disbelief that it was this disappointing... and then stopped playing it dispite having the ability to continue playing for free for another 2 days.2/10 Would replay XCOM again before wasting any more time with this.

Early Access Review
								It's a bit light on content right now, but the core gameplay is a lot of fun. Basically a turn-based stealth roguelike, with the stealth mechanics done right.What really makes this work is that the game provides all the necessary tools to make the stealth gameplay work - you have variety of scouting options including hacking cameras and predicting visible enemy routes, but they all have an opportunity cost. Due to the options to gather information, there's very little randomness outside of the actual mission generation (though there are plenty of opportunities to take calculated risks). You never feel like you were cheated by something you couldn't have accounted for or that winning is more luck based than skill based.The balance is also very good considering it's still in Early Access. It does have a bit of a learning curve to figure out what works, but once you get rolling the missions are challenging but reasonable. The main difficulty is in how greedy you want to be - there's a soft time limit in each mission, and plenty of optional loot; usually you can't afford to try to get everything, so you have to make some tough decisions. But the game keeps scaling in difficulty, so you can't leave behind too much loot...Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys stealth games.			"

It has that X-COM feel yet Splinter Cell with a bit of Metal Gear. Add in the charming art work and great all-around game and strategy mechanics, and you got an incredible rogue-like game. There are times I've played I thought would be impossible to get out of but the game is so well made that you'll find a way...some way. Anyways, it's 2:36 AM and I've just been playing this STRAIGHT since I got it logging at 11.3 hrs. 10 out of freakin' 10. Would Invisible again.			"

												This game is great on replay value. Reminds of the great games of the 80's for that reason despite the fact that it is a fully modern game.I love that the story is not overly dominant, and that most of the game is about solving the puzzle of each mission. Turn based so if you need to pause and come back later its no big deal. I would prefer less of the story actually. Its nice having the alternate tasks and missions that come up within that arc, but all in all who cares about the story? Just give me more puzzles.I am also not very good at it which keeps me interested. I put it down for awhile then come back to it. Addictive. Played more of this game than I normally play anything and I still am not quite finished on the middle rating of difficulty. Expert or something with only one redo allowed.Perfect game. I'll probably still be dropping in on it after I've put in the same amount of time in which other games become tired or tedious. As much as I like and have played Civ. It gets tedious after awhile. And play is more obsessive than all fun. This one is always right on that edge. Solving the puzzle. Getting in hot water when agents are knocked down and the map is flooded with enforcers. And you just get more into it trying to see if you can still pull the mission off. I'll be looking forward to the next level of difficulty and losing game after game until I develop the skill to handle more difficult situations. Its all fun. And it is refreshing to lose for a change.Great game. I wish I had designed this.			"

												A turn-based stealth game with a LOT of great ideas that is unfortunately pretty much ruined by some ill-considered mechanics. Specifically, some enemies have ""Armor"" and in many run-throughs of the game, you will simply not be given access to any items which allow you to ignore Armor, meaning you often encounter literally unstoppable enemies and just have to shrug your shoulders and reset.It also suffers from ""roguelike"" syndrome, which is where a lazy developer declines to provide balance to a system and then chalks it up to ""it's a roguelike"". You might get a team of 4 awesome hackers and thousands of credits worth of equipment in your first two missions. OR, you might get a bunch of ""intel"" missions, which just tell you about other missions, giving you zero opportunity for advancement. If that situation comes up on your first day or two, you can just restart. If it comes up when you're 75% done with the game, oh well - sucks to be you! ""It's a roguelike"".I'd really like to give this a thumbs-up, the theme is awesome, the art is just gorgeous and fits the cyberpunk world perfectly, the voice acting is top notch, and there are a lot of great gameplay ideas that unfortunately just don't come together, due to a couple of bad mechanics.Keep an eye on this if you're into turn-based, and try it if it goes on sale really cheap, or they ever fix the balance problems.

Early Access Review
								It's a bit light on content right now, but the core gameplay is a lot of fun. Basically a turn-based stealth roguelike, with the stealth mechanics done right.What really makes this work is that the game provides all the necessary tools to make the stealth gameplay work - you have variety of scouting options including hacking cameras and predicting visible enemy routes, but they all have an opportunity cost. Due to the options to gather information, there's very little randomness outside of the actual mission generation (though there are plenty of opportunities to take calculated risks). You never feel like you were cheated by something you couldn't have accounted for or that winning is more luck based than skill based.The balance is also very good considering it's still in Early Access. It does have a bit of a learning curve to figure out what works, but once you get rolling the missions are challenging but reasonable. The main difficulty is in how greedy you want to be - there's a soft time limit in each mission, and plenty of optional loot; usually you can't afford to try to get everything, so you have to make some tough decisions. But the game keeps scaling in difficulty, so you can't leave behind too much loot...Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys stealth games.			"

												Fantastic combination of XCOM: Enemy Within and FTL: Faster than Light. Squad-based tactics, procedurally generated missions, permadeath, items/upgrades, and insane replayability.If you enjoy rogue-like and turn-based strategy games, you're going to love this game.Currently trying to run through on Expert mode. Wish me luck!

Early Access Review
								Like most Klei games, this isn't a groundbreakingly new concept, but it is an interesting twist on existing concepts, and it's already developed to the point of being 10x better than it's nearest competitor. Klei is the same company that brought us Don't Starve and Mark of the Ninja, so you really don't have to worry about the Early Access thing in this case. This is already a solid game, and it's continually being updated with new features and content.If it looks like something you'd be interested in, just grab it. You won't regret it.			"

												This game was on my wishlist for a while and I was very excited to be able to try it for free during a weekend deal.  I really expected to play it, love it, and then buy it.  I am a big fan of XCOM and other turn-based games.Invisible Inc. left me very disappointed.  The stealth mechanics made me laugh... not in a good way, more like in a 'why can't this guard move his eyeballs one millimeter to the left and see me standing like RIGHT NEXT TO HIM?""  It was just so silly.  The guard AI when they are searching for me appears to just be random movements.  They walk up to walls and go in random directions.  The ""hacking"" is just stupid.  You just press a key and it puts you in 'god mode' and you just click on what you want to disable, using a type of game currency that is as easy to find as dots in pac man. It was fun to play for about 10 minutes, and then I spent another few hours playing it in complete disbelief that it was this disappointing... and then stopped playing it dispite having the ability to continue playing for free for another 2 days.2/10 Would replay XCOM again before wasting any more time with this.

Klei EntertainmentKlei are a company I trust and seeing how well they interact with and involve their community fan base, puts faith in everyone they will deliver. If you haven't already heard of Klei then check out their official site and look into some of their games such as Don't Starve, Shank and Mark of the Ninja. What is Invisible Inc?Their most recent title to hit the steam store comes in the form of a turn based tactical espionage thriller. Invisible Inc puts you in the role of the ""Operator"", giving you full control of highly trained agents set on infiltrating corporation controlled facilities. In short, your job is to ""get in and out"" as quietly and quickly as you can. If you've played turn based games before you'll understand the concepts fairly quickly, if you're new to the genre, the easy to follow tutorials and animated pop ups help out a lot. The basic concept involves you moving your agents around a randomly generated grid based map, once you've made your move you end turn and the NPC controlled corporation guards make their move. Things are made tense with an ever increasing alarm system. So even though their is no time limit, you are always conscious of the alarm level and the the difficulties it brings the higher it gets. More to follow....			"

It has that X-COM feel yet Splinter Cell with a bit of Metal Gear. Add in the charming art work and great all-around game and strategy mechanics, and you got an incredible rogue-like game. There are times I've played I thought would be impossible to get out of but the game is so well made that you'll find a way...some way. Anyways, it's 2:36 AM and I've just been playing this STRAIGHT since I got it logging at 11.3 hrs. 10 out of freakin' 10. Would Invisible again.			"

												Invisible Inc. is a great game with a well-designed difficulty. The ""beginner"" difficulty, for instance, is not that easy ; it essentialy allows you to rewind five times in a game, in order to try to correct your mistakes. But the core mechanics remain the same and there's not much room for improvisation.You have to try this game if you like tactical games and stealth gameplay.Piece of advice though : you should buy the expansion, but I think that, before installing it, you better finish the original game once, with the beginner difficulty. The expansion adds indeed tools and agents that are a bit too helpful for the beginners.			"

												One of the best games I've played in years. I've been playing roguelikes (real roguelikes like DCSS, Rogue, DoomRL) for years now, and I can safely say as a vet of the genre that this game is a genuine roguelike. Random generation, satisfying character progression, and filled with systems that are both entirely fair and brutally unforgiving.Perhaps one of this game's strengths is that it is such a beautifully crafted roguelike but at the same time it has a suite of options to help introduce the game to a less masochistic playerbase. Rewinds, tweakable campaign settings, and the beginner difficulty all mean that you can play this game at whatever level of involvement you want. I will say that you shouldn't buy/play this expecting a deep campaign. Its charming and engaging, but its just a frame with which to present these beautiful systems, and assuming you know what you're doing you can finish one successful run of the game in 3-5 hours.Easily a 10/10Already looking forward to the DLC.

												Background: I have played a few Rogue-Like games and I am an IT Guy in real life so the whole hacking/technology thing piques my interest 10 fold.  I also play and DM Shadowrun so I was in for this game 100%.First and Foremost: It is a Rogue-like with a rich cast of characters each with unique abilities to assist them in carrying out their tasks.  They cover a wide range of play styles from CQB to straight up speed and subterfuge. That being said some characters only work well in certain game types and some seemingly not at all.  There are many guides and forums available that detail how/when/where to use Agents. It does all come down to personal preference. Speaking of which this game plays much like Shadowrun, except your Agents all go down in 1 Hit. Floor/Enemy Mechanics: Vision plays a huge part for both the Enemy and your Agents. Guards don't ignore Movement and there isn't a ""maybe"" Mechanic. They investigate every slip up. Floors have sound sensors, locked doors, automated turrets, laser beam sensors, robots that are immune to Stun, and Cameras that feedback to the enemies. It has a real nice sense of Realism.Resources: Power is the Main Resource Utilized by Incognita for hacking, but does have other uses. One agent even uses Power to Stun Guards Multiple Times per Round.  Each agent has Equipment that can help them navigate and disable Guards. This ranges from Non-Lethal and Lethal weapons, grenades, holo projectors, cloaking devices and more.Agent Mechanics: All Agents have Unique abilities that help you in some way to fit a play style. Some excel at Combat. Some are good at Energy Management. Others at Mobility.  Incognita Mechanics: So along with your Agents is Incognita your AI System who you interface with in the Hacking Layer of the Level. She relies on Power to hack terminals, disable sensors, and take over enemy Robots and Turrets. She also has a suite of programs that allow her to perform more advanced functions like creating sound to distract guards or to override Enemy Shielding.  However her power is not without risk. Some terminals are infected with malware that cause detriments to her abilities and to those of your agents. This can include needing more power to hack terminals, bringing extra guards onto the map and even being locked out of hacking all together. Final Thoughts: The Level of Realism this game brings to the table makes it Challenging everytime you play on any difficulty. I find myself on Easy sometimes losing on the first level due to the Random Generation of the Level.Also this game can be VERY UNFORGIVING. One screw up and it could be game over in mere moments. I love this. It makes me care about my Agents. This does it for me 100%.As Always watch gameplay before buying!			"

												Another marvelous showing from Klei, Invisible Inc. delivers on everything that makes roguelites/likes great. Its challenging, tense, and always encourages players to think outside the box and address problems in interesting ways. As normal for the studio, not only do they offer rocksolid mechanics, but also deliver incredibly in sound, music, theme, and mood. While this game is undoubtedly a roguelike (which 9 times out of 10 means a light story), the characters' banter and the overall vibe of the game really makes me wish there was more there.For the player that aren't fans of the tense gameplay, the options are versatile enough to allow lots of tweaks to suit your playstyle. For example, many negative reviews highlight that you aren't allowed to 'take your time', because every stage grows more dangerous the longer you stay there. However, you can turn off the creeping alarm completely so you can take your time. You can also make disabling guards last longer, allow yourself to find more money, or even decrease the number of guards per stage. Inversely, you can go full on masochist Iron Man, and remove the option to rewind turns, the ability to abort missions, and enforce a real time Time Attack that ends the turn if you take too long making decisions.To be honest, I was hesitant when I first read up on the game some years ago. I never thought turned-based and stealth could work together, but Klei married them together beautifully. As a design junkie, it was a joy to follow this game through early access, seeing how tiny changes completely shifts the gameplay with each update. As mentioned, the story does suffer, and comes to a VERY abrupt end (perhaps a higher difficulty allows you to go further? I don't know). However, if Don't Starve is anything to go by, we'll see more content before long, and I honestly can't wait.			"

								If you are a fan of calculated puzzle solving with a little stealth gameplay sprinkled in, then Inivisible, Inc. is for you. I picked it up because I enjoy the X-COM style turn-based decision making, coupled with great art style from Klei, this is shaping up well. It's a challenging game; even on easy it can be unforgiving. All too often I find my agents essentially too far afield and unable to navigate the room maze back to the elevator. The challenge is what makes this game the most rewarding for me.  Looking forward to seeing the final product.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. The initial story mode felt really half-baked and the gameplay wasn't engaging enough to pull me back into its procedurally generated side -- and I really tried. I think this could have been a great tactics game if there was less emphasis on it becoming some kind of roguelike. This was especially disappointing as it felt like Klei failed everthing that they got so right with Mark of the Ninja.			"

Early Access Review
								Just got the early access for myself at Thanksgiving.  Great game again by Klei (ryhmes w/ Play).  If you like chess played on random boards.  You have to think a few moves ahead and ....  oh yeah .. your opponent gets a new knight or bishop every four or so turns.Where in Don't Starve you are always on the edge of panic every second, Invisible lets you worry about your move for minutes on end...  contemplating, choosing the best options before you, and then panicking as the corporation makes its turn..  or sighing relief as a gaurd passes an agent in the open.The art style is cool, inrteresting, and different which seems to be (or what is becoming) a signature of the company.The game has great potential (Multiplayer, Steam Workshop, or Play by email)  beyond already being a pretty darn  good turn based game.   Klei will continue to etch its name in the gaming industry pantheon with Invisible, Inc.Thanks for reading.PS.This could be a decent platform for E-sport turn-based play, something I think is lacking in the e-sport world.  Flex the brain instead of Twitch muscles "

												I've only been an hour into this game but so far it's really fun and super stressful. If you're into stealth and strategy, this is for you.Edit: Almost three hours in and I've beat the story in beginner and I was kind of sad to see how short the story was. That could have been that it was on beginner but this game seems to have a lot of replay value. I still highly recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								Invisible, Inc. is a game of risk vs reward. Beginning each adventure with only two operatives you have everything to lose, even in the very fist mission. It can take a while finding a play style that works.However, despite all this, it is very satisfying when you begin to get good at it. Slipping passed guards, cracking safes, and generally having a plan go off without failure feels great. The more things you attempt to pull off, the more can go wrong and Invisible, Inc. challenges you to get better as it ramps up the difficulty considerably as the game continues. This may be my only gripe. As each level is randomly generated to a point, sometimes there can be purely trap rooms between you and your goal (sometimes even straight out of the door) and it makes it impossible to win. You could have planned levels in advance, but other than that, it's impossible to foretell. I think this may have been a mistake on the end of the random generations and may be fixed by the developer, but it's hard to tell sometimes.Klei Entertainment is a good company and they do listens to what their fans want. They've made a well polished, great looking and sounding game. Invisible, Inc. is both worth putting time into playing, and also watching out for in the future, as each update until release seems to change the gameplay in small but refreshing ways. Two thumbs up.			"

												You know what really sucks? I tried so hard to like this game. I love stealth games and I love turn-based tactical games. I thought that combining the two would bring about a Godly game. I thought wrong. This game gets extremely repetitive and loses its luster after one playthrough. Oh, by the way there are only like 5 missions in the entire story. Snore. I'd definitely not buy this for the price it's currently out for... maybe for free, but not this price.			"

												Well, the game entises you to believe it is a long, well planned campaign, with the actaul campaign consisting of about 5 missions before you're forced in the final mission!!!Would be a good 5 pound game for what you get.There is seriously no progression to the game, unlike XCOM, where the missions are lacking and the character progression is pointless. Not worth it, don't buy it. Full stop.			"

												Not as good as everyone seems to think it is. I don't really get the fuss over this game. The progressive upgrades of the four primary attributes are ... unexciting. Other enhancements and items don't seem to change the gameplay that much. Speaking of which, the gameplay is somewhat tedious and the overall movement and mechanics are a bit awkward. Exploring a whole level feels like grind - the rewards are typically mediocre and predictable.Meh.			"

												Even on the easiest difficulty level of this game is too much of a challenge for me. Guards will literally appear out of nowhere and kill your agents. If you don't do everything exactly right first time on each mission then you have to replay it again - but they're randomly generated so you can never learn from your mistakes!Endlessly frustrating, don't buy if you think it's going to be anything like any other turn based game, don't buy if you want a relaxing game that you can play every now and then.I really think that a lot of people who give this a positive vote haven't played it and are going by the groovy pictures.

												Very fun game.  A much different take on turn-based strategy as the game is extremely stealth heavy.  Different characters can be unlocked that offer different playstyles, but by in large the game is intended for stealth type play.   It is very fun though, and uses familiar mechanics to other turn-based games, like actions points for each character, which make it easy to jump into.The weapons and gadgets are interesting and different.  Stun guns that daze enemies so you can get away.  Stun darts, mobile cameras, controlling enemy robots.The difficulty settings though could use some tweaking.  You can play with different aspects of how hard the gameplay is and it doesn't seem like you can get it to a medium difficulty.  There's either hard, hardish, and easy.  But don't take that the wrong way, the game is challenging, which is good. "

Each run through is quick, and when using different agents and Incognito programs, you get a different feel for the run as their starting powers are unique enough to make a difference to how to play. Also, as you can only do so many missions in the 3 days, picking which ones (and which type of mission) makes each run that more unique			"

												Very very short main campaign, but it's built around ""rogue-lite"" mechanics, or something; once you've finished it, you start again but with some new characters and abilities unlocked, so it becomes a (potentially-) different challenge each time.The core turn-based stealth mechanic itself is fun, but the new characters you unlock as you complete the campaign each time never seemed all that great. So too for the new abilities. So after a handful of playthroughs (enough for 30+ hours, mind) I'd gotten used to the idea that nothing fundamentally new was happening each time, despite the unlocks, and after that just got frustrated with it.

												It's a bit like someone started with Shadowrun Returns,then stripped out the combat to focus on stealth, then stripped out story for a linear generic-spy-group plot, then severely dumbed down the upgrade mechanics and replaced XP with money,then cartoon-ified the visuals,and then arbitrarily limited campaign length and added things that unlock via playthrough to encourage replay.For what it is, it's not bad. I remember feeling that Shadowrun Returns was surprisingly heavy on the combat and light on the core of the tabletop game, which was always espionage and stealth. Invisible has a saturday morning cartoon feel to it that keeps the tone light as your little trenchcoated minions ambush and taser unsuspecting security guards.However, don't hope for character developement, involved plot, or indeed any originality. Invisible rips off most of its language straight from Shadowrun except where it uses generic cyberpunk to avoid having to actually worldbuild.			"

												Invisible Inc is a stealth based turn based strategy game by the same studio that produced the stealth masterpiece that was Mark of the Ninja so it's safe to say they at least have a bit of experience with how to be sneaky.You control a team of secret agents as they hop across the globe stealing from vast corporations while trying to just survive another day.Each mission is procedurally generated so you have no idea what the next mission will bring.The gameplay is very similar to Xcom and there are many elements that are shared with Mark of the Ninja.I go into more detail in my video review but suffice it to say Invisible Inc is a wonderfully well done entry into the turn based and stealth genres.

Early Access Review
								I bought this game when it was litterally in the pre-alpha state, and it known simply as ""Incognita"". Back then, it was intense, even if it was barely playable. There was more action (Deckard started with a silenced gun since the beginning of every stage, for example), and the atmosphere was more ""James-Bondish"". Things changed, it seems. PG direction is no more choosable, and those darn elevators now have a cooldown. Weapons are rare, and all the ""grid thing"" was simplyfied. But do not take this as a complain: Invisible Inc. is still an incredible game, where truly, every action matters, even the simpliest one, like closing a door or hacking stuff in a particular order. The IA still needs some work, in my opinion, since it prefers to privilege quantity over quality, when depolying threats for your party.Tl, dr: it started as a great game. It's becoming a slighty different, yet awesome game. Catch it as fast as you can.			"

												Another very good game from Klei . What i like most about this game is the amount of options you have to tailor the game to your liking and to make it as challenging as you want. It's also a change from most of the turn based games as it's about stealth and avoiding trouble . It also has a really good risk/reward system that tempts you into trying a bit more than you can handle to get some more loot. Though an individual campaign might not be that long there is a lot of replayability through having a good selection of stuff to unlock that can change how you play and adds variety . The game is definetly designed to be played multiple times. I like games that make me think each turn what should i be doing and how to do it and also have the tension of knowing it could all go horribly wrong if you make a mistake. It can be a challenge and you can tweak it to make it as hard or easy as you like.Definetly worth buying if you think you might enjoy it , it does what it says on the tin. "

												Its fun, but sufers from a near complete lack of replay ability. The only real decisions you can make to add replayability are to change your programs and agents, but even that feels like almost nothing. Its like making a new wizard in WoW, getting it to max level, and then making another one and choosing different talents.Definately not worth its price, has a total playtime of around 4 hours, less if you don't try to collect everything. Don't get fooled by steam workshop either, most of it is just language packs because the developers couldent be bothered to translate anything.Buy if it goes on sale for something like 90% off, otherwize just ignore it.

												When I say that Invisible, Inc. has “virtually” infinite replay value, I mean to say that while it is not mathematically possible to comprehensively experiment with all the variables, such as starting agent duo, I do not believe that this is the kind of game that should be played exhaustively, and that is why I struggle with it as a package. I do believe that it is a good game, but I feel that what keeps it from being a great game is a palatable lack of balance and direction.The regular campaigns are brief enough so that any single session does not overstay its welcome, and that is intelligent design. However, a consequence of deriving inspiration from a roguelike is that not every playthrough is fun. Even when I win, it’s because I am scraping by with skill, although I would prefer to experiment with cool gadgets. Endless mode is a solution to the abbreviated campaign, increasing the likelihood of maxing out four agents to a certainty as long as the player is talented enough to not lose. At times, I feel that endless mode the best, “unintentionally intended” way to play Invisible, Inc., but then again, as of this writing, I am on day 11 of endless and my agents seem invincible even at alarm level 6 (based shock trap III). I feel challenged, but I don’t fear losing. Then again, I routinely play games involving heavy strategy. Overall, I would recommend Invisible, Inc. to gamers looking for some strategy in their lives, but are disinterested in a game with a skill ceiling as high as the nosebleed section.Full Review: http://www.geeksundergrace.com/gaming/pc/review-invisible-inc/ "

								I've had this game for a while know, ever since it was called Incognita, and I gotta tell you, this game has evolved massively since then.  It used to be a kind of turnbased rpg where the goal was more or less ""complete goal X then leave the building"" but now it is more of a roguelike, but it has an amazing twist on the genre.  Since you play as a spy, and most teams don't even start with weapons, you have to us stealth, hacking, and lock-picking to make it through the hostile buildings you find yourself in.  This might sound boring, sneak in and out while gathering anything you can, but it leads to some absurdly tense moments.  One such moment for myself was when I had been spotted and knocked out one guard while I had another one already knocked out but I couldn't just leave them knocked out because they would wake up 2 turns from one another blowing my cover completely so I waited maybe 20 minutes trying to make a plan to escape, I failed.  Two agents permanently gone.  It's a wonderful game and I recommend it to roguelike fans, stealth fans, and tactics fans.			"

												A great turn-based tactics that looks like a mix of XCOM and Splinter Cell. You control several agents as they infiltrate and pillage different facilities.The main campaign is really short (5-6 hours tops), but there's an endless mode. Even better, all locations are randomly generated with different rooms, guards, cameras, security bots. etc. This adds a lot of replayability, especially since there are 4 preset difficulties and you can tailor a custom difficulty by changing various game settings.You also unlock new agents and AI abilities (programs & hacks) by getting XP for completed missions. So each time you start a new game, not only you can choose other difficulty settings, but different agents and abilities as well.			"

												[Edit : Suggested Strategy at the bottom]Invisible Inc is a very good surprise. I usually enjoy team-based tactical games, and this blend of stealth and hacking is really engaging for me.I think the game truly shines by the way it manages tension. During a mission, even if you can crawl and hack your way discretely to your objectives, the alarm level still rises and you're only a turn away from a very stressed situation where guards surrounds you and make you sweat like hell.  In between mission, since you have a time limit, you'll have to make tough choices between gaining access to facilities, acquiring money, items or improving your agents.Depth and replay value comes from the procedural map generation and the multiple improvements for your agents (skills, augments, items) or your IA (programs), The art direction is excellent and really contributes to the game's readability (an important feature since you have to monitor multiple agents, sometimes in different places, and also the Incognita network).Suggested Strategy (for casual play)- Choose Beginner Mode- Start with Internationale and Banks- Start with Power Drip (+1 Power / turn) and Parasite (Progressive hack) // Flow- Use Internationale to ""scout"" doors and surroundings ; Use Parasite to hack Cameras, shops (items or programs), Safes, eventually Drones - forget the sound bugs - you can walk pass them.- Use Banks to ""knock out"" guards, drag them and paralyze them ; and also, check locked doors and eventually unlock them.// Development- Augment Internationale with the ability to gain AP each time you hack a firewall (Network Download) ; equip her with a rechargeable pistol and keep a charge. Internationale should use her weapons only in last resort - her role is to uncover most of the map as fast as possible.- Augment Banks with the ability to reduce item cooldown each time you use one item (Torque Injectors) ; equip her with several neural disruptors.- Buy these programs as fast as you can : Data Blast (-1 Firewall in 5 square radius), Leash (+1 turn to control Drones), Taurus (Move Daemons) - some can be tricky to use and require good timing.// Mission Order- Free another agent as soon as you can !- Remember to buy items and programs in Shops scattered in maps- Go for : Programs, Items and Weapons in that order if possible // Third agent- You cannot control the agent you'll get, so take advantage of their augment. For example, with Shalem, he starts with a +1 Armor Ranged Weapons so I usually give him a rechargeable Rifle up to +2 Armor ; I augment him with a +1 Armor Melee Weapon so I do the same with a Neural Disruptor +2.// Misc Items & Skills- I suggest you first buy skills only when you need them ; later when you have more credits, you could add Strengh (more items, less encumberance, better drag) and Speed (more APs).// Buy & Sell- Remember that you can buy and SELL items to Monst3r, and Shops (regular and super).Well, this is not a complete strategy guide, but I found this combination quite pleasing for casual play :)			"

												ok. this game is awesome and a must try. The players who love heavy strategy games must try this. The game is pretty good and even fun. Each move you do changes what happens next. The game is amazing and you can customise it as you want it. The support team is extremely helpful as well. This game is a must try. If you haven't experienced the support by Klei, then you havent lived to your fullest			"

Early Access Review
								I've had this game for a while know, ever since it was called Incognita, and I gotta tell you, this game has evolved massively since then.  It used to be a kind of turnbased rpg where the goal was more or less ""complete goal X then leave the building"" but now it is more of a roguelike, but it has an amazing twist on the genre.  Since you play as a spy, and most teams don't even start with weapons, you have to us stealth, hacking, and lock-picking to make it through the hostile buildings you find yourself in.  This might sound boring, sneak in and out while gathering anything you can, but it leads to some absurdly tense moments.  One such moment for myself was when I had been spotted and knocked out one guard while I had another one already knocked out but I couldn't just leave them knocked out because they would wake up 2 turns from one another blowing my cover completely so I waited maybe 20 minutes trying to make a plan to escape, I failed.  Two agents permanently gone.  It's a wonderful game and I recommend it to roguelike fans, stealth fans, and tactics fans.			"

												This game is AWESOME!!!!!, If you're a Spy fan this is a must buy. There is a lack of spy games out there and the ones that have come out are about some rouge spy finding out his agency betrayed him now he/she is on the run (boring). Real espionage is about team work and using the resources and intel provided by your agency; Invisible Inc has that and much much MORE!!!!.... With randomly generated maps, random mission orders in every new play through, an endless mode, you're not just playing a spy; you're living the life and career as one.  This is the best spy game since Sid Meier's Covert Action.I'd give it 2 thumbs up if I could.Klei you guy's and gal's kick A$$ :)			"

Invisible, Inc. is the perfect balance between your stealth, largely non-lethal combat, and cunning against the all powerful corporations who have black listed you. Fully random levels and make millions of different runs through the game; and the mod community is amazing at enhancing the base game even farther.

You can play in endless mode if you wihsh, so it never stops generating missions to do, or you can set that after X number of missions u ""finish"" that playthrough. Also u have to keep in mind that every single map is diferent from the last u did, u will never find the same map again (thats f... awesome for me)			"

Invisible Inc. is a game that looks and feels great and gets better with every replay. I can't sing its praises enough! I highly recommend.			"

It's a load of fun, and when you roll the dice and take a risk that pays off, it's incredibly satisfying. Plus, let's face it, Klei's games are always worth a look.

												Highly recommended. Invisible, Inc. must be one of the best turn based strategy games I've played recently. There's a lot of possibility for customisation of play strategy. There is no damage randomisation or so, and you can calculate the outcome of your every turn. The game is quite difficult, and sometimes you can lose due to bad luck (awful gear drops), but invisible Inc. is short and it's easy to start yet another game. Play-through value is high, the levels are random-generated, and there's a lot of starting agents to choose from. With each play-through you even open new characters and in-game hacking software.

												I finished 3 campaings (easy, advanced, expert) in about 7 hours and I don't see what more the game has to offer. Sure you can pump up the difficulty to the max but as the difficulty increases it becomes more and more apparent how RNG plays a huge role to your success. It's no surprise being a rogue-like, indie title but I truly believe the game would be far superior by ditching this tired, attention grabbing strategy. Taking the wrong path to your objectives, rescuing a sub-par agent or not getting a useful item/upgrade can pretty much ruin a run. You can roll with the punches and keep going but you'll feel gimped along the way.In conclusion, the game is too short for the 20 euro pricetag. Getting it for 6 and spending a enjoyable 8 hours with it was perfect for a relaxed gaming weekend but don't expect a memorable experience. "

												The interface and feel are polished and stylized.  It's also a pure stealther, which I normally enjoy.Unfortunately, a number of gameplay issues make it far less fun.First, your success in each mission is far more subject to the luck of the randomizer than your skill.  Every bad level leaves you less prepared for the final one.  In my case, I only had one chance to add an agent so I was also 1 short for the end mission.Second, you can't afford to max out all your agents, so you end up specializing each one.  The problem is, due to the random levels, you split them up to cover ground and just hope the right agent encounters the right stuff.Lastly, it's extremely unclear what is important to improve/buy.  For instance, you might increase an agents loot finding results marginally and then discover that without armor piercing weapons you are unable to handle higher levels.  Then, you ""solve"" that by exiting levels without clearing them, since the timer makes things dicier the longer you take.This means you get even less resources for subsequent, harder, levels.   Thus compounding the problem into a gloriously pointless end mission.  My first time on the final mission (which just pops on you) I simply did not have enough power to complete the mission.  I was getting +1/turn but it was clearly impossible to finish the first, let alone second, mission objectives.  The only solution is to restart the whole campaign and ""try harder"" on the lead up missions.  Since the campaign is so short, that's not so bad, but leaves you feeling pretty crappy about the whole experience.			"

Invisible Inc. – A Steam Review[Disclamer - I was provided a copy of by the publisher for review purposes]The goodPerfectly tuned turn-based stealth mechanics Unique graphic style – as per Klei’s pedigreeRandomly generated levels offer countless hours of replayabilityThe not so good: The story is generic at bestPlayers need to get used to the idea of a rogue-like turn based stealth game – I found it frustrating to die so many times. Objectively, I’m not the best stealth player ever, but the game was pretty punishing The conclusion: Combining perfectly the spy genre with turn based tactics, ala X-Com, Klei proves once again that they have the stealth gameplay mechanics on lock. Must buy game for fans of the genre, while newcomers might find it a bit punishing.You can see gameplay here -

												The year is 2074. Corporations own everything. You are part of an underground resistance unit.You break into procedurally generated, corporate buildings. You hack into computer terminals, upgrade character statistics, buy software and weapons and try not to pi** your pants. The tension is palpable. There are three difficulty levels: beginner; experienced; expert. The game is turn-based strategy, with a built-in mechanic to rewind time.""Hitman 2: Silent Assassin"" meets ""Deus Ex"" ( 2000 ) meets ""X COM: Enemy Unknown"" ( 2012 ).I've become horribly addicted to this game and have not showered in a week!

												ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?Okay, this is a good game, and I've finished it on beginner in about 24hrs according to steam, I'm playing with dlc and I haven't played it with out before. All seems good. So you beat the game and then sink another 6 hrs in to experienced mode.  Two problems, one, the disconnect from coming from super powered agents way back to basic agents on a harder difficulty setting is jarring, you make too many mistakes.Second is just how hard this is with out level resets, and the difficulty seems to have been adjusted too much, what is a 2nd or 3rd mission is very hard with out the correct hack tool, which you know from beginner you get later... It's not vastly different from beginner, but the combination of disabling level restarts - so you have to start the entire campaign again - and the addition of trying new characters out is too much. Then also the difficult shield level is way out, you don't have the hack tools needed. This can be fixed by enabling level restarts - but then you're not playing experienced you're playing custom, no awards for that.On first play through most people I assume would be doing stealth and avoiding kills, the default characters are this way. You happen to get a couple of characters later which are geared around killing which would be best for a second play through - I just don't see myself playing through beginner again though to get use to it. Also on experienced, even when you ARE experienced, the shield difficulty indicators, the things which tell you how hard something is going to be, were way out. 2nd or 3rd mission in a 2 or 3 level became impossible because I didn't have the right hacking tool (area effect hack), but having played beginner I know that that tool wouldn't be got so early.(I think I got up to turn 37-45 in one map, dragging a body along a map which was basically one long corridor while 8 guards swamped around, a lot of micro. Obviously it wasn't meant to get like that and should rewind before, but it was fun enough to do.)This may be a problem of expectation. Because some in beginner which are marked as ""do not advice infiltrating"" level 5-6 aren't that hard, yet on experienced a level 2-3, what should have been easy, wasn't. I'm wondering if it would have been better to have started the game on experienced, just so the expectation was set, but even so. Or to have my suped up agents from beginner carry over, just so I could tell if it's the agents or the game.It can sometimes degenerate into a game of drag the body and sit on it, but there are other tools available (like an 8 turn ko syringe)and I'm sure I've not seen even half of them really, it will take a few more play throughs.

Early Access Review
								Don't listen to those reviews complaining about the difficulty. This game is hard as nails and it owns up to it. This is not a game for the weak of heart, or more critically, the weak of mind. This is not a game that you can sit down and play and expect to have a casual fun time. This is a game that will beat you into the ground until you have that glorious ""ah ha!"" moment when you finally figure out how to proceed in this game. Once you get over that difficulty hump, this game can be extraordinarily rewarding. That feeling you get when you just barely get your agents and the cash/intel/prisoners to safety is about as exhilerating as a game can get.			"

Took me 6 hours to finish this game on Beginner difficulty. I loved every minute of it!I bought this game yesterday at the end of the weekend sale, not too sure if I deemed it worth 12 bucks, but after finishing the campaign on the easiest difficulty in 6 hours (almost in 1 sitting). I'm sure this game is going to played and enjoyed more than you usually get for this kind of price. I tend to divide the price by playtime, to see if a game is worth it's money. GTA V kept me busy for 90 hours at 60 euro, so 0.66 euro per hour. Witcher 3 kept me, so far, occupied for 110 hours for 25 euro, so less than 25 cents per hour. This game will definitely clock in 12+ hours and thus reaching the value of 1 buck per hour - a steal!These days a lot of games are more about graphics than gameplay. This game, though the artstyle is amazing, is definitely more about gameplay. It's basically a turn-based puzzle, where the pieces get mixed after every turn. Progression feels really good and it's almost sad to start over, but the increased difficulty and the unlockables between playthroughs (another level of progression) make it worth it anyway. The random generated levels make playing through the campaign 3 times still a lot of fun.There are a few different missions, which mostly means you get a different rewards for reaching your objective, but apart from that they're all pretty much the same. The beauty in this lies in the random level design. You might get dropped in an impossible situation, where you actually have to trigger an extra alarm, just to continue, because the deactivation station lies out of reach. You will definitely have to use all of your wit combined with your spy gadgets, to finish a level - especially because some of the mechanics are very unforgiving and this gets worse as difficulty increases (a simple misclick can result in the death of an agent).The story is okay, the artstyle is brilliant and the gameplay takes this game home.The developers seem to have a love for bringing really cool games and giving you value for your money, so if you're even slightly interested in this title, definitely pick it up!Too long, did not read?Pros:- Gameplay!- Unique artstyle- Very good replay value- Workshop/mod support- Support indie-titles!- Still receives updates and bugfixesCons:- Short campaign- No multiplayer support- Unable to undo a misclick			"

Early Access Review
								With a game in beta, it can sometimes be hard to determine whether or not to recommend it.  But Invisible Inc. has some issues that seriously need to be worked out before a full launch.I don't have an issue with hard games.  But what makes Invisible Inc. difficult in its beta has little to do with requirng practice or any skill on the part of the player.  Invisible Inc is difficult in the way that winning on a slot machine in Vegas is difficult: the player is at the mercy of sheer dumb luck.  Even the easiest of missions will have your team dead in two rounds if the random number generator (the floor layout for each mission is randomly generated) is unkind, which is more often than not the case.

												In summary, Adam Jensen found a copy of X-COM ...and augmented himself with it.  The awesomeness was too much for either game, so Invisible, Inc popped back out.  You're welcome.I haven't yet beaten the game, but the *potential* for replayability is immense here.  Given the reviews, I don't expect to be satisified by the story, or even ""endless"" mode.  Hopefully, a DLC will add some on-going story elements, a campaign, or what this game really needs: A meta-game where your orginization can truly be ""Invisible"" and play a dangerous game of whittling down the power of the corporations: sabotaging projects, siphoning information, stealing money, ferreting spies, establishing assets, evil corporate DOUBLE AGENTS!, all while keeping your organization's HQ from being wiped out (again) if you leave too much evidence behind.  Lose an agent?  Find him/her and extract before they break under interrogation!  Fail, and it's back into exile w/two random agents.  Corporations, left to themselves, could have power-struggles between them that could allow them to gobble each other up, becoming even more dangerous, and more focused on you.... I could go on and on...@klei - The roots are RIGHT THERE!  I can't recommend this game until something along those lines happens.  I *really* want to.  ...so make me.			"

Big kudos to Klei for making such great use of early access and delivering in any way possible. I highly recommend this game to anyone, since it is an unique experience which never has been realized before, and thus should not be put off with arguments like: ""I didn't like x so i won't like this."".

												I would dare to say the combat system of this game is better than X-com. 1 square moving, 1 degree line of sight, every aspect of the combat system really makes me say ""This is A FXXXing great game."" I literally kept saying that during the gameplay.However, a really tragic thing is that there's no story here. Even if the game is great, people need some stairs to reach there. I really want to play more, I really want to try other agents, but combats without story makes this not a game, but rather a labor. I really wish Devs could consider it when they make the next game. If they had written some decent stories and integrated it with the combat system, this game definitely could have been the top 3 game of 2015.Still, system itself is really damn great. I saw another great possibility of 'Klei'. I am hopefully expecting the next game with deep stories and narratives, as a perfect art work. Think of the game 'Skyrim', the show 'Game of throne'. People are thrilled with those Arts because they have stories.Was it really hard to make more stories? I have always hated dirty companies who try scam with DLCs, but I'd gladly buy tons of DLCs of this game because the game itself is absolutely perfect.			"

												This game is garbage in my opinion, pure and simple. Mind you, i LIKE stealth games, strategy games, turn based game mechanics AND the art style, so this seems like a match made in heaven. Except It's not.It's something about strategy games that try to hurry you up that angers me immensly. It's strategy, aren't I supposed to properly think things through and make plans? Yes? Okay, then why do you give me timers? I am so angry I am almost beyond words.Example: Every five turns something bad happens so you need to hurry up. To get where you need to go you need to knock out 2-3 guards, no avoiding it. The game actively punishes you for killing people by making the timer go faster so you knock them out. Except they only stay knocked out for three rounds unless someone is sitting ontop of them like a schoolyard bully in third grade. Alright, so you either gotta leave someone behind or drag the guard with you. Except you needed to knock out 3 guards and you had three people. Okay, dragging it is then. Except you can only move 3-4 squares at a time while dragging them making the mechanic almost useless. That turn timer is still on by the way.Tick tock.Okay, fine. Leave the guards how bad could it be when they wake up?Three rounds later and they wake up and zero in on you faster than shark smelling blood. ready to crush your hopes and dreams. Okay, maybe i can knock them out again? Nope, they have guns and you do not have the drop on them.Also now the turn timer decided to filter in more guys and reveal your position.Can i run? Nope, one guy is watching the door, that means that if your guys leave the room they get shot. All of them. In a row. By one guy. A guy you knocked out but didn't take his firearm away from him, so he can still hurt you. Yup.Fun.If you enjoy this game, or this synopsis of my experience playing it makes you want to buy it, you may want to consider investing in a multi-tailed whip.Self flaggelation has got to be at LEAST as fun as playing this steaming pile of refuse.That said, i give this game a 5/10. Even if It Is absolute garbage, at least It's functional garbage.Get It If It's under five bucks and you need help taking that last step off the balcony.			"

												Just finished the game on beginner... felt extremely short. Is there more content if I complete it on a harder difficulty?I was expecting something similar in length to the turn based XCom games, new or old. It felt like 1/10 of that.I read one review that said the game feels a bit ""flat"", I'd have to agree. There is just not enough stuff in it, actually feels like a well polished first level rather than an entire game.Having said all that I do recommend it, as it's one of the best examples of how to execute a classic turn based squad game. Despite not breaking much new ground, it does what it does well, has good music and personality delivered through the now trademark Klei animations.The game fashions itself as a rogue-like, if I had to guess they were trying to go for replayability on par with something like FTL. Unlike FTL, the game just isn't deep enough to leave me wanting to try it again. I didn't feel like I missed out on anything. There were no paths I felt like I should have taken or challenges I wished I completed. Perhaps these things do exist, but the important thing is that I didn't _feel_ like I missed them or missed out on them. You do get some upgrades in tech, agents and abilities, but they're not nearly as interesting as the ships you unlock in FTL or the tech trees in XCom games.If you can wait for it to go on sale, I would. If you're thinking of making a turn based squad game then you should buy and study it. If you're looking for a fun game to play then paying full price for it doesn't make much sense. The ending definitely leaves room for a sequel, perhaps they have plans for free episodic content? If so, it would have been nice for them to leave a ""To be continued"" at the end of the credits.

								This review is obviously just about the current state of the game. Right now I think this game is highly overprized. Although the mechanics work well and I didn't encounter any bugs there is just not much to do. The so called ""story mode"" isn't worth it's name. There's just a tiny textblock before you are thrown into a mission. And that's pretty much all you do. Start a mission get some money to level up, grab some items and leave the building.  You repeat this until you die. You unlock new characters but right now there seem to be just 4 characters (2 of which you have right from the start).The design seems to be pretty nice but it's highly repetetive as well. Most buildings look pretty much alike, although the rooms are in a different order and stuff like that. I do think this game has potential. With a well made story, FAR more things to unlock than there are right now, and some new textures for buildings and stuff like that, this could be a fun game. But even after all that I think 20€ are quite alot to ask for this.			"

												I enjoyed the first two levels. After that it's just tortuously hard, achieved by simply throwing enemies at you until you fail.It doesn't matter how careful a spy you are, the game fakes a constantly rising threat level so even if you never put a foot wrong, the game will detect you every three or four moves and send another couple of fresh and increasingly well-armed troops to find you. It becomes not so much a game of sneaking, but a game of pathetically dancing around one square on the grid that for some reason no guard ever investigates, until the game decides to send three new guards to that exact spot.Not much fun.Only get this if you actively enjoy almost impossible challenges, even on 'Easy'.

												Weird game to review. Pro's: Great art. Really really prettyNice atmosphere. Very cyberpunk. Good OST adds to it. Good gameplay. Game made me anxious each time and i cut a lot of missions too close to lose them or even not completing the main mission. Con's:Extremely small campaign.It took me 5 hours or less to finish it on the beginner level. So in the end if you are only interested in the story mode like me i would give it a pass. if you enjoy replaying games with more difficult options, time attacks, endless mode there is content there to pad up the time. Since there is no neutral option in review i would give it a pass due to the sort campaign mode. if you don't care about that  sure its a good game with satisfying gameplay.  "

												Weakest of the Klei title so far I think... and it hurts to say that.It's a wonderful game, but had I tried it I wouldn't buy it...You can't see crap, the graphic design is not as tight as most of their other games. Trouble seeing where the doors are, where you can or can't go, even if you rotate the view... it gets in the way of enjoyment because my turns take so long to perform... it's just so slow pace, way slower than X-Com and I felt that was slow. And everything is so small, the icons the typo...  I play on my TV so that doesn't help, but then again, all their other games were so perfect. I guess my expectations are way too high now with those guys. and the map are huge and full on difficult right from the get go so there is a lot of failure initially. It doesn't feel fun enough to really squint my eye and read the ton of text and upgrade stuff, where the core gameplay  is not that enjoyable really. It's move to, flick switch, move to, flick switch, get caught, start again...  Well, I only have 2 hours in it but yeah I got other games waiting I guess.			"

												What looks to be an incredibly polished turn based action game is actually hampered by poor UI design and incredibly boring gameplay. Most of the gameplay consisted of just walking from room to room and passing your turn (to get more AP so you can walk to another room).I am a big fan of Klei's other games, and the animation and style is clearly polished, but the gameplay and UI are lacking. I had to refund this one.PROS:-Great art-Good voice acting-Lots of modes (level generation)-Multiple agents with different abilitiesNEUTRAL:-The ""increasing alarm"" system is misguided. I assume the purpose is to make exploration a risk/reward system, but this system (combined with the excessive walk/pass, see below) got on my nerves rather quickly.CONS:-Terrible UI design (NOT intuitive at all)-REALLY boring gameplay. The distances that must be covered are too long, so you will constantly be moving all of your agents, then ending the turn to get more AP, then moving them again, then ending the turn again....SO exciting. -Although different agents existed, their differences were not very clear by reading the stat screens (crappy UI), nor is anything really explained (even starting with the easiest mode). In my first 4 missions there were a number of instances where I had to stand on a particular tile to reveal the presence of a camera across the room, but there is no way to know that ""this"" is the tile to stand on ( as opposed to all the ones next to it).

Now dont get me wrong, the game has amazing artwork, a very good gameplay, soundtrack and reaches all that goals, but it gets boring when you are in field playing by turns etc.So here is my tip, if you are looking to buy this game, keep in mind that the gameplay is calm and slowly paced. If it didnt reach your expectations, Mark of the Ninja (also from Klei) might be what you are looking for.			"

Do not make fun of war. You deal with different guys this time. It is not Germany of Afghanistan. George, your troops will be torn into pieces here. 250'000 of elite Iraqi soldiers are here. They will destroy everything they want, they can cross the whole desert in an hour and blow all your destroyers, journalists, diplomats. George you are a cowboy! Stop now! Forget it! Hide bullets in the warehouses away. And forget your daddy. We had one dumbass, he had revenged for his brother and the whole Glory Russian Empire crashed. And another weirdo who had revenged for his grandfather the USSR collapsed after that. And you will repeat these mistakes. Leave your father alone. He has finished his work already. Think about the future of the States, it is collapsing, young people flee from your country. Nobody wants to live in the States, NO ONE! It is a second-hand goods' store. Dollar, dollar, dollar! This is dirty green paper. Soulless! No composers, you have no writers. The whole World listens to Chaikovsky and Dostoevsky. Festivals, sport! Only in Russia. Russia here and Iraq. People love their president here and you are despised. Despised! Your predecessor — Clinton. He had his pants unzipped right in his office! Its all ♥♥♥♥ed up when some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the president's cabinet does a blow-job to mr. President. Is it what the USA is all about? Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥shall long. What are you doing out there? Monica! Nothing else metters — president, war, Middle East!♥♥♥♥♥♥suckers all around, handjobbers, ♥♥♥♥♥♥s! George! Watch any cowboy movie look how many dead bodies, blood. Murders here, murders there. Here… I'm talking to you from HERE! Look at the sky — it's Baghdad! Baghdad is not Berlin, is not Kabul. You will never win there as we know local people, we know this president. He is the only one on Earth who tells you to ♥♥♥♥ off. The only one! All others are too afraid in front of you, they stay in the line to bow low before you. And he is the only one who sits there for 11 years. For 11 years he's been resisting you! And you with your ""powerful"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥ economy, your million soldier army, your fleet and missiles can do nothing. You drop bombs daily, you kill children, while the Iraqi soldiers are ready to fight. You are afraid to send your troops there. And you have been afraid for 11 years, your papa had also feared. The apple never falls far from the tree. You will never win there! This will be your fatal fiasco. Napoleon has lost the Waterloo, Hitler has lost the battle for Berlin and you will lose Baghdad. Baghdad is your tomb. You hear me, George — damn cowboy? You need back to Texas, to your ranch. Drive around your empty lands in Jeep and start learning spanish. And New-York will have spoken russian already. We will send another 10 million of Russians to the States and will elect our own President for the US. And you, George, will get a good cell in the Butirka prison. Do you get me? George, you will never be victorious here. All Arabs and Muslims of the world, the whole eastern Europe, Moscow is against you. Moscow doesn't want this war and our President has clearly told you^ do not fire at Baghdad. Let's better blow up Tbilissi together or Baku, or other cities. We will find other targets on the Earth. The Earth is so large — we can sink Australia into the oceans depths if you like. Alright! Wanna see our missiles? Our weapons now… at night our scientists will change gravitation field of the Earth a little bit and your country will be under the water. 24 hours and your whole country will be under the water of the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. Think about who you are playing with? Think! You forgot what Bonapart's end, Hitler's end was, all others? You will make a historical mistake, your father won't be grateful to you, forget him, your daddy. Your generals tell you not to start war. Still it is not too late! Today is just the 21th of June 1941! But if tomorrow morning you send your fighters to Baghdad it will be your own tomb, you will die in this war. And no one will bury you as you hit the whole country, the whole humanity. 6 billions people do not want this war to happen SIX! SIX BILLION. You ignorant, do you know how to count? One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six billion. Whole planet is against you. You are the only one who wants war and this♥♥♥♥♥♥— Condoleezza Rice. She is a half-black ♥♥♥♥♥ who needs a good♥♥♥♥♥♥ Send her here, guys of our Taman division will make her satisfied, will make her happy in baraks in one night. She will not want war any more, she will choke in Russian sperm as it will be leaking out of her ears. She is not Monica Lewinsky who has made a single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There Condoleezza will be so sucked that she will creep to the US embassy in Moscow on her knees. George, STOP! George, better go to casino, Las Vegas and finish all. All quiet in Baghdad.			"

												Update: This game is unplayable in it's current version. The camera wants to pan to the middle of the map. I've tried everything, but I can't get the camera to stay centered on my agents, so I can't even start the tutorial. Reading the forums, other people have had this problem, with no clear solution. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It has a very cool theme and the gameplay is clever. The early access version gives you the sense that there is a cool world to explore and ways to improve the characters. The only problem is that with no way to save, and very difficult missions, you have to keep re-starting. For example, learning that I needed armor piercing to kill a guard only occured only after the mission had started. With the guard blocking a key point, and no way to kill the guard, there was no way to progress in the mission and no way to go back to a previou save.  The end result is that you get the feeling that all the neat stuff is out of reach as you replay the first missions again and again.			"

												Not a bad concept and art design however the randomly generated levels make getting into the story difficult as you may get one or two decent levels and than one in which is completely ridiculus or nigh impossible even on lower difficulties. Another game done in by the alure of randomly generated levels that would have done immensely better if it had care love and attetnion given to its levels like it did its characters. If you like arbritrary challenge this is your game, otherwise steer clear as their are alot better stealth games out there.			"

								Some up's in the game, some downs..+ Fun gameplay+ All the different maps feel unique+ Graphics+ Not at all hard or confusing to get into- Story took just over 5 hours for me - Once you're done with the storymode the game feels really repetitive- No difficult level which makes the game hard at first (didn't play the tutorial though..) but after some hours the game was just way too easy- If you're unlucky with the loots you can really get ♥♥♥♥ed over when you don't have anyone with armor-penetration just because it didn't drop or you couldn't afford itAll in all it's a good game but I just feel it's too expensive for the content.

								Don't get Early Access, wait until the bugs are fixed. The game is great, but intermittently causes rage-inducing total party kills with its bugs. This game isn't Bethesda-buggy, instead there are a few very precise bugs with gameplay. These bugs will get your team killed, on hour 60 of your playthrough, and the only mode of the game is Ironman, so no reloading.  Bugs like armour penetration upgrades not working on armoured enemies, guards shooting instantly instead of going to overwatch, and implants that don't proc when they say they will have all killed playthroughs.

												This is a game that was on my wishlist.  I enjoyed the introduction to the game and the backdrop.  That was about as much fun as I was going to have in the game.  Highly disappointed! :(The game is beautiful artwork and runs smoothly.  It opens and gives the player a basic tutorial on actions and abilities.But what really kills the fun is the inability to take all these high tech toys and abilities and do something useful.  When you start a level, you know only that your objective is somewhere in the game area and you have to search for it.  You can hack cameras, unlock safes, and disable drones that wander around.  You know what would be useful?A MAP OF WHERE THE OBJECTIVE IS LOCATION!That way, my operatives can move quickly to the location instead of fumbling around like keystone cops.  I know, sounds like an intelligent idea; to bad people in 2074 do not have those....Then there are the guards.  How they move about reminds me of ""Commando: Behind Enemy Lines"".  Unlike Commandos, my operatives have some sort of moral streak against killing guards.  Yes, they will not kill people, but steal their stuff and beat them up, that's OK.  The operatives start off as enemies of the state.  And the guards whom your up against are more than happy to kill youer operatives.Again, the game has many nice qualities.  But not  knowing where to go quickly nor neutralizing the guards enough not to be an issue later, is more aggrivating then fun.If Steam allowed for a 'maybe' option, I'd go for that.  If someone asked, I would explain things and help with what ever questions from my limited experience.  I just did not have fun with it.  Maybe it'll be fun for them!			"

												Gameplay is pretty good, story is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I mean that in the meanest possible way because I prepurchased this game back when it was called ""Incognita"" instead of this terrible pun. If you like stealth games, buy it and mute the sound(or find a suitable mod).When I say the story is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I mean the story literally ends with the AI using magic. Like, animates a lifeless object with electricity or ""quantum energy"" and... the point is: skip the cutscenes, mute the sound, and try to not read the flavor tooltips. Everything is a reference or a pun or worse. (Klei thought it was funny to include a poop joke in the cyborg character's alternate background.)			"

												Game is super overrated. It's cool in a lot of regards but the whole ""it's a campaign, sort of, but your supposed to play it over and over again"" is really lame IMO. It's not a survival game like don't starve.. It should be a tactical, stealth, story driven game. I was told this was Xcom, just rogue like. It's not at all. It's a mini game with very little substance.I don't really understand why it would be that much harder for Klei to make a real campaign, with slow story developments. Perhaps DLC?It just feels totally stupid to care about your characters or make meaningful decisions when the games ends like right after you start it.. Tetris you are supposed to play over and over, I get it.. But in Tetris you don't level up and make choices just to have them all start over again anyways the next time you play...			"

												After playing this with the updates, I still cannot recommend this game.The stealth factor in this game is great and the use of each agents abilities to pull off a mission is also great.  There are still bugs in this game, one that ruined the last mission in the game for me.  I closed the door, silently, behind an enemy and he somehow knew it despite facing the other direction.This game does frown on killing enemies, so don't expect to pull off some stealth kills, just stuns.What hurts this game for me is the missions themselves.  I expect to be able to steal more items for use while in mission but I'm usually buying them during the mission.  Very rarely does Monst3r have anything to sell me in between missions.I'm certain this game will appeal to a lot of people but it is not my cup of tea.			"

												Unfortunately, I must go against the masses and say I ended up uninstalling Invisible soon after I bought it. I found the artwork and athmosphere to be too childish and naive. It's not that I dislike cartoonish style as such. But Invisible Inc was just too ""Disney"" for me. Together with a lack of a good storyline noted by many other reviewers, the game just did not have the backbone to make it worth my time. The strategic mechanics, while fun, failed to make up for complete lack of immersion in the game world. I would pick up something like Frozen Synapse over Invisible Inc any day. It is too bad since I really wanted to like this one... Sorry!			"

								Despite what pro-gamers may write here, I've struggled to get into this game. The graphics and the idea is rather nice. However, it is not very accessible - very little explanation of how something works and why it doesn't. Too often you are having to click repeatitively around the screen for something which works. You are a walking by objects which look like you ought to be able to interact with them but don't.Money is used both to level up your agents and to buy equipment - does that even make sense?? Equipment cannot be bought between missions, only during missions - so you go to a shop computer and instantly get your items during the mission?This is a complete RIP-OFF - I cannot believe such an underhatched, halfmade game is being sold at all. Will spend lots of my spare time making sure it gets as much bad PR through the net as possible. Do not buy this!			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Invisible, Inc. is a game developed and published by Klei Entertainment, the same people behind Mark of the Ninja. Invisible, Inc. is simply one of the best single-player games I've ever playedThe theme is evoked well and the mechanisms of play are finely tuned. The real genius though, lies in how the game handles mistakes. In many games failure just costs time, or you are forced to reload whenever you make a mistakeInvisible, Inc. also allows this, but it really shines when you set up a game without rewinds or reloads. Then you get to experience how good a game can really beThe perfectly executed stealthy infiltration can quickly become a deadly game of cat and mouse, and successfully pulling unconscious agents out of a botched operation is way more satisfying than a reload could ever bePoints of reference could be XCOM or the best roguelikes, but I think Invisible, Inc. outclasses them allMy only criticism lies with how certain equipment can make core elements of the game trivial to overcome. It's not so fun when you have a ""super agent"" able to avoid or overcome all oppositionThe relatively short campaign time-frame and random item availability prevents this from becoming a significant problem though RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Entertaining but a bit short. I particularly like the comic graphics. I finished it on Beginner in just about 13 hours. Not sure about replay value after knowing the game mechanics. It's a turn based stealth game. There is a couple different mission types to go through until you reach the final level. Each missions increases in difficulty with time. You need to run your agents through the mission to solve a particular quest and then flee the location. The levels can have side missions. Usually you will need about 30 to 60 minutes per mission, which roughly equals 15 to 30 turns. You gain money and items on the missions to improve your agents. Or you can go on rescue missions to find more agents. I don't think anything you do during a mission has any impact storywise. At least, I did not notice anything. I feel the game could have been more if the story had been, well, a story instead of just a loose bracket around the missions. Also, the characters are a lost opportunity for making the game more interesting if they somehow would impact on gameplay. But they are basically just the same statbags. Still a good game if you can get it for a bargain price.			"

Early Access Review
								SECOND EDIT: The final game allows an excellent level of difficulty customization, from ""filthy casual"" to ""brutal masochist."" There's nothing really to add to the first edit I made apart from that. This game is amazing. Everything I hoped it would be when I saw the trailer and more. Without question the best early access game I've bought and the best game I've bought in 2015 so far. If you like tactical combat and a stealth based version of that sounds interesting you absolutely should get this game. You won't be disappointed. The developers seem to be actively working on it and I can see this becoming a classic like X-COM, it's that good.The emphasis is very much on the stealth/combat missions, with minimal rpg elements, but that works fine in this context, and endless mode means you'll get lots of hours of play out of it (I certainly have).STRONGLY RECOMMENDEDORIGINAL REVIEW: This is a rogue-like, a fact which is mentioned absolutely nowhere on the game's store page. Ignore every other tag or adjective in the description as they are completely secondary to relentless, punishing rogue-like heart of this game.On the surface I should love this game. Turn based tactical stealth? Count me in! And the basic mechanics are a lot of fun. The actual game side of it is really good, and I enjoyed it a lot. The graphics are really nice. If this were an X-COM style game I'd be giving this a thumbs up, because it has the potential to be an amazing amount of fun. Hell, it is an amazing amount of fun.But it's a rogue-like. A rogue-like with the difficulty turned up to eleven. And that's what takes all the fun out of this game and stamps on it until it's no fun at all. If you make a mistake, you get 1 do over/mission. Make 2 mistakes and you may as well delete your surviving agents and start over from the beginning. Not even joking. If you lose an agent, particularly after a few missions when you've spent some of your extremely scarce resources upgrading them, start over from the beginning. The mission difficulty ratchets steadily and if you've made any strategic mistakes with how you upgraded and equiped your agents, start over from the beginning. If you've even been a bit unlucky, didn't get the money or equipment you needed on the earlier levels because they didn't spawn, start over from the beginning. And that's the ""Easy"" difficulty level. I haven't even looked at ""Normal.""EDIT: OK, I figured out how to get infinite money and power with Cheat Engine[1]. Once the punishing difficulty level is taken out, OMG how much fun is this game! I've been playing endless mode for hours and it is so good. Slowly building up your agents' gear and augments, leaning how to deal with the different situations. With the difficulty tweaked and/or getting rid of the nosave, permadeath BS I could see this turning into a cult game like X-COM. I really want to give this game a positive review because it does so much right. I just can't while I need to use 3rd party hacking tools to make it something other than an exercise in misery and frustration. [1] They're stored as Doubles, and the memory address changes every mission, so you're going to have to either rescan every mission or do something clever with pointers if you want to cheat all the time.

												A quick description would be the gameplay for the original XCOM (or Crusader) with the technowiz of Uplink: Hacker Elite. It has a wide range of settings so you can customize your gameplay far more than a simple Beginner or Advanced. Admittedly, it is a rather short game, which may not appeal to some, but it still has high replayabilty. Every level is randomized: even when playing the same mission, the layouts, enemies, and rewards change every time. In short, if you liked XCOM, go for it.			"

The game is always challenging you, the security is always risng, The drowns are hounding you and you dont have enough power to hack them, the lack of credits and equipment always hindering you, this game really puts the pressure on. If you play on begginer (which is very challenging) you get a couple redos for turns, other than that its cutthroat! If an agent dies, he's dead. If you screw up and get shot your done. The game even deletes your save file if all your agents die... BRUTAL!!! The nice part is you get EXP even if you loose that unlocks better (More diverse) agents and computer hacking tools. This Game is really fun and addicting! It really makes you feel like a spy. P.S. Those Deamons really suck...			"

Invisible Inc. is the their second foray into the stealth genre, and like the first one, it's an exceptional must play; it even went so far as to turn stealth into a turn based game,and it actually works. Invisible Inc. essentially plays as a randomly generated puzzle, but not only are the ""puzzles"" cerebral and open to experimentation, but the random generation is absolutely rock-solid.The only major issue in terms of gameplay is that the thematically famous ""augments"" are entirely boring, and while do affect player ability, they don't really feel like they make a proper impact when compared to, say, Deus Ex: Human Evolution.

I know, right? If you weren't aware of this fact I bet your interest-o-meter just moved a notch or two in one direction or the other. If it ticked upwards, just buy the game because I'm certain that you'll enjoy it. On the other hand, if you're not a fan of rogue-likes just ignore everything I've said because my opinion is going to be of little to no worth to you anyway.			"

								It actually kind of blew my mind how great this game turned out to be, every single mission is TENSE as hell, and it's really hard, you're probably not gonna win it on your first playthrough. But that's what's great about it, you're meant to play it several times, just like The Binding of Isaac or FTL. My only gripes as of now are that there are too few items, every map looks the same and you can't manage your inventory to give an item from one agent to another, but hopefully these things will all be adressed before or at release! What I would like is more variation in the rooms/buildings you find yourself in, and maybe even outdoor parts that vary between night and day depending on where in the world you are at what time, daytime making stealth harder in some way. Either way, for the price, even in early access, this game is absolutely worth it, I'll trust the developers to take fan opinions into consideration when adding more features to the game.			"

								Interesting take on turn based stealth. I was worried before I tried it that the stealth would be too twitchy and hard to manage, but in the vein of XCOM I rarely feel like the game screwed me, and failure is always my fault. The upgrade system is cool, and there is already a nice selection of items to haul around and play with. The XP unlock of new characters/items from games I've failed is a nice surprise as well.For early access, it's already fun. Linux support promised down the road too!Also, screw security drones...

								Invisible Inc. offers unique and fun experience which encourages careful thought through challenging gameplay. Despite being in early access, the game is very enjoyable in its current state, and will be even better when finished. The game has a fairly steep learning curve, and your first few playthroughs will appear unfair, however once you have gotten used to the game mechanics, Invisible Inc. becomes a challenging, rather than punishing affair. Unfortunately, on two occasions my save file became corrupted, and I was forced to restart the mission I was playing but being in early access, this is excusable.Ideas for improvement:-Offer a basic shop between missions for buying ammo etc.			"

								The story so far...Dig this game. Not gonna lie, its currently lacking on the whole 'game' thang. You kinda just go from mission to mission, and if your not aweful, you keep doing that, but most likely, you'll do a few missions and die off, and restart. Which appears to be part of the games stucture, as at the end of each session you are given XP to your...player level I guess? Which unlocks new stuff, agents, powers, extLoads of stuff that I hope they add, and well given Klie's track record, I belive they will do just that, but if you aren't really into kinda running the same basic mission a buncha times and waiting on new builds, then maybe hang on for a bit till there is a lil more content in here.

												I recommend this game to everyone who likes tactical turn base games. In this game you lead a team of agents on their revenge on corporations, you have to chose your tagets from few available missions and then complete objectives and run away with loot.There is also endless mode in which difficulty goes up and game will never end, unless you fail and all your agents die.While on mission you have to balance between stunning/killing guards or simply avoiding them. It is a nice tactical choice, killing is easy, but raises alarm level and reduces money gains from missions while stunning will require you to carry guard bodies and watch them not to wake up too early.On top of that you have to use AI at your disposal to hack objects like cameras, drones, safes and manage resource for hacking which is Power.There is first DLC for this game but I haven't tested it yet.I haven't seen any bugs, there are a lot of options to tweak difficulty level and plenty of game modes.

												Invisible, Inc. is a turn based strategy game set in a technologically advanced future. Players will control covert agents as they infiltrate high powered corporations to raid high security vaults, steal advanced technology, rescue captured operatives, and download important data.  Along the way the agents will face a myriad of threats like armored corporate security officers, drones, laser walls, and security turrets.Players take turns against the computer moving their agents through the randomly generated levels, doing their best to stay out of site while they hack security nodes through their cyberspace combat program, Incognito.  Depending on the programs you have loaded determines how you’ll bring down cameras, unlock electronic safes, and take control of camera drones. After each level you’ll spend credits on buying and selling equipment and leveling up your agents’ skills.Invisible, Inc. plays a lot like Xcom, which I personally love. It’s difficult to put down.  You’ll get so engrossed in completing a level you won’t realize time is passing! Difficulty ramps up at a reasonable pace so you never feel like you’re completely in control.  In fact some levels become downright tense!Each level has an objective and an exit zone.  You can leave any time you discover the exit, but you’ll want to try and complete your mission first.  There are several factors that make this difficult.  First, there’s a security meter that rises one point every turn.  Every five points raises the security level and will add complications like new guards on patrol, turning on more security cameras, and even pinpointing the location of one of your agents on the map and sending a guard to investigate.If that wasn’t enough, guards you knock out won’t stay that way forever.  And once they wake up, they will start searching the entire level for you.  Eventually you’ll have access to lethal weapons, but using these can raise the alarm level much faster as almost all security guards are equipped with heart monitors.  Games can get very tense as you try and steer the guards away from the exit so you can make your escape with the 3000 credits you just stole from the corporate vault!I enjoy how accessible the game is to first time players.  It’s not very difficult to learn and the beginner difficulty (which I recommend everyone play, regardless of your skill level with strategy games) explains all of the features in the game while being forgiving enough to not beat you over the head when you make a mistake.  At higher difficulty levels, the safety net drops away and you’ll find that every mistake can have dire consequences for your team.Overall, I find Invisible, Inc. to be fun and engaging.  The gameplay is challenging without being unfair. I particular enjoyed the art style, which has a retro feel about it.  After 15+ hours, I feel confident recommending this title to anyone looking for a new turn-based strategy experience.			"

												   A game of simple concept & simple graphics, however, extremely well coded.Pros:   1) Utilise mere 5mins on first mission (tutorial) to understand how to play this game properly   2) Levelling / talent spec choice is entirely up to you to suit your gameplay preference (more stealth vs more action)   3) Maps are randomly generated with certain fixed parameter. Every game feels different and exciting especially towards Day 2, even more thrill when playing Iron man mode.   4) Weapons / Items / Augmentation. These are well balance in my opinion. You utilise all or focus more on 1 or more of these, again up  to personal preferences   5) Difficulty scales at a very appropriate rate. You will always feel challenged and proceed with cautious Cons:   1) Camera rotation feels weird at the begining. Some paths are not visible no matter and it can be cumbersome at times to keep rotating camera and using ""Incognition view"". After some getting used to, this is acceptable   2) Game play too short. Even with high re-playability, counting normal mode, endless mode, expert plus mode, this game is still short. You can complete the story once in normal mode within 4hrs. Having said that, this game is meant to be played multiple times. With each game play, progressively increase the difficulty and aiming towards clearing all achievements.   Conclusion: If you like turn based strategy game, this is one of the best. If you enjoyed XCom, this is the game you will also enjoy.			"

												This game scratches so many itches for me - it's a beautifully executed stealth game with rng-free tactics and a roguelite component that I've been missing dearly in recent games. This game is definitely not for everyone since the campaign is rather short and there's really not too much of a plot in here. The idea here is to beat the game repeatedly and unlock stuff in the process which makes future runs different from the past ones, that's what makes it feel so roguelite. You should pick this up if you like XCOM, roguelik(t)es or stealth games, and if you happen to like more than one of those at once - BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!			"

												Entertaining but a bit short. I particularly like the comic graphics. I finished it on Beginner in just about 13 hours. Not sure about replay value after knowing the game mechanics. It's a turn based stealth game. There is a couple different mission types to go through until you reach the final level. Each missions increases in difficulty with time. You need to run your agents through the mission to solve a particular quest and then flee the location. The levels can have side missions. Usually you will need about 30 to 60 minutes per mission, which roughly equals 15 to 30 turns. You gain money and items on the missions to improve your agents. Or you can go on rescue missions to find more agents. I don't think anything you do during a mission has any impact storywise. At least, I did not notice anything. I feel the game could have been more if the story had been, well, a story instead of just a loose bracket around the missions. Also, the characters are a lost opportunity for making the game more interesting if they somehow would impact on gameplay. But they are basically just the same statbags. Still a good game if you can get it for a bargain price.			"

												Pros: Brilliant, seriously stylish turn-based tactics game with a surprising amount of depth. Each playthrough is short, sweet, and rewarding. If you love games like XCOM but you frequently take breaks, forget about what you were doing and need to start over, this is the game for you. It's pretty much designed for replay value, there are many characters and loadouts to experiment with in brand new generated levels each time. The best part is adapting your tactics as you slowly notch up the difficulty to what it's meant to be played at.Con: The story mode narration and descriptions can get tiresome after a while, I would appreciate a setting that disables voice acting.EDIT: There is an endless mode that adresses some of my above complaint			"

												A wonderful combination of short-range tactical and long-range strategic concerns in a futuristic corporate spy setting. The turn-based approach seems plodding at first, but it allows for delicate precision in making every move count. This is exceedingly important as the difficulty level rises.The 3/4 top-down view can be a bit frustrating to see where you're going at times (really a general annoyance of the format, not this particular title).

												Invisible Inc is a fantastic game. Graphics and voice acting are whimsical, yet elegant (the latter is rare in games). The game mechanics are so very well thought out. The missions are surprisingly un-repetitive, and have just the right lenght for a nice little session. There is not much of a story, but a good tension arch with a not too long campaign that gets progressively more difficult.What it somehow manage to do, is that I'm getting just barely through the missions, yet I manage them. This combination of just barely dodging the bullet and outsmarting the level gives a nice sense of achievement.That this happens so often, and so many, shows that it is not a coincidence, but rather a result of a couple of well designed game mechanisms. Moreover, this happens on procedurally designed maps, that could be unfair or easy just out of luck. Somehow the game gives you enough tools to compensate it. Rock paper shotgun analysed this, and found that the flexible structure of objectives and a risk level that increases with every turn are responsible. It is up to the player how much they chose to risk, and how much reward they get. Immediate mistakes are forgiven, due to a roll-back function. However, strategical mistakes can get one in a situation where roll-back does not suffice. Here one has to improvise, accept losses and recover, or get busted. Failure is part of the game.			"

												This is an incredible stealth-based tactics RPG. I frequently describe it to my friends as ""the second best stealth game I've ever played."" Why second best? Because Klei already made Mark of the Ninja.It features a surprisingly deep cast of playable characters that have just enough in their one-lines and informational bio's that they have subtlely real personalities. The maps are designed in a seemless procedural generation that always leaves a mission challenging but doable. The four stat mechanic (Speed, Strength, Hacking, and Anarchy) is simple enough to understand and extremely effective in execution. The variety of weapons, items, and implants for your agents and programs for your AI buddy Incognita offers a bunch of different playstyles. And the setting... that cyberpunk noir... mmm...			"

Early Access Review
								Post release update: This game is even better than I hoped it would be. It is a wonderful mix of Shadowrun Returns, Mark of the Ninja with just a hint of XCOM. The tension between trying to get everything and the ever-increasing security level is perfect, and the difficulty level customisation options are brilliant. A+ gameOriginal Early Access review: Invisible, Inc is a fantastic turn-based stealth strategy game. The gameplay is spot on and really, really tense. Violence really is not a good option which I love (it just makes more trouble for you!) and the game is all the better for it. As could be expected given Mark of the Ninja they show real confidence in the stealth mechanics, but stealth here is about precise placement and tactical thought, rather than in darkness and movement. Both are brilliant. Finely tuned, beautiful to look at, with lovely music this could be a finished game already.Klei are doing Early Access right with this game. I bought the game when it was pre-Early Access and development has been a joy to watch as Klei are working hard to craft a gem of a game.			"

												what a hidden gem of a game (pun intended)  if you are a fan of shadow run this certainly has that feel, more cloak and dagger and you really feel the pressure to remain so, something I found lacking in the shadow run series, even on beginner mode you feel the challenge is palpable without being overwhelming. definitely worth the coin 4.8/5 stars			"

												Put in about 60 hours on Early Access, and 32 hours so far on the final release.The polish on the final release is extremely satisfying. This game keeps me up 'til 3AM on the regular. It's punishingly hard (on Expert with 1 rewind) but OH SO SATISFYING when you nail a particularly tricky escape.If you like XCOM, Jagged Alliance, Fallout 1/2/Tactics, etc...you'll probably enjoy this game. A LOT. It's tactical, turn-based, STEALTH-FOCUSE gameplay. I haven't had this much fun with a game in long while.			"

												The majority of the negative reviews say things from ""too short"" to ""depends on RNG""And both of these are true. But as a game about spies who have a limited amount of time to complete their objective this makes absolutely perfect sense. sometimes you realize a level is going to be awful after recon, and then leave. better to get some cash and items and have everyone alive than bash your head against the corporate structure. That being said, I haven't run across a mission that I haven't been able to beat. Andwith some creative hacking and thinking, most higher alert missions can pretty much be drawn out for ever. Sure the ""campaign"" can be repetitive, but on higher difficulties the satisfaction of waltzing around guards, hijacking robots and turrets, and the blood pumping adrealine from successfully navigating supposedly random patrol paths. For a turn based STEALTH(!!!) game, this one certainly gets the arenaline pumping as much as some big name action tiles.			"

												Invisible Inc attempts to mix the tension and tactical gameplay of XCOM and Shadowrun while removing all the random dice rolls of combat, making sure that players realise that ever action/ success or failure achieved was their decision and not the game. Coupled with the inability to save during gameplay and only rely on ""Rewinds"", makes Invisible Inc a very challenging game that will appeal to even the most discerning hardcore squad based tactical player. Expect to fail alot and enjoy the rush when you've completed that successful run while being pursued with a level 6 alarm.			"

												Invisible Inc. What is there to say about it?Hm, well, that's the question.Invisible Inc is often described as roguelike, or in the words of TotalBiscuit ""Rogue-Lite"". Unless you're playing on a custom difficulty to unwind, expect to die A LOT.Let's break this down, then.Story;Invisible Inc has an incredibly short story, but still a fun one to watch, with 2 very nicely animated cutscenes that to me at least felt reminiscent of The Incredibles. Its cast of characters are fairly fun, for what we get to learn of them. Central in particular has to be the best in the game - not only does she have the best voice, but you also feel for her plight and genuinely feel scolded for letting agents die.Gameplay:Being a turn-based stealth strategy game, things will go wrong, a LOT. Often resulting in death. Fortunately there is a ""rewind"" option which allows you to go back to the beginning of the previous turn. Of course, while this is useful, barring custom mode, your Rewinds are limited and you may have made a mistake much earlier that caused your problems now.the stealth gameplay is really enjoyable and the combat is simple, and just a little frustrating if you don't have the ability to knock out your enemy before they shoot you, or if you are surrounded. I would criticise how hard it is to obtain enough money to keep your equipment up to date with the difficulty increase each in-game ""day"". You'll very quickly find yourself surrounded by armoured guards without armour-piercing weapons while trying to get an extra agent in a detention centre, and that certainly doesn't feel nice.Similarly, there is a ""hacking"" feature to change the sides of security features in the levels such as drones and cameras. This is absolutely vital for you to maintain a stealthy approach. However, in an endless mode, even on super-easy difficulty settings, Daemons (programs that activate upon hacking, none of which have positive effects) will begin spawning automatically at the beginning of the level, including one which adds a Daemon into ALL hackable items in the level, severely limiting your ability to do, well, anything.I do applaud it for punishing killing, however. Though despite this, there have been too many situations where killing EVERYONE is the only way to survive a level. Also, while the levels are randomly generated, this isn't necessarily a good thing. While it improves replay value, there have been too many situations where the only way to advance is to go through a room with a stationary guard who is watching the only door you can go through, meaning you will have to risk increasing security by killing or KOing him. Bonus negatives if said guard is more armoured than you have the ability to deal with at the time.Modding:Currently, there is too little in the modding scene for this game. I would really like to see some modding support for agent creation, items and missions in the future. Right now the only real mods are language packs, which is nice if you speak a different language but that's not really a mod otherwise. TL;DR: Great gameplay, nice short story, needs more modding.

												""Invisible, Inc"" is the best designed and most polished game I have played in a long time. The balance between all the different items, augments, and options in general is just perfect. Almost every single level unfolds into an epic mission, where every AP counts, and I somehow (it baffles myself!) manage to barely escape in the end. When I lose, which happens often, it is always because of a mistake or miscalculation on my own side. The game isnt unfair. It isnt frustrating. It is challenging in the best way possible, where it's up to YOU if you fail or succeed, and to do creative kiting or maneuvres to escape in one piece. I have bought so many games lately, from indies to AAA, and none of them have been as fun and addicting as Invisible, Inc.I can only recommend! :) "

												The campaign on beginner difficulty took me 11 hours, a little short but still good value for the price. Since it has a great replayability value. It's  like XCOM Enemy Unkown, but without the cumbersome base operations. Invisible Inc. just let's you focus on managing and upgrading your team. For me this is stealth tactical squad based gaming with RPG elements at it's best. And the permadeath for the team members does add that caring element to it, I just want this team to survive the mission together.			"

I don't understand how they've managed to get the mechanics so tight; the escalating threat, the close shaves, the number of missions where you feel you've only just escaped, the number of missions where you have to choose to leave a team member or key objective behind or risk all-out failure.  It's just so damn good.  So many games try to pull it off and so few succeed so beautifully.I could write about this for a really long time.  Short story:  the art, sound and story are great, but it's that amazing, amazing gameplay that makes this one of my favourite games ever.			"

												Invisible Inc. is a meticulously clockwork strategy game. The only uncertainty here, is information you do not yet have, and AI decisions. Yet, even in these areas the game gives you extensive information to play with. You can see at a glance exactly which of the areas you can see, are also observed by guards. You know enemy health and traits. Even the destination and object of a guard's interest may be divined. This is very empowering, and puts most failures squarely on the player.At first, you'll want to avoid ever being seen. Soon, you'll be satisfied with escape when spotted. Eventually, you'll confidently pull the strings of the enemy to send them hither and yon, as you scamper about your business. It's an awesome feeling when you pull it off.I love the slick sci-fi setting; the characterizations are nice and refreshingly diverse. Unit upgrades are fun, and the stage dressing is nicely on theme. The worst I can say is that like all roguelikes, you must first learn the game before you can win at it. Also, you're going to rely on a bit of luck to have the options that you want. Overall, the limited ""rewind"" system is a good way to offer a safety net, although I do miss that tool on the higher difficulty settings.The best I can say is, I loved the challenge and was glad to be able to complete it. The unlocks on failure were a great way to spin straw into gold. I liked the expansion, but that difficulty really gets up there. This is a good game to play if you enjoyed X-Com, FTL, Dungeons of Dredmor or Mark of the Ninja. The fusion of stealth and turn based strategy is, in the context of a roguelike, exquisite.			"

												Invisible Inc is a fantastic game. Graphics and voice acting are whimsical, yet elegant (the latter is rare in games). The game mechanics are so very well thought out. The missions are surprisingly un-repetitive, and have just the right lenght for a nice little session. There is not much of a story, but a good tension arch with a not too long campaign that gets progressively more difficult.What it somehow manage to do, is that I'm getting just barely through the missions, yet I manage them. This combination of just barely dodging the bullet and outsmarting the level gives a nice sense of achievement.That this happens so often, and so many, shows that it is not a coincidence, but rather a result of a couple of well designed game mechanisms. Moreover, this happens on procedurally designed maps, that could be unfair or easy just out of luck. Somehow the game gives you enough tools to compensate it. Rock paper shotgun analysed this, and found that the flexible structure of objectives and a risk level that increases with every turn are responsible. It is up to the player how much they chose to risk, and how much reward they get. Immediate mistakes are forgiven, due to a roll-back function. However, strategical mistakes can get one in a situation where roll-back does not suffice. Here one has to improvise, accept losses and recover, or get busted. Failure is part of the game.			"

												This is an incredible stealth-based tactics RPG. I frequently describe it to my friends as ""the second best stealth game I've ever played."" Why second best? Because Klei already made Mark of the Ninja.It features a surprisingly deep cast of playable characters that have just enough in their one-lines and informational bio's that they have subtlely real personalities. The maps are designed in a seemless procedural generation that always leaves a mission challenging but doable. The four stat mechanic (Speed, Strength, Hacking, and Anarchy) is simple enough to understand and extremely effective in execution. The variety of weapons, items, and implants for your agents and programs for your AI buddy Incognita offers a bunch of different playstyles. And the setting... that cyberpunk noir... mmm...			"

												I played this game on the free weekend and loved it. The gameplay ticks all the right boxes with me. I think it is better than XCOM due to non-randomness of combat. Combat is possible but not recommended because it alerts the guards. The Campaign itself is short but infinitely replayable. Had a situation where a guard saw me through a door, so I had one of the other character sneak up and close the door. Funny timesIn XCOM, all the units are identical and disposeable, which is good becauses they die so easily. Here each agent has a special ability and so lends character to them.			"

												While this game is fun to play, it's ridiculously difficult even on the beginner setting. If you like turn based strategy games you'll enjoy it, but getting out alive is an extremely difficult task. It takes a full playthrough of the game (about 3 hours) to even begin to understand what you are doing. This game is challenging, but sometimes it seems unfair. The procedural generator can be very unforgiving, throwing you into a difficult map including many rooms where the objective and exit are on wildly different parts of the map, forcing you to traverse back through the mess of guards that just woke up. The game world is already set up for you to lose. Because the maps are procedurally generated, you can get maps that literally are not possible to beat without sacrificing a large portion of your team.Unless you might like a very challenging spatial strategy game, I'd save your money until they deal with the difficulty.This is all on Beginner mode. Each approach you take has HUGE consequences down the line and the game's alert level system just brings the crushing weight of time down on you. The cost and armor level of the guards go up very quickly without providing much to help you in return.The game feels polished, but they've got a lot to do difficulty wise. I'm still coming back to the game, but my first playthrough I didn't complete any objectives because of the level of difficulty. If the DEV wants the players to play perfectly, they should make it a bit easier on beginner mode.			"

												Another fine game from Klei to say the least. Had this since April of last year and I'm very pleased as to how the final product turned out. Yet another fresh take on stealth by Klei, this is a turn based tactical espionage game that features procedurally generated levels and permadeath(though there are mission retries on the lowest difficuly). It may not explicitly state this, but it is very much structured like a modern rougelike (a la FTL) with playthroughs lasting around the ballpark of a couple hours and a lot of variation between each playthrough. You create a team whenever you start a playthrough, selecting any two of ten unlockable agents(six of which have an alt form so technically 16) and two mainframe programs. There is a hacking element in the game that features resource management of CPU power that can be used to hack various devices such as cameras, safes, etc. There's also an alarm level that ticks every turn, Forcing a lot of different decisions(do I go after that nanofabricator machine and buy some gear or escape before things get too hectic?) and making the gameplay more dynamic. Overall, I love the gameplay of this game. Not many games can keep me playing for 70 hours(and I don't plan on stopping now) but Invisible Inc has enough depth and variation to keep me playing. Also, as with every game Klei makes, the artstyle of this game is wonderful. My only complaint I have is that the couple of cinematics they put in the game very recently could have been better quality. Voice acting is a little flat and it looks a little grainy. Overall I definately recommend this game.			"

												TLDR: turn-based tactical espionage action in a stilish cyberpunk setting. You will learn the importance of closing doors!In this future cyberpunk setting, you are cast as an operator trying to survive a hunt called by many corporations, hoping to last 72 hours so that you can strike back (there are custom and endless modes available too).In the strategic map, you will choose where to deploy your team between the different randomly generated mission available, each offering different objectives, enemies and rewards. Once chosen, you will proceed to a turn-based, XCOM like mission. Unlike XCOM, sneaking and not engaging the enemy is the order of they day.Despite lacking an enfasis on combat, each mission is a tense and tight affair where you are using all the tools available. The wonderful and atmosferic soundtrack enhances the gameplay.I have enjoyed this game so far, my only negative is that some of the mechanics are not covered by the tutorial or in the help section, so you will have to do some googling to find your answers.

												One of the best sleath games of all time. If you like tactical games or steath games, this is a must-try game. I could go on for paragraphs about the one time I was on the last level an just barely made it out!. Invisible, Inc is chalk full of great moments that make you wish you could play it over and over again. Oh wait, you can!			"

												A bit of a hidden gem. Great audio visual design, great mission variety and the stealth system is perfectly executed.  Short run gameplay similar to the wonderful FTL, the meta progression isnt as good as FTL's (but what game's is?) but the in-run gameplay is a more varied. If you're a fan of stealth games and/or turn based strategy like me, then this is a unique slice of nirvana.			"

												Excellent tactical espionage game. Klei never ceases to amaze me with their diverse yet quality products. I've owned this since day 1 and things have only changed for the better. Highly recommended if you like tactical games. One recommendation is that if you want to play this game as it truly should be, play it on, at minimum, expert mode with ironman difficulty, which was the intended difficulty and how the game must be played.

Every decision and mistake has weight in this game and no playthrough is ever the same. I wholly recommend it. With all my heart.			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic and is the most addictive game I've played since FTL. I'm not even into stealth games but everything about this game, from the gameplay, graphic style, music and sound effects all come together to build a tense, edge of your seat experience.I've had so many close call heroic victories in this game and also heart breaking defeats. Highlights include having my agent surrounded by guards and using a cloak modded with an electric burst, knocking them all out. Another time on the final mission a critical character was shot by guards but I was able to purchase a med gel and revive him, all the while Shalem shot dead several of the guards. Overall it's hard to explain what's so good, it's just worth playing.Only negatives for me are as follows:- don't play on beginner difficulty it's far too easy with 5 rewinds per level- it's too easy to unlock all agents and programs! Would like to have been made to work harder.- it took me a while to get used to the action point system including the fact that opening/closing doors doesn't cost any points. It seems a bit strange and there's rarely a good reason to leave a door open. It breaks the flow of the game a bit having to close them all the time and annoying when you forget to.Overall please bring on the DLC I'll happily lap it up!!			"

												I fell in love with this studio when Mark of the Ninja exploded in popularity. Yet again here we are with another fantastic title from Klei Entertainment. I liked Invisible Inc. before I even played it because I'm a huge dork and a sucker for puns. The whole game feels like a giant super-spy chess match, and the charming graphics and fluid gameplay make it a must-have.			"

												This game is close to perfect.  I don't understand how they've managed to get the mechanics so tight; the escalating threat, the close shaves, the number of missions where you feel you've only just escaped, the number of missions where you have to choose to leave a team member or key objective behind or risk all-out failure.  It's just so damn good.  So many games try to pull it off and so few succeed so beautifully.I could write about this for a really long time.  Short story:  the art, sound and story are great, but it's that amazing, amazing gameplay that makes this one of my favourite games ever.			"

												Slightly recommended.This game is turn-based and about stealth, and about break-ins to support your struggle against different companies, break-ins you do at those companies. the options available differ somewhat though, and maps seem to be generated for each run, so there's no risk running into the same map twice, not at least from what I've experienced.The agents at your disposal differ some at the beginning, upgrades (augmentations) can make them differ alot though, upgrading their skill can make them more similar if that's your choice, or make them even more specialized, should you wish for that.While playing, you have 2-4 agents, depending on earlier missions, to execute your objectives, and to help you you have some sort of AI that allows you to hack different terminals, safes etc. The game plays out really well in my opinion, and the only issue actually is the amount of missions. You should know before purchasing this game that the campaign isn't more than 7 missions or so, wich might seem a bit short.Replayability lies in playing different difficulty modes, and of course playing the different difficulties in iron man mode as well. There's also other modes in general, as some type of time trial. Although, if you're picking this up for playing the campaign, waiting for a sale might be recommended. Somewhat overpriced considering that.If you, on the other hand, won't be bothered by exploring the different difficulty levels as the way to get your game time in this game, then by all means, pick it up full price. I do however think that even for those players, waiting for a sale is a good move.			"

												Presentation: +- nice art style, animations, good visual feedback on important game elementsGameplay: + - Invisible Inc.'s core gameplay, sneaking a small party of agents through technology- and guard-wise protected facilities, is executed really well and all given game subsystems work well together- selectable difficulty options enable a customized challenge- thanks to procedurally generated levels, no playthrough is the same ...Gameplay: -- ... BUT I personally can't see myself in replaying the game over and over again for unlocking new agents, weapons, skills, etc. as they don't feel distinct enough to me to justify another playthrough- the game goals given after your initial playthrough (""unlock new agents"", ""beat the game in a higher difficulty"", and ""level up your agency"") feel more like a grind to me than goals that I want to work for intrinsicallyOverall, for me it was a pleasant and short (<10 hours) gameplay experience that I do not intend to repeat based on the given game goals.

								This is a game that even now in beta, commands your attention.  Too often game idea's sound good on paper, or trailer, but when you play it, it doesn't deliver on the gameplay and more importantly fantasy.  Invisible, Inc. delivers on both.  It's up there with the best and most difficult turn based games, and is undeniably the best example of a true espionage game out there.Did I mention it was difficult.  Oh god, be prepared to lose....and not reload...but restart, the entire game all over again.  Many, many times.  With a smile on your face, and if you're lucky, a lesson learnt from your defeat.  If you're intrigued by that last part, your the kind of agent this game is looking for.			"

								Interesting take on turn based stealth. I was worried before I tried it that the stealth would be too twitchy and hard to manage, but in the vein of XCOM I rarely feel like the game screwed me, and failure is always my fault. The upgrade system is cool, and there is already a nice selection of items to haul around and play with. The XP unlock of new characters/items from games I've failed is a nice surprise as well.For early access, it's already fun. Linux support promised down the road too!Also, screw security drones...

								I loved Mark of the Ninja. Klei proved without question they can do stealth gameplay well, and I grabbed this game on the strength of that alone.Be aware that the game is rough around the edges, and you're going to die a lot before you even understand how to play properly. It's difficult to tell where rooms actually begin and end in some cases, and where line-of-sight is. Some elements of the background are easily mistaken for rooms you don't currently have LOS to. Also, when planning where you're going to move to next, it's hard to tell where you can be spotted from that position.It's not clear whether an edge is a wall or a corridor you haven't been down yet. Considering that every move counts, you can't waste time exploring a wall that you thought was actually a pathway.That said, you can rotate the view left and right with Q and E, which alleviates this problem somewhat.It's not obvious when enemies are going to regain consciousness. It's two turns from when you knock them out. I'm not even sure whether than means they revive on turn two or on turn three.It's not obvious at ALL where reinforcement enemies are going to spawn from, and it badly needs to be. More than once I've sneaked into the enemy spawn room accidentally, a guard has spawned the next turn and killed me.Basically, it's difficult to get to grips with how the game actually works, so it's going to take some perserverence.On the plus side, the game is very hard :) . It has the feel of a roguelike, where your own skill and experience makes the difference between success and failure. Also, it has permadeath.Previously I'd complained that you unlock more abilities and whatnot purely from grinding. I was wrong. The unlocks are really just alternate stuff you can use, rather than things that are objectively better.Very difficult, very tense, and there's a lot of potential here that needs a bit more polish. On the balance, though, it's probably worth getting.			"

								Wow! It was very frustrating at first since my agents kept getting overwhelmed. The key is to ace the prisoner rescue missions as soon as possible which will add the rescued agents to your team, making later missions much more survivable. I think that the exit elevator should be made visible on the map when you first start so that you have a clear goal. Either that, or make it possible to exit without saving so you can bail out of a disaster without losing all your progress on that level. FYI for new players: If you are obviously losing, choose the 'retire' option at the bottom of the list on the pause menu. Your progress up to that point will accumulate as experience that will unlock more stuff.			"

								I think this is my game of 2014, because it is so dang cohesive. The art is full of personality, the staff team is dedicated to interacting with their forums, and the game design is focused on creating the highest number of risk-reward decisions. This kind of game may be frustrating for beginners because it has a high difficulty curve, but that's actually the enjoyable part of this game. When a pattern of recurring situations has led to your failure, it is also an opportunity to create a deep satisfaction when you've figured out your own strategy and methods of response. I'm looking forward to see how this game further develops as it's currently at early-access. I highly recommend it for anyone who loves strategy turn-based games and is willing to accept that it takes many fails to figure out how to play the game well.			"

								This game is in early access, so I'm allowed to be as critical as I like, right?Simply put, the game still has a few techincal issues left, I've had charaters fail to tazer an enemy next to them, while they were on overwatch for example. The bigger issue, however, is that the game's tutorial doesn't do a good enough job to explain the game's mechanics. There is a fine line between information given to the player, and information the player can find out for him/herself in a roguelike. I've died twice because of a poor tooltip on the cloaking device:-Running right in front of a guard while cloaked caused a guard to see me and kill me, I had no way of knowing it would do that, since you can pass through his visibility in any other point without being noticed.-Stealing from guards cancelled my cloak. I also had to watch a youtube video to know that pinning people legthens their KO-status (A VERY vital mechanic)Those are the mistakes I've made, but I've seen Youtubers mess up much worse because they simply had no info about some of the basic mechanics, or that they understood them wrong.I'm also left wondering about the character balance, since Internationale seems a bit underpowered compared to her peers at the moment (Banks is really good, but she's unlockable so I guess it's fine)Hm, what I thought of the game? It's right up my alley. I love strategy games in the vein of Xcom and Fire emblem, and I can see this as a roguelike that finally clicks for me. Can't wait for more story content. "

								The story so far...Dig this game. Not gonna lie, its currently lacking on the whole 'game' thang. You kinda just go from mission to mission, and if your not aweful, you keep doing that, but most likely, you'll do a few missions and die off, and restart. Which appears to be part of the games stucture, as at the end of each session you are given XP to your...player level I guess? Which unlocks new stuff, agents, powers, extLoads of stuff that I hope they add, and well given Klie's track record, I belive they will do just that, but if you aren't really into kinda running the same basic mission a buncha times and waiting on new builds, then maybe hang on for a bit till there is a lil more content in here.

								This game is hard. You control spies trying to make money and secure data by choosing where to break into through the use of a world map. You choose your spies, and the perks which each one has to be able to suceed at whatever your doing, which is very hard. A compelling game though frustrating at times when melee reaction does not work or you forget at the end of a turn the default selection resets to charachter 1 who you then make run into the gunfire of a guard thinking you were telling charachter 2, who was spotted, to run into cover. =P Lots of fun!

								This is one of those games that you didn't know you wanted someone to make, but as soon as you see it you can't believe you haven't always wanted it to be a thing someone was making.It's a bit odd that it isn't made more apparent that this is a rogue-like, but it is. I know, right? If you weren't aware of this fact I bet your interest-o-meter just moved a notch or two in one direction or the other. If it ticked upwards, just buy the game because I'm certain that you'll enjoy it. On the other hand, if you're not a fan of rogue-likes just ignore everything I've said because my opinion is going to be of little to no worth to you anyway.			"

								This game has got me crazy hooked. mad props to the developers. One thing i'd like to note is that the 5 AP for the prisoner rescue is just ridiculous. and he has no running ability. I reached the final rescue mission. The dude was literally one move away from the elevator... AND DIED. So much rage. so so much rage.Other than that. This game is 10/10. Cant wait for the full release!			"

Early Access Review
								...Very promising approach. Played the first tutorial mission. Players that favor turn based games will probably not be disappointed. Oldschooler, I played all X-Coms, Jagged Alliance series, The Clou and Syndicate. Invisible Inc. is a very entertaining but very hard to play game. Actually, I tried one of the first mission for three times and was not able to win the mission, instead I lost both agents, just one false move is enough and your game is spoiled. If you have time and do not need to progress in a game right away, challenging Invisible Inc. might just be the right game for you, if you are new to this genre and if you want to get some reward from playing a game, you may look on and forget about Invisible Inc.For me, I would like to recommend the game and will give it more tries. (Sums) Thumb's up :-)			"

								This is probably one of the most challenging TBS games I've played. Well done!EDIT:After more playtesting, I'd say the single biggest, and at the same time simplest, modification the devs could make is to make it possible for the agents to re-lock security doors once they have a passcard.A couple things I'd like to see: Some method whereby you can recover the gear you've previously lost in the field.An optional 'Casual' mode which doesn't affect your score, but in which permadeath doesn't happen.

												I don't play many stealth games (Mostly because I'm not all that great with them) but Invisible, Inc. Hits a high note for me that none of the other stealth games could. Klei in general have made some pretty amazing games, and I think this is just another example of their talent. Random level generation may be something that certain people may dislike, but I appreciate the rogue-like elements in play here and overall I think it suits the type of game it is. I also really enjoy the sense of progression that you have with the unlocks and so forth. I think it adds a nice little dimension to the game and gives it replay value. Final thing I'd like to say is that I extremely enjoy the campaign set up, and how you can customize the campaign to how easy/difficult you'd like it to be. Overall, I think its worth a look at even for people that aren't too keen on stealth games to begin with. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.  "

												First things first: This game is great. It's made by Klei. They rock. Buy it.Invisible Inc. is a turn-based stealth game similar to xcom or shadowfall, but with less emphasis on rpg elements and more on steath. The game is a joy to play and has no rng, like xcom, making the game entirely based on strategy. The game IS DIFFICULT for newcomers and it took me 2 semi-playthroughs and watching guides to be able to complete the game on beginner, before moving on to advanced. The characters are unque (although there should be more), the story is solid, the graphics look great, and the future theme is spot-on. I will say that the enimies aren't very unique, they usually only differ by appearance, or minor things like extra armor. Also, there should be more types of missions, and more layouts for the locations to make each playthough feel different. All in all, an enjoyable turn-based stealth that I plan on continuing for a while.Overview:Gameplay: 10/10Characters: 9/10Story: 8/10Music: 7/10Replayablility: 9/10FINAL SCORE: 9/10			"

												Solid fun, puzzle to solve that is able to keep it fairly fresh with randomly generated maps and enough options to tweak just how hard a fight you want to deal with. Unique (to me) combination of turn based play for a sneaker like this refreshing. Always enjoyed the Thief titles, but this is much more of a spy squad based setup with you as the ""operator"". Hacking angle with Incognita is a fun overlay on top of several other unique additions, that I won't spoil here. Great deal on sale at $12, I'd say worth the $20 as well if you think this may appeal to you as well. And for the real crazy folks that want the hardest challenge, go Ironman (perma-death) with a 2 minute time limit per turn. I enjoy the optimizing of every move that i plan out and taking my time. Once that gets old to me, I might try some speed runs and go full lethal attacks. Oh, and a bonus for me is the ability to save the game at any time and pick it right back up. Life gets in the way some times, this is just like pausing a chess game that is by far more fun.			"

												The majority of the negative reviews say things from ""too short"" to ""depends on RNG""And both of these are true. But as a game about spies who have a limited amount of time to complete their objective this makes absolutely perfect sense. sometimes you realize a level is going to be awful after recon, and then leave. better to get some cash and items and have everyone alive than bash your head against the corporate structure. That being said, I haven't run across a mission that I haven't been able to beat. Andwith some creative hacking and thinking, most higher alert missions can pretty much be drawn out for ever. Sure the ""campaign"" can be repetitive, but on higher difficulties the satisfaction of waltzing around guards, hijacking robots and turrets, and the blood pumping adrealine from successfully navigating supposedly random patrol paths. For a turn based STEALTH(!!!) game, this one certainly gets the arenaline pumping as much as some big name action tiles.			"

												""Invisible, Inc"" is the best designed and most polished game I have played in a long time. The balance between all the different items, augments, and options in general is just perfect. Almost every single level unfolds into an epic mission, where every AP counts, and I somehow (it baffles myself!) manage to barely escape in the end. When I lose, which happens often, it is always because of a mistake or miscalculation on my own side. The game isnt unfair. It isnt frustrating. It is challenging in the best way possible, where it's up to YOU if you fail or succeed, and to do creative kiting or maneuvres to escape in one piece. I have bought so many games lately, from indies to AAA, and none of them have been as fun and addicting as Invisible, Inc.I can only recommend! :) "

												Invisible Inc attempts to mix the tension and tactical gameplay of XCOM and Shadowrun while removing all the random dice rolls of combat, making sure that players realise that ever action/ success or failure achieved was their decision and not the game. Coupled with the inability to save during gameplay and only rely on ""Rewinds"", makes Invisible Inc a very challenging game that will appeal to even the most discerning hardcore squad based tactical player. Expect to fail alot and enjoy the rush when you've completed that successful run while being pursued with a level 6 alarm.			"

												Well now here is an interesting diversion.Lets make one thing clear, I play a custom set of rules, mainly because I hate games that try to rush me, so I turn off the incremental alarm setting, because the hell with that. Instead I max out the alarm setting. One ♥♥♥♥up, and the corps come down like the fist of god. Much more stealthlike that the basic settings.All in all this Invisible Inc is a fun game, easy to play with plenty of replay value.

												This game has potential. Its gameplay is unique. I don't mind the graphics so long as the play style is good. My only problem with this game is the storyline. Its too short. I beat the game in 6, I think 7 maps including the final one. I thought that there will be s surprise in the middle of the game, like I could increase the storage capacity of my items or I would build a new headquarter after the previous base was attacked. But it didn't happen as the game was cut way too short because of its limited storyline. Over all, I score the game 8 out of 10. Ten being excellent.			"

												A quick description would be the gameplay for the original XCOM (or Crusader) with the technowiz of Uplink: Hacker Elite. It has a wide range of settings so you can customize your gameplay far more than a simple Beginner or Advanced. Admittedly, it is a rather short game, which may not appeal to some, but it still has high replayabilty. Every level is randomized: even when playing the same mission, the layouts, enemies, and rewards change every time. In short, if you liked XCOM, go for it.			"

I played 200 hours of XCOM, any difficulties, but this game is already very difficult on the 2/4 difficulty level, much more difficult than XCOM. The first difficulty takes 8 hours (with slow gameplay) to finish, and then i wasnt able to enjoy, because i just got new and new guards, before i even found the objective, and was impossible to control the situation.The graphic, gameplay, story very nice, but i would prefer longer gameplay on a given difficulty, more quests, etc. The second difficulty first level after completing the first difficulty, was like hitting a brick wall for me.edit: okay, i was extremely unlucky on the first mission.

												I've been playing this since it was Incognita and received the final release a few days ago as an EA buyer, so I have a few hours on it. It's a very good, turn based, tactical game. There are enough bells and whistles to make the gameplay interesting for more than one run at the campaign, and with the ability to alter practically all of the gameplay settings there's a lot of replay value to it. There's also an Endless play mode which allows for just mission after mission without the cutoff of the triggering of the Final Mission. The levels are all procedurally generated so you don't see the same thing twice, and since it's had a lot of tweaking the generating of the levels is pretty much glitch free. Highly recommended.			"

												TLDR: turn-based tactical espionage action in a stilish cyberpunk setting. You will learn the importance of closing doors!In this future cyberpunk setting, you are cast as an operator trying to survive a hunt called by many corporations, hoping to last 72 hours so that you can strike back (there are custom and endless modes available too).In the strategic map, you will choose where to deploy your team between the different randomly generated mission available, each offering different objectives, enemies and rewards. Once chosen, you will proceed to a turn-based, XCOM like mission. Unlike XCOM, sneaking and not engaging the enemy is the order of they day.Despite lacking an enfasis on combat, each mission is a tense and tight affair where you are using all the tools available. The wonderful and atmosferic soundtrack enhances the gameplay.I have enjoyed this game so far, my only negative is that some of the mechanics are not covered by the tutorial or in the help section, so you will have to do some googling to find your answers.

												Another fine game from Klei to say the least. Had this since April of last year and I'm very pleased as to how the final product turned out. Yet another fresh take on stealth by Klei, this is a turn based tactical espionage game that features procedurally generated levels and permadeath(though there are mission retries on the lowest difficuly). It may not explicitly state this, but it is very much structured like a modern rougelike (a la FTL) with playthroughs lasting around the ballpark of a couple hours and a lot of variation between each playthrough. You create a team whenever you start a playthrough, selecting any two of ten unlockable agents(six of which have an alt form so technically 16) and two mainframe programs. There is a hacking element in the game that features resource management of CPU power that can be used to hack various devices such as cameras, safes, etc. There's also an alarm level that ticks every turn, Forcing a lot of different decisions(do I go after that nanofabricator machine and buy some gear or escape before things get too hectic?) and making the gameplay more dynamic. Overall, I love the gameplay of this game. Not many games can keep me playing for 70 hours(and I don't plan on stopping now) but Invisible Inc has enough depth and variation to keep me playing. Also, as with every game Klei makes, the artstyle of this game is wonderful. My only complaint I have is that the couple of cinematics they put in the game very recently could have been better quality. Voice acting is a little flat and it looks a little grainy. Overall I definately recommend this game.			"

												This is an extremely slick turn-based stealth game. Despite levels being randomly generated, the situation never seems impossible thanks in part to an excellent arsenal of items, and an internal set of rules that are never hidden. Difficulty is fully customizable, and while there is an unlock system, it only affects your starting load out; all items and agents can be found during missions with the exception of two hidden agents that will require you to complete the story. There are no dice-rolls in this game outside of level generation, and a few secondary effects associated with a few of the more advanced Incognita programs, so you aren't going to fail a mission because your sniper missed a shot. Instead you are going to fail because you got your agents too far apart, or you got greedy and used up all your hacking actions on that last vault before you discovered the security bot between you and the exit. Levels play like wonderful little stealth puzzles with a solution that depends on how you decide to handle the situation. Easily Klei's best work thus far, and one of those ""now I see why early access can be good"" cases.			"

												I have been a fan of this game since paying for it in Early Access. Klei did a fantastic job with their other titles (Mark of the Ninja is a personal favorite of mine) and this is another solid piece of work. The game feels very much like an advanced kind of chess while you're playing it. The fact that your agents will die if spotted and not moved immediately makes the movements feel like a complex series of steps to avoid being in ""check"", so to speak.The addition of voice-acting and some cutscenes has fleshed out the story and compliments the music nicely. The story is nothing to write home about, but moves the game along and gives you some motivation on why things are the way they are in the game.Be warned: this is a difficult game that has a steep learning curve. You will fail. Many times. But every failure gets you further along and gets you more agents, new toys, and new ways to play the game.Highly recommend.			"

												Invisible, Inc. is an exciting, in-depth take on the turn-based strategy genre. It has an incredibly deep atmosphere of cyberpunk infused espionage that steers you towards using cunning stealthy strategies to make any progress. Although, its focus on stealth isn't so restrictive that it doesn't allow a completely different playstyle if one is so inclined. Just remember: one wrong step and it is very likely game over – forever. You don’t get any checkpoints to revert to or retries when you fail a mission. While there are customizable options like that you can enable when you start a campaign, you’re basically looking at permanent death when you make a crucial mistake in strategic judgement in the regular campaign.The short storyline is a neat and compact campaign with a well thought out and very satisfying beginning, middle and end. It has you navigating the whole globe infiltrating various corporations with the aim of acquiring high tech gear you will need on the final mission. There’s quite a variety of procedurally generated missions from which you can choose, but distance travelled matters in your choice as you run down the 72-hour in game clock every time you move to another mission. Even before you get in game you need to make strategic decisions on how you’ll tackle the order you do the missions in and how you will equip your agents. Even the levels on the missions are procedurally generated, so no two playthroughs of this game can ever go the same. When you complete the campaign for the first time it will definitely leave you wanting so much more. Klei has you covered as their expectation isn’t that you just play the campaign once. This is where the unlockables deliver on your craving for more. With each playthrough, you use your experience gained to unlock new programs and agents. With up to four power programs, up to four hacking programs and up to 10 agents to choose from, there’s ample choice at your fingertips to construct tons of unique playthroughs.When you've had your fill of the campaign in every combination you can think of, Invisible, Inc. really shines in the long-term replayability with its Endless mode. Endless mode is the same as the campaign except the mission difficulty increases past what they normally would in the storyline. That difficulty keeps on increasing as the days go by, but, of course, there is no time limit leading you to a final mission; you just keep on going for as long as you can handle it. Between the loadout combinations, procedurally generated missions and level layouts, I’ve happily put hundreds of hours into countless endless mode playthroughs. And that was before the full game was even released!With all the gameplay praise, Invisible, Inc. also does not disappoint when it comes to its graphics, animation, music and SFX. The final release of this game is an incredibly polished work of art in all of those aspects. I can’t even put into words how perfectly the music and SFX fit the atmosphere of this game. Each corporation even has their own subtly different musical theme associated to them. The animations are smooth and the graphical style is crisp.The only thing I don’t like about this game is related to the animations. My mind thinks very fast and I would like to be able to click on things and carry out orders in rapid succession. When I have to wait for every animation to finish before I can click on the next thing, I get quite annoyed. The game has a fast mode option to speed them up, but it’s nowhere near fast enough for my liking. I always feel like computer software should be the one waiting for more inputs from the end user, not the human element having to wait for the software to allow it.Despite that, the bottom line is this: Klei Entertainment did a fantastic job with Invisible, Inc. and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the strategy genre.

												Fun Game.Warning, Spoilers.Of course, I enjoy the turn-based tactics genre so no suprise there. But I do have one complaint. The additional story elements introduced via the expansion really should have been part of the main game, as without them the story feels rushed - incomplete. Its just - BAM! - Incognita decided to take over the world, vs a gradual build up to it with the expanded story. I think a seperate campaign that actually used young Central and Monst3r, showing them first establish Invisible, would have been much better for the expansion.Still, good game. And if they were to come out with an expansion that follows the story of Invisible's founding, I'd probably buy it.			"

												This is a really enjoyable turn based strategy game. Sadly, sadly the story is...non existant. It is completely beyond me how the game programmers could create such atmospheric graphics with decent voice acting only to butcher it with a story that sucks any replay value out. Almost anything would have been better than what is there. So, if you are big on game mechnics and don't care much about the story, you really, really want to buy this game. If you are imagening yourself as James Bond meets the Nightstalker as you sneak around the buildings, heroically saving the last line of defence in a hostile world - then do yourself a favour and find something else to play.

												I recommend this game to everyone who likes tactical turn base games. In this game you lead a team of agents on their revenge on corporations, you have to chose your tagets from few available missions and then complete objectives and run away with loot.There is also endless mode in which difficulty goes up and game will never end, unless you fail and all your agents die.While on mission you have to balance between stunning/killing guards or simply avoiding them. It is a nice tactical choice, killing is easy, but raises alarm level and reduces money gains from missions while stunning will require you to carry guard bodies and watch them not to wake up too early.On top of that you have to use AI at your disposal to hack objects like cameras, drones, safes and manage resource for hacking which is Power.There is first DLC for this game but I haven't tested it yet.I haven't seen any bugs, there are a lot of options to tweak difficulty level and plenty of game modes.

												Klei continue to impress with a game that is once again different to what they’ve produced before, yet still recognisably theirs.Here is an easy to learn turn-based stealth system where the developer’s excellent visual design choices mean nothing is left unclear. However, it’s a real challenge to master, with rising security, randomized level design and item drops, and deadly enemies. Fortunately, this all adds up to encourage you to play through the campaign over and over again! Even better, the huge amount of customization options (and then mod support) mean this is a title with pretty much endless replay value.			"

												Good game for fans of stealth, random level generation, turn based team combat. The default game settings (enemy difficulty, starting cash, stun/KO duration, etc.) can be a bit tricky for first time players but there are options to customise all of these and turn the game into something more manageable (or even harder if you want a challenge).The options also allow you to extend/reduce the fixed duration of the game or to turn it into an ""endless"" game ... it's not really endless, the enemies just get harder and harder and eventually you fail to complete too many missions or your team is all captured/killed. Ther random nature of the missions, equipment you can find/buy and the abilities you can find for your pet AI can make some of the games harder/trickier than other sessions but overall it is enjoyable. The game is not very long but it is one you will repaly again and again as you unlock new agents to play with.TLDR; nice game, no twitch responses needed, nice depth of strategy in all aspects of the game. Good value for money.			"

								Wow! It was very frustrating at first since my agents kept getting overwhelmed. The key is to ace the prisoner rescue missions as soon as possible which will add the rescued agents to your team, making later missions much more survivable. I think that the exit elevator should be made visible on the map when you first start so that you have a clear goal. Either that, or make it possible to exit without saving so you can bail out of a disaster without losing all your progress on that level. FYI for new players: If you are obviously losing, choose the 'retire' option at the bottom of the list on the pause menu. Your progress up to that point will accumulate as experience that will unlock more stuff.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Invisible, Inc. is a game developed and published by Klei Entertainment, the same people behind Mark of the Ninja. Invisible, Inc. is simply one of the best single-player games I've ever playedThe theme is evoked well and the mechanisms of play are finely tuned. The real genius though, lies in how the game handles mistakes. In many games failure just costs time, or you are forced to reload whenever you make a mistakeInvisible, Inc. also allows this, but it really shines when you set up a game without rewinds or reloads. Then you get to experience how good a game can really beThe perfectly executed stealthy infiltration can quickly become a deadly game of cat and mouse, and successfully pulling unconscious agents out of a botched operation is way more satisfying than a reload could ever bePoints of reference could be XCOM or the best roguelikes, but I think Invisible, Inc. outclasses them allMy only criticism lies with how certain equipment can make core elements of the game trivial to overcome. It's not so fun when you have a ""super agent"" able to avoid or overcome all oppositionThe relatively short campaign time-frame and random item availability prevents this from becoming a significant problem though RECOMMENDED :)  "

Early Access Review
								I loved Mark of the Ninja. Klei proved without question they can do stealth gameplay well, and I grabbed this game on the strength of that alone.Be aware that the game is rough around the edges, and you're going to die a lot before you even understand how to play properly. It's difficult to tell where rooms actually begin and end in some cases, and where line-of-sight is. Some elements of the background are easily mistaken for rooms you don't currently have LOS to. Also, when planning where you're going to move to next, it's hard to tell where you can be spotted from that position.It's not clear whether an edge is a wall or a corridor you haven't been down yet. Considering that every move counts, you can't waste time exploring a wall that you thought was actually a pathway.That said, you can rotate the view left and right with Q and E, which alleviates this problem somewhat.It's not obvious when enemies are going to regain consciousness. It's two turns from when you knock them out. I'm not even sure whether than means they revive on turn two or on turn three.It's not obvious at ALL where reinforcement enemies are going to spawn from, and it badly needs to be. More than once I've sneaked into the enemy spawn room accidentally, a guard has spawned the next turn and killed me.Basically, it's difficult to get to grips with how the game actually works, so it's going to take some perserverence.On the plus side, the game is very hard :) . It has the feel of a roguelike, where your own skill and experience makes the difference between success and failure. Also, it has permadeath.Previously I'd complained that you unlock more abilities and whatnot purely from grinding. I was wrong. The unlocks are really just alternate stuff you can use, rather than things that are objectively better.Very difficult, very tense, and there's a lot of potential here that needs a bit more polish. On the balance, though, it's probably worth getting.			"

Early Access Review
								A fair few people seem to have bounced off this game which is why I decided to write this review. Yes, the initial learning curve is steep. You're likely to get squished the first couple of times you play until you get a better feel for exactly how far you can push it before you are putting yourself in danger. I can see that would put off some people, but it just means that when everything finally 'clicks' then the satisfaction is incredible.This is a game that lends itself very well to creating instances where you are in awkward situations, often of your own making (e.g. opening doors you thought were safe but, oops, turns out a wandering guard is right on the other side), but you are given all the tools you need to create awesome solutions. When a recent mission went astray and two out of three of my agents were KO'd, it was up to my last guy to run around kiting enemies into the range of turrets I had hacked onto my side, taking their cash to buy an extra medi-gel, then cloaking, running past the remaining guards, reviving my two downed agents and everyone legging it to the exit. It was easily my favourite moment in games this year because I had created this impossible situation, and then come up with my own equally unlikely solution.Once you've worked out how to play with the AI, and you figure out how to use the toys the game gives you in the form of different agents (you start with 2 available but can unlock 2 more) and items like EMP emitters, paralyzing drugs and cybernetic implants, if anything it gets too easy - but the joy of manipulating the enemies and the environment doesn't go away, and leads to so many incredible moments.IMHO, very strong contender for game of the year.

												Satisfying, Ingenious, and challenging, Invisible inc is a great title. The game is always challenging you, the security is always risng, The drowns are hounding you and you dont have enough power to hack them, the lack of credits and equipment always hindering you, this game really puts the pressure on. If you play on begginer (which is very challenging) you get a couple redos for turns, other than that its cutthroat! If an agent dies, he's dead. If you screw up and get shot your done. The game even deletes your save file if all your agents die... BRUTAL!!! The nice part is you get EXP even if you loose that unlocks better (More diverse) agents and computer hacking tools. This Game is really fun and addicting! It really makes you feel like a spy. P.S. Those Deamons really suck...			"

												Great turn-based strategy game.  Fun and challenging.  The need for careful planned movement and coordination of agents, the lure of additional objectives (lured me into doom!), the cover system, and the turn-based nature of the game all make this an excellent puzzle-ish strategy game.

												Good game for fans of stealth, random level generation, turn based team combat. The default game settings (enemy difficulty, starting cash, stun/KO duration, etc.) can be a bit tricky for first time players but there are options to customise all of these and turn the game into something more manageable (or even harder if you want a challenge).The options also allow you to extend/reduce the fixed duration of the game or to turn it into an ""endless"" game ... it's not really endless, the enemies just get harder and harder and eventually you fail to complete too many missions or your team is all captured/killed. Ther random nature of the missions, equipment you can find/buy and the abilities you can find for your pet AI can make some of the games harder/trickier than other sessions but overall it is enjoyable. The game is not very long but it is one you will repaly again and again as you unlock new agents to play with.TLDR; nice game, no twitch responses needed, nice depth of strategy in all aspects of the game. Good value for money.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a game that even now in beta, commands your attention.  Too often game idea's sound good on paper, or trailer, but when you play it, it doesn't deliver on the gameplay and more importantly fantasy.  Invisible, Inc. delivers on both.  It's up there with the best and most difficult turn based games, and is undeniably the best example of a true espionage game out there.Did I mention it was difficult.  Oh god, be prepared to lose....and not reload...but restart, the entire game all over again.  Many, many times.  With a smile on your face, and if you're lucky, a lesson learnt from your defeat.  If you're intrigued by that last part, your the kind of agent this game is looking for.			"

												Klei Entertainment did an amazing job on Don't Starve, and Invisible, Inc. is another beautiful game. To give an idea of the style of game, it is an FTL mixed with XCOM. This combination makes a very cool futuristic spy game that has a short campaign with endless replay value. The character unlock system works like Don't Starve character unlocks, and the levels are procedurally generated. Keep up the great work, Klei. Would highly recommend this game to fans of FTL, XCOM, Don't Starve, and everyone else.			"

												This game, even in this incredibly early beta state, is tons of fun. It is basically a turn-based stealth strategy game that involves breaking into precedurally generated levels, taking as much stuff as you can, and then escaping with some sort of new toy to make the harder levels viable. This game is punishing. If you like games like Fire Emblem or XCom you will definitely dig this and I eagerly await the finished product. Gold star to Klei for knocking it out of the park again after Don't Starve.UPDATE: The full version was released recently for pre-purchasers and I am happy to announce that the finished product is quality. The game is getting released in a couple of days and it is worth your time and money. There are stylistic cutscenes, new objectives, a cohesive story, and a custom campaign mode on top of new characters and abilities that have been trickling out since early access. Definitely worth the price of admission.			"

												It is a mixture of X-Com, NetRunner, Mark of the Ninja, Payday2, all combined in a setting of the future. It has mechanics, polish, style, sleek 2D art designs. Every character is different in the sense that they have their own unique ""talents/skill"" in the form of augments and stats.I easily sank in 30 hours of gameplay before finally beating the game's campaign at least once; And 71 hours total over the course of early-access. They weren't kidding about the unforgiving, hardcore, constant failing and retrying to learn your team of characters' and items' strengths, as well as weaknesses.Overall, a really ""Wow!"" Industrial/Corporate Espionage game.9/10. Highly recommended. That 1 point is missing for the sheer frustration of retrials! <3 Klei Entertainment.			"

												I've been playing this since it was Incognita and received the final release a few days ago as an EA buyer, so I have a few hours on it. It's a very good, turn based, tactical game. There are enough bells and whistles to make the gameplay interesting for more than one run at the campaign, and with the ability to alter practically all of the gameplay settings there's a lot of replay value to it. There's also an Endless play mode which allows for just mission after mission without the cutoff of the triggering of the Final Mission. The levels are all procedurally generated so you don't see the same thing twice, and since it's had a lot of tweaking the generating of the levels is pretty much glitch free. Highly recommended.			"

												TLDR: turn-based tactical espionage action in a stilish cyberpunk setting. You will learn the importance of closing doors!In this future cyberpunk setting, you are cast as an operator trying to survive a hunt called by many corporations, hoping to last 72 hours so that you can strike back (there are custom and endless modes available too).In the strategic map, you will choose where to deploy your team between the different randomly generated mission available, each offering different objectives, enemies and rewards. Once chosen, you will proceed to a turn-based, XCOM like mission. Unlike XCOM, sneaking and not engaging the enemy is the order of they day.Despite lacking an enfasis on combat, each mission is a tense and tight affair where you are using all the tools available. The wonderful and atmosferic soundtrack enhances the gameplay.I have enjoyed this game so far, my only negative is that some of the mechanics are not covered by the tutorial or in the help section, so you will have to do some googling to find your answers.

Early Access Review
								Post release update: This game is even better than I hoped it would be. It is a wonderful mix of Shadowrun Returns, Mark of the Ninja with just a hint of XCOM. The tension between trying to get everything and the ever-increasing security level is perfect, and the difficulty level customisation options are brilliant. A+ gameOriginal Early Access review: Invisible, Inc is a fantastic turn-based stealth strategy game. The gameplay is spot on and really, really tense. Violence really is not a good option which I love (it just makes more trouble for you!) and the game is all the better for it. As could be expected given Mark of the Ninja they show real confidence in the stealth mechanics, but stealth here is about precise placement and tactical thought, rather than in darkness and movement. Both are brilliant. Finely tuned, beautiful to look at, with lovely music this could be a finished game already.Klei are doing Early Access right with this game. I bought the game when it was pre-Early Access and development has been a joy to watch as Klei are working hard to craft a gem of a game.			"

												Another fine game from Klei to say the least. Had this since April of last year and I'm very pleased as to how the final product turned out. Yet another fresh take on stealth by Klei, this is a turn based tactical espionage game that features procedurally generated levels and permadeath(though there are mission retries on the lowest difficuly). It may not explicitly state this, but it is very much structured like a modern rougelike (a la FTL) with playthroughs lasting around the ballpark of a couple hours and a lot of variation between each playthrough. You create a team whenever you start a playthrough, selecting any two of ten unlockable agents(six of which have an alt form so technically 16) and two mainframe programs. There is a hacking element in the game that features resource management of CPU power that can be used to hack various devices such as cameras, safes, etc. There's also an alarm level that ticks every turn, Forcing a lot of different decisions(do I go after that nanofabricator machine and buy some gear or escape before things get too hectic?) and making the gameplay more dynamic. Overall, I love the gameplay of this game. Not many games can keep me playing for 70 hours(and I don't plan on stopping now) but Invisible Inc has enough depth and variation to keep me playing. Also, as with every game Klei makes, the artstyle of this game is wonderful. My only complaint I have is that the couple of cinematics they put in the game very recently could have been better quality. Voice acting is a little flat and it looks a little grainy. Overall I definately recommend this game.			"

												Invisible Inc. was already solid in Early Access, and after catching up on the full release with the Contigency Plan DLC...I love it even more.  One of the few experiences where procedural levels are fundamentally essential to the core experience.  Instead of stealth in real-time where being caught just means restart and memorize the space, you're forced to explore.  Peaking and hacking your way into these randomized spaces, gathering intel and using what's in your toolkit to deal with slowly mounting threats.  Each decision becomes more important, tension rises, the risk for reward sits in the back of your mind, and the surprises will make you cheer or despair.Turn-based games live and die based on whether they provide interesting choices, and Invisible Inc. has them in spades.  So many stealth games now feel like I'm an action hero with a silencer, but this makes me feel like a secret agent in more ways than one.			"

												A delight of turn-based strategy game. I have completed one campaign (hours not recorded by Steam, I was always off-line) and am now going for the second. Many many times I have consumed myself over what shall be my next move, my choice of target, or upgrade or equipment to buy. Resources are scarce, you race against time, and every decision is tough. The stylized graphics are pretty but run on modest hardware, and the music compliments the mood of the action beautifully. If you are cautious, minimize risks, your agents will have better odds at first... but you won't collect enough resources, and the enemy keeps upgrading, and becoming more dangerous. To stand a chance to win the campaign, you need to be bold; it is fear, excitement and thrill all the time, building up to that nearly desperate last mission. And you can make the campaign as hard as you like. Random generated levels and different outcomes give re-play value. Worth snatching with its DLC right away.			"

												I got this on a sale, wasnt expecting much but it had been in my wishlist as an interesting concept. Think XCOM meets Chess as a game of stealth. First and foremost, the game has reply value. It is'nt mind blowingly captivating but it is addicting in the standard one more turn for the next hour fashion. There is something missing to make this came equal to the caliber of XCOM, but the game is complete and polished. When ever I need to just veg out and not think, this is a game I can sit down to and further unlock character and items. Ive only played through on Easy. The biggest disapointment on story mode is the lack of having or rescuing more than 4 operatives.			"

												While this game is fun to play, it's ridiculously difficult even on the beginner setting. If you like turn based strategy games you'll enjoy it, but getting out alive is an extremely difficult task. It takes a full playthrough of the game (about 3 hours) to even begin to understand what you are doing. This game is challenging, but sometimes it seems unfair. The procedural generator can be very unforgiving, throwing you into a difficult map including many rooms where the objective and exit are on wildly different parts of the map, forcing you to traverse back through the mess of guards that just woke up. The game world is already set up for you to lose. Because the maps are procedurally generated, you can get maps that literally are not possible to beat without sacrificing a large portion of your team.Unless you might like a very challenging spatial strategy game, I'd save your money until they deal with the difficulty.This is all on Beginner mode. Each approach you take has HUGE consequences down the line and the game's alert level system just brings the crushing weight of time down on you. The cost and armor level of the guards go up very quickly without providing much to help you in return.The game feels polished, but they've got a lot to do difficulty wise. I'm still coming back to the game, but my first playthrough I didn't complete any objectives because of the level of difficulty. If the DEV wants the players to play perfectly, they should make it a bit easier on beginner mode.			"

You need to depend on your wits and not even overpower your enemies, but avoid them. That, and the beautiful art style and unique setting really set this one apart. One of my favorites!			"

												Excellent game that comes highly recommended if you enjoy either stealth games or roguelikes (or both!).The stealth mechanics are consistent and predictable. When played carefully, the game acts almost like a puzzle game, as you manipulate guards to avoid detection. Pure stealth is complicated by the escalating security measures, which add a soft time pressure to the game; take too long, and added patrols will eventually overwhelm you.Roguelike mechanics are present, in the form of a short campaign designed for replayability, randomized loot opportunities, and of course permanent death and loss. The game is designed to be played numerous times, with different strategies and difficulty levels; a choice of many different agents and initial programs means that you can try out different builds and techniques with each run through the game.There are a few minor gripes. Many agents and gadgets just feel subpar compared to their alternatives. Stat breakpoints are everywhere, most obviously Anarchy 2 to unlock pickpocketing (which gives you all the loot from guards without needing to KO them, a very valuable mechanic in a game where KO'd guards will get back up and start hunting you!). The game feels less balanced the later it stretches, though the vanilla game features a time limit that'll keep the length fair.All things considered, I'd strongly recommend the game. A few flaws are overwhelmed by a slew of positive and well-executed mechanics, plus a beautiful art style and engrossing world.			"

												Combine stealth and turn-based element to become Invisible, Inc. If you like XCOM, you would want to get your hand on this game. The game is so intense that you might replay the level... a LOT...VERY much recommended for XCOM fans... "

												Klei has stumbled onto the secret formula of stealth games wherein unmasking the behavior of the core systems and providing the player with an abundance of information can result in fun, engaging gameplay that rewards playing situations as close to the edge as possible without the feeling that you're suddenly going to be screwed by a random number generator.

												Klei has gone done it once more.  Their ability to blend a fresh graphic style with near flawless stealth mechanics and a good story is impressive.  I find myself staying up well past a respectable bed time to play ""one more mission"" which is generally a good sign of a fun game.There is this sinking feeling that the mechanics of Invisible, Inc. are very much the mechanics that I was hoping for in the first place with the ""Shadowrun"" series.  Sneaky about, avoiding patrols, disarming cameras and augmenting your agents is all very cyberpunk and it system flows very nicely.  Harebrained take notes...  reminds me a bit of Shadow Watch from the late 90s as well which I have fond memories of as well.If you are looking for a fun turn based, team tactics stealth game then look no further then Invisible, Inc.

Early Access Review
								This game is in early access, so I'm allowed to be as critical as I like, right?Simply put, the game still has a few techincal issues left, I've had charaters fail to tazer an enemy next to them, while they were on overwatch for example. The bigger issue, however, is that the game's tutorial doesn't do a good enough job to explain the game's mechanics. There is a fine line between information given to the player, and information the player can find out for him/herself in a roguelike. I've died twice because of a poor tooltip on the cloaking device:-Running right in front of a guard while cloaked caused a guard to see me and kill me, I had no way of knowing it would do that, since you can pass through his visibility in any other point without being noticed.-Stealing from guards cancelled my cloak. I also had to watch a youtube video to know that pinning people legthens their KO-status (A VERY vital mechanic)Those are the mistakes I've made, but I've seen Youtubers mess up much worse because they simply had no info about some of the basic mechanics, or that they understood them wrong.I'm also left wondering about the character balance, since Internationale seems a bit underpowered compared to her peers at the moment (Banks is really good, but she's unlockable so I guess it's fine)Hm, what I thought of the game? It's right up my alley. I love strategy games in the vein of Xcom and Fire emblem, and I can see this as a roguelike that finally clicks for me. Can't wait for more story content. "

								Xcom meets Mark of the Ninja.This game is a gem that is getting polished bit by bit.GAMEPLAY:Stealth Combat: Challenging but without the frustration of random number generators (abilities have cooldowns instead). Hide behind doors and desks, distract guards, and knock them out for a few turns before they regain consciousness.Hacking: Manage your energy power vs the cost of hacking into firewalls. You can gain from dispensed terminals in a level and from producing it yourself based on the particular tool you decide to use (ex. Power Drip = +1 power/turn vs Power Fusion = -5 power + 3 power for 4 turns)Fast-Paced: Every turn you spend in a level, the Alert meter fills up. There are 6 Levels in the meter with various consequences (ex. Level 1 Alert = more cameras turned on, Level 2 = added firewalls)Various Objectives: Rescue prisoners from detention cells, steal artifacts and cash from corporate vaults (my favorite), steal advanced gadgets and equipment, steal corporate intelligence; then make it back to the extraction point.RPG ELEMENTS:Characters: +4 characters to choose from each with their own unique abilities and stats (ex. cloak vs rifle). 4 Different Statistical upgrades which include Stealth, Hacking, Inventory, Anarchy. Each level of a stat gives a character an additional benefit (ex. Stealth = +1 to movement points).Incognita: Upgrade the hacking tool you use on a mission when you pull up the tactical 'incognita' map interface.ART & ANIMATION:Just look at the screenshots above. Animation is basic with more fluidity and variety to come (early access). NOW I'm just waiting on technical and balance refinements and additional story elements.9/10 "

Early Access Review
								A fair few people seem to have bounced off this game which is why I decided to write this review. Yes, the initial learning curve is steep. You're likely to get squished the first couple of times you play until you get a better feel for exactly how far you can push it before you are putting yourself in danger. I can see that would put off some people, but it just means that when everything finally 'clicks' then the satisfaction is incredible.This is a game that lends itself very well to creating instances where you are in awkward situations, often of your own making (e.g. opening doors you thought were safe but, oops, turns out a wandering guard is right on the other side), but you are given all the tools you need to create awesome solutions. When a recent mission went astray and two out of three of my agents were KO'd, it was up to my last guy to run around kiting enemies into the range of turrets I had hacked onto my side, taking their cash to buy an extra medi-gel, then cloaking, running past the remaining guards, reviving my two downed agents and everyone legging it to the exit. It was easily my favourite moment in games this year because I had created this impossible situation, and then come up with my own equally unlikely solution.Once you've worked out how to play with the AI, and you figure out how to use the toys the game gives you in the form of different agents (you start with 2 available but can unlock 2 more) and items like EMP emitters, paralyzing drugs and cybernetic implants, if anything it gets too easy - but the joy of manipulating the enemies and the environment doesn't go away, and leads to so many incredible moments.IMHO, very strong contender for game of the year.

								Each mission feels tense and difficult but not unfair, and it seems like there are potentially a ton of different tactics you can try. There are a few rough edges on it, but for an Early Access game, I'd call this entirely playable and enjoyable in its current state. Only real downside I can think of is that the tutorial is inadequate; it teaches a fair bit but you still need to stumble through multiple missions wondering what the hell is going on before it starts to click. Once it does, though, lots of great gameplay here.			"

Early Access Review
								This one surprised me. Invisible Inc's art struck me as unique, and after watching through the steam video I thoguht I would a shot. I am so glad that I did! I've played for 17 hours, at the time of this review and the fun hasn't stopped (thoguh it has slowed down). At first it was all about learning how to play and discovering unlockables, but now that I've mastered the basics it's about balancing my resources, making the most out of every turn, utilizing items in interesting and effective combinations, and sometimes sacrificing a loyal agent as a distraction to get the job done.The randomization of the levels is well done, in my opinion. Enemy difficulty and map complexity ramp up as the player continues along the campaign or advances in Endless Mode (unlocked by beating the Story Mode), and thoguh it is true that sometimes the whole map funnels through ONE STUPID DOOR, even in desperate situations you can usually weasel your way through with some losses.The AI is good enough for now, and I'm sure it will only get better as the game is built. There are bugs here and there, but overall it is in a very stable state for an early access game.Some Tips:-The mission names are descriptive. Make sure you pick ones that are best suited for your situation. Don't do the Contraband Templates missions if you are broke!-Do detention missions until you have at least three agents. Three is vastly superior to two.-You can rotate the camera wit the Q and E keys!-Sometimes your agents die. Learn from what happened and start againREMEMBER: If you open or peek though a door, melee reaction mode is disabled. This is the worst part of the game and has killed me many times.			"

								I understand why people aren't a fan. You pretty much need to go into it with the understanding that you will die. You will die a lot. You will die so much that you will get upset, and once you've passed that part of it you will realize that this is all part of the game. This game punishes you for cutting corners and for being indecisive. I love every bit of it and look forward to all of the development still in store for it. IF you like the harsh, ""don't starve"" style gameplay where you can go for hours and lose it all from one stupid mistake, then pick this up and enjoy.			"

The upgrade system is cool, and there is already a nice selection of items to haul around and play with. The XP unlock of new characters/items from games I've failed is a nice surprise as well.For early access, it's already fun. Linux support promised down the road too!Also, screw security drones...

												This game is an absolute triumph of design and I would go as far as to say the best designed game I've ever played.  It's always tense and generates some great stories of some impossible situation you squirmed out of.  Not once in my time with the game did I feel cheated or think the game was unfair, unlike other turn based strategy games.  Looking at you, Xcom.  Most importantly of all, it's great fun.If you're the kind of gamer who never replays things, you might feel the campaign is too short.  The Contingency Plan DLC addresses this by extending the campaign as well adding a lot of new items, programs, guard abilities etc.  I don't know who in their right mind would only play through this once, but you've been warned.  Invisible Inc and its DLC are easily worth the money.			"

												Invisible, Inc. is a great stealth/TBS game with rogue-like elements.  It looks great, runs great.  I have experienced no technical issues/bugs of any kind.  With this game, Klei does Shadowrun better than Harebrained Schemes (minus the trolls and magic).+Great visuals and audio.  Procedurally-generated levels.  Lots of playable characters and items (lots of choices/options).  The hiding/hacking/guard visual cone mechanics are all easy to understand and use.-I thought M0nst3r was a bit of a disappointment as a storefront (often has nothing for sale).  I would like Incognita to be upgradable.  No major complaints with this game.If you like TBS games and the idea of sneaking around guards undetected while stealing everything in sight then Invisibile, Inc. is worth a look.  This is not a frontal assault / guns blazing game.			"

												Invisible, Inc. is easy to learn and hard to master.  It has great replay value.  You can get a lot of mileage out of different combinations of group members, attributes & skills, computer programs, weapons and random levels.This game makes you think out of the box.  You have a lot of options for handling different situations.  You try to use stealth and line-of-sight visibility to navigate through the levels without being detected.  Sometimes you will be detected, and you use various means to keep the situation under control.  A lot of it comes down to making smart decisions, and managing risks and resources.The game puts you in tricky situations over and over again.  Sometimes it looks like there's no way out, but I try something, and it works.  I find it very rewarding.Also, you will fail sometimes on the harder difficulty settings.  This is not so bad.  I always learn from my failures and I see myself improve afterwards.I like:-Randomly generated levels keep the game fresh-Large, diverse cast of playable characters-Stylish art design and great animation-Custom difficulty options-Balanced, chalenging and flexible gameplay-Excellent cutscenesI don't like:-The campaign feels too short-Environments and corporate guards generally look the same, regardless of which region you travel to-The heroes' ability to assassinate low-level security guards with no repercussions or impact on the story-I wanted to watch more of those great cutscenes between missions, instead of back-and-forth dialogue between the same two charactersOverall, recommended if you like something turn-based but simple, that you can pick up and play at short intervals, for a low price and a lot of replay value.

												In a nutshell: This game is kinda like Chess... but with cool gadgets.Lots of options to customise the gameplay to suit you, loads to unlock, pleasing visuals, potentially VERY challenging gameplay thanks to Endless mode... it's a great little package - smart, and well presented.I hope Invisible Inc. returns for a second outing.Review:I came across this game as a result of looking for a decent hacker/spy title. I got a tip from somebody in a comments section on a blog so I put it in my wishlist and finally made the investment during a sale.As I play on what I guess would now be considered an outdated laptop, I was concerned that it wouldn't run that well and there'd be lots of lag and slow-down, but it plays fine actually. And I'm happy that it does, because it's a quality game, especially so considering its sale price.- As mentioned earlier, this game is kinda like Chess in that it's a turn based game - you make your move, then the opponent makes theirs, and so on... what makes it interesting, apart from all the cool gadgets and the Random Number God (more on that later) is the ever-increasing incremental alarm system, meaning that not only do you feel somewhat under pressure, but also that each turn is precious, so thinking things through before you execute is advisable if you want to avoid coming into contact with some of the better equipped enemy personnel who lurk at the higher levels. Thankfully, there are no limits to how much time you spend during each turn (unless you select this option) so you get to consider things before ending your turn.- There are lots of things to unlock (including Augments, Programs, Weapons and Items, as well as new Characters), and a few different strategies based on what equipment loadout is selected, but it's essentially a stealth game, meaning there are few rewards (but plenty of penalties, mind) for a playstyle which is geared towards being overtly offensive.- The top-down, isometric view can at times present some frustrations, but only occasionally (when trying to view a narrow passageway, for example), and is quite pleasing overall.- On the subject of views - the cell shaded art style is easy on the eye, and whilst the in-game graphics are polished, functional and without flaw (from my experience, at least), some might consider them to be lacking when compared to the realism presented in other titles nowadays, not that this is a criticism of mine as I'm grateful that my old laptop can handle the visuals comfortably enough to allow for a smooth gaming experience. Let's call the graphics 'accessible' then.- Game length is very short if you're talking about completing just one single campaign, but the replay factor is ever-present thanks to rolling XP (used to unlock those unlockables mentioned earlier) and also what seems like a Random Number Generator (RNG) type of level generator - no two levels are the same, even if you have the restart option checked. This is clever and means there is no 'practice makes perfect' approach to the gameplay in any given level, as you always need to investigate and explore in order to locate the mission objective and exfiltration point which can lead to wrong decisions being made, and this is what makes it fun..... and also why you might want to have the NOOOOOOO! button to hand, as I wish I did when I realised I left my newly purchased (and expensive) Portable Server at the other side of the level, not realising I'd need to pick it up again before I snuck away into the night - ugh... There are, however, options to customise the gameplay, meaning you can choose the number of Rewinds etc to make the game harder or easier, depending on how you feel that day - this I like.- The voice acting is well done, but due to the short span of any given campaign, there isn't much of it. Quality over quantity.I actually wish the campaigns were longer, at least in terms of the story (which hints at the cliche outcome now and again), but having said that, there is a DLC option which promises to extend the campaign mode and offers more unlocks and challenges. So I look forward to playing this as well.Recommended :)			"

												I initially played Invisible, Inc. before having played XCOM, so I understand why people say that they're similar.This is a turn-based tactical strategy game--the movement of the units is very similar the FFTA (and other games like it).  Your main goal is to get in and out under the radar. You really don't want to be shooting it up.I really enjoyed the plot and the character backstories are also quite nice.Would recommend it to anyone looking for a slightly challenging game but casual enough to just pick it up.

Despite being in early access, the game is very enjoyable in its current state, and will be even better when finished. The game has a fairly steep learning curve, and your first few playthroughs will appear unfair, however once you have gotten used to the game mechanics, Invisible Inc. becomes a challenging, rather than punishing affair. Unfortunately, on two occasions my save file became corrupted, and I was forced to restart the mission I was playing but being in early access, this is excusable.Ideas for improvement:-Offer a basic shop between missions for buying ammo etc.			"

At first, it seems a little like XCOM but players will soon find that instigating fights will lead to swift defeat. You're the Operator. Your job is to make sure your Agents navigate the level safely while disarming security systems and dodging enforcer patrols. Catch is: loot is (mostly) optional but you gain no extra money for finishing missions and every mission gets harder! More guards, more security systems, all the while the constant threat of having increased security levels after each turn (resulting in EVEN more guards, harder to hack security fire walls and more threats to your mission). It's fun as much as face-palming after you realize you made a wrong move and now your agent is dead - did I mention they don't come back to life unless you save them and exit the mission with them? Levels are always different and the way you approach them will be different as such. I'd highly recommend anyone to get this game even in Early Access. I can't really give a number/10 since this is my first review and I don't know what I could compare this to.			"

Early Access Review
								This is probably one of the most challenging TBS games I've played. Well done!EDIT:After more playtesting, I'd say the single biggest, and at the same time simplest, modification the devs could make is to make it possible for the agents to re-lock security doors once they have a passcard.A couple things I'd like to see: Some method whereby you can recover the gear you've previously lost in the field.An optional 'Casual' mode which doesn't affect your score, but in which permadeath doesn't happen.

								I only have a little time into this game so far, but I can already tell this is going to be a lot of fun. With its combination of stealth and turn based tactics, it seems like a great mashup of XCOM, Mark of the Ninja, and Syndicate. The style is gorgeous like pretty much any game from Klei. Although it's in early access I haven't encountered any bugs yet. Totally recommend.			"

Early Access Review
								I'll be honest, I can hardly believe that his is early access.This game is brutal, I'll put it simply.  If Ironman XCOM is a game you love, then you wwill love this.  It has a very interesting blend of stealth and savagery - you can't just crush everything because, if you do, you'll be dealing with it for the rest of the mission.  And on top of that, the big badddies will destroy you.  Not even the big baddies - one shot, one kill in this game (or at least your agents die that easily).Pros:  It's gorgeous.  Absolutely beautiful.  Rotating the map, being able to turn on ""Incognita"" so that you can see the grid and hack the cameras, freeing prisoners, sight cones - combined with the excellent graphic design, this game feels like a legitimate, true spy game.  On top of that, it's in Early Access, and it's this good.  These are the games that deserve Early Access, the games with proven, solid gameplay.  I already feel like I've got my money's worth out of this, because even though I only have 3 hours logged, I know that I have so many more available.  The procedural generation is astounding too - the rooms are almost always believable, and some times you have to figure out whether something is worth attaining, or if it's impossible for you becaus you just need that one piece of gear.  I love it already.  Their Alarm mechanic breates new life into this game, much like Meld did for XCOM.  Further, just because this is Early Access, I should mention that there actually have not been any huge bugs or game crashes or anything like that.  That may change, but so far, it's incredibly stable, both in terms of gameplay and... electronically?  It doesn't crash and you don't have teleporting guys or anything like that.  I didn't even see any small bugs.Cons:  Not many.  Sure, they are going to add more content, and I could see how addining additional spies would assist with that.  Same for bad-guys and rooms and safes and target sites.  But it sure doesn't feel forced, nor does it feel constrictive because of a lack of content in any way.  Once or twice your spies will spawn in a room with one door and you kind of wonder how they got there (the vents I guess) but that's ot a concern more as a ""huh"" moment.  It takes up a lot of my time.  It's kind of annoying that everything is credits, and that my spies develop no ""experience"" unless I spend money (which determines your score) on them.  However, from a design stand point, this makes sense - now development is a decision, not a given; can you do without that upgrade to try and get an even higher score, or is it a small expenses for great rewards scenario?You can tell I like this game if the cons have REASONS and aren't just there.In a nutshell: This game is the XCOM of spy games.  Totally worth a buy, especially at 15 bucks.			"

												A turn based stealth game that does more to encourage sneaking than most first person stealth games.The ticking alarm keeps the right amount of pressure, making each level a nail biter.At the Start of each level: I'm a sneaksy spy, creeping past guards, turning off cameras, more ghost than man.At the End of each level: I need two more turns to complete the objective, but the exit is on the other side of the map. There's a guard closing in on my position, and those other two I knocked out a few turns ago just woke up, and are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I can send a teamate to intercept the guard closing in on me, but that door is locked, and the only key we have is held by my OTHER teammate, and she's on the other end of the map.

												Invisible, Inc. is the best Tactical Espionage Action game I've played in years. In some ways it even beats Metal Gear Solid V in that field, though the two games obviously go for very different approached to the stealth genre.I've played quite a few games that randomizes their levels each play and most of them suffer from the occasional nigh impossible levels as a result. Klei has done something right with their system, however, since I remember only two or three instances where I've had to retreat from a level because I felt my agents had no chance of making it to their objective and back. Even in these cases I possibly could have pulled the mission through with more prudent upgrades to the agents and their equipment, and even though I was ill-prepared the level still gave me ample opportunity to exit it without too much of a hassle (plus you can adjust difficulty so the guard patrol paths are more infiltration friendly if you need it).And tactical retreat is truly a viable option here: You may have a harder time down the road from missing the resources you were trying to get but that doesn't mean you're out of the game just yet. 98% of the time there's blindspots to exploit in the patrol paths and even when there's not, you can usually lure guards into an ambush or just our of your way. Just take your time to observe their movement and time yours accordingly.The large roster of agents are all different in terms of their abilities, equipment and possible augmentations, lending great variety to gameplay on top of the randomly generated levels. In addition, you never know for sure what equipment, augmentations or Incognita programs you'll encounter each playthrough, or what kind of a layout of the different corporate facilities you are going to get - you'll have to adapt on the fly and choose between several alluring options, meaning no two campaigns are going to feel quite alike.On top of all that, the game has modding tools available even if they are somewhat under utilized at the moment: Most mods are language packs or graphical tweaks. One user, however, has created several new agents for the game, each with their strengths and weaknesses. I've only tried one of them out yet but it was solid work and balanced as far as I can tell, and the reviews on the other ones suggest they are of similar quality.If you're at all fond of turn based squad control games, or at all into stealth, I highly recommend you get this game.

Early Access Review
								It actually kind of blew my mind how great this game turned out to be, every single mission is TENSE as hell, and it's really hard, you're probably not gonna win it on your first playthrough. But that's what's great about it, you're meant to play it several times, just like The Binding of Isaac or FTL. My only gripes as of now are that there are too few items, every map looks the same and you can't manage your inventory to give an item from one agent to another, but hopefully these things will all be adressed before or at release! What I would like is more variation in the rooms/buildings you find yourself in, and maybe even outdoor parts that vary between night and day depending on where in the world you are at what time, daytime making stealth harder in some way. Either way, for the price, even in early access, this game is absolutely worth it, I'll trust the developers to take fan opinions into consideration when adding more features to the game.			"

												Klei continue to impress with a game that is once again different to what they’ve produced before, yet still recognisably theirs.Here is an easy to learn turn-based stealth system where the developer’s excellent visual design choices mean nothing is left unclear. However, it’s a real challenge to master, with rising security, randomized level design and item drops, and deadly enemies. Fortunately, this all adds up to encourage you to play through the campaign over and over again! Even better, the huge amount of customization options (and then mod support) mean this is a title with pretty much endless replay value.			"

												For some reason, I really enjoyed this somewhat simple game. The missions are quick, the 2 tiered strategy is sufficient (hacking and stealthing), there are enough options to play with for quite a while.The only bad part is occasionally playing a horribly designed stage. They are randomly generated, so sometimes there will be like 5 guards all in one narrow spot that you've no chance in hell in getting past. Yes, I tried distracting them through the door. It's a better idea on paper, and works better in a circular setup. If they don't scan grenade you.Still, that happens rarely. I can usually overcome the random level design. It just makes me more careful for every stage.It's definitely worth $10 or even $20.			"

												Invisible, Inc. is an amazing game. I would describe it as a turn-based stealth rogue-like. The mechanics, UI, and logic in this game are fantastic. The game has a number of agents, items, and software programs that allow for a great variety of strategies. To give you a sense of this, here are some of my favorites:My favorite agents: Internationale (who is great for scouting), Banks (who is great for quickly opening up the map), and Dr. Xu (who can open safes and take out drones without breaking firewalls, even bypassing daemons). My favorite items: I love the cloaking rigs (invisibility is simply the best way of avoiding guards, cameras, and drones). I also like the biogenic DARTs (for taking out guards from a distance).My favorite programs: Parasite is great for whittling down firewalls across the map, and Ping is a great way to distract the guards and send them in a different direction.I highly recommend this game if you find the concept appealing. This is the first game for which I have earned all of the achievements! Good luck, operator ...			"

												It's like XCom and Mark of the Ninja had a child together - a turn-based stealth game where you try to infiltrate corporations with your squad of hackers, and whatnot. The campaign is short-ish - it took me about 6 hours to get through the beginner mode. However, the game is extremely replayable, with you unlocking different characters / items / programs every game - somewhat like Dungeon of the Endless. Multiple different difficulty levels exist as well as custom games, which give you a tonne of options.The artstyle is awesome - it's somehow both typical Klei (Don't Starve, Mark of the Ninja) while being completely unique from both of those titles.All in all, this is a fantastic game.

This game spices it up focusing on stealth, hacking and...outright tile abuse!The difficulties make you have to die a lot before you realize how you need to play in order to beat it, the game is short though. Too short actually, the game is meant to rush you but, i find it hard to build my team into anything i want by the end.There are a lot of upgrades to find and youll only have access to a select few. Thats not the problem tho, the fact is that most of the upgrades you can find are complete garabage. Now you can sell them for half price but, thats assuming you stole it, which is a let down either way.Basically its in your best intrest to browse every type of upgrade station you come across. You might get killed not having it, you might get killed trying to get it.Maybe im just too used to them but, the starting agents and programs seem to be the best starting kit. Not just easiest to play but, the most practical.The game is better than good but, its not great either, its definately missing some polishing. Hard to tell if i even want to get the dlc expansion. It looks more or less the same, add new things in, strat changes, get ♥♥♥♥ed for not knowing better.5 out of 10 dameons "

												This is a great game. The concept is excellent, I liked the characters, and really enjoy the gameplay. Unfortunately, I wish the developers kept building on that momentum for a much longer story arc. When the game ended, I thought it was about to start the main part of the game. Instead, I was surprised by rolling credits. I'm not as interested in continuing to play the same scenario with different characters and difficulty levels.			"

												Great TBS/RPG with wonderful art, a great soundtrack, and well balanced procedural maps; with in-depth customization to match your playstyle.  With several campaign settings that change the game drastically as well as custom campaign generation, Invisible Inc has infinite replayability. The Contingency Plan DLC is absolutely worth it as it provides more depth to the standard campaigns and includes a large amount of new content. Highly recommended for people who enjoy one of the best Turn-Based-Strategy games ever.10/10			"

												What surprises me most about this game was how much fun I had with it. What drew me in the first place was its good looking art style and intriguing storyline. I must say the game deliver on all aspects. The gameplay was very fun and challenging requiring you to develop more complex strategies as the story progresses. This decision to whether to prioritize maximizing your team of agents, acquiring vast monetary income and obtaining valuable weapons is the core of Invisible Inc. The art style is really satisfying to look, and I have nothing but praises for it. What I think left me the most stunned was how compelling the story was, and I can't wait to see how the story develops should the game ever receives a sequel. I highly recommend this game to everybody. My rating: Buy it!  "

												I didn't know I enjoyed turn-based strategy until I played this game. I love the theme, the design, the atmosphere, everything. I especially love how customisable the play is, allowing you to play it in your own way. If it wasn't for the ""beginner mode"" I'm not sure I would have given a game like this a go, and I'm so glad I did because I'm addicted! The character progression, new skills/augments, items, and strategy options make it so fun, and it really feels like your agents are going from unequipped, to more awesome, stealthy badasses, thanks to the resources they've acquired. I recommend this to people even if they don't usually like turn-based strategy :D			"

												A turn based stealth game that does more to encourage sneaking than most first person stealth games.The ticking alarm keeps the right amount of pressure, making each level a nail biter.At the Start of each level: I'm a sneaksy spy, creeping past guards, turning off cameras, more ghost than man.At the End of each level: I need two more turns to complete the objective, but the exit is on the other side of the map. There's a guard closing in on my position, and those other two I knocked out a few turns ago just woke up, and are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I can send a teamate to intercept the guard closing in on me, but that door is locked, and the only key we have is held by my OTHER teammate, and she's on the other end of the map. I think I can juuust make it out al- OOH! There's another save a few steps away... I think I can loot it.The game combines Stealth, Strategy, push-your-luck type game play, and is very well executed.			"

												Brilliant game so far. Perfect for anyone who loves a good strategy game. I've read from a few other reviews that it's too short, so I'm trying to drag out my game to get more impact!Doing beginner, and it's tough. It takes a few deaths to get into the swing of how it all works, you do have to get through a bit of a steep learning curve to work out exactly what you can, and can't get away with. The whole AI thing took longer than it should to work out how it works, and it's pretty rubbish until you can level it up later on.As you level up, so does the enemies. It's always 1 level above you I've found, there is no 'easy missions' at all. It would be nice to be able to do lower levels with your leveled up characters as you go through. It only gives you the ability to do high levels the more you go on. I get that it's not meant to be a cakewalk, but you do want to dominate a mission with your characters from time to time!			"

												Invisible, Inc. is the best Tactical Espionage Action game I've played in years. In some ways it even beats Metal Gear Solid V in that field, though the two games obviously go for very different approached to the stealth genre.I've played quite a few games that randomizes their levels each play and most of them suffer from the occasional nigh impossible levels as a result. Klei has done something right with their system, however, since I remember only two or three instances where I've had to retreat from a level because I felt my agents had no chance of making it to their objective and back. Even in these cases I possibly could have pulled the mission through with more prudent upgrades to the agents and their equipment, and even though I was ill-prepared the level still gave me ample opportunity to exit it without too much of a hassle (plus you can adjust difficulty so the guard patrol paths are more infiltration friendly if you need it).And tactical retreat is truly a viable option here: You may have a harder time down the road from missing the resources you were trying to get but that doesn't mean you're out of the game just yet. 98% of the time there's blindspots to exploit in the patrol paths and even when there's not, you can usually lure guards into an ambush or just our of your way. Just take your time to observe their movement and time yours accordingly.The large roster of agents are all different in terms of their abilities, equipment and possible augmentations, lending great variety to gameplay on top of the randomly generated levels. In addition, you never know for sure what equipment, augmentations or Incognita programs you'll encounter each playthrough, or what kind of a layout of the different corporate facilities you are going to get - you'll have to adapt on the fly and choose between several alluring options, meaning no two campaigns are going to feel quite alike.On top of all that, the game has modding tools available even if they are somewhat under utilized at the moment: Most mods are language packs or graphical tweaks. One user, however, has created several new agents for the game, each with their strengths and weaknesses. I've only tried one of them out yet but it was solid work and balanced as far as I can tell, and the reviews on the other ones suggest they are of similar quality.If you're at all fond of turn based squad control games, or at all into stealth, I highly recommend you get this game.

												Very nice game.Invisible, Inc. is similar to xcom but without combat RNG or damage scaling. The graphics is quite easy to the eyes and instructive, the music and voice acting are fairly well done, and the character design has decent depth. The storyline campaign is very short, with an average of about 6 to 10 missions. Even with the DLC (which is well worth it) missions it will only take at most a few hours to finish, which is a great shame as it would make a very dank cartoon show should there be some more effort. The real content lies in the custom campaign generation, for you can remove the 3 (ingame) day time limit to receive more missions up to endless. This allows you to explore more strategies with your agents and items of choice, and with about 20 different agents there are abundant possibilities to experiment.What really made it better than xcom for me is its randomly generated maps, even for unique storyline missions. For those who are familiar with xcom EU/EW you should know that all missions use a limited pool of fixed maps, so after a playthrough or two, the only uncertainties are the locations of the aliens (even that you can guestimate) and the mood of RNGesus. Invisible, Inc. on the other hand has no combat RNG, all aggressions either result in a KO (knockout) or kill. However the variety of the maps made gameplay weighs a lot more towards stealth, scouting and planning, qualities I appreciate from a turnbased strategy game; and across the 4 or 5 endless campaigns I barely ever feel the fatigue I felt while replaying xcom.tl;dr Great game, value purchase, short storyline campaign, surprisingly high replayablility and depth in strategy. 9/10, -1 to the unrealized lore potential.

												Worth picking up if you can get it on sale... the basic mechanics are pretty fun, has some elements of Syndicate and XCOM going on, art style is distinctive and refreshing.The campaign is short though... really, really short. After that there's not much to do except run it again with or without the difficulty cranked up, and the higher difficulty levels can get excessive fast. So... I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure how much replay value I'll get.			"

												Turn based stealth strategy with an impending doom timer in the upper right hand corner. The game is fantastic. It takes a simple, logical stealth mechanics, freedom to approach a level however you want, and throws it in your face in the most perfect way. This game pulls no punches. It is not easy. You will fail many times. The game really focuses on learning from your mistakes. Also, since all levels are procedurally generated, the replayability is incredible. In this game, the default difficulty setting is the 'Expert' setting. The beginner setting and the next one up are actually tuned to be much easier that the default, but when playing those, you'll still get ♥♥♥♥♥ slapped when you screw up. If you're looking for a challenging stealth game that uses a turn-based approach to emphasize forethought and strategy, play this game. If not, go play something less interesting.			"

												My first game took me 7 hours on beginners difficulty. I begun another one immediately after.Invisible Inc is a great tactical RPG featuring an okay story but a very high replay value thanks to a very well rounded gameplay and several agents to unlock and to choose from, each one having unique capacities. Difficulty is entirely customisable by the player, and each game grants xp which unlocks new hacking programs for your AI and new starting agents. If you are looking for a challenge, this game won't disappoint you. If you aren't, you can run on lower difficulty settings!I highly recommend this game for its incredible gameplay and ambience, as I once heard: ""it makes you feel as a spy.""			"

												The idea is great, the style is great, the promises are great. That is what making this game delusional in it's core.1. It's settings. They make it quite tempting to buff your initial team. 2. Campaign timer. I thought 120 hours will be more than enough, but it only means around 10 missions before the end of the game! Are you serious???? This game whants to show how scarce the resources are and it is great, but in the end even with the buffed initial options I feel I am being a toy. Timing between missions are awkward and most of the time you just fly from one part of the world to another, because you first need vaul key, than money, than augmentation, etc...3. Alarm timing during missions. Me personally turned it off. There are plenty of other events in the campaign that can trigger the alarm level4. KO and stealth. I guess, I should have set up it to +99 turns. Seriously, I can't imagine an operative in the future, who can incapacitate someone just for 3 turns. They never learned how to tie someone for good? Later there will be drugs that extend the incapacitation,but still the game runs on slow pace with constant body storing. No agent even though about disarming the guards.....And thus the most serious problem - the level system. 10 rooms, that can be merged in larger ones.... it makes all the stealth useless. Passing through the back of the guard? Noway, as you have a narrow room up ahead, so either backstab/shoot him or ambush him. And sorry, dude, you will need to wait for three turns for your shocker to be recharged, martial arts are forbidden by the ethics. The whole realisation of the game is awful. With so much potential, they could have just created several prebuilt scenarious like in old Silent Storm game. Room creator is awful and I guess it is the reason for failing some quests due to some triggers not working properly.			"

												Really hard, great concept, fun but deeply frustratingThis is a fun game with a good concept - turn based strategy meets stealth.  The graphics look good, the scenarios are randomly generated, complex, and require significant thought.  The story is good enough for what it is, however, I will say despite what you are supposed to be doing, it feels like you're just doing random missions, getting more buff and waiting for the game to just move on - like the missions are meaningless obstacles.  They don't really play into the actual story.What I really want to talk about is how frustrating this game can be.  Things that make this game so frustrating include not being able to see enemy vision cones - it's not very helpful when you can see what an enemy's path is, but not whether they can actually see you - you want to plan ahead but you can't.  Hacking 'power' points - saving them up is complicated, you can easily find yourself in a situation where you just don't have enough to complete a mission, and there is no way to get them.  So you automatically lose.  If you want to open all the safes and disable all the cameras, at least make it semi-feasible to do so.  As it stands at least in my game, I need to save every point, or I will easily find myself in an unwinnable scenario.  This problem sort of bleeds into the next, which is how much it costs in power to hack terminals that let you buy upgrades/weapons/etc.  You don't know what's for sale, but the out of mission shop barely carries anything, so you are encouraged to hack them and buy - but they may have nothing of value, or you may just not have enough money - wasting a ton of power points that you likely can't get back.  Lastly, getting spotted - it is very easy to die in this game.  Which is fine, we're all doing this Dark Souls-hard game thing now.  However, it is such a slog to get back to where you were, it's really depressing to lose. So, in summary - this is a good turn based RPG and gets credit for incorporating stealth in a very meaningful way, but it has balance issues when it comes to supplying you with power points, and there are some tweaks it could make to its userface that would decrease moments of death/failure that feel ""cheap"".  Also, if you want to play this game, you have to enjoy the experience of smashing your face against the wall because of frustration, because you will be doing that often.			"

												Exciting gameplay -- stealth and timed actions along with escalating difficulty surpasses XCOM's classic formula (I played XCOM 1 and 2, and honestly I loved the time I spent playing this game).Only thing is, its a 7-hour game (specifically referring to the story, on BEGINNER, yah). Kinda sucks, cuz I was getting really excited on what could come next and how much farther I can go. But after less than a dozen missions, your story ends. I guess when I play it on harder difficulties, my playthroughs will involve more missions.The gameplay is definitely exciting, with many variables thrown at you at first. But the length of the game is my only gripe.RPG elements are there too, albeit not as deep as a $60 game. Still fun though.Replayability is high, if you dont mind playing from the start to end again. Every new game is deeply customizable as you can have a timed playthrough or an endless run of missions.Ill be playing this game some more.Highly recommended for those who love turn-based RPG.			"

												I recommend this game to everyone who likes tactical turn base games. In this game you lead a team of agents on their revenge on corporations, you have to chose your tagets from few available missions and then complete objectives and run away with loot.There is also endless mode in which difficulty goes up and game will never end, unless you fail and all your agents die.While on mission you have to balance between stunning/killing guards or simply avoiding them. It is a nice tactical choice, killing is easy, but raises alarm level and reduces money gains from missions while stunning will require you to carry guard bodies and watch them not to wake up too early.On top of that you have to use AI at your disposal to hack objects like cameras, drones, safes and manage resource for hacking which is Power.There is first DLC for this game but I haven't tested it yet.I haven't seen any bugs, there are a lot of options to tweak difficulty level and plenty of game modes.

												Invisible Inc. was my debut on the stealth TBS game, though I'm an old fan of both plain TBS (since Final Fantasy Tactics) and stealth (since Commandos).This one is an awesome game. It has a cool and stylish visual, a good soundtrack and well worked voice acting.It packs quite a punch on the chalenge matter until you get a firm grasp on the mechanics, at which points it will be just hard, but not too much. Gameplay feels intuitive.It has a good replay value, depending on your affection for challenge, achievents and experimenting with different setups.One bad aspects of the game is the ocasional cluttered interface, that places some important buttons over a movable title, possible leading to misclicks. It can be overcame by simply rotating the camera, but it's there anyway.The other downside is that the campaing will get old really quickly, expecially if start playing on any difficulty but Expert. You will probably have all the character's lines memorized by then,,,Wrapping it up: great game, with original gameplay, nice artwork, decent difficulty and good replay value.Get it!			"

												The game can be just as rewarding as it is frustrating because of the RNG. But by god, when you win a mission using nothing but your wit against everything the game throws at you, theres nothing like it.It's got me to play for 50+ hours, so its got to have done something right.(Yeah, real funny Klei, place the door control terminal and the Incognita upload as far away from eachother as you can, and put the guard spawner in the middle. Hilarious. I didn't want to win anyways.)			"

												This game has quality sound and art assets, but the design of the mechanics and items are weird to shoehorn you into stealth gameplay over lethal. So you end up with guns with 1 or 2 bullet magazines or guns that can only be fired once per mission. The autogenerated nature of missions also tend to create ridiculously difficult levels in terms of goal placement and enemy patrols. Combined with the time limit, a lot of these missions are nigh unbeatable unless you are lucky enough to head in the right direction to find objectives quickly, or abuse the ""rewind"" (save scumming) mechanic. These annoyances aside, there is a lot of replayability if you like the gameplay loop it offers.			"

												This game is an absolute triumph of design and I would go as far as to say the best designed game I've ever played.  It's always tense and generates some great stories of some impossible situation you squirmed out of.  Not once in my time with the game did I feel cheated or think the game was unfair, unlike other turn based strategy games.  Looking at you, Xcom.  Most importantly of all, it's great fun.If you're the kind of gamer who never replays things, you might feel the campaign is too short.  The Contingency Plan DLC addresses this by extending the campaign as well adding a lot of new items, programs, guard abilities etc.  I don't know who in their right mind would only play through this once, but you've been warned.  Invisible Inc and its DLC are easily worth the money.			"

												Invisible, Inc. is the best Tactical Espionage Action game I've played in years. In some ways it even beats Metal Gear Solid V in that field, though the two games obviously go for very different approached to the stealth genre.I've played quite a few games that randomizes their levels each play and most of them suffer from the occasional nigh impossible levels as a result. Klei has done something right with their system, however, since I remember only two or three instances where I've had to retreat from a level because I felt my agents had no chance of making it to their objective and back. Even in these cases I possibly could have pulled the mission through with more prudent upgrades to the agents and their equipment, and even though I was ill-prepared the level still gave me ample opportunity to exit it without too much of a hassle (plus you can adjust difficulty so the guard patrol paths are more infiltration friendly if you need it).And tactical retreat is truly a viable option here: You may have a harder time down the road from missing the resources you were trying to get but that doesn't mean you're out of the game just yet. 98% of the time there's blindspots to exploit in the patrol paths and even when there's not, you can usually lure guards into an ambush or just our of your way. Just take your time to observe their movement and time yours accordingly.The large roster of agents are all different in terms of their abilities, equipment and possible augmentations, lending great variety to gameplay on top of the randomly generated levels. In addition, you never know for sure what equipment, augmentations or Incognita programs you'll encounter each playthrough, or what kind of a layout of the different corporate facilities you are going to get - you'll have to adapt on the fly and choose between several alluring options, meaning no two campaigns are going to feel quite alike.On top of all that, the game has modding tools available even if they are somewhat under utilized at the moment: Most mods are language packs or graphical tweaks. One user, however, has created several new agents for the game, each with their strengths and weaknesses. I've only tried one of them out yet but it was solid work and balanced as far as I can tell, and the reviews on the other ones suggest they are of similar quality.If you're at all fond of turn based squad control games, or at all into stealth, I highly recommend you get this game.

												Worth picking up if you can get it on sale... the basic mechanics are pretty fun, has some elements of Syndicate and XCOM going on, art style is distinctive and refreshing.The campaign is short though... really, really short. After that there's not much to do except run it again with or without the difficulty cranked up, and the higher difficulty levels can get excessive fast. So... I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure how much replay value I'll get.			"

												I didn't know I enjoyed turn-based strategy until I played this game. I love the theme, the design, the atmosphere, everything. I especially love how customisable the play is, allowing you to play it in your own way. If it wasn't for the ""beginner mode"" I'm not sure I would have given a game like this a go, and I'm so glad I did because I'm addicted! The character progression, new skills/augments, items, and strategy options make it so fun, and it really feels like your agents are going from unequipped, to more awesome, stealthy badasses, thanks to the resources they've acquired. I recommend this to people even if they don't usually like turn-based strategy :D			"

												Brilliant game so far. Perfect for anyone who loves a good strategy game. I've read from a few other reviews that it's too short, so I'm trying to drag out my game to get more impact!Doing beginner, and it's tough. It takes a few deaths to get into the swing of how it all works, you do have to get through a bit of a steep learning curve to work out exactly what you can, and can't get away with. The whole AI thing took longer than it should to work out how it works, and it's pretty rubbish until you can level it up later on.As you level up, so does the enemies. It's always 1 level above you I've found, there is no 'easy missions' at all. It would be nice to be able to do lower levels with your leveled up characters as you go through. It only gives you the ability to do high levels the more you go on. I get that it's not meant to be a cakewalk, but you do want to dominate a mission with your characters from time to time!			"

												Brilliant, just like every Klei game - this manages to create a level of tension that I would never have thought possible on a turn based game, especially one where the objective is to NOT kill anyone!Invisible Inc. creates situations that in other games would mean certain death to your squad and a restart, but here somehow it is possible to produce the most spectacular escapes as you scramble and struggle to decide if it is more important to augment your agents, buy more gadgets or hire more spies.Highly recommended.

												I'm really enjoying this one and wholeheartedly recommend Invisible, Inc.  Since it has great replayability, I don't know that I'll ever be done with the game.  I want to spend more time on challenges that other modes offer.The player picks two agents among team members that have different abilities. As you play the game, two more agents become rescued and are added to your infiltration missions during the current playthrough. (You will also unlock agents to use at the start of your next game when you finish your current playthrough.) The game is turn-based, with your actions being spent from the agent's AP pool. You infiltrate a procedurally generated corporation level and accomplish main and side objectives and try to escape any way you can. There is also an AI computer on your side that sees the map as you reveal it, and it can hack the enemy consoles and units, helping your agents accomplish their mission. You will upgrade your agents by spending money on their skills or by giving them items to use. The AI can be upgraded by buying programs to use against consoles and enemies.The best thing about Invisible, Inc. is the ease at which it builds tension in a given mission and makes you consider every decision carefully. When you knock out a patrol, they will eventually wake up unless you dedicate an agent to pin him, which means you can no longer use that agent for hacking or taking out others. There is an alarm tracker counter that advances each turn, and can step up when certain things happen in the game. The alarm tracker is an abstraction that signifies that the corporation you're infiltrating senses something amiss when you teleport in. Even when you are perfectly stealthy, the alarm tracker counter will go up regardless and cause some pressure and a little chaos to your game. It's best to accomplish your objectives before the counter gets too high, or you may not make it out alive. The game is at its most exciting when the alarm level is 6 and there are several guards waking up and pursuing you after you retrieved some crucial data from their servers, and you just acquired some new items to deal with them more effectively. You quickly learn that every step in the game counts, and you should always close the doors behind you when you move through the level. The game is always a nail-biter, and I love it.I love the aesthetic of the game -- the stylish graphics and the cyberpunk music. The story is surprisingly good, and it makes me want to play more and unlock more story bits as I go. I'm not a big roguelike guy, but this game is outstanding.			"

Gameplay mechanics and atmosphere are well-thought; pulling off a perfectly stealthy mission feels genuinely rewarding, but small mistakes add even more to the tension, rather than snowballing to a total failure. Widely different starting options and procedurally generated content increase replay value and challenge without relying on randomness. I can hardly think of ways to improve this game.			"

												Great turn-based tactical stealth game, even if you just want to play 10-20 minutes here and there. What I didn't like is that on every mission the first 5-10 turns must be used to explore the map, and that is a very luck dependent thing. Maps are random, so you will get very hard and very easy ones too. When exploring the map, you don't know where the target is, where the exit is, so in many cases you just flip a coin, and either you are lucky or not. When you start the game, there are several options which you can change to your taste, but unfortunately there is no way to control the exploration (personally I would like to turn it off completely, and just make the whole map visible). Once you know most of the map, the real fun begins. You can then predict everything, even the enemy guards movements, so the random factor will be pretty low after that. You can be deep tactical, and I'm sure you will have missions where you would like to give up, but just at the latest second you can save it with a smart move. Pretty satisfying.			"

												If you're willing to put the time in, this is one of the most rewarding games I've played on Steam. But be warned - it is brutally (brutally!!) hard and totally unforgiving.  Starting from a fairly simple design, the game's complexities soon reveal themselves. The way the tension is racked up as the security level rises and more and more guards are spawned makes the whole experience a bit of a heart-pounder - good luck when the level gets to 6! I never really saw the point of roguelike games before, but this game has made me a believer. Every level is procedurally generated, making each game completely unique. If you can keep patient and not pull your hair out in frustration, there are hours upon hours of thrilling gameplay here, for a fraction of the price of the big releases.			"

												I enjoyed this game - but - it is impossible. Even on the easiest difficulty, missions frequently end in failure for a variety of reasons. It has a very steep difficulty curve, and player skill / Agent ability does not scale with difficulty or the opposition you face by Corps agents. You will find yourself repeating missions over and over again, and likely starting new games often. It has a cool XCOM feel, and the setting is interesting and fun, but you'll find yourself getting very frustrated, very quickly. I've lost the entire game repeatedly on the first mission, having been swamped by enemies out of nowhere. The game can be fun, but you'll be driven mad by frustration having lost over and over and over and over again.			"

												Invisible, Inc. is so addicting by the time i played it for the first time. The mechanic of this game is quiet loveable for everyone that love an isometric games and stealth games. There's a hacking mechanic that requires powers, the player need to manage that powers on what's important or whats not, so that they didn't run out of power during critical circumstances like being ambushed by guards or daemons (enemy hacking programs).- Every character had his/her skills including augments, that can be upgraded  with money or by playing a mission. You can unlock other character til 4 members by saving them from a mission.- Each mission is generated, so there's no same room that you will encounter twice. There are atleast 8 types of mission (if you own Congtigency Plan, that worth the buy).- Unique mechanic like cover behind every object or walls, peeking door holes/black masked corner, hacking, looting, Alarm level that kept rising until 5 (beginning) or above.- The tools of trade is fun to play/experiment with.- The game can be difficult for new comers, even after playing the tutorials. I suggest playing or tingkering with the difficult settings until you learn the basic ropes.Other than that, it's a recommended game for me.			"

												I'm writing this review coming off of the victory high from beating Experienced Mode, and as part of my task to write a review for those upcoming Steam Awards. My nomination for Invisible Inc: The ""Just Five More Minutes"" Award.I had no expectations when I first opened up this game. I only knew that it was part of the Klei Essentials collection and that it was up for cheap cheap. So I'm willing to call my first experience perfectly unhyped.And man am I happy with what I got. Invisible is an incredibly well-designed game, both graphically and technically. Each agent holds their own on the field, each Corporation has their own distinct theme which resonates well throughout their facilities, everything just seems to make sense within the context of the game. The gameplay itself is like a high-stakes chess game at its peaks, except all you've got is bishops which can't really take any enemy pieces, only slow them down (or, if you want to go lethal, END their corporate slave lives for good [YOU MONSTER]). The game teaches you with every loss and every restart: about itself, about the patterns of the enemies, about the various semi-random daemons which affect gameplay in new and interesting ways the more you hack the enemy systems.It's a glorious red-and-yellow dancefloor of danger spots that you're constantly learning to manuever without getting your shoes stomped. And I LOVE IT.Will the RNG bite you in the butt? Yes. Constantly. But never will it put you in an insurmountable situation. You will always have the opportunity to prepare for armored enemies. You will always have the ability to scout ahead before that guard walks into the spawn room on his regular patrol. You do not get to yell at the game for putting a guard in that room that you told your agent to walk into without scouting first. That's on YOU.Will it eventually get boring, having learned every enemy pattern, every room shape, every action and reaction possible by guards, drones, etc? Maybe. One day I might find myself without my classic evil mastermind cackling as I lure guards off of their patrol with the body of one of their comrades, directly into a waiting ambush by my agent behind the potted plant. I dread the day that I might grow bored of this game. But I don't see it happening anytime soon. I've logged 36 hours thus far, most of that accidental overnights as I urge my teams into the next mission, next mission, until the sun comes up and I go to eat a sad and sleepless breakfast, and I STILL find this game as fun as when I first booted it up.The plot? I'm willing to call it good. The voice acting is top-notch, animation sequences are well-done, the ending... is actually fitting when you think about it. But you're not there for the plot. You're there for the game. And the game is brutally fun.I recommend. Full force.			"

												KLEI hits everything out of the park, and this is no exception. Imagine X-COM; now trim the fat, add more stealth, more replayability, and more interesting characters and you've got Invisible, Inc. And the kicker is that you can get it for a fraction of the price of the triple-A title. If you have ever enjoyed moving characters around a grid in a turn-based fashion, this one is for you.			"

												I really want to give this a thumbs up and down, but since that isnt an option, I'm giving it a up, as trying lots of the options can be rewarding/challenging and can eat a fair amount of time making the $ to playtime equation pretty good.But a warning: this game can be brutal!First whats good: Unique setting/graphics/abilities.  Fun tactics and sneaking around. every level is randomly generated, meaning it never plays the same.Whats so/so: The story is weak, and very short, and annoying by the time you have played through a few times. Some of the ""agents"" dont even get to start with one extra ability point(balancing?)Whats bad: Due to the complete randomness of everything, levels, stores, guards etc: you may not have the tools you need to survive later levels.  For instance I didn't get a single item or ability that would allow me to affect guards with armor, and on the last level every guard had armor.  Personnal Opinion - good/meh/bad - You decide: Due to the randomness of everything you cant rely on one play style/tool setup to get through. This can give you a unique challenge on each play through.  But hurt you if you perfer one play style.  The game seriously penalizes you for taking your time, so its a constant struggle of pushing too far vs keeping your agents safe.  Some levels (randomly) spider out in several directions, meaning if you take the wrong path you waste a ton of time exploring a dead end, and then have no time left/there have been too many guards spawned that you can't make it down the correct path, decide: cut your losses and run, or chance ending our play through/loosing agents to get to the goal.  On the other hand I have had level randomly have all the goals on the room right off the start. Risk Reward decisions are huge since both Power and Cash are almost always in short supply for you.In all I have played for 30 hours, beaten the first 2 difficulties, and been stuck without the tools the final level needed on expert a few times.  I havent scratched all the different agents yet, as I have been trying a few related play styles, perhaps its time to try something else ;)			"

												Excellent turn-based strategy game. Love the art style and theme. It seemed difficult at first but after a few tries I figured things out. There are a few things that would've made this better. The game's default 72 hour time limit was pretty short. I think I hit that time after maybe 7-8 missions in 5-6 hours. Don't know why it was defaulted this short because it should've been double that IMO. There is an endless game mode but I don't have access to all my operatives. I wanted to be able to max level and select any operative. If there's future DLC maybe they can fix these things. This is still an excellent game though.  "

												What. Straight off. Wow!A bit about me, I'm not a fan of detective stuff or stealth games but I do love Turn Based Strats.THe fluff of this game I honestly though would bore me and I would play for 15 minutes and uninstall but I'm extremely happy to say its the polar opposite. Its a compelling game with a nice upgrade system, a story that is quite involving, beautifully animated and its extremely intuitve from the tutorial mission which poses as a real mission. I can really get behind this game. Its very nicely polished and I want to explore every room. Im only 4 levels into it and I can already imagine how the games depth of puzzles will come into it. Top marks from me. If I had some down points it would probably come down to nit picking about how some of the upgrades dont quite make  sense or how the upgrade system can look a little dumbed down, but seriously, this game is polished!

												There is a similarity with Firaxis' XCOM: Enemy Unknown. It's nicely polished turn based tactical strategy game but with shorter playthrough in compare to the second mentioned game. Understand, the shorter does not mean worse. You get to the end (win or lose) just faster. Each mission takes around 30-45 minutes and the whole game composes from approx. 10-12 missions (overall 5-7 hours).The general ""research"" element is replaced by gathering credits (in-game money) for which you can equip new items (some require a particular level of agent's stats), implant new augmentations to your agents' bodies, increase their statistics, or install new programs for hacking. Credits are gathered by stealing from safes, guards or by selling unwanted items. And like in XCOM, you are facing tough decisions and desperate situations many times. Your mission time is virtually limited by the system of increasing alert level. In each level, it all gets tougher and harder. Thus you need to balance between quick less cautious play and slow progress when you risk high alert level in the later mission time.If you like turn-base tactical strategy you should try this one too.

												This game is not invisible, it is in fact pretty visible. That's the only drawback, but it was a concession to playability so that gamers who rely on sight could play it. Otherwise it is a game about a grumpy British lady and her attempts to yell at people for not being sneaky enough.			"

It can be frustrating at time if you don't get the equipment you want, but in actuality, it teaches you to approach games by thinking outside of the box.  The best help is to have as many people as possible by the last mission.  Sitting on guards is very effective.  Soon I will try a harder difficulty level.  I'm scared!			"

												Invisible Inc. is a difficult Turn-Based Strategy Stealth game set in a world of mega corperations. You play in short campaigns of a handful of levels made with randomly procedurely generated rooms. The goal is gaining enough money through the use of stealing artifacts, dosh or valuable data from a VIP's brain to upgrade your team of agents after the initial collapse of Invisible.I like to think of this game as a blend of FTL: Faster Than Light, XCOM and Mark of the Ninja (a previous game developed and plublished by Klei Entertainment). Each playthrough can be completed in 1-2 sittings and the difficulty of the game makes each run a stressful but fulfilling exercise for stategy minded players.Every turn each of the agents in play are given action points (derived from the stats of the agent; upgradable with money) to perform moves, actions with items equipped and interactions with the environment across an isometric playing field. These environmental objects must first be hacked primarily with the Incognita system, a re-purposed A.I that can break down firewalls with the spending of power which can be replenished via consoles (as you progress, items and agent abilities can also accomplish this).There are layers of stategy with the cast of agents, the spread of item variety and the different programs to equip Incognita that make this short game replayable in alternate playstyles (hidden, sneaky with tazers, tazers and sleep syringes, full-on assault with firearms etc.) This stylish gem of a game deserves to be played by more people and the developers should be proud of how polished this Early Access game turned out.

												Better than XCOM! Invisible Inc is my favorite game in my 100+ title Steam library!This game took me over 100 hours to beat expert-plus mode but it was worth it! The game takes 4-5 hours for a play through and the levels are procedurely generated. There are a wealth of unique agents, programs, and rewards so every play through really is different.There is a steep learning curve- you will die a lot. This is the point and this is how you learn, don't despair! It's important to balance patience with aggressive exploration. It's ok to usually play it safe, especially in higher difficulties! Here are some hints (or rather basic mechanics that you shouldn't overlook):1. Always peak or open a door before running into a new room.2. If you peak into a room with the door already open, the whole room is visible (good for corner cameras).3. Only hack what you need to for your current situation, conserve power when possible.4. Don't kill or KO gaurds if you can help it. Let them walk in the same predictable patterns as long as possible.5. Run when enemies won't be able to hear you (within 5 paces?).6. Upgrade agents to Anarchy level 1 then steal credits and passcards without KO'ing guards.7. If you screwed up and are going to use a rewind on this or the next turn, have other agents sprint to scout the map.8. Use Alt to see a guard's vision lines. You can run in the diagonal red shaded squares to distract them.Hope this helps. Make Invisible Inc 2, Klei!!!!			"

The challenges and quests are fun and makes you think, the storyline is decent, the mechanics is awesome, and there's replayability which, in my book, is a super plus for games.

Campgains can also be customed with special rules and difficulty, such as making  an endless mode. There are some general complaints with UI, gameplay loops or similar issues, but none enough to ruin the game. Definitly not for everyone, but can easily become a favorite for some.			"

												I love turn based strategy games and I also love stealth games. But only in my wildest dreamsI ever thought it could be possible to put together both of these styles of games in a single one. Invisible, Inc. turns that dream into reality and does it masterfully. The game mechanics are flawless; the playable characters feature distinct skills, enough to ensure different gameplay experiences depending on how you build and upgrade your team; And, as if it were not enough, also offers us an entertaining story to follow.The gradual increase system of difficulty levels, depending on how long it take to finish a stage, prevents the player to make reckless decisions. Every action here, no matter how small, carries an urgency weight that makes it much more exciting and fun the whole experience (and sometimes frustrating, I can't deny).The game's campaign is short, which is quite good as it prevents the experience to become repetitive for players less junkies in stealth or turn-based strategy. However, for the diehard fans of the both genres, Invisible is extremely replayable for two main reasons: every play the maps are randomly generated and the different characters to release every match ensures that the game remains fresh for a long time.--------------------------------------------------------Eu adoro jogos de estratégia em turnos e jogos de açõa furtiva. Mas nem nos meus sonhos mais malucos imaginei que veria esses dois estilos de jogo reunidos num só. Invisível, Inc. transformou esse sonho em realidade e o fez com maestria. A mecânica é impecável; os personagens possuem habilidades distintas o suficiente para garantir diferentes experiências de jogo dependendo de como se construi e atualiza a equipe; e, como se não bastasse, ele também oferece uma divertida história para acompanhar.O sistema de aumento gradual dos níveis de dificuldade, dependendo de quanto tempo se leve para concluir um estágio, impede que o jogador tome decisões imprudentes. Toda ação aqui, não importa quão pequena, carrega um peso de urgência que o torna tudo muito mais emocionante (e às vezes frustrante, não posso negar).A campanha do jogo é curta, o que é muito bom, uma vez que impede que se torne repetitivo para os jogadores menos viciados em estratégia baseada em turnos ou  ação furtiva. No entanto, para os fãs incondicionais de ambos os gêneros, Invisible é extremamente rejogável por duas razões principais: a cada jogada os mapas são gerados aleatoriamente e os diferentes personagens para serem liberados a cada jogo garantem que ele permaneça divertido por um longo tempo.

												In a nutshell: This game is kinda like Chess... but with cool gadgets.Lots of options to customise the gameplay to suit you, loads to unlock, pleasing visuals, potentially VERY challenging gameplay thanks to Endless mode... it's a great little package - smart, and well presented.I hope Invisible Inc. returns for a second outing.Review:I came across this game as a result of looking for a decent hacker/spy title. I got a tip from somebody in a comments section on a blog so I put it in my wishlist and finally made the investment during a sale.As I play on what I guess would now be considered an outdated laptop, I was concerned that it wouldn't run that well and there'd be lots of lag and slow-down, but it plays fine actually. And I'm happy that it does, because it's a quality game, especially so considering its sale price.- As mentioned earlier, this game is kinda like Chess in that it's a turn based game - you make your move, then the opponent makes theirs, and so on... what makes it interesting, apart from all the cool gadgets and the Random Number God (more on that later) is the ever-increasing incremental alarm system, meaning that not only do you feel somewhat under pressure, but also that each turn is precious, so thinking things through before you execute is advisable if you want to avoid coming into contact with some of the better equipped enemy personnel who lurk at the higher levels. Thankfully, there are no limits to how much time you spend during each turn (unless you select this option) so you get to consider things before ending your turn.- There are lots of things to unlock (including Augments, Programs, Weapons and Items, as well as new Characters), and a few different strategies based on what equipment loadout is selected, but it's essentially a stealth game, meaning there are few rewards (but plenty of penalties, mind) for a playstyle which is geared towards being overtly offensive.- The top-down, isometric view can at times present some frustrations, but only occasionally (when trying to view a narrow passageway, for example), and is quite pleasing overall.- On the subject of views - the cell shaded art style is easy on the eye, and whilst the in-game graphics are polished, functional and without flaw (from my experience, at least), some might consider them to be lacking when compared to the realism presented in other titles nowadays, not that this is a criticism of mine as I'm grateful that my old laptop can handle the visuals comfortably enough to allow for a smooth gaming experience. Let's call the graphics 'accessible' then.- Game length is very short if you're talking about completing just one single campaign, but the replay factor is ever-present thanks to rolling XP (used to unlock those unlockables mentioned earlier) and also what seems like a Random Number Generator (RNG) type of level generator - no two levels are the same, even if you have the restart option checked. This is clever and means there is no 'practice makes perfect' approach to the gameplay in any given level, as you always need to investigate and explore in order to locate the mission objective and exfiltration point which can lead to wrong decisions being made, and this is what makes it fun..... and also why you might want to have the NOOOOOOO! button to hand, as I wish I did when I realised I left my newly purchased (and expensive) Portable Server at the other side of the level, not realising I'd need to pick it up again before I snuck away into the night - ugh... There are, however, options to customise the gameplay, meaning you can choose the number of Rewinds etc to make the game harder or easier, depending on how you feel that day - this I like.- The voice acting is well done, but due to the short span of any given campaign, there isn't much of it. Quality over quantity.I actually wish the campaigns were longer, at least in terms of the story (which hints at the cliche outcome now and again), but having said that, there is a DLC option which promises to extend the campaign mode and offers more unlocks and challenges. So I look forward to playing this as well.Recommended :)			"

												This game is incredible. An interesting turn-based stealth game with a fair amount of content, a good soundtrack, and distinct artstyle are present but what really sets Invisible Inc. apart is the difficulty. When you start the game for the first time, the game advises you to start with beginner difficulty, and rightly so. I struggled to beat the campaign on the easiest difficulty on my first run, which never happens. However, what Invisible Inc. does best is pushing you to think several steps ahead everytime you play. Even when you've got four, well-upgraded agents towards the later stages of the game, if you mess up one move you get **** on. Combine that with randomly generated levels and you've got possibly the best stealth game ever made. Fantastic job Devs, will be looking for more where this came from. 9/10P.S. Try not to use Internationale (good luck) >.<			"

												Invisible, Inc. is a great stealth/TBS game with rogue-like elements.  It looks great, runs great.  I have experienced no technical issues/bugs of any kind.  With this game, Klei does Shadowrun better than Harebrained Schemes (minus the trolls and magic).+Great visuals and audio.  Procedurally-generated levels.  Lots of playable characters and items (lots of choices/options).  The hiding/hacking/guard visual cone mechanics are all easy to understand and use.-I thought M0nst3r was a bit of a disappointment as a storefront (often has nothing for sale).  I would like Incognita to be upgradable.  No major complaints with this game.If you like TBS games and the idea of sneaking around guards undetected while stealing everything in sight then Invisibile, Inc. is worth a look.  This is not a frontal assault / guns blazing game.			"

												Very smart, well-designed strategy game. Even on easy I had several moments that made me stop and think long and hard about how to turn a situation to my favour. When you beat a difficult mission in this game it feels like an accomplishment that you overcame using every single tool that you were given. Really gratifying and fun.			"

												THIS is Early Access done right.I first stumbled upon Invisible Inc. some months ago. Maybe even a year. Saw a very fascinating lets play of it and decided to buy myself into the Early Access.I wasn't disappointed and watched the game get regular updates with nice new content. A few dozen hours in the story mode got repetitive though and I stopped playing.Then I suddenly hear 'Invisible Inc has been released'. And I reinstall it, boot it up and WOW!!The last version I played had solid gameplay, nice mechanics and an overall catchy art style. But now it even got story, voice acting, polished interfaces... and obviously more contetn and the same great gameplay.In short, the developers did an exemplary job on this gem of a turn-based stealth game. If you enjoy solving complex puzzles, fighting against overwhelming odds and leaving no trace of you ever having entered the building...Buy this. You won't regret it.Rating: 9.5/10 - I found a single bug by abusing the interface. Otherwise, this gem is flawless.			"

												Good game for fans of stealth, random level generation, turn based team combat. The default game settings (enemy difficulty, starting cash, stun/KO duration, etc.) can be a bit tricky for first time players but there are options to customise all of these and turn the game into something more manageable (or even harder if you want a challenge).The options also allow you to extend/reduce the fixed duration of the game or to turn it into an ""endless"" game ... it's not really endless, the enemies just get harder and harder and eventually you fail to complete too many missions or your team is all captured/killed. Ther random nature of the missions, equipment you can find/buy and the abilities you can find for your pet AI can make some of the games harder/trickier than other sessions but overall it is enjoyable. The game is not very long but it is one you will repaly again and again as you unlock new agents to play with.TLDR; nice game, no twitch responses needed, nice depth of strategy in all aspects of the game. Good value for money.			"

												Put in about 60 hours on Early Access, and 32 hours so far on the final release.The polish on the final release is extremely satisfying. This game keeps me up 'til 3AM on the regular. It's punishingly hard (on Expert with 1 rewind) but OH SO SATISFYING when you nail a particularly tricky escape.If you like XCOM, Jagged Alliance, Fallout 1/2/Tactics, etc...you'll probably enjoy this game. A LOT. It's tactical, turn-based, STEALTH-FOCUSE gameplay. I haven't had this much fun with a game in long while.			"

												This game is a fairly unique take on the Turn Based Strategy genre. I highly recommend it to anyone that likes games like XCOM or Fire Emblem. The twist on this game compared to others in the genre is that its stealth based- instead of fighting the enemies head on, you want to try your best to avoid them. Your directly offensive options are fairly limited and you generally want to use them only in emergencies, because ammo is scarce and the enemies vastly outnumber you. That isn't to say that your options overall are limited, however. There are ways of fighting back that don't involve shooting someone with a gun in an open firefight. Setting silent ambushes and traps. Hacking the enemies security system and creating a false alert somewhere else in the building to redirect them. Turning a turret on their side to yours, evening the firepower some in a pinch.Invisible Inc is all about doing things the 'non standard' way for games of this genre, while still encapsulating what makes them great- plenty of ways to force you to think ""How do I get out of this situation with what I have right now?"", which leads to those satisfying moments when you pull off a clutch escape out of a bad situation, or the despair as you lose your best unit and need to find a way to salvage the game.

												I have been a fan of this game since paying for it in Early Access. Klei did a fantastic job with their other titles (Mark of the Ninja is a personal favorite of mine) and this is another solid piece of work. The game feels very much like an advanced kind of chess while you're playing it. The fact that your agents will die if spotted and not moved immediately makes the movements feel like a complex series of steps to avoid being in ""check"", so to speak.The addition of voice-acting and some cutscenes has fleshed out the story and compliments the music nicely. The story is nothing to write home about, but moves the game along and gives you some motivation on why things are the way they are in the game.Be warned: this is a difficult game that has a steep learning curve. You will fail. Many times. But every failure gets you further along and gets you more agents, new toys, and new ways to play the game.Highly recommend.			"

Early Access Review
								Post release update: This game is even better than I hoped it would be. It is a wonderful mix of Shadowrun Returns, Mark of the Ninja with just a hint of XCOM. The tension between trying to get everything and the ever-increasing security level is perfect, and the difficulty level customisation options are brilliant. A+ gameOriginal Early Access review: Invisible, Inc is a fantastic turn-based stealth strategy game. The gameplay is spot on and really, really tense. Violence really is not a good option which I love (it just makes more trouble for you!) and the game is all the better for it. As could be expected given Mark of the Ninja they show real confidence in the stealth mechanics, but stealth here is about precise placement and tactical thought, rather than in darkness and movement. Both are brilliant. Finely tuned, beautiful to look at, with lovely music this could be a finished game already.Klei are doing Early Access right with this game. I bought the game when it was pre-Early Access and development has been a joy to watch as Klei are working hard to craft a gem of a game.			"

												Great story, nice artwork, almost perfect mechanics.Some of the missions had my heart pounding after clicking turn change, afraid of what the AI might do. The good kind of tension.  Getting away with all your agents and pockets full of loot, feels very rewarding.My biggest criticism is, that if you can't get weapons with armour piercing and/or augments that enhance your armor piercing, you basically stand no chance in the later missions. The AI is good and when it starts hunting you, an error from 2, 3 turns back can return and bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥ On the other hand, it can be tricked easily with certain programs, which make the AI look stupid. (I wouldn't want the AI to be a lot smarter, though :D )My first playthrough took me about 6 hours. The 2nd, on the next difficulty, more than 7. I guess it will increase like that with every tier.

												This game does so many things right. within a niche of a niche.  Stealth-rouge like-TBS-RPG.  You have a small team that you can improve or grower bigger, you can lose team members and if you do you can lose all their equipment.  You have to decide is it better to invest in everyone, or to only invest  in a few party members and use the rest as sacrifices.   Lots of difficultly levels to play on.  On normal mode the game is rouge-lite and offers a certain number of “rewinds,” to cope with situations in which your rush around a corner and happen upon a guard.  On the highest level you get zero rewinds, and if you wipe that run is over.  On the lowest level you get more rewinds and also can replay missions you wipe on.     "

												An excellent stealth centered, turn based roguelike game where each choice matters. The game does not joke about you having odds stacked against you in a direct firefight, instead you must use sneaky tactics to get around complex you infiltrated, get the objective and get out ASAP. Truly managed to captivate the hit and run tactic used by small agencies.However, speed as well as being undetected is the key. You will not remain undeteced forever as the security level increases over time, moreso if you are caught. Invisible Inc strikes a nice balance between having to be fast and stealthy, a quality that gives a healthy gameYour squad is also accompanied by a powerful AI, that playes a major role in your success by being able to manipulate facility devices to serve you instead but beware, they are protected and sometimes you need to think about your resource allocationI also highly recommend getting the DLC, contigeancy plan. It adds a bunch of items and characters to make the game more varied, opening up even more strategies and interesting synergies. It's only 4€ if bought in a bundle and well worth the small priceThe downside of this game however is  that if you are not familiar with stealth or strategy games, then Invisible inc can be quite difficult to pick up and learn as the tutorial is quite honestly lacking finer important details which you will discover as you play. Thus I recommend starting up from the easiest difficulty (it still provides a decent challenge) and move up until you hit the hardest difficulties, which is what the game balance is centered around and what defines the true invisible inc experienceAs a final word: Try to save knockouts and kills until the last moment where you absolutely need to do so and use the corpse drag option to prevent guards from waking up			"

												EDIT a year and 400 hours later:I cannot recommend this game enough, it is a must buy. It's one of those games where it's incredibly challenging and most of your losses are due to poor planning and unthought actions. Stealth is key as much as avoiding violence.If you avoid violence, this game is a lot easier for you. And that's all you can hope for considering how difficult the game gets later on when guards have armor and mainframes become even harder to hack through.It's been an emotional experience for me mastering this game, here's a link to my blog post about it that the developers appreciated a lot: https://yourwritetolive.com/2016/08/22/what-i-learned-from-being-a-spy/Otherwise, here's my original review below:40 hours in and I STILL haven't beaten Experienced Mode, but I love this game to death! I've had it for maybe a week or two by now, beaten Beginner, and my own customized version of Experienced Mode with level retries, and I can't get enough of it. The gameplay mechanics are top notch. It is a turn based, top view, stealth game where you need to be very careful how you spend your Action Points and Hacking PWR. As you progress through the campaign, you can earn a ton of skills and items that help you aide in your missions.It can range from having armor piercing weapons to take down the stronger guards, to also getting better hacking programs from Incognita so that you can better sneak around corporation headquarters. The mission types have a great variety: you can find Cybernetic Labs to enhance your team's abilities, recon powerful items, or simply loot heavily guarded vaults for credits that you can use to buy skill points or other items. Even better is the Financial Suite type of missions where you can find corporate executives and steal vault access cards from them for even greater rewards in said mission types.What I don't like about this game is how short the campaign is. You only get 72 game hours to get to the final mission, and basically when you send your team to a mission, each location has different amount of hours it takes to fly there, so you gotta be careful.You can always increase the amount of hours the campaign takes, but that changes the official difficulty to custom and, thus might be unable to unlock certain programs and other things. However, there's at least an endless mode where you can basically play forever and constantly beef up your characters to take on even beefier missions.I highly recommend this game as it is quite addicting! If you enjoyed Mark of the Ninja, Metal Gear Solid, or Tenchu, this, in my humble opinion, is the next level of the stealth genre. Just what's possible really makes this game unique. Tiniest drawback is that all maps reuse the same tiles and look the same at a distance, but at least the maps are randomized and so are always a fresh new experience in how to traverse them in each playthrough.This game is worth its full price, but if you can get it on sale, don't even think twice! Just get it!			"

Gameplay mechanics and atmosphere are well-thought; pulling off a perfectly stealthy mission feels genuinely rewarding, but small mistakes add even more to the tension, rather than snowballing to a total failure. Widely different starting options and procedurally generated content increase replay value and challenge without relying on randomness. I can hardly think of ways to improve this game.			"

												An absolute gem - clever, stylish, addictive.Going in I expected a bit of a power fantasy, as my solid snake type agents ran rings around a helpless bunch of guards. Instead it's one of the most tense games I've played. You can't leave a level the way you came in, so from the outset the clock is ticking, as even if you abandon your objective you still have to find the exit as the clock ticks down and your enemy becomes more capable. It's unforgiving, if an guard spots your agent you might have one chance to stop them getting permadeaded. In theory you can save them with medigel, but you won't because a) you won't have any medigel and b) you'll need another agent to get past the guard that just shot the first to apply it. Once you get off beginner difficulty this game is HARD.This works in its favour though. Every level completed feels like a true victory, especially if you manage to complete secondary objectives, outwit guards, or pull off narrow escapes. The game is also tough but very fair. The only randomness is in the proceedural level generation, so short of it generating a map where a guard or two immediately bursts into your starting room (which has happened to me about twice), if you make a mistake it's always your own fault. There are always multiple ways to accomplish goals, first of which is balancing speedagainst stealth, and until things go really, really bad there will be a way out if you're smart enough. The turn-based gameplay means most of the pressure is in your mind.It's gorgeous, with a clear aesthetic, and should run on just about any computer.It would be nice if upgrades and items were a bit more available and varied, to allow you to build a team based on specific approaches. The DLC seems to help with this a bit.Campaigns last 3-4 hours and there's plenty of replayability with a dozen-odd agents to pick from, the proceedurally generated levels and a variety of game modes.

												I'm writing this review coming off of the victory high from beating Experienced Mode, and as part of my task to write a review for those upcoming Steam Awards. My nomination for Invisible Inc: The ""Just Five More Minutes"" Award.I had no expectations when I first opened up this game. I only knew that it was part of the Klei Essentials collection and that it was up for cheap cheap. So I'm willing to call my first experience perfectly unhyped.And man am I happy with what I got. Invisible is an incredibly well-designed game, both graphically and technically. Each agent holds their own on the field, each Corporation has their own distinct theme which resonates well throughout their facilities, everything just seems to make sense within the context of the game. The gameplay itself is like a high-stakes chess game at its peaks, except all you've got is bishops which can't really take any enemy pieces, only slow them down (or, if you want to go lethal, END their corporate slave lives for good [YOU MONSTER]). The game teaches you with every loss and every restart: about itself, about the patterns of the enemies, about the various semi-random daemons which affect gameplay in new and interesting ways the more you hack the enemy systems.It's a glorious red-and-yellow dancefloor of danger spots that you're constantly learning to manuever without getting your shoes stomped. And I LOVE IT.Will the RNG bite you in the butt? Yes. Constantly. But never will it put you in an insurmountable situation. You will always have the opportunity to prepare for armored enemies. You will always have the ability to scout ahead before that guard walks into the spawn room on his regular patrol. You do not get to yell at the game for putting a guard in that room that you told your agent to walk into without scouting first. That's on YOU.Will it eventually get boring, having learned every enemy pattern, every room shape, every action and reaction possible by guards, drones, etc? Maybe. One day I might find myself without my classic evil mastermind cackling as I lure guards off of their patrol with the body of one of their comrades, directly into a waiting ambush by my agent behind the potted plant. I dread the day that I might grow bored of this game. But I don't see it happening anytime soon. I've logged 36 hours thus far, most of that accidental overnights as I urge my teams into the next mission, next mission, until the sun comes up and I go to eat a sad and sleepless breakfast, and I STILL find this game as fun as when I first booted it up.The plot? I'm willing to call it good. The voice acting is top-notch, animation sequences are well-done, the ending... is actually fitting when you think about it. But you're not there for the plot. You're there for the game. And the game is brutally fun.I recommend. Full force.			"

												I enjoyed this game - but - it is impossible. Even on the easiest difficulty, missions frequently end in failure for a variety of reasons. It has a very steep difficulty curve, and player skill / Agent ability does not scale with difficulty or the opposition you face by Corps agents. You will find yourself repeating missions over and over again, and likely starting new games often. It has a cool XCOM feel, and the setting is interesting and fun, but you'll find yourself getting very frustrated, very quickly. I've lost the entire game repeatedly on the first mission, having been swamped by enemies out of nowhere. The game can be fun, but you'll be driven mad by frustration having lost over and over and over and over again.			"

												THIS is Early Access done right.I first stumbled upon Invisible Inc. some months ago. Maybe even a year. Saw a very fascinating lets play of it and decided to buy myself into the Early Access.I wasn't disappointed and watched the game get regular updates with nice new content. A few dozen hours in the story mode got repetitive though and I stopped playing.Then I suddenly hear 'Invisible Inc has been released'. And I reinstall it, boot it up and WOW!!The last version I played had solid gameplay, nice mechanics and an overall catchy art style. But now it even got story, voice acting, polished interfaces... and obviously more contetn and the same great gameplay.In short, the developers did an exemplary job on this gem of a turn-based stealth game. If you enjoy solving complex puzzles, fighting against overwhelming odds and leaving no trace of you ever having entered the building...Buy this. You won't regret it.Rating: 9.5/10 - I found a single bug by abusing the interface. Otherwise, this gem is flawless.			"

												An insanely addictive game where it's easy to get started, but hard to win. Difficulty increases exponentially so that you keep coming back for new challenges. Is it worth the money? Depends on who you are, but I think this is a well thought out game that could keep anyone entertained.-WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH IS NOT ACTUALLY IN THE GAME--IT IS WHAT I BELEIVE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME--*CONTAINS SPOILERS*-My only complaint is that what I thought of as the intro to the game turned out to be the entire story. I would like to see an alternate universe career mode where the objectives following the installation of Incognito into the new mainframe (without her killling everyone) are not for the benefit of Invisible Inc., but for the detriment of the corporations. Money must still be acqured to obtain some gear, but other gear can be manufactured at your own HQ. At this point, because the corporations have realized Invisible Inc. did not fade away and is still going strong, security will be stronger and the levels larger, because it is more difficult to bypass the firewall. The main objective of this section of gameplay would be to evaluate ways to sabatoge the corporations and take them down one by one until they all fall. But because the corporations now know where you are, you will have to defend your base from time to time in reverse-spy missions. THAT is the game I want to see for this, not just the 3 day mission. Still, the 3 day mission is quite challenging in itself, just because of the length of the story, there isn't as much replay value for those who prefer story oriented games.Buy it on sale.			"

												The majority of the negative reviews say things from ""too short"" to ""depends on RNG""And both of these are true. But as a game about spies who have a limited amount of time to complete their objective this makes absolutely perfect sense. sometimes you realize a level is going to be awful after recon, and then leave. better to get some cash and items and have everyone alive than bash your head against the corporate structure. That being said, I haven't run across a mission that I haven't been able to beat. Andwith some creative hacking and thinking, most higher alert missions can pretty much be drawn out for ever. Sure the ""campaign"" can be repetitive, but on higher difficulties the satisfaction of waltzing around guards, hijacking robots and turrets, and the blood pumping adrealine from successfully navigating supposedly random patrol paths. For a turn based STEALTH(!!!) game, this one certainly gets the arenaline pumping as much as some big name action tiles.			"

												""Invisible, Inc"" is the best designed and most polished game I have played in a long time. The balance between all the different items, augments, and options in general is just perfect. Almost every single level unfolds into an epic mission, where every AP counts, and I somehow (it baffles myself!) manage to barely escape in the end. When I lose, which happens often, it is always because of a mistake or miscalculation on my own side. The game isnt unfair. It isnt frustrating. It is challenging in the best way possible, where it's up to YOU if you fail or succeed, and to do creative kiting or maneuvres to escape in one piece. I have bought so many games lately, from indies to AAA, and none of them have been as fun and addicting as Invisible, Inc.I can only recommend! :) "

												Invisible Inc attempts to mix the tension and tactical gameplay of XCOM and Shadowrun while removing all the random dice rolls of combat, making sure that players realise that ever action/ success or failure achieved was their decision and not the game. Coupled with the inability to save during gameplay and only rely on ""Rewinds"", makes Invisible Inc a very challenging game that will appeal to even the most discerning hardcore squad based tactical player. Expect to fail alot and enjoy the rush when you've completed that successful run while being pursued with a level 6 alarm.			"

For me this is stealth tactical squad based gaming with RPG elements at it's best. And the permadeath for the team members does add that caring element to it, I just want this team to survive the mission together.			"

												Easy mode makes you feel like a superspy badass and is easy to get through while still feeling challenging. Then you try Experienced or Expert and the difficulty _really_ gets ramped up. As you complete playthroughs (successful or not) you will gain XP to unlock new agents and alternate versions for some agents. This allows for a good amount of replay value since different agent combinations will lead to vastly different playstyles. Even the same agent can feel very different from between playthoughs depending on what items and augments you give to them. The framing story is nice but nothing special, after your first playthough you will find yourself skipping through the voiceover bits between missions. (There's not a lot though)I would definitely recommend getting with the Contingency Plan DLC as it basically doubles the length of the storyline and adds a good number of useful weapons and extra agents.

												I came into Invisible Inc. with the feeling that I'd be playing a tactical stealth game and departed with feeling like I was playing a lighter slightly less luck based X-Com. But that is hardly a bad thing. Invisible Inc. is a very strong title about fast-moving tactical stealth, full of customization options to benefit many different types of gameplay ranging from completely silent to brutal elimination.From the start of the campaign you're given three days to gather enough resources to mount a counterattack against a shadowy corporation (even shadowy-ier than the other four ruling the world). Every mission takes between 5 to 12 hours to reach, meaning you could do a bunch of nearby missions and get about four done in a day, or as little as two. Missions typically don't take much longer than 20 minutes in game time but are meaty enough to really get your mental muscles flexing. At the end of every successful (or unsuccessful) campaign, you earn XP which is translated into new starting agents and upgrades, all of which promoting various playstyles. On top of that the campaigns are relatively short (four and a half hours) meaning that there's a lot of room for trying these various gadgets and gizmos with minimal downtime. Another thing I greatly enjoyed is the modifiable difficulty, beginner difficulty is easy enough to get you in but still challenging enough to test you. As of writing, I haven't yet played the other difficulty levels, but I was greatly impressed by the first so I have high hopes for the rest.The DLC - Contigency Plan - adds an additional 48 hours to the campaign while adding a challenging mission to the middle of the game, not to mention a whole lot more stuff and challenges to overcome. If anything it feels like a warmup to Endless mode (which I'm actually excited to play, a first really) as it extends the game another 4 and a half hours while throwing harder security to deal with. Unfortunately the last mission doesn't seem to scale as well and I found it an embarrassing cakewalk to overcome where I was barely making it through the mid-campaign mission that was added. Overall I liked the additions, but also felt like the game hit its stride when you had minimal resources to work with.So all said and done, Invisible Inc. is an incredibly strong title that also happens to be pretty cheap to boot. It surprised me, feeling like an overall enjoyable game. I'm hoping they do a little more with it, but am okay if they don't. Recommended for full price, DLC is totally optional, but synergizes well with the main game so it's up to you.			"

												Invisible Inc is an intense turn based strategy game about infiltrating corporations and staying alive. You start off with two agents (you can get more as the game progresses) who have limited resources and, quite frankly, are pretty weak. As you infiltrate facilities, you can buy new gear, augments (which are basically power ups) and programs for your AI, Incognita. For a turn based strategy, it is rather fast paced. The alarm level escalates slowly even if you aren’t spotted in your turn which adds an extra layer of pressure to the game play.PROS:The graphics are great. They are cartoony, but the style works perfectly with the darker, ominous, cyberpunk look of the surroundings. It is challenging, even on the beginner difficulty. This is a pro because it is a lot more rewarding when you complete a mission that you have previously failed.The controls are easy. It takes a while to adjust to the gameplay, but the controls are very easy to pick up and use.There is a wide variety of gear. It is not limited to guns and tasers, there is a variety of other gadgets like adrenalin shots, distraction devices and even an EMP.The gameplay outside the mission is engaging. You have to choose targets around the world, buy/sell items from your contact and manage your agents.The voice actors are great. There is no shortage of dialogue in this game and it adds a lot the ste personality of some simple animations (my personal favorite is Monst3r)As you get stronger/faster/more efficient, the guards will to. You will encounter guards with armor and augments of their own. There are even drones that you can hack.The game is very entertaining/addicting. It’s worth the money, you will come back to the game time and time again.CONS:The gameplay is relatively short. There is plenty to do in the game, but once you complete beginner difficulty, the missions in experienced mode are the same except for the added difficulty. If you buy it with Contingency Plan, you won’t have this problem.Though the worlds are randomly generated, there isn’t a huge variety of how your surroundings look. There are four very subtle changes (they vary depending what corporation you’re infiltrating) but otherwise, the setting is the same. Fundamentally, the game is phenomenal. I would highly recommend it. Put it on your wishlist and get it when it goes on sale. It’s thoroughly entertaining and worth every penny.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Invisible, Inc. is a game developed and published by Klei Entertainment, the same people behind Mark of the Ninja. Invisible, Inc. is simply one of the best single-player games I've ever playedThe theme is evoked well and the mechanisms of play are finely tuned. The real genius though, lies in how the game handles mistakes. In many games failure just costs time, or you are forced to reload whenever you make a mistakeInvisible, Inc. also allows this, but it really shines when you set up a game without rewinds or reloads. Then you get to experience how good a game can really beThe perfectly executed stealthy infiltration can quickly become a deadly game of cat and mouse, and successfully pulling unconscious agents out of a botched operation is way more satisfying than a reload could ever bePoints of reference could be XCOM or the best roguelikes, but I think Invisible, Inc. outclasses them allMy only criticism lies with how certain equipment can make core elements of the game trivial to overcome. It's not so fun when you have a ""super agent"" able to avoid or overcome all oppositionThe relatively short campaign time-frame and random item availability prevents this from becoming a significant problem though RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Incredible stealth TBS game. Difficulty ramps up at a good clip and resources are limited so you are forced to balance what you want to bring vs. what you need to bring while still leaving space for future upgrades and for objectives. Enemies are distinct and interesting, which caused me to focus on particular corporations that my team was better suited for. Despite what some negative reviews state, there is always a way to beat a level. You just may not be able to find it. I've repeatedly had all my agents down but one, max alarm, guards everywhere, etc. and still beat the level without losing anyone permanently. It's also a nice feature that if you do leave behind an agent, you can always break them out of a prison on a later mission.tldr: Brilliant game. Get it if you have the brainpower and patience for it.			"

												This game is a turn by turn strategy where a couple of spy try to infiltrate a complex, with a gameplay very close to the X-com games : you mouve a couple of guys, get info, stun enemies, then the computer play and you start again. If you like strategy and intersting micro-management, this game is for you.I really like Invisible Ink, which is for me the elegent version of X-com two. There is less content, less graphics, less super-powers, but the ones that exists have intersting interaction, and therefore the gameplay is funnier than the one in the X-com series.- first randomness is correctly managed. No unlucky shots, or bad luck when performing and action. Everything you do will work, but the enemy reaction and the level layout are randoms. This is definitively a good decision as it create the illusion that the enemy has a plan, and it makes exploration crucial.- then, exploration is fun, as it's a poker game : the more you explore, the better decision you'll take and the more loot you will gain, but the more time you will loose. And time (in fact turns) are a precious ressource : as time passes, the enemy gets stronger and you'll have more gards, more enemy programs and harder hacking to handle.- then the game is more readable : this is simple 2D, with simple cover, and simple actions. You don't have to try everything 10 times to understand how it works. Things just do what's written in the description, that's intuitive and cool. Difficulties comes from poker and interaction, not from hard to understand interface.So if you like strategy, you'll like this game.Here comes the usual paragraph about music and graphics. In fe words, they do the job. Graphics are cool, with a style that fits perfectly well in a High-tech spy game and easy to read. There is no anoying stuff (like bad rotating camera, useless details, anoying particles, fog or whatever graphics cards sellers likes, but gamers hate), and no creative or awsome things. And the music is the same way : minimal ambiant.And now, here is the paragraph about the invisible pink unicorn. She's in the game, but you cannot see her, as she's as invisible as the ink. But as she's pink, we're pretty sure that the invisible ink is pink.			"

												An excellent stealth centered, turn based roguelike game where each choice matters. The game does not joke about you having odds stacked against you in a direct firefight, instead you must use sneaky tactics to get around complex you infiltrated, get the objective and get out ASAP. Truly managed to captivate the hit and run tactic used by small agencies.However, speed as well as being undetected is the key. You will not remain undeteced forever as the security level increases over time, moreso if you are caught. Invisible Inc strikes a nice balance between having to be fast and stealthy, a quality that gives a healthy gameYour squad is also accompanied by a powerful AI, that playes a major role in your success by being able to manipulate facility devices to serve you instead but beware, they are protected and sometimes you need to think about your resource allocationI also highly recommend getting the DLC, contigeancy plan. It adds a bunch of items and characters to make the game more varied, opening up even more strategies and interesting synergies. It's only 4€ if bought in a bundle and well worth the small priceThe downside of this game however is  that if you are not familiar with stealth or strategy games, then Invisible inc can be quite difficult to pick up and learn as the tutorial is quite honestly lacking finer important details which you will discover as you play. Thus I recommend starting up from the easiest difficulty (it still provides a decent challenge) and move up until you hit the hardest difficulties, which is what the game balance is centered around and what defines the true invisible inc experienceAs a final word: Try to save knockouts and kills until the last moment where you absolutely need to do so and use the corpse drag option to prevent guards from waking up			"

												A unique and addicting roguelike experience that gives me the same good feelings I got from Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and GBA Fire Emblem as a kid. The way the game values stealth and cunning over brute force is so refreshing for the roguelike genre. Also, I love the several different difficulty modes and the custom campaign options. A nice way to make the difficulty just right for diferent kinds of players!Fell in love the first time I saw it, and am definitely still playing it for months to come!			"

												A great turn-based strategy game. If you have the expansion (contingency plan) you have more characters and programs, that is more choices and replayability. I enjoy playing this game all over again as 1. each mission is differnt due to the layout being generated by an algorithm (if you increase the difficulty, I have realised that the algorithm will create missions in which you will have to cover longer distances since the rooms are not interconnected as much), and 2. there is always something that I want to improve (such as new gadgets, weapons or characters that I want to try). In my opinion, comparing to Xcom is 1. more challenging 2. more replayable (even if you restart the mission, a new layout will be generated). Certainly a good game to test your strategy abilities.Finally, I want to add that it runs flawlessly on Linux.			"

												I enjoyed this game - but - it is impossible. Even on the easiest difficulty, missions frequently end in failure for a variety of reasons. It has a very steep difficulty curve, and player skill / Agent ability does not scale with difficulty or the opposition you face by Corps agents. You will find yourself repeating missions over and over again, and likely starting new games often. It has a cool XCOM feel, and the setting is interesting and fun, but you'll find yourself getting very frustrated, very quickly. I've lost the entire game repeatedly on the first mission, having been swamped by enemies out of nowhere. The game can be fun, but you'll be driven mad by frustration having lost over and over and over and over again.			"

												It was weird at first, and the learning curve was a bit high. Understanding just how difficult the game was made by attacking everything in sight isn't the easiest of lessons to learn. But once you figure out the basics you start to realize there are a lot of different ways to win and trying out new things and learning when that safe just isn't worth it yield you a very well thought out game. It's really well balanced giving room for all the different ways to win. The DLC adds new dimensions to it, and there's workshop mods available. If you like real-time strategy this is a nice one to try as long as you remember that blowing stuff up isn't always the best approach.			"

												Invisible, Inc offers amazing sci-fi, turn-based, stealth strategy with randomly generated levels. The situations that you get yourself into builds a lot of tension, and it feels great when you manage to save all of your operatives when it look liked not everyone was going to survive. My only critques are that the campaign was fairly short and the story pretty weak. There is a good amount of replayability to partially offset that, but I wish there was more. The DLC is also great.			"

												To start of, this is probably my favourite game on steam right now.As i like tactical games, this one fits the bill perfectly.The one thing i like most, is that can avoid situations where you need to depend on your chances, like in X-Com, when your 95 % shot misses and because of that, your whole team dies. If your team dies here, it was probably your fault.That is because you have a very high amount of control over what happens. The guards path can be predicted, you can hack  everything that would make your life hard, if you got the resources.Another thing i like is the possibilitys you have. Before every playthrough, you choose two agents and two programs to start with. The are combinations that are quite safe, but not the only one working. You can also go for risk. Those are pretty dependant on luck, and with enough badluck can end a run despite all skill you can put up. Also, you can decide to stay in the level a tad longer to loot more, but then permanently ramping up of the security will make it more difficult to get out alive.Ok, back to standard categories:Gameplay:Solid, nothing exceptional, but that is not what makes this game so good. There are tools at your disposal like the tactic-screen to increase overview, etc.Graphics:Funktional, but nice enough that you don't get tired of looking at them. Story:Almost non existent. In every run, you follow the same pattern with the exact same voicelines at the exact same points. You get compormised, build your forces in secret and after your time runs out, you tackle the ""bosslevel"". Summary:If you expect a story, keep your fingers of the game, it will just dissappoint you. If you're looking for something tactial with a high level of control that has the potential to melt your brain from overheating, your at the right place. And for those who like living with their brain intact, there are enough possibilities to play somewhat more casually.Well then, thanks for reading.Cheerio			"

												Easy mode makes you feel like a superspy badass and is easy to get through while still feeling challenging. Then you try Experienced or Expert and the difficulty _really_ gets ramped up. As you complete playthroughs (successful or not) you will gain XP to unlock new agents and alternate versions for some agents. This allows for a good amount of replay value since different agent combinations will lead to vastly different playstyles. Even the same agent can feel very different from between playthoughs depending on what items and augments you give to them. The framing story is nice but nothing special, after your first playthough you will find yourself skipping through the voiceover bits between missions. (There's not a lot though)I would definitely recommend getting with the Contingency Plan DLC as it basically doubles the length of the storyline and adds a good number of useful weapons and extra agents.

												Incredible stealth TBS game. Difficulty ramps up at a good clip and resources are limited so you are forced to balance what you want to bring vs. what you need to bring while still leaving space for future upgrades and for objectives. Enemies are distinct and interesting, which caused me to focus on particular corporations that my team was better suited for. Despite what some negative reviews state, there is always a way to beat a level. You just may not be able to find it. I've repeatedly had all my agents down but one, max alarm, guards everywhere, etc. and still beat the level without losing anyone permanently. It's also a nice feature that if you do leave behind an agent, you can always break them out of a prison on a later mission.tldr: Brilliant game. Get it if you have the brainpower and patience for it.			"

												This game is a turn by turn strategy where a couple of spy try to infiltrate a complex, with a gameplay very close to the X-com games : you mouve a couple of guys, get info, stun enemies, then the computer play and you start again. If you like strategy and intersting micro-management, this game is for you.I really like Invisible Ink, which is for me the elegent version of X-com two. There is less content, less graphics, less super-powers, but the ones that exists have intersting interaction, and therefore the gameplay is funnier than the one in the X-com series.- first randomness is correctly managed. No unlucky shots, or bad luck when performing and action. Everything you do will work, but the enemy reaction and the level layout are randoms. This is definitively a good decision as it create the illusion that the enemy has a plan, and it makes exploration crucial.- then, exploration is fun, as it's a poker game : the more you explore, the better decision you'll take and the more loot you will gain, but the more time you will loose. And time (in fact turns) are a precious ressource : as time passes, the enemy gets stronger and you'll have more gards, more enemy programs and harder hacking to handle.- then the game is more readable : this is simple 2D, with simple cover, and simple actions. You don't have to try everything 10 times to understand how it works. Things just do what's written in the description, that's intuitive and cool. Difficulties comes from poker and interaction, not from hard to understand interface.So if you like strategy, you'll like this game.Here comes the usual paragraph about music and graphics. In fe words, they do the job. Graphics are cool, with a style that fits perfectly well in a High-tech spy game and easy to read. There is no anoying stuff (like bad rotating camera, useless details, anoying particles, fog or whatever graphics cards sellers likes, but gamers hate), and no creative or awsome things. And the music is the same way : minimal ambiant.And now, here is the paragraph about the invisible pink unicorn. She's in the game, but you cannot see her, as she's as invisible as the ink. But as she's pink, we're pretty sure that the invisible ink is pink.			"

												This is one of the best stealth games on steam, probably second only to Mark of the Ninja, which Klei also created.This game will appeal to you if you like strategy and value challenging yourself on repeat runs on harder difficulties (the harder difficulties get quite tough without being cheap). If you are looking for depth of story you're not playing the right game. If you're looking for Klei quality stylized art assets with great sound and good tactical stealth gameplay then look no further.Imagine X-COM mixed with Mark of the Ninja and you get this gem, wonderful art that it is that I have no doubt you will love.

N/AWorth revisiting? Yes, game is designed to be replayed multiple times, with new unlocks and increased difficulty levels offered as an incentiveBest part – The way the game is designed to encourage repeat playthroughs is what makes Invisible, Inc. unique in the turn-based stealth genre and provides an addictive and satisfying gameplay loop.Worst part – Missions do not have a lot of variety and can become repetitive. I found limiting myself to one or two missions per play session helped alleviate any possible monotony.			"

												During my first playthrough I found the game incredibly hard, even on easy! (And I was seriously considering not starting on easy as I rarely start on the first difficulty... good thing I didn't do that!). It was so hard, I had trouble enjoying it.I finished the main game by sacrificing half of my team, the initial and good members, in the brutal last mission. I tried the first DLC mission, but with only one member with a weapon and both not upgraded... I gave up.I then looked online, learned about my major mistakes and restarted from the beginning. I'm still not super good but just reached the last mission of the main game, didn't lose any mission yet and I'm enjoying it so much more! I ended up finishing the game + DLC with never losing once, and enjoying it so much more than the first time! I thought I the ending was pretty cool too, a bit open to a sequel maybe, though without spoilers it would seem to be much harder.The fact that so much of the game is randomize made it so that I didn't mind at all restarting the game right away, as it doesn't feel like I'm it redoing the same thing. It's super rare if not never seen of me replaying a game twice in a row (well to be fair, it's also because I felt I stood no chance for the DLC missions so not really replaying it for itself...).All in all I doubted my purchase for a bit but now I'm happy with the game!

												If you are a fan of the turn strategy games there is no error buying invisible inc, it's a incredible twist on the genreThis game is a small masterpiece that Im glad to have played, gameplay is superb with many interesting mechanics and the replay value is Incommensurable. You can literally have more than  100 hours in this game easily.But be adviced, altought the story is pretty good and the voicework is AMAZING this is a game that you should play mostly because of gameplay. For a game focused on gameplay the story is very well made and is a great part of it, but not the main selling point. The art is also gorgeous and fit perfectly with the setting of the world.seriously, if they made a sequel where the gameplay was the same with just a different story and minor smalls additions to maps and characters I would buy it and STILL feel happy, because this game is amazing, I really hope this gets a sequel because I regret no paying full price, this game is worth every cent.The only ""negative point"" is that the story is short, but as I said the gameplay is the focus and the replay factor very good.

												This is another winner from Klei - a great, challenging, and surprisingly deep turn-based strategy game. I did find that the initial learning curve was a little steep, and so recommend that beginners actually do not select the Beginner difficulty. Instead, dig through the custom settings and dial up the multiplier for the # of credits you get for hacking / stealing, and increase the KO amount for the guards. This helped tremendously, as even with the Beginner difficulty, I was always getting killed after just the 2nd or 3rd mission.Once you get past the first few hours, and start to learn all the ways your agents can die (and oh yes, they will die, repeatedly!), then you begin to see just how much depth there is to the game. This game really reminds me of some of the best Euro-board games, such as Tikal, Catan, etc. The thing that makes these games great is the vast amount of choices you have on any given turn, and the very small amount of actions you actually have time to perform. Of course in Invisible, Inc., as you progress, you will gain the ability to gain more actions, but the central strategic element of balancing all of those choices to maximize your outcome still remains.I foresee a great # of hours put into this game before the year is out.

												After playing 86 hours of this game i've finally completed Invisible Inc + Contingency plan on experienced difficulty, possibly one of the best and also most frustrating games i have ever played. Just as a quick run down: Beautiful art style, Wonderfully challenging, Well written and whitty text and voice acting,  Simple stealth mechanics whose intricacies are hard to master (making them all the more satasfyiing when you do), Huge variety of items/augments/programs/characters that mean every playthrough pushes you to explore new tactics.As a caviate; if you dont like rogue like games where they take several attempts to complete, this is probably not the game for you. I think iv got to pretty solid grips with it now but thats after nearly 90hours of gameplay and i have yet to even try my hand at expert difficulty. However if you love testing yourself against punishingly hard games, and particularly if you like stealth games this is the game for you.Also Buy the DLC, it makes the main campaign slightly harder by making it longer, but all the additional items/characters/programs etc. make it a much more intricate game.Good luck!

												Invisible Inc is a beautifully crafted piece of gaming heaven.  It can seem difficult and somewhat unforgiving, but it's only if you're impatient and impulsive. It rewards risk taking and victories are sweet. Highly replayable. Worth every dollar, and the DLC is worthwhile too. Cannot recommend this game highly enough.			"

												With all its different agents, augments, skills, and items there is a lot to explore. Tons of replay value, as every mission is procuderally generated so you never get the same map twice.I'm also loving the alarm system. Each turn, the counter increases, so that every five turns the alarm level is raised and a new security feature is implemented. It forces you to be faster; you have to know when to leave and decide if looting that last safe over there is /really/ worth it.If you don't like that though, you can just turn it off. There is a great amount of customization options so for anyone who is failing Experienced difficulty like me - don't worry, you can simply get rid of the thing that causes you to fail. Put more power stations into each level, make the maps smaller, disable the automatically increasing alarm, place more safes to loot. Whatever it is that frustrates you; you can get rid of it with one click.10/10 would absolutely recommend if you like strategy games.			"

												It's a turn based strategy stealth game where the only randomness is the map generation.  All sorts of difficult layouts and traps can be bypassed with some creativity or patience, and even the moments where you mess up and are spotted are pretty exciting.			"

												Fantastic game. The gameplay is tense and suspenseful, the visuals and atmosphere are great, but what impressed me the most is the way the game breaks new ground in terms of stealth games. The developers have taken a bunch of familiar mechanics and combined them in such a way that it does something entirely new. I rate it up there with Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft as one of those games that manages to carve out a new genre.			"

												Like Mark of the Ninja and Don't Starve, this is another outstanding game by Klei Entertainment. It takes elements of stealth games, XCOM, Shadowrun and rogue-likes and merges them together to create a tense strategy game about a secret agency that infiltrates companies in a dystopian future.While there is an enjoyable main plot in the campaign, the main focus of the game lies in it's gameplay. Its rogue-like nature, its random elements and the fact that the campaign is not too long (without the DLC at least) let's you enjoy the game multiple times even after you have beaten it the first time. IF you have beaten it. I say that because the game can be really brutal at times (in a really enjoyable way). Unlike many rogue-likes, the game is very accessible and not too complex but the depth it achieves by combining all its elements is great. While permadeath and limited ways to undo mistakes appeal to rogue-like fans, the game is highly customizable and you can enable retries and rewinds to make the game easier for you if you like.Apart from the good gameplay and the clean UI, the music is amazing and adds to the tension. Starting out relatively quite it ramps up and when everything goes down in flames on the screen, the music let's you know. And everything will go down in flames. Every game. Even if you think you have everything under control, something will happen. Part of the fun is getting out of these situations unharmed.If you dig strategic games, rogue-lites, and stealth games you should definitely check out Invisible Inc. I did not think I would enjoy the game as much as I do, but I tried it anyways because I liked Klei's previous games and was not disappointed. It does a lot of things right and checks enough boxes for me to let me do ""just one more mission"".			"

												This is an excellent turn-based strategy and infiltration game. The story, though short, is intriguing, and the gameplay is easy to pick up and deep in its mechanics. It has high replayability value and I never felt as though I was out of danger. I only wish that they had spent more time fleshing out the details of this new, corporate-controlled world and doing a little more world building. The art style is cool and stylish and really striking, a sort of a mix between polygonal art and that Erin mascot from Esurance. I highly recommend giving the game a try, especially if you can get it as part of a bundle.			"

												Very surprised so few people on my friends list is up on this game. Definitely the most enjoyable turn based game I've played in a good long while. I actually think the mechanics and unique characters make this an even better package than X-Com 2. It's certainly more unique. I love how they managed to get both hacking and stealth to work so seemlessly in a turn based game. The campaign isn't anything ground breaking and isn't even close to being as well designed as Hitman to show off how much is actually part of the package. It requires a lot of patience early on, but once you start to understand the systems, it shines as a strategy game. These days, it doesn't seem to matter what type of game Klei releases. They stay winning.			"

												When I first saw the game I was afraid the gameplay would be too clunky. Now I regret not playing it sooner. The combination of infiltration and tactics is very good : both at the start of every level, when you're scouting, and after getting the objectives, when you're trying to get to the exit dodging 6 or 7 ennemies.The replayability is also worth it and I garantee you will lose track of time racking your brain to get everyone back alive.

												A very fun game.  Standard cyber-distopia, turn based strategy.  There's a turn limit, as the ""alarm"" level keeps creeping up each turn.  It can go shooting up if you act indiscretely.A little hard to try to ghost each level, and if you're there for too long the guards are alerted each turn to where your characters are.  You can use lethal methods to keep the guards permently down, but that tends to increase the alert levels.  Non-lethal results in guards getting up a few turns after getting knocked out.  You can keep them knocked out by using an agent to pin them.  But then you're down an agent that you need exploring the map.The goal is to steal enough supplies from each mission, while completing the primary objective.  I suggest playing on Beginner to get the hang of the game, and then ramp it up to suit your abilities.  Enjoyed the game and the story line.			"

												I first played this during a free to play weekend and was completely hooked. The game would be very short without Contingency Plan. I definitely recommend the bundle. Main plot is the same each playthrough, but you can choose which type of mission to pursue and levels are randomly generated. Also, different agents have different abilities for good replayablility. Great turn-based infiltration game! Please make Invisible 2!			"

												It's like XCom and Mark of the Ninja had a child together - a turn-based stealth game where you try to infiltrate corporations with your squad of hackers, and whatnot. The campaign is short-ish - it took me about 6 hours to get through the beginner mode. However, the game is extremely replayable, with you unlocking different characters / items / programs every game - somewhat like Dungeon of the Endless. Multiple different difficulty levels exist as well as custom games, which give you a tonne of options.The artstyle is awesome - it's somehow both typical Klei (Don't Starve, Mark of the Ninja) while being completely unique from both of those titles.All in all, this is a fantastic game. Even after just playing Beginner Mode, I'm totally sold on it.			"

												Like any rouge strategy game you're going to get ♥♥♥♥ed from not knowing better and the rng. This game spices it up focusing on stealth, hacking and...outright tile abuse!The difficulties make you have to die a lot before you realize how you need to play in order to beat it, the game is short though. Too short actually, the game is meant to rush you but, i find it hard to build my team into anything i want by the end.There are a lot of upgrades to find and youll only have access to a select few. Thats not the problem tho, the fact is that most of the upgrades you can find are complete garabage. Now you can sell them for half price but, thats assuming you stole it, which is a let down either way.Basically its in your best intrest to browse every type of upgrade station you come across. You might get killed not having it, you might get killed trying to get it.Maybe im just too used to them but, the starting agents and programs seem to be the best starting kit. Not just easiest to play but, the most practical.The game is better than good but, its not great either, its definately missing some polishing. Hard to tell if i even want to get the dlc expansion. It looks more or less the same, add new things in, strat changes, get ♥♥♥♥ed for not knowing better.5 out of 10 dameons "

												I very much enjoyed this game. The stealth aspects work well with the ""high information"" style of the game. Although the campaign is short, I have found it very replayable. The DLC is also quite worth it, and it adds to the already significant challenge. The game also has excellent music.			"

												A wonderful mix of clasic stealth gaming and take turn grid based strategy like Fire Emblem or X-com with less enfasis on combat. It also has procedurally generated levels and dungeon crawling mechanic's.I am a bit of a Klei fan boy, that beeing said I gave this my own personal GOTY and its has been amazing since beta. Now that it is fully release the amount of conetent is awesome.			"

												It's a great game, simple as that. The easiest difficulty is hard enough not to be boring, but easy enough to learn the controls and mechanics. The next one is a bit of a challenge, but not frustratingly so. And then it goes full on permadeath FTL-style and screws you over for every little mistake. I love it. They teach you everything, and then throw you in the deep end.If you like very hard games with a resonable learning curve, and stealth games, try this. It's great. The story is nice too, but I much prefer the nice gameplay. Especially since killing people is usually a bad option, and neutralizing them temporarily is much more effective. I always enjoy games that encourage a clean job.			"
