												When it comes to games of chance, I would normally stay away. Slot machines at the casinos are a prime example. However, with 7 Grand Steps, there's more at stake. Your coins are steps to improving oneself in the world. In this case, a coin operated Ancient Egypt. You have coins that denote the 'skills' you can adept yourself in as it pushes you forward into time. If you decide to excel yourself in the society, you move up in the social hiearchy. You can find new techs (skills) or become a hero through its adventure-story style of narrative.However, once you get to the ruler class, it becomes a challenge and that is what I admire: a game that is actively trying to push you back if you screw up. It is telling you to learn the mechanics again and come back when you are ready. That is why I am recommending this game. It is a game that is responding to your choices, your shifts and your play of the coins. Who knew a slot machine would be this fun?			"

												The game is okay, but the price is absolutely ridiculous. I got this in a bundle and paid less than a dollar for it, and it's been worth that much. But there are literally thousands of other games I would buy before this one at full price.Essentially, you control a family from ancient times as they make their way throug the ages. The entire game happens in this weird wheel segment, with tokens representing your husband and wife moving around on it. The game mechanics boil down to spend coins to move clockwise on the game board, and collect ""legends"", points that go towards earning discoveries, which can give you technological advances, earning you big chunks of coins, or help you move to the outer rings of the wheel, where you have more movement options. You have children, and spend coins to boost their skills. These skills help them earn more coins when they take over the family line. But as far as I can tell, that's about it. It's an endless cycle of earning and spending coins. The story elements aren't compelling at all, as they come in tiny fragments and don't seem to affect anything visibly.  Like I said, mildly distracting, but far from addictive and not worth twenty bucks.			"

												Honestly, I wishlisted this on the basis that additional features were pending and I would buy it when it was more fleshed out. The trailer and associated screenshots make it look simple, but I can assure you; it is not. Installed it Sept. 3rd, in the afternoon, and played just about 12 hours straight almost. This is one of the best sims I have played in a LONG time, and easily justifies $15. It gets its hooks into you early, and quickly turns into one of those ""just one more turn"" games. It is unique, has a seemingly infinite amount of depth, and one play through is REALLY long if done correctly. I'm still on my first family, after this initial 12 hours. One of the best purchases I have made all year, easily.			"

												7 Grand Steps is an interesting concept: board game meets chose-your-own-adventure-meets (very light) civilization. You begin the game as a couple of poor workers and must build a dynasty, trying to climb the social ladder. Since 7 Grand steps is very much the sum of its parts, I'll describe each one, as it's quite difficult to understand the game based on existing reviews.DescriptionThe board game. That part is an almost direct port of the board game Cartagena. You almost always control two playing pieces (husband and wife). You advance the track by paying a token that makes you advance to the next location on the track that has a symbol matching that of the token. You can also move backwards to the next space that is occupied by another playing piece (either your spouse or one of the shadow pieces that are controlled by the AI). Doing so earns you tokens. How many and of what type depends on your skill level (more on that later). Here stops the Cartagena comparison.Whenever you land on a space occupied by your spouse, there is a chance that you'll get a child. Children must be educated, so it's best to feed them tokens as often as possible. Doing so increases their skills, which will be used when the child becomes an adult (you can chose which child to play as in the next generation, a choice you have to make when the current one reaches the end of the track). Remember that the skills increase the number of tokens received when making a move towards the back.There are 4 different tracks on the board, one for each social strata. With few exceptions, you're confined to your own social status's track.On some spaces, beads are found that you can collect if you are among the firsts to reach the space. Collecting enough beads will trigger an event of one of three types: discovery (which changes one of the symbols on the track to a new one, and gives you a boost in skills and tokens for it, therefore giving you an advantage over shadow playing pieces), heroic, or social advancement.Heroic and social advancements trigger a short choose-your-own adventure. A narrative is presented to you, and you'll typically have to make 5 choices. If you make ""good"" choices, you earn rewards: assorted rewards for the heroic events, or climbing one step of the social ladder for social advancement ones.When you reach the fourth and last social class, you must make civ-style ruling decisions for your city each turn. You'll typically start as a sort of secretary of agriculture, but you'll get more power later on, on financial and defence matters for example. Most of those decisions are actually sliders to set (how much grain to distribute to the people, how much to store, what level of corruption do you tolerate/encourage, etc.)CommentsRegarding time spent on each section, 7 Grand Steps is actually about 90% board game, 7% choose-your-own-adventure, and 3% civ-style ruling.Meaning you'll spend the bulk of your time (I guess about 15 hours per game) playing the board part. Now ask yourself this: are you comfortable with a 13.5 hours-long game of Cartagena? No? Me neither! Cartagena is fun as a 45 minutes affair, but it's not meaty/varied/strategic enough to warrant 10+ hours a pop. It gets boring quite fast, actually.The choose-your-own-adventure part is unfortunately not better. It feels completely random, gives incredibly weak feedback (to the point where the text describing the resolution will leave you scratching your head: ""is that good or bad?""  ). It's also repetitive and lacks drama. The board game part might be boring, but at least it's something solid. You feel like you have some control on the outcome. Not so with the adventure part.About the civ-style part, I must admit I have not spent a lot of time with it (more on that later) and I certainly haven't seen all it has to offer. What I've seen is something pretty abstract, and relatively basic, but it made sense and gave me control, so probably the best part of the three. Too bad it's also the one you'll play the least.So why did I spend so little time with the ruling part? Of course, partly because, as I said, it's only accessible once you reach the top of the social ladder. But also because, when certain conditions are met, a ""challenge of the ages"" is triggered, which is another choose-your-own-adventure that ends in an age advancement (from the copper age to the bronze age for example). It's as random as the others, but the consequences are much more dramatic. After my first ""challenge of the ages"", my character died and I got to play a distant sibling in the next age. The problem is, that sibling was only on the second rung of the social ladder and had of course no access to the ruling game. And that's actually the moment I quit this game: I didn't want to spend another 3 or 4 hours to reach the point where I could play the only part of the game that was at least mildly satisfying. yukConclusionI don't recommend 7 Grand Steps. It's much too repetitive, long and random. in short, it's very boring. That's a shame, really, because the basic concept is interesting. This game is apparently the first of the 7 grand steps (full title is 7 Grand Steps, Step 1: What Ancients Begat). IF (capitalization intended) the developer manages to correct its many flaws, I think there's a possibility of making a very good and original game out of the concept. I therefore wouldn't rule out playing step 2, if it ever sees the light of day. But until then, I'd avoid the game entirely. If you're desperate for playing a game with a similar concept, there are two alternatives I can think of:* Zafehouse Diaries, about Zombie apocalypse survival. Not excellent, but much better than this.* King of the Dragon Pass, which I haven't played yet, but sounds similar with a stronger emphasis on the ruling part (it also has much better reviews).			"

												7 Grand Steps is an ambitious game. It provides a single-player boardgame experience against computer-controlled AI characters set amongst the classic ages of history. Unfortunately, the experience is enormously crippled by the random elements of the game. Progress often feels the benefit of luck, and the frequent impediments to your progress are frustrating and feel beyond player control. While the various storylines you'll encounter are somewhat engaging, they are often hopelessly vague. Character choices that work for one individual utterly fail for another. While training children is an important part of the game, the parents can reproduce beyond their means, such that nurturing each child becomes impossible. Should you choose to dote on one child, rivalries will develop which hinder progress down the line. While progress is exciting, especially from Age to Age, due to the strange and random nature of the game, you could be forced to play one Age for a great length of time. As you are forced to make the same choices again and again, the tedium weighs the experience down, such that slogging through the wheel becomes a chore. While you may find the game has an instant surface appeal, it doesn't ultimately hold up. The lives of the characters in the game feel beyond any meaningful influence, and each turn eventually feels mechanical. The initial wonder of the experience was greatly muted after a few hours of play, to the point that I couldn't explain why I continued to play. The structure of 7 Grand Steps is intriguing, but sadly, it is a flawed creation. ""Winning"" the game is an empty achievement: the end result of many hours of token creation in a blind universe.

												I kind of have mixed feelings about this game. I would give it 5/10. Good, playable, but with serious drawbacks.Upsides: It does give you a strangely epic feeling - you do feel like a part of history itself, looking at stories of families not at the level of each individual, but ultimately, for the entire family bloodline, as a whole. I would say that this epicness is the most unusual part about this game, which no other games I've ever played offers.The graphics and music is also not bad for a game of its size.Downsides:The biggest problem is the disconnect between player's choices and their consequences, and the lack of any coherent logic as to how and why to make decisions. For example, when your family is facing a crisis of the age, you are given 4 questions, each with 4 choices - and after you choose all 4 answers, you kind of get a ""score"" on how you did. But there is absolutely no prompts as to why one answer may or may not be correct - and the worst answer kills your character outright, and the previous 2-3 hours of your gameplay is wasted. What the hell?! This happens in other places too...To make this even worse, there's no SAVE functionality in this game - just Pause/Continue. I understand that history cannot be rewinded, and that decisions are decisions. It makes sense, but this is a game, for people to play. It is not meant to punish the player harshly. If the character you control dies, you lose your previous 2-3 hours of progress; If all you characters of the current generation dies, you are dead. Your game progress is completely erased. What the hell?!Overall, I like this game for what it's good for, but I hate it for what it's bad for. I'm not playing it again.			"

												STRONG POINTS: elegant and steeped in metaphor. The game tells a story while you play. The actions from one generation build upon (and perhaps hamper those) of the next. Lots of interesting strategic decisions: when to marry (and gain an additional pawn), which pawn to move first to maximize your chances at points. The game expands impressively the further you advance, and when I first landed in the ruling class my jaw dropped.WEAK POINTS: Those who dislike randomness will become frustrated with the inscrutable child-bearing mechanics. Sometimes you try and fail every time, sometimes your pawns won't stop having kids no matter how many you already have. :)TO SUM UP: An epic strategy game that doesn't end up overwhelming. You stay focused on the here-and-now, even though the ramifications of the player's actions stretch beyond the immediate.			"

												I really like the concept of this game and wanted to love it, but unfortunately I do think that it gets way too repetitive. At first it's pretty exciting to work to get beads to advance your goals and watch your family change, but I hit a point where I'd seen a lot of the stories you can get multiple times, and once you hit that point the game starts to feel pretty unexciting, which exposes how repetative the gameplay really is. As a board game that lasted a few hours I can see this game being kind of fun, but as a game that lasts around 15 hours, it's easy to get bored of it really quickly.I think the devs could probably improve the next release of the game enough to make this series worth playing, but for now, although I'm really intrigued by the ideas present in the game, I can't really recommend it. If you really love board game mechanics, family building, and history, consider checking it out on sale, but for everyone else I'm afraid I have to suggest you give it a pass.			"

												I wasn't going to buy this game, but after watching a brief video of game play I was intrigued, so went ahead and purchased it.  It's more a board game with animations than a video game.  I've so far throughly enjoyed playing the game.  I'm still in the copper age, but hope to progress  soon.  :)As strategy isn't my forte I was struggling initially, but soon picked up the basics and managed to stave off the symbolic failures (i.e by being eaten by crocs). What a refreshingly different game, that's based on the circle of life. I'd recommend this to anyone. The game has simple game mechanics, but it will keep you thinking throughout the whole game. Watch out for those crocs, lol. I'm surprised they don't burp. :)			"

												7 Grand Steps is weird. I don't really have a better way to describe it, because it aims to be a life simulator in the strangest way possible. You guide the lives of a family through many generations of early human history, raising them up through the ranks of society from farmers to rulers. The way you do this is by feeding tokens into a fancy machine that moves your little people along an ever-turning wheel. The wheel turns counter-clockwise towards the crocodiles (representing death in the fine Egyptian tradition) every turn, and spending a token on your character moves them ahead to the next instance of that symbol on the wheel. You can also have your characters make new tokens, which keeps them stationary or moves them backwards depending on the proximity of other pieces, so you have to balance spending and making tokens. There are other characters on the wheel representing neighbors and acquaintances, and they have their own agendas as well.You also produce children who become your new characters when the current ones die, and you can spend tokens on them to train them for life. The token system is a very clever representation of wealth and resources. Trying to balance their uses gets really tricky, especially when you get the chance to move to a higher ring on the wheel (representing higher society) and have to start collecting and using different tokens. As you move you also collect counters towards a life goal, which has dramatic effects on the wheel like changing token symbols or opening up new rings. There's quite a bit of storytelling to it as well, with some Crusader Kings-style choices to make about your family. Additional gameplay systems come into play as you ascend through society as well, such as ruling over others, and the game purports to have 15 hours worth of content. I didn't get that far because honestly this doesn't feel like my kind of game, but it's unique and worth trying to see if it's the kind of thing that clicks with you.			"

												Towards the end of the Copper Age, things were finally looking up for my family.  After many years of being bottom dwellers in the social caste system my family discovered the ""alphabet"" and the art of being a ""physician"".  This thrust us into the upper middleclass, and my only daughter, Senet, became the best child this family had ever seen.  She was above the other children in the village with an absolute understanding of science and literature.  When Senet left to discover herself she took a sizable inheritence with her.  But as this game will teach you..life can be cruel even to those more fortunate.  After watching all the other neighbors get married and start families, Senet was left alone to focus on her career.  And about midlife, still with no suitor or successors, Senet decided to pay a matchmaker in the town to find a worthy husband.  What she got a was drunk who stole from her and gave her three rotten children who weren't good at anything but lying and stealing, constantly bickering with each other.  Now towards the end of her life, and the families fortune all but squandered the children were fighting over the meager inheritence they would get.  War had broken out in the surrounding lands and many people were flocking to the city Senet and her family lived in, bringing with them disease and poverty.  This disease ultimately spelled the end for Senet and her family, as they were now too poor to move away or pay for medicine.  The plague took all of them, and in retrospect it was probably for the best that the family line did not continue at this point.I really enjoyed this game and plan on doing another run through soon.  I read a lot of negative talk about this game being repetitive and that can get boring.  Is this game repetitive? Sure it is.  But so is Monopoly and other boardgames.  Stick with it long enough, though, and things become interesting.  I enjoyed the concept of this game and watching a family trying to struggle in one generation and succeed in another.*To the developers: just a fun little thing to add at the end of the game would be a family tree of sorts.  Showing all the paths you took and how they ended.There are some grammatical errors in the game and I have no idea how they determine the outcome of some of the story choices.  I would also like a little more coherence with the character designs, especially from age to age.  Overall, though, a fun and relaxing game.P.s. I paid a couple dollars for this in a bundle pack.  $20 is way too much when compared with what else you could get for that price tag.  Wait until on sale for less that $5. "

Basically you get tokens on certain turns that allow your current family to get rewards by moving to designated areas on the 'board' (dial thingy). It is focused around the notion of continuity and progress of generations, wthin the context of family life. Though this is a little more elaborate and unique than the Game of Life, at full price its expensive. If you do find this on sale, for really cheap and you would like something to kill time then this might be for you...unless you hate reading, cos there is alot of it.Note - If you are visually impared, you can still play this fine in windowed mode using windows magnifier.

												TL;DR  Any hobby boardgamer should pick this up without a second thought.  Others with an open mind and a willingness to learn the rules might find themselves strangely addicted.Though some reviews compare this game to a slot machine, the comparison is apt only in the most superficial way.  Instead, it is a solo boardgame with a length that feels like a full-on campaign and the ability to quit and save your state in three seconds (take that Mage Knight).  While there is a compelling storytelling mechanic at work (that emulates King of Dragon Pass to some degree), understanding the underlying mechanics is essential to success.  Difficult decisions abound, and multiple winning conditions, tradeoffs between long-term and short-term success, and pinches of push-your-luck tension are all present.  Really curious to see whether a sequel would stick with the same base mechanics or innovate all over again.  Definitely an indie gem.			"

This game draws you in and makes you live generations of lifes in a civilization, repeatedly grinding your way to the top, to just realize how many more levels of society are still above your family after many generations pass.  As soon as I saw this game I knew that it would be something special, with it's board game feel and the slot dispension movements/actions and multiple decisions, I don't think I could play through this game the same multiple times if I even tried.

												I have no idea what this is actually supposed to be. It's sort of a board game, sort of a strategy game, and sort of a roleplaying game and exists as something entirely its own thing. Normally I'd call that a plus, but as you might have guessed by the gratuitously pretentious title, it's a game much more full of itself than it is actually well-designed. Playing as a family, you use tokens to move forward on a board that's constantly rotating  towards a pit of crocodiles which represent failure to thrive. As you play, you might produce children, and one of those children moves on to be your next player character and start a new generation eventually. Choices you make, like neglecting one of your offspring, might affect you down the line.Pretty cool in concept, but everything is just so slow and boring that it lost me. I remained curious and entranced despite the repetition for a while, wanting to know where this was all going, but eventually I realized just how much time I was wasting clicking on tokens again and again. Every actual in-game action is so far removed from the overall story it's trying to tell that it requires you to bring your own personal narrative to things just to make it interesting. Coupled with a really self-satisfied writing style and a way of trying to sound philosophical without saying much, and my goodwill quickly faded away entirely. This was a bundle game for me, but I'm still not interested in playing any longer. That it sells for $20 normally is insane. Some people might find something of interest here in the unique concept - I do recommend giving it a try if it makes its way to your library via bundle - but everything it was trying to do just didn't work for me.

												Kind of a mix between a board game and Civilization. I liked this game at first, until it punishes you for playing a game. There's no save function. They're probably trying for ""You can't change the past,"" but it essentially erases all your progress if you fail to play the game the way it wants you to play. You have to marry on the first or second turn, and aim to have a thousand children all treated equally. If you treat one child very well and ignore the others, then your next generation your 'best' child will (most of the time) not have children and then it's game over. This game costs too much for what it is. People that are a glutton for punishment can buy it when it's on sale.edit: dev commented. I played 3 games where I favored one child over the other. 1st game, the next generation they died out as there was no one to marry since I didn't marry on the first two turns. The leftover single lady didn't care to marry me. Dead line. // 2nd game, the next generation died out as somebody was sterile. Never had a child with my spouse or even infidelity (is it even built into the game?!) and died out from old age no matter how any times I banged my wife. The next generation under the uh ""runty ignored son"" nobody would marry at first, then married too late and too old to have kids. Maybe he could've been gifted a questionably-statted orphan for next generation if I had let him live past the 60ish I quit on.// 3rd game the rivalry occured, but did survive beyond that generation.

												Eminently addictive and fairly deep despite being simple to play. There's probably a great boardgame hidden in this somewhere, but for the dearth of tokens it definitely benefits from not being one. The game could certainly use a bit more to do in some areas and the events tend to repeat a bit often between consecutive generations, but on the whole it's just a great ""one more turn"" type deal.Talking about deal: Wait until it's on sale or in a Humble Bundle. I doubt I'd be as happy about it if I had paid $20 for it.			"

												I'm not a fan of indie games, they remind me of the sort of games I played back in the 80's. I want more out my my games now. Saying that, once in a while along comes a real gem of an indie production and this is one such game. So simple on the surface but really has some nice depth to it. I bought it on a sale day but after playing it (loads) I'd have been more than happy to have paid full price, it's worth it. Good job guys on producing a really nice game. 10/10			"

												I got this game in a Humble Bundle and it was small, simple, and looked very different from other games I've been playing. I booted it up thinking I could fiddle around with it for an hour or so before I went to bed. Four hours later, it was 1am and I was still playing.It's a simple little game, but your strategies can get pretty complex, and there's a lot of luck involved to keep you on your toes. The tutorial doesn't cover every trick there is, so you'll have to discover some things on your own. The only downside is the writing is sometimes hard to understand, almost as if this was translated from another language. Maybe that's a stylistic thing? It's not too bothersome, but I do notice it.			"

												It's a very addictive game for what seems like simple game play. You need to educate the offspring and make sure they all get the same treatment or you suffer the consequences which when you're just barely staying afloat can be make or break. But, if the siblings get along it can be wonderful.I found myself often saying I'll just finish this generation before I quit ... and 6 generations later I was still saying 'just this generation'.

												This is a strangely compelling - and strangely moving - game. It's about a mysterious coin-op machine which represents the progression of time and a family's struggle to advance - and sometimes just to survive - the turning wheels of history. Their story is told mostly with the interaction of a few abstract icons, and the occasional snippet of text, and you'd think it would be a rather cold and abstract experience. It didn't feel that way to me, though. The struggle to find the best way to provide for your children's future has real emotional weight, for example. I still can't really say why I like this so much, but it's a totally different experience to most computer games. It seems very simple at first, and the complexity only creeps up on you very slowly, but as it does, the whole experience seems to grow with it. Highly recommended.			"

												As others have already said - it's a highly addictive game. When board games and RPG meet, the result can only be good if you like both. You start off in the Copper Age and advance your family the way you want to. You can choose between social advancement (which can catapult your family to noble ranks), heroic adventures (which can become a revolution) or inventions (which opens up new techs).I would recommend the game to everybody, that likes a little board game paired with casual strategy and a nice narrative. :)			"

												This one I got on a sale, and am suprised to find out that it costs 20 bucks...7 Grand Steps is a sweet game, it has an interesting concept but yet it is very plain and eventually that's a board game, and I got the feeling that the advertisements tried to make it look like something more than that..While I can't say that this game is *just* a board game, because, yes, it is more than that, it is still *mainly* a board game,It has story elements in it, as it involves raising a family (kind of), and progress with it from generation to generation holding onto the wheels of time (really, the board is a wheel of time).During the board-game moments you'll have to spread skills to your children and make some decisions from time to time when some textual messages show themselves, describing a certain situation.Those are the basics, and yes, there IS some more, but not much.This game really rocks, as a board-game, because it's different and executes new and original ideas in it.Yet, it's extremely simple and eventually it's merely a time-killer, for me at least. And while I really liked it and played it for a couple of times I just didn't feel like returning to it and felt I've already seen everything this game can offer rather quickly.I do recommend it, but perhaps when it's on a sale or something, because I can't see why it costs 20 dollars.The title on the steam library says ""7 Grand Steps, Step 1.."" So maybe that means there are other parts coming out, but I don't see any official statement about it.			"

Brief Synopsis:7 Grand Steps: What Ancients Begat is a game made essentially by one man (he outsourced music and art assets, I believe). Originally, this game was meant to be part of a seven part series. The developer has mentioned however (in early 2014), that the second step (game) won't be coming for ""several more years"". The game is stylized after the old coin games in which you insert a coin into a machine which triggers movement. Game play is relatively simple to understand, but is complex enough so that there is a layer of strategy involved. The game is relatively simple. Through the use of coins and choices made during game play, you influence a family through the ages, determining how educated the children become and how powerful the family becomes. Play the game right, and your family could end up ruling over their city as high priest or even king.Long Review:Story:  You start in the bronze age as a new family. Throughout the game, you'll be presented with story cards through which you can sometimes influence the fate of your family. There are several Ages through which you must progress in this game. Each Age follows several generations of your family. Some generations manage to reach high society while some struggle to survive as simple peasants. The story cards are very samey throughout a given Age, which can make the game a bit boring at times.Graphics: The art assets are very well done in this game. Similar to the story cards, there aren't many different assets, but that's to be expected, given what the game itself is a relica of (old fashioned coin fed theatric game machines).Music/Sounds: The music and sounds in What Ancients Begat are superb and really add a lot to the overall ambience and immersion of the game. They're not over done, but are instead rather subtle, which is exactly what a game like this needs to make it shine.Length: According to the forums, the length of this game varies according to each person's play style. Some people manage to finish the game in less than 5 hours, while others take closer to 15 hours to reach the end. Personally, I got about 13 hours worth of play time.Replayability: There is a bit of replayability in this game. In my opinion, it's well worth playing through at least twice, as the first time can be seen as an opportunity to learn the mechanics and work out a viable strategy for the second playthough. Overall, I recommend that you purchase this game if you enjoy simple, historical, slow paced games with strategical elements and few art assets. It's definitely worth getting on sale, if nothing else.			"

												7 Grand Steps is... Kind of weird.  It's a boardgame with story elements where you control a family through the generations.  You travel around on a disk while trying to snatch up tokens and train up your kids to succeed you when you die.  Sometimes there's mini stories to click through and make decisions.  The biggest problem is that the game plays super slowly and it's easy to get dicked over by a bad roll.  It's worth trying if you can grab it for cheap but overall ehh.			"

												The game is moderately interesting to begin with, the concept itself is quite appealing: this mix of tabletop game and an arcade machine, the artstyle and so on. It, in fact, could have been a nice game... if it were about 5 times shorter and 10 times cheaper.One playthrough takes wa-a-a-y too long, even if you don’t take into account the possibility of your family dying out halfway through, which of course makes you start over, as there is only one save. For the first couple of hours planning on your family’s development, balancing between producing tokens, spending them and moving forward is interesting, even fascinating – due to the novelty of this experience, probably – but it gets old really fast.You rise up to the very top of your ancient society, become an ultimate ruler… and then the Age ends, and you find out that you have to do the same thing yet another time. And again, in the third Age. The art changes from Age to Age, the icons on the board change… everything else remains the same, over and over again. Once you start climbing up the social ladder during the third Age, the routine gets depressingly, brain-curdlingly repetitive and boring. The ruling mini-games are the only thing that is different among the three ages, and again, after you organize your city’s grain supplies for 30-odd turns, repeating the same set of actions…The title implies that the developer plans on continuing the series, this time showing the way of a family through the Middle Ages. If the sequel ever gets around to being released and it will be similar to this game in terms of game mechanics, well… I can only say that the developer is really, really optimistic if he plans to keep it up for all 7 steps.

7 Grand Steps: What Ancients BegatThis review was last edited when I had completed the gameShort ReviewA strategy based board style game which I found strangely addictive for around 10 hours game play before it started to get rather repetative. The suggested playtime of ~15 hours was about right for my completed game.Long ReviewAs many other reviewers have noted this is a difficult game to describe. I tried to write up a detailed description of the game but is was messy and made little sense :(The best I can say is that is like a board game where you are awarded tokens which you use to move around the ""board"" by matching the pictures on the tokens to the pictures on the ""squares"". Beads appear on the squares and you are awarded points for landing on squares with beads on. You accumulate points to progress in the game. The board is actually circular and you only see about a third  of it at a time, each turn involving the board rotating at least one ""square"". The board is made up of up to 3 separate ""rings"" and depending on your tokens and how you have progressed you can move between the different rings. You can only move clockwise by matching pictures but you can choose to move anti-clockwise by moving to the next square occupied by another character. Note that you generally have to keep moving clockwise to avoid being eaten by crocodiles which happens when you drop too anti-clockwise on the board.There is a background story generated as you play the game as you can marry, by landing on the same square as another character who is also available for marriage, have children, by landing on the same square as your partner (who you also control). Eventually your characters will die and you will need to nominate an heir at which point the board is redrawn. The game progresses through distinct phases called ages & a new age brings on a new board layout and the background story options change.The game is saved on exit, although note there is no cloud save!There is textual help which is fairly helpful although personally I found out how to play the game mainly by trial and error.ProsAddictiveEasy to play in short burstsConsRepetative towards the endOver longMarks Out Of 55) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted1) Not worth getting even if given away freePlatform Played OnIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, EasyAcc Mouse & Steelseries MERC keyboard.My best guess for a  PEGI Rating 3: I can't see any reason to raise it above this.

												What a strange and fascinating game...that was literally my first thought when playing this game and it still accurately describes what i think of it now.  Even after 20+ hours of gametime I cannot think of many other experiences as unique and interesting as 7 Grand Steps.But is it fun?  Yes...if you are into this sort of gameplay...which I now realize is probably difficult to pinpoint the audience for this game.  It is probably most accurately described as a storytelling boardgame that lets you build generations of your family trying to achieve advantages to overcome ""challenges of the age,"" which are basically disaster events that wipe out most everyone but you (if you pull it off).  Strangely enough, the gameplay sort of simulates the constant struggle of trying to stay ahead in society and still provide a better future for your children (basically by teaching them better than you were tought).  It works extremely well at keeping a feeling of tension and accomplishment throughout, and I found it pretty addicting.  It is definitely a game that warrants a few hours each time you play instead of one to two hours. However, my biggest complaint with the game is...the sequel.  Or rather the very low chance of getting one.  I would LOVE to see this game continue,  and I really hope it sees more attention.			"

												Strangely addicting board-game style play. I'd suspect that players who like board games, 4x games like Civ, or other slow-paced, time-to-make-decisions type strategy games would enjoy this as well. Going through all, I assume, seven ages is a daunting prospect. But I've had a lot of fun learning the system and clearing the first age.Edit: after looking at the store page and perusing some other reviews... $15 feels steep for this. Wait until it's on sale. This is worth a couple dollars to pick up on sale, or is a welcome gem among other bundle offerings. And yes, children will frustrate you to no end in this game. Sometimes you get a couple who is just exasperatingly fertile, and then you have to figure out what to do with all the extra mouths to feed. As I got further, I considered this part of the challenge of each generation and planned my pawn movements more carefully to try to avoid extra kids whenever I seemed to have a ""lucky"" couple.			"

												Feeling much like a board game it's highly addictive. Play various characters through family generations through the copper / bronze / iron etc ages. It reminds me of Shark Attack in that there is a rotating board and crocs, instead of a sharks, will eat your characters if you don't move ahead fast enough. You will explore various professions, need to raise children and upgrade their stats as you play as one of your children in the next generation.  Various challenges can mean the end of your family line if your stats are not high enough or you make the incorrect decisions. Adds a bit of a random element of danger in that the board game is happening to you, not you strong arming your way through. Definitely worth it.			"

												One of the most original games I've ever played. It's a a puzzler game mechanic used as a narrative device to explore and guide the progress of the story of a family and the society it lives within.As the famility and society evolves through the ages of antiquity the rules of the puzzler also evolve and seamlessly layers on more mechanics and complexities, always guided by what came before and building the story.The closest game I've played to it is probably King of Dragon Pass, a great game from the 90s, but only in the feel of crafting a story and history that is uniquely yours on every play, the gameplay has little similarity.This is a game you're almost certain to love, or to take a look at and think ""what's the point?"". If you love it, you'll get plenty of enjoyment from this quirky gem; and if you think ""what's the point?"", well... you've got no soul.			"

												A quite unique game with a strange combination of tactical board game and roleplay & story-telling. As first side, the game seems like a ""Monopoly"": you start by moving your character-token and gathering ressources (token and achievement points). But you'll quickly discover that the gameplay mecanism has quite some depth: how to optimize your itinerary by minimizing ressource-token used and by maximizing achievement points gain, how to use ""boost"" of movement etc etc... There are a lot of tricks that can give you some tactical advantage over AIs.However, this gameplay discover phase may take you 2 hours or so, and then you may start to feel some repetitiveness: the game has 3 main phases (copper age, bronze age and iron age), all of them have absolutely the same gameplay mecanism. The only thing that changes with the ages is the ""ruling game"", which you gain access by uplifting to the highest rank. Honestly for me, the ruling game is the true shining point of the game, they are kind of ""management & simulation"" like mini-games. I found them pretty well thought, as they fit very well to the historical aspects of each age.One major default is that the ""random side stories"" you can encounter. The problem is that... well they are random, but the pool of available events are extremely low... If you chain several ""heroic deeds"" quests, it's very likely you'll get the same story twice or more. For a game which is supposed to centered on developping a story of a clan/family, I found this very annoying.Overall, I rate this 7/10. Repetitiveness and the lack of variety in ""random events"" are the major default, but it is still worht playing if you seek an unique game with an enjoyable board-game gameplay and interesting story.

												You will like this game if you are into longterm strategy games like any of the sid meiers stuff, or table top strategy like risk. There's also a touch of ""choose your own adventure"" in there. Many seem put off by the price but I think it's quite fair. We've become so spoiled with our bundles and sales and have forgotten what games are really worth. A lot of time and effort has clearly gone into this game. There are many ways to progress in the game, many variables to consider, and a variety of different way the story may be told. You absolutely will get your $20 worth!It's really too bad the dev is busy on other projects right now instead of a part 2 but it's understandable considering his effort vs. reward for this game didn't pay off much. It seems to me this game has gone quite underappreciated. But don't let the lack of a second step deter you from this excellent game. In fact, buying it will make a sequal much more likely in the future! (just don't be holding you breath for one any time soon. Let's just hope within the next 5 years ;) )			"

												A really interesting game this. It's not at all a typical computer game, being mechanically very much inspired by euro-style boardgames, with some minimal systems based around the stock and flow of tokens that do a suprisingly good job of representing complex scenarios of social and economic status. Periodically you get a little story describing some challenge or incident of life in an ancient city-state and these help to flesh out the history of the family that you are steering through the ages - what narrative there is emerges from a combination of these vignettes and the story you tell yourself as you move your tokens (representing the patriarchs and matriarchs of your clan) around upon the ever revolving wheel, but the content provided by the game designer is minimal - a spur to imagination rather than providing a story to you on a plate.Going by what the designer has said, I have only played about the first third of this game and haven't graduated t the 'game of thrones' element that comes in to play once you get to the outside track of the wheel - so this review is really a preliminary impression. But so far I am really enjoying it.			"

												I like it. It's a nice, simple experience. It's also got simple, yet surprisingly deep mechanics and choices. ""Do I feed my children knowledge, or do I let them play because I can't do that AND stay alive."" Or ""Do I make tons of tokens with my spouse, and risk the chance of having more kids?"" It really does kind of get repetitive (in fact...really repetitive) after a while, however, until you get to royalty level. Then you actually have some nice choices to make with managing the country. One complaint is that you can't manage the country unless your primary character (the child you raised from the previous generation) moves, so you can't get the +1 research...But I guess it kinda makes since due to how that +1 research is explained, and it's not that big of a deal.What I REALLY don't like, however, is that all your story choices are made when you decide the character's personality, which is fine....I guess, because there are definite ""best"" responses to each event, and should you be able to choose it...well, you see where that goes. So, it's reasonable, doesn't mean I like it.But, by far, the worst part of it is the heroic challenge, when on the surface, they are a fun, pick your adventure sorta deal, 3/4 of the responses you are allowed result in either instant death with no recourse, or losing most of your currency, and with background information to guide your decision by you're blind guessing with a high likely hood of  horrible consequences. So, the decision making basically becomes a wikipedia search, and considering how much this game hates alt-tab, it's really inconvenient.So, it's good fun for a few hours, maybe slightly longer, but it definitely through bull cr*p at you for no real reason, and kills you or your children without any chance for choice or strategy...Take all this into account when trying to decide if you want to spend the money on it.

												A truly bizarre game, with very unique gameplay. However, it is very repetitive and far too easy to be interesting on the long scale. The main problem is that the game is cyclical, it is divided into several eras, each of which you try to climb to the top. On each era, there are four castes plus the ""king"". The four castes always play the same on each era, while the ""king"" gameplay is different, from holding your copper age city state(management), to your bronze age kingdom(conquest) to your iron age empire(senate). While the idea of different high level gameplay is intriguing, it's far too simplistic and easy. All said, I can't help but recommend this game, but realize that it is certainly not for everyone. The screenshots and video speak for themselves very well in this game.			"

It's lightweight, turn-based, isn't stupid ""new"" old school graphics, and allows the player to make a lot of choices. Nothing bad to be said of it really, I haven't encountered any glitches or bugs. So hey, if it's on sale definitely pick it up; if you get bored, you just put it away until next time.			"

												Ehh... this is really bare-bones for a $20 game, first of all. No animations, minimal art, practically a basic flash game. Presentation aside there still isn't much I found myself liking. It's a board game with a heavy strategy element, but far too heavy on luck elements as well. I felt pretty clueless playing at first, and doing the tutorial again/reading all the info helped a little but it stilll felt rather overwhelming with how little control I had towards the game's outcome. It's not very engaging, either, rather tedious without much to actually do. Drag tokens, hope you get a decent amount of tokens from ingots, read the occasional piece of story that you may have already seen before even without only 90 minutes of play time. Just not enjoyable. There's probably a crowd for this game but it certainly isn't me. Fortunately this game was in a humble bundle, I'd never buy it otherwise even at 80-90% off.			"

												7 Grand Steps is an intriguing board game with a very powerful flavor to it. Mainly its challenge comes from Risk Management. You get tokens which allow you to move to places and collect beads to attain a major advantage (e.g., advancing to a higher rank in society, being first-in on a new invention) over your fellow man. However, your tokens and the arrangement of the board are random, with certain predictable quantities (a character skilled in agriculture produces agriculture tokens). So you must balance social advancement against innovation against raising your children against the alligators waiting to slay you and the end of an era approaching.Compelling, despite its rather lackluster sell, is my point.

												Surprisingly addictive game where you play a family over multiple generations, trying to stay ahead of death, disease and poverty in the era where civilizations spread out of the Fertile Crescent.The graphics are in a simple but satisfying ""animated boardgame"" style, and key ""events"" in the lives of family members are played out as a series of choices in a narrative. Sometimes the ""right"" choice leads to bad outcomes, and the ""wrong"" choice to social advancement ---- just like real life!The story that builds really puts modern life in perspective. Marrying for love definitely took a backseat to marrying for the resources your prospective partner brought to the relationship in those times. Similarly, literally everything revolved around sacrificing as much as possible for your children; every inch of advancement you could buy them was worth it. And not just one child, but making sure you had a ""backup"" in case of misfortune. But don't spread yourself too thin! Sure children are free labor, but they are also mouths to feed...I got around 20 hours of fun with this -- so for me it was definitely worth the Steam Sale price I paid for it.			"

												Tl;dr: Weird but evocative.An interesting game that plays pretty much like a cross between a board game and a poker machine. The basic idea is that you try and elevate your family through ancient society to accept challenges related to technological discovery, prestige and heroism by gathering tokens and using them to advance yourself while educating your children - heavy stuff for what looks like on the surface to be a casual puzzle game.Some people have an issue with the random number generator suddenly throwing your family back amongst the peasants through misfortune, but I feel it encapsulates the idea of struggle - and once you get a feel for the best strategy you can reduce the likelihood of that happening. In one instance, the parents played favourites too often so the next generation was plagued by a sibling rivalrly when my useless brother kept stealing my tokens.If you get to the top rung it opens up another game-within-a-game depending on the era, at one point I was a general (and was really bad at it), on another playthrough I got to play senator with all the powerplays and shenanigans that involves.All the individual game elements are pretty basic but they form a quite evocative experience, much of this down to the excellent writing of the challenge scenarios. I should note that this is apparently the first of a series of games, so this particular episode stops kind of abruptly after a few eras with a ""to be continued"" placard. Even so, you might start off thinking it's a bit lame but then hours later...			"

												It's rare for a game to be so fascinating and yet so mind-numbingly boring at the same time.7 Grand Steps is not-so-secretly two games in one. There is a choice-driven narrative, and a kind of token- and pattern-driven board game.The narrative is the fascinating part. It tells the story of your family line spanning dozens of generations; these small vignettes give the world flavor and gives you tiny hints of insight into the larger culture surrounding your family. The problem is, to get to these vignettes you have to play the board game. And the board game is... not great. There's some good allegory here - you're almost literally ""keeping up with the Joneses"", as it were, making kids and earning coin. But the actual mechanics of it make it a chore - I spent a lot of time simply muddling around on the board and not actually accomplishing much for my troubles. Sure, you'll get those short vignettes for your trouble, but they are few and far between. Making matters worse is when you finally get to a new generation and the narrative you get is a rather floral description of how badly you goofed up in raising a kid in the board game.Even putting aside the price (as I got this game in a bundle) I ultimately felt this game didn't respect my time.

												This is an interesting game. The way you have to make trade-offs with the tokens regarding your current life vs your children's lives, and the way you have to juggle your children overall, are really good metaphors for their real life counterparts. Also the fact that each generation struggles regardless of the prosperity of the previous one due to new technology is well-conveyed. I can however see why this might not be fun for everyone. I got this game in a bundle, and I'm happy with it. The full asking price does seem a bit much though, maybe wait for a sale if you're on the fence.			"

The dialog is terrible and the ""choices"" you have to make have NO logic to them, it might as well be a coin toss - and that's the main problem with this game it's based too much on luck.

												This is a charming and deceptively simple game that I really enjoyed playing.  The game mechanic is straightforward: generate tokens that enable you to progress around life's wheel. The subtlety lies in the tiny decisions you make which gradually drive the longer narrative of the game. Every turn of the wheel could raise you up or bring your family's fortunes crashing down.

												This is a strangely addictive game with an excellent and original premise.However, it eventually becomes repetitive, at which point one notices little flaws, like an event system that seems to be based on choice but is actually based on random chance.Still recommended, if only because there ought to exist more games like this one.

However, you will find this an excellent game to explore - to see if you have what it takes to survive all the ages without a cheat sheet - as the randomness embedded in the game really brings it to life.

												This game came with a Humble Bundle a while back. It was downloaded and installed only to get the Steam cards. It's good it didn't cost anything really, because the game is not that good. Not only is this game almost completely reliant on luck, it's really boring. This game is sort of like a single player board game, with a bit of ""Choose your own ending"" story telling. The story telling is kind of funny, but not very memorable. The animation looks like it's from the early 90's, so why does this retail on Steam for $20? I only played for about two hours, but it was just so boring I didn't feel like playing after I got the cards. The worst part about this game is, when you lose the game just closes. There is no option to start a new game, the game just shuts down...I'm glad the couple pennies I probably spent on this went to charity, instead of to the developers.			"

												Simply put, one of the most addictive games I've played in a long time. Once I started playing, I could not stop.It's deceptively simple, and it is simple, but the stories and the work it takes to raise many generations, one after the other, emotionally invests you in the characters like no other strategy game I've played. You will find yourself rooting for them, cursing at them, and risking parents' life and limb just so your children can have a better education. Hopefully, their better position will translate to even more wealth and education in the next generation. The whole mechanic of generations of family means you constantly strive to improve each new generation before it dies off and you are left with nothing, or worse, stupid kids that can't support themselves.The random event system can feel unfair at times, or worse repetitive. Many of those events need to have options where you can decide your own fate. Instead, they make you suffer pre-ordained setbacks or reward you with undeserved wealth. This is the weakest part of the game.For its addictive, pleasantly immensely surprising fun, I highly reccomend this game.			"

Also I don't think going for a hero is worth it unless your just starting. Doesn't carry over through the ages whereas if you become a noble or royalty that normally will carry over if you don't screw up much. And invention is cool but it just gives you 10 of what ever token you discovered. My suggestion is either go straight for social climbling or do a hero one first. Overall its a decent game and I would say give it a shot.  Get it on sale if you can though.			"

It is a cross between a board game, a stratgey game, and a choose your own adventure of sorts. I highly recommend this game if you enjoy making choices that directly effect a story and the outcome of the storyline. Every full playthrough will yield a completely different story. This is the only game of its kind I have ever had the pleasure of playing. It WILL suck you in for hours at a time! Def. lives up to the ""just one more turn..."" hype.			"

												This is a charming and deceptively simple game that I really enjoyed playing.  The game mechanic is straightforward: generate tokens that enable you to progress around life's wheel. The subtlety lies in the tiny decisions you make which gradually drive the longer narrative of the game. Every turn of the wheel could raise you up or bring your family's fortunes crashing down.

												They've done a pretty OK job at showing how much life must have sucked back then, but if it were really representative, upward social mobility would be a lot harder. This is the kind of game where you're almost expected to fail. The kind of game that'll look at you weirdly if you win and ask ""How did you get here? All of your kids were supposed to be eaten by cows somehow. Did you hack?"" And you'd say ""Yep."" Like playing monopoly during the great depression, or an MMORPG without any NPCs or quests, you're trying to create a family dynasty in a world where noone seems to know what is happening or what they're doing.

												NOTE: The recommendation is tentative, since it is a very limited game but does have its merits provided one likes the token-mechanic or the overall aesthetics, and only applies to the game being on sale.PRO: very appealing artstyle and layout unique mechanics and presentation fitting musical score and ambient sound effectsCON: limited gameplay options, making for a repetitive experience and hurting replayability limited customisation and roleplay options limited transparency regarding interactions of other characters [children, other families], making it difficult to plan ahead repetitious random events, even at my fairly low playing time too expensive for what it providesA very unique game, especially in its presentation. You play by moving figurines along a rotating board, forced to keep moving clockwise before you get eaten by the crocodiles behind you, but the figurines can only be moved with the usage of tokens, indicating by their marking what field to move onto. Since you are playing through an entire period, you need to get a husband/wife and have up to seven children, who are not playable themselves [but can be selected as such once the current generation dies through crocodiles or old age] but can be levelled up - allowing them to produce more tokens. The children you don't chose as heirs can be used as restart points when your current line dies, providing for a very creative and well-integrated sort of checkpoint system.The 'progression' of the game is achieved by setting one of three goals that equate to collecting a certain amount of beads, strewn about on the board. Depending on what your goal is, you can benefit from various effects once they are achieved, such as changing the board to your favour by invalidating tokens of a now outdated kind. There is urgency here, too, since other families are progressing alongside you [though as far as I could see there is no way of telling where they stand or even how many there are] and can snatch awards away from you, making the game suddenly a lot harder.There is a degree of deliberation in the token use and all strategy and engagement comes from this, but there are quite a lot of factors that are not in your control. The movement of the characters takes a while to get used to and invite a few lost turns near the beginning. But most egregious are the random events that are designed to shape your individual story. I wish I could say I liked them, since I'm generally very partial to flourishes of this kind, but I don't think they are handled very well. They can be beneficial or detrimental [to the point of killing you], are not necessarily linked to previous decisions and tend to repeat often, despite the circumstances being quite specific. In some cases, however, they fit nicely to the development path you've chosen, showing off a great side of the game and making it feel like an actual sensation of individual progression through history. Which is immediately lost when a bit later the exact same event occurs again. Also, after every generation you can chose an attribute to accompany your character [things like ""the generous""], but from what I've seen so far this has little impact on the game's random events, which is a huge shame.There are consequences to your actions too, aside from running out of tokens or dying to the crocodiles, particularly in how you level your children. If you have many, you probably can't afford to treat them all the same, making them hostile to each other. There seems to be a high degree of randomness here too, since I've seen siblings get along fine despite being treated differently, and siblings hating each other even though I simply gave them different types of tokens. One of these sibling feuds was so bad that when I took over one child for the next generation, her sister - who hated her - barged into the game through random events CONSTANTLY [approx every six turns] and always made me loose a substantial amount of tokens. There was nothing I could do to prevent this, no way to change the relationship [since the sister was no longer on the board] and since I didn't understand the hatred in the first place it felt like a cheap way to make the game more challenging or 'dramatic'. And that is the biggest gripe of the game in my opinion; You have very little impact. A lot of things are out of your control, you can only try and stay on top of things. I'm sure this was intended to some extent [the families are, in a sense, expendable after all], but for a game that also tries to focus on a story development aspect it is very underwhelming. Though it may seem otherwise, you are not playing as characters, you are managing tokens. The lack of RP elements which I was, perhaps falsly, expecting makes the game quite one-sided to me and doesn't help its replayability. I'm sure mastery of the game's tactical side can be intriguing to some, but to me the tactical aspect seems underdeveloped and too much outside of your control [a staple of many board games, tbh].The game revolves around one single game mechanic and a gimmicky but not unappealing presentation. You need to try and stay ahead of the game, hoping that random events or decisions aren't too much to your detriment, and trudge along collecting as many beads as possible. If the mechanics sound appealing or the graphics enjoyable, it may well be worth the investment provided it is on sale [the asking price is way to high]. But if neither of those seem worthwhile, stay far away from this game.I myself have had a decent time with it and I might even come back to it at a later date. But for now, the monotony of the experience and the limited strategic impact combined with the hardly at all present customisation of characters were enough to prevent me from revisiting it quite yet.

												It's hard to describe this game. You start off as a poor guy looking to climb the social ladder with a little luck and a lot of strategy. Sometimes the game gives you choices to make and the outcome can either drive you forward or lead you back to a lower part of the social wheel. One of the weirdest parts of the game is trying to not have too many children with your spouse because if you end up ignoring one of the kids (which you kind of have to considering there is a finite amount of resources you can collect) they can come back and really ruin your life. The decisions you make in the present have impact on what happens in the future so you're constantly having to weigh the pros and cons of what you want chips you want to collect. Even after playing it for a multitude of hours I'm still learning new strategies. I've only made it to the top of the social ladder once and that was only for a very brief moment haha. It has a lot of replay value and I've gone through it at least 5 or 6 times trying to get a new outcome each time. Very fun and easy to play for small chunks of time.			"

And that's just it. It feels more like a mechanical board game. And I say ""mechanical"" as in you drop tokens into slots to create effects.

												Here's the thing. You pretty much have to review a game at the full price. That's the value of the game in the eyes of the publisher.In that case, 7 Grand Steps fails utterly.Graphics, audio, story, documentation. No aspect or combination is worth the full price.The game concept and overall execution isn't bad, but suffers from simply pretending to be more than it is. A lack of documentation that serves to feign complexity.Example: You're given 4 questions with 4 options each. The degree of success determines how well you will do in the new age, while complete failure will outright kill the character. That sounds fair.However, picking the exact same options on a second playthrough might result in different results. Why? The stats or family of the character? The reputation of the character? Wealth of the character? Any missions undertaken by the character? Pure chance, possibly with a greater chance of success for certain options?Yeah, good luck figuring it out, because the game doesn't tell you. Initially that is of little consequence, but it becomes more important as the game proceeds through the ages.Overall, not recommended. Perhaps on a 90% sale, if you can handle the frustration.Look at earlier Mousechief games, that have a good deal more to offer.			"

It's not very challenging (made it to the highest social class before the end of the first age), and its actually pretty difficult to lose if you know how to play.Not worth $20 by any means. It should be priced around $5, and even then it'd still be worth $2 or $3.			"

												Very interesting and original board game...Pros:+ Original concept+ Clever mechanics+ Many things to discover+ FunCons:- Solving ""wtf is that?"" is a somewhat long process- Price tag is absurdFinal verdict:An original, fun board game to kill some time (*cough* if you grab it on discount *cough*).

												7 Grand Steps: What Ancients Begat seems like the love child of slot machines and board games.With innovative concepts and a unique takes on a board game, this game felt like a breath of fresh air amongst the current boardgames in the market. This game however, fails to achieve what it sets out to do.The game play revolves around inserting coins into slots which in turn moves your pieces on the board. While doing a single action repetitively is understandable given that it is a boardgame in nature, the premise of translating said actions into creating your own story pretty much boils down to generic random sequencing that gets very repetitive.You basically control a family in the ancient times and make decisions for them that reflect the major moments of their life. These major moments, while exciting at first glance, was just a shell of excuses to progress each of the individuals that will eventually die. This will trigger you to select a new character, whom will re-perform said actions. On theory, the fact that one could have mortal enemies that transcend many generations as well as skill-transfers that convoy the meaning of family heritage can tingle one's senses, but the execution underlying the principles of the game is just poor. When you realize all that remains in the core of the game is naught but a series of random events that was not well executed, the illusion shattered and the exhilaration is replaced into mundane, unimportant choices that you need to repeat for centuries. Basically a dead boardgame that you might play one more run just to scrape the last pieces of meat under the skin, but certainly not one you would dare to turn on the third time. Keep your $20.			"

												Good mechanics, but bad storytelling.  You want to buy this game because it seems like it'll pioneer choose-your-own-adventure storytelling into a strategy game, but it ultimately fails.  The CYOA is often linear and random in that you don't even get to choose among options or the options you choose among don't have sensible consequences.  Furthermore, if you try to influence those consequences through preparation, your preparation doesn't seem to help.  I played the game up through the Bronze Age's ""Challenge of the Age"", and had to stop because of this.  After invading all of my neighbors for 20 turns straight and improving my cities infrastructure and roads, I died because my invading forces fell apart and couldn't regroup despite how I previously got the regular army upgrade.  In other words, everything I did up to that point was completely meaningless.  Yea, I could have taken the conservative route, but I thought my mechanical preparation would have made that unnecessary.  On top of that, in the Copper Age, I took the conservative route in the ""Challenge of the Age"" when subduing colonies that weren't tributing resources any longer, yet that penalized me by making the invasion of my main enemy more difficult since it had more time to prepare.This ignores other problems like how the king gave me only so much time to ""conquer a city"", but despite how I won so many invasions where I got sued for peace, the king still didn't recognize my conquests and even ridiculed me instead.  Other times, the king would build me monuments but still keep the clock ticking.I mean the mechanics in the lower three social tiers are easy enough to grasp as long as you play a balanced strategy between using the ingot to get more tokens versus jumping on victory point chips to achieve heroics, discoveries, and social status.  Don't breed too many children either or else you'll end up with sibling rivals in the next generation who make your life a pain.  You can be sure of this by using the ingot back and forth between your partners in moving backwards to make more tokens while the other one gets victory point chips......but ultimately, the storytelling just falls flat.  Decisions don't make sense.  Sometimes, you don't even get to make a decision, and half the time, the story doesn't even seem important.  This especially happens when choosing a personality for your next generation after finishing a rite of passage.  What's the difference in the game between being virtuous versus benevolent or miserly versus petty?  The game is never clear about this.All and all, interesting concept, but poor execution.___________EDIT:  I have since completed the game since my last playthrough had a dimwit sibling, so the game let me play as him (or her since I don't remember).  Luckily, I managed to get a lot of tokens by playing the ingot over and over, so my next generation lead the country to success......upon which I became a hermit shepherd who never got married and had to start over in the bronze age again......so I did, and again became a shepherd, but got married and had too many kids that constantly got in fights, but I eventually managed to reach the ruler class in the iron age anyway.The game ended with the empire splitting up after I consolidated all the power of the (Roman) Senate, and my family forgotten in the original part while remembered widely in the new part......and then the game tells you there will be a part 2 and that your family's history is saved in your documents folder......except it wasn't.  :-\The Iron Age ruling period is weird since you have to vote for bills alongside your political party to maintain support among constituents even if the empire suffers.  My party got so small at one point though that I had more politicians supporting me than my party size was, so I had no idea how to vote.  Thankfully, I finished the game before getting removed from power and dumped back into the noble class.I dunno about you, but the game seems like it needs a lot of work to me.			"

												Obligatory: ""I wish there was a neutral rating""...I bought this game as part of a bundle, so I paid nowhere near the $20 asking price.At the much lower price I paid, I am happy with it, and not the least bit disappointed.But I could never recommend somebody buy this game at full price.It is an interesting game experience, and I was taken in by the mechanical board game aesthetic.It is a challenging game experience, as well, where feeling like you're actually doing well seems to always be just out of reach.  (even when you seem to be doing very well, the rug can come out from under you pretty quickly)Overall, it has a lot of potential, but the goals of the game need clearer bench marks to make the experience fully satisfying.The game mechanics, themselves, are incredibly addicting, with a ""just one more turn of the wheel"" sort of drive behind it.But an addicting game without the clearer goals I've mentioned just can't be recommended for the price.If you see it on sale, buy it.If not... wait.

I was not very appeal to the stories. The idea of generations is nice but fall a little short. It is quite hard to understand what control you have and if events are consequences of your choices or not. And, it's not related enough to what happen on the board. Nothing really make you relate to your family. It's a little nicer once you can do government choices but this only happend very late on the game.The game is relly to slow. I found the graphisms quite nice but really boring- it's always the same. The failur reasons and macanisms are nice though.

It is well done in the way you interact with it, but it feels like it should come in an nice wrapped up cartonage with the picture of an family playing the game on top of it. Than go fold the tablet get the dices and the event-cards and play some nice 7 Grand Steps.The big flaw of this game is, that it comes as an singleplayer, meh.And after 12 times of ""There is an old man who tells tales if you give him some tokens."" you kind of feel as if the writers of the game want to abandon you as well.4/10 Is anyone out there?!

Boared GamesYeah, you read right.This game is actually started only sometimes, because it wears you off quite fast. It is more like one of those mechanical board games, that were the rage at some time or another.Actually those games are of limited use, they weren't real classics like Ludo, Mallefiz, Monopoly and such. Because they often were very delicate, fragile and often broke down when a kid handled them too rough. Often the tin miniatures were torn off, because those things weren't handled with utmost care.I personally don't like these games, they are far to fragile for a guy like me... at least now, as kid, well another matter.So no recomendation for this game, though it is graphically not so bad it's lacking the long term motivation to play it over any extend of time.

												An interesting and incredibly artistic experiment that fails as a fun game to play. Unique and intriguing but ultimately not fun.One part CYOA interactive fiction, one part resource management sim and one part token board game. Ultimately, it is fun to look at and interact with but entirely too random and without any way for the player to meaningfully affect things. It is far too easy to be set up to lose a generation and therefore need to start over simply by the initial tokens given, or by random events that arise through the course of play (particularly in the CYOA parts). Simply put, the game is too random and gives the player no real way of counteracting a bad roll of the dice with either skill or proper planning.Given that it was supposed to be part of a series, which the author has since decided not to do, it is another mark against actually purchasing or playing it.

												There isn't much to be said about this game other than it is quite...boring. It's pretty much playing slots without the anticipation of hitting a lucky '777'. The problem being (in my opinion), the lack of importance in your choices. For the short amount of time I played, I felt that all I was doing was progressing my characters' lives, trying for babies, training my kids, and most of all, wasting my coins. The game never congratulates you and none of my actions seemed to make a real difference. It's like watering a flower that will never bloom until maybe the end of summer, in which it would promptly die the next day. Oh, and don't think this game is even a little bit of an RPG because it is not. The 'choices' you make for your characters really don't alter anything short term, and also the fact that your characters are simple board pieces makes them even more unimportant, making the player not really care what happens to them.I will recommend this game only to old people and maybe people that are very patient with these type of 'board games'. To everyone else, I suggest looking elsewhere for a good board game RPG.			"

												7GS is first and foremost a strategy-heavy game, reminiscent of a board game. So from the get-go it is not going to be for everyone. Speaking personally, I couldn't get into it.It requires you to collect ""tokens"", which allows you to move your family around a wheel, which represents life. Or something. Going off the main description given on the game's store page, I can say that only the ""Core Mechanic"" is accurate. Yes, it doesn have other things as described under the ""Family Drama"" heading, but I didn't really see how that fit into the game at all, other than some textual prompts.Also, the game seems highly repetitive. You move round the wheel, and every now and then a new age comes along, letting you advance slightly further. Again, maybe if you're into strategy games this is a good thing. I don't know. But it didn't immediately strike me as being overly interesting.			"

												I admit that I didn't play the game for a long time. The concept is ok. It's casual. You put coins to your family members to either move them to collect beads or make them grow (and love). You have choices to make and have to make your way through against rivalries (other families). I find the pacing of the game slow and repetitive. Well, at the beginning, you're kind of really not sure of what you're doing.			"

												Board, yes. Game, not so much.An extremely simplistic ""board game"" that consists of just dragging coins to slots...over and over and over. It didn't seem possible to fail and my entire gaming experience consisted of repeating the same action continuously. It got boring extremely fast.PROS: -Art style is ""ok""-Includes a textbook of rules....but who wants to read that?CONS:-Price is WAY TOO HIGH. Even if you actually enjoyed this game, its worth $5ish at best.-Simplistic and *extremely repetitive* game mechanic. -Nothing to keep your interest (no narrative, graphics, storytelling, nor engaging game mechanics here)-No  atmosphere/ambiance.-Many mechanics are just thrown at you and seem to have barely any influence on the game at all (such as peers/neighbors). and last but not least....-Even the DEVS are ""burned out"" of this game and are making a totally unrelated game for their next project rather than continuing this series (good decision!)I really can't recommend this title at any price, but certainly not at an  insulting $20.

												The idea of this game is neat. It really is. A board game style game of family progression sounded fun.But that's where the good things end. About 3 or 4 hours into a game the gameplay is clunky and insanely repetitive. I was determined to finish a game before I wrote a review, but I don't see the point. Always having to drag the coins into slots is clunky and takes too long. There is no character variability, as the initiation stories quickly repeat themselves and have little substance. I was playing this while watching TV and I still managed to get bored out of my mind...It's a shame because there was an interesting idea here that was utterly wasted.			"

Another time my main character (with 4 x AA skills) was killed shortly after getting married so I was suddenly left with only his D rated wife and 1 child. Other times for no explicable reason no one will marry your character so your line just dies out - you get to choose an RP reason why the character didn't get married, but that still means lose the character you invested heavily in. Depnding what backup children you have you may have to revert back several generations or play with an underskilled main character.

												3.5/10. The gamemakers claim this is an interesting tale of families and dynasties with multi-layered gameplay and board-game like mechanics. In reality it is a game about game pieces moving on a quarter wheel using tokens, to keep away from crocodiles,  to pick up beads, to make tokens, to make kids that you give tokens to, to increase their token making abilities in order to level up from getting beads. The story is delivered in tiny random pieces that are really boring. The game is super repetitive and the only thing that changes from leveling up and moving to a different tier of the board is there are more symbols of tokens you can make. The makers claim 15 hours of gameplay, but I was already bored after 30 minutes, I can’t imagine sinking that much time into it. Instead of actually playing like a fun interesting board game, it plays like a casual budget game. There really is no incentive, because you’re just going to do the same thing with your kids that you did with your parents before. There really isn’t much of an element of surprise, besides the random shadow people that move around the board. The game talks about all these choices and decisions, which basically boils down to: do you want to make tokens or move, and which space will your person move to based on the tokens you have, and which ability you want to level up in your child. I guess it never gets old that everybody bangs everybody almost every turn. The best part is the price of the game is 20 dollars, which is absolutely hilarious, as it is honestly worth about 2 dollars. Buy this game if it goes 90% off and if every other game on steam is out of stock.			"

												7 Grand Steps is sorta like a board game/strategy hybrid. You move you character to spots on the wheel, depending on what card you use. You can marry, have kids, discover new things to advance your civilization. There really isn't much to it and it doesn't really feel like you gain anything when you discover new advances in civilization, so it's pretty shallow.However, it's a fun little time killer if you're bored, but you don't want to get wrapped up in a more involving game. I would say get it, but the regular price is $19.99. For a game with little depth, I can't recommend it at that price. If you can get it in a bundle or on the cheap, get it, however paying $20 for this game would be criminal.			"

												7 Grand Steps: What Ancients Begat first impressions after 2 hours.This is a good game, however I can't recommend it.Please hear me out.This game is a computerised board game, the advertising boasts that it is part board game, part real time strategy and part interactive novel. I guess they are somewhat correct, but the ratio is more like  95:1:4.The board game part of this game works like a dynasty simulation. You start off as an adult of very low social standing and have to find a partner and have a child to continue the blood line. The board  is like a big disc with 4 rings on it, and you start at the lower ring. Most of the disc is off screen but you see from the 3rd quarter to about 3 O' clock.  There are crocodiles just below the disc and after each turn it rotates around, moving all the playing pieces with it. If you get nommed by the crocs then your character dies. The board has these symbols on it and you gain tokens throughout that you spend to move your pawn to the next segment with that same symbol. There are also other pawns on the board that the computer controls.When the new generation starts the first thing that you really need to do is find a partner and start raising a family. This is important as the disc eventually runs out of segments and only a new generation can start on the reset disc. You also want to do this early because each turn you can give the child a movement token to train them in that profession. When your 2 married pawns are on the same space then a little flame comes up which allows them to try for a baby. This seems to have a very high chance of success, at least 3/4. The other way to bring about children is “accidentally”. If you run out of tokens you can instruct your pawn to generate more. This makes them fall back towards the crocodiles but they will be “caught” by another pawn assuming that there is one between them and death. Based on the skills they have been taught as a child they will have a chance to generate new tokens based on each of the labours that they have trained. If you are caught by your spouse that is optimum as they can both generate tokens meaning you will get a higher yeild, but after work they get in the mood if you know what I mean and you have about a 25% chance of having another baby. Children are a real problem. The most optimum solution is to have one and only one because it is in your best interests to spoil that child rotten with tokens so you will have a powerful pawn for the next generation. The game adamantly warns you about having a “favourite” as the children will get pissy with each other if there is a golden child, but really the benefit outweighs the risks with that. I understand that it is a board game and you have to use your imagination, but the families are so similar and you go through so many generations that they become so bland and are almost interchangable. I got to about generation 7 on my play through and I can guarantee that if I was to take a break and you hacked the game so that I was playing generation 3 pawns, I would not notice. This is where the interactive novel part of the game comes in though, as your children are given a few tidbits of backstory as they grow up, it says if they are playing nicely or breaking each others toys, unfortunately that's about all it says, the interactive novel is surprisingly repetitive. Later on they may annoy you as adults but the most they can do is remove a few of your tokens and they will do that at most two or three times per generation, but it is much more powerful to generate new ones with a buffed spoilt golden child then it is to have a half cocked character with a little insurance.If this were a real board game then the families would feel like this for sure, but that's not really an excuse. Don't get me wrong, I adore board games, I prefer spending time around a board game with friends then any computer game (although there's still over 500 left to review at time of writing so I might end up eating those words) and I understand that this is a dynasty simulation and in real life you would not be like this towards your children, but you are most likely a gamer like me, and you want to win. This isn't like the sims where you can see an abused child crying, every 10 or so turns you might get a small text box that says she had a crappy day but really that is your only motivation for caring for them outside of your own imagination. I think the object of the game is to become the ruler of the bronze age, not that it tells you that until the late game. You see, there are mini objectives that you choose to fulfil, these are a choice of a heroic deed, an invention or an upgrade in social class. When you have chosen your mission you try and pick up a certain number of beads that are on board segments, the npcs can take them too though.A heroic deed is a gamble. You are given a text based multiple choice quiz and you will try to come out with more beads than you lose, unfortunately the text is extremely vague and it ends up being just luck if you choose the right things. I had one where I had to write a book, at the end it asks if I should give it to the mayor, a scholar, a priest who trains scholars or bury it. I gave it to the priest who told me it was crap and that was that. An invention will replace a certain segment with a more upgraded version, I.e masonry becomes arch building. As the inventor you get a load of that token. This is quite a tactical decision to make because it will obsolete everything you have taught your child of that profession, but it can give you a boost in movement and training. Its a real pain if an npc does it though as you not only lose your obsolete tokens but you don't gain an of the new type. And this is really a problem because as you raise through social status jobs less befitting of you are slowly lost from your bloodline, which actually happens quite organically which I thought was a nice touch. And finally there is a raise in social status, this allows your pawn to advance to the ring above it where you can learn new trades and have a much better quality of life. I managed to get to the highest ring which made me a very noble person, so much so that I had responsibilities for the community. This however was incredibly confusing to me as suddenly I had 4 sliders I needed to keep in check. They had something to do with the amount of farms that the city builds and how many tokens I can skim off the top in bribes but the game didn't explain it very well and I just kept clicking okay on the default one. At the end of each turn I was getting a boat load of tokens and getting some very vague text box like the villagers are working hard, or the villagers are content. Unfortunately though, ♥♥♥♥ing bandits came and burned the entire city down!? o.OWas this my fault. I guess I will never know. This demoted my character back onto ring 3 giving me a massively long quest to grind up again to have another go. It was at this point I closed the game and wrote this review.Now call me thick for not knowing how to balance this game properly, and yeah you are right. I'm an inexperienced noob but I don't really feel like taking the time to master this. Maybe you would. To me the game isn't quite as arty as it thinks it is. I wouldn't go as far to say it is pretentious but I would hear you out if you told me you did. The story is just too vague and brief and could really do with fleshing out way way more in order to train the player a little more. Some of it is pretty interesting though like when you mouse over the crocodiles and they tell you what each represents.I realise that I have complained a lot but the game does have some really good parts too. First of all. It is fun. It is time eating fun. I played it for 2 hours without realising how much time has passed which actually kind of shocked me. The style, graphics and sound effects are really quite lovely and fit			"

												7 Grand Steps is a fun game for a few hours. I would recommend it if it is on sale. The basic game play is a mix between puzzle and an adventure game in the sense that you make choices which enhance or inhibit the development of characters. You follow a family through various ages and through various ranks in the ancient world. I would recommend the game more if there were other steps, but c'est la vie!			"

												It's an interesting concept, with compelling storytelling, and a decent single-player boardgame like expereince. That being said this is just part 1 (of seven??? it's not really clear what if any additional games this dev is working on), so this game is relatively short. The game has a lot of potential for additional expansions, but for now it's rather short. If you like boardgames, and you're looking for something (as in litterally anything) to fill time with, buy this game on sale. And definitly keep an eye out to see where the dev takes this idea in the future.			"

												A board-game inspired ""stay ahead of the crocodile"" romp using actual historic periods and odd little ""choices"" which mostly only give you one option. Unfortunately, it's utterly mindless despite the interesting premise; this game quickly becomes move-feed-repeat as soon as you get the hang of the mechanics. If it was a half-hour diversion that would be fine, but a full playthrough of all ages is a 6+ hour slog, clicking the same things over and over. Within a half an hour the story elements will start repeating.There is no strategy at all, and the tactics all basically boil down to ""grab the big disks ASAP"" and hope the random number generator gods aren't against you. If you end up weak in one area, there's almost no way to recover for several entire generations, which should add to the strategy, but instead only makes it annoying. You can't ally, you can't trade. Whether you have lots of kids or one doesn't really change anything, except lots of kids means wasting lots of coins (either from feeding them or from petty jealousy). Kids on lower levels learn plenty without coins, but on higher levels are dumb as a post without spending heavily. Of course, the AI is dumb and always gets itself killed. The final ""upper society"" game introduces some completely new mechanics, but is still very basic and nearly impossible to win. Then you restart the next age back like before.Sure, you might enjoy exploring for an hour or more, but it's hard to justify paying much for such a repetitive game.			"

												This game starts off mildly entertaining but only it took me 15 minutes to start finding it boring and repetitive. They made a good effort at storytelling but the actual gameplay was too dull for me to care much about the plot. You put tokens into slots to move your characters across a board, raising children along the way (by putting tokens into slots) to repeat the process with. I suppose if you enjoy putting tokens into slots this is the game for you.I got it in a bundle and will probably play it now and then when I need to kill a very short amount of time, but it's not worth even half of the regular price.

												This should have been a quirky gem, but it's ruined by bad art and a terrible interface. You're usually moving a husband and wife around the board, and it is RIDICULOUS how needlessly difficult it is to tell their stylized figures apart. The symbols that are used on the board and tokens are glorified squiggles that already difficult enough to tell apart, but if one of your characters is unlikely to produce a type of token, that face is indicated by showing a TINY, illegible version of the token. To be fair, there is a subtitle shown underneath to tell you that that particular tiny gold dot means that you have almost no chance of making a Masonry token (as opposed to that other tiny gold dot that means you're terrible at making Irrigation tokens) but how did the game get published like this? How did the other people listed in the credits not sit the creator down and tell him that it was an AWFUL idea to indicate token probability by shrinking his squiggle-tokens down to the point that HE NEEDED TO ADD SUBTITLES SO YOU COULD TELL WHICH IS WHICH?!

												Since I like boardgames, I thought I was going to like this game, but in the end I was dissapointed. It just lacked immersion, and the mechanics can become reptitive that it ends up becoming a grinding slog.In this game, you try to advance through the board , which in this game is a wheel, using tokens, which you produce by moving backwards, If the wheel ends up dragging you to the wrong end, your character gets eaten by crocodiles.No, you dont lose the game when that happens, instead you continue with a child-heir of yours, or if you don't have any, a past sibling.The problem here is that, it is too much luck based, you don't know what tokens you are going to get, and there is a real good chance that you are going to run out of tokens, which means bye-bye and say hello to the crocodiles. This happens especially if you don't get married early, and the matter of you getting married is again dependent on chance and luck.And if you don't have children, as I have stated above, you continue with a past sibling of yours, which means you will go back a generation. In my case, I was already in the iron age, but went back to the bronze age. This made me stop playing, As it really felt that the game was never going to end.Also, the writing which is supposed to bring depth, story, and immersion is weak and uninspired, and most of the time lacking in context - I'm a doctor? no? then a potter? not really, so what am I really? - Such basic questions, the game often fails to answer.If you like games like checkers or maybe go. You might like this game, but for those seeking for an immersive saga through the ages, like me, we are better off looking someplace else.			"

												This is an unusual game, with an interesting concept, clever writing and a lot of emergent storrytelling, making you feel for your pawns like if you were really watching unique livestories of real people. However, it has a fatal flaw: it's way too repetitive, slow and tedious. I would have recommended the game if a playthrough lasted 2, 3, 4 hours... But 15 hours of nothing but throwing tokens into slots is ridiculous. On such a scale lives of your individual pieces become insignificant and forgettable. What the game lacks is a blitz option where every round and every generation counts.			"

It hides its shallowness well, and while it’s hilariously easy to game the system at later stages, it’s not particularly obvious at first. Normally that would be enough to recommend, but then I checked the price tag. And f*cking Christ, I paid 20 Euro for this? I don’t know what I was thinking. This is not a 20 Euro game, this is a 5 Euro game at best. Paying anything more than that is clearly getting ripped off.  So just keep that in mind.  "

												7 Grand Steps is an amusing little game and I had tons of fun with it. It hides its shallowness well, and while it’s hilariously easy to game the system at later stages, it’s not particularly obvious at first. Normally that would be enough to recommend, but then I checked the price tag. And f*cking Christ, I paid 20 Euro for this? I don’t know what I was thinking. This is not a 20 Euro game, this is a 5 Euro game at best. Paying anything more than that is clearly getting ripped off.  So just keep that in mind.  "

												This should have been a quirky gem, but it's ruined by bad art and a terrible interface. You're usually moving a husband and wife around the board, and it is RIDICULOUS how needlessly difficult it is to tell their stylized figures apart. The symbols that are used on the board and tokens are glorified squiggles that already difficult enough to tell apart, but if one of your characters is unlikely to produce a type of token, that face is indicated by showing a TINY, illegible version of the token. To be fair, there is a subtitle shown underneath to tell you that that particular tiny gold dot means that you have almost no chance of making a Masonry token (as opposed to that other tiny gold dot that means you're terrible at making Irrigation tokens) but how did the game get published like this? How did the other people listed in the credits not sit the creator down and tell him that it was an AWFUL idea to indicate token probability by shrinking his squiggle-tokens down to the point that HE NEEDED TO ADD SUBTITLES SO YOU COULD TELL WHICH IS WHICH?!

												Hmmm, tricky review.As preembl, let me mention I like text-based games/RPGs quite fine, f.e. CKII, FTL, Long Live the Queen, etc.This game is a really interesting mix of gamble, boardgame and afromentioned text-based RPG. The gameplay is a bit complex to understand at first, but you quickly get into it (definitely not because of the tutorial though).However, the text-based parts quickly repeat themselves, even within a game time of just a couple minutes. This especially goes for 'rite's, which occur every generation... and there is exactly 1 rite per class/gender.The sideevents are rather repetitive, too, and completely random, reminding of CKII style brutal difficulty spikes.In my oppinion, one of the game's biggest strengths, the storytelling, suffers exactly from this lack of content.On top of that, the gameplay quickly grows repetitive and feels overly lengthy... to the degree where the lack of actual content diversity becomes even more of an issue.I think this game is not worth more then a few bucks, maybe 5€. I got it for 10€, which slightly hurts... albeit I have seen worse.Rating: 6/10Great concept, nice idea, but lacking execution. Buy cheap or don't buy.			"

												I don't understand why he had to use these disgusting 3d models to convery his point. He could have hired even a bad artist to do some portraits for him, both increasing the visual quality of the game and removing the ugly uncanny valley that is extremely pervasive. Hell, the store image itself; that sort of art, would have been fine, but nope, ugly 3d models. However, that still would not make up for the lack of -game- here, and that nothing really feels like I'm making a choice- it is a story, but my choices make no difference, and I do not feel any sense of progression. I do not grow attached to the people I carry, and I have no idea what is going on or why I should care. The metaphors put in are not very solid and poorly executed. The writing itself is fine- but the overall vision, the overall arching idea of the entire game, is sorely lacking and it seems to long reaching vision is missing. I do not know what I am working towards. Ever escalating numbers, I suppose. The mechanics themselves are cryptic and mysterious at best, and broken and not WAD at worst. Perhaps if he gets his♥♥♥♥♥♥together, step 2 (probably never coming) will actually be a game.			"

												I was expecting something more like King of Dragon Pass, where you manage a clan, a family in this case, and you choose event decisions that affect the future.Instead 7 Grand Steps is more like a board game like The Game of Life, with primary gameplay consisting of playing tokens to move and trying to land on specific spaces to collect more tokens. Events are more like side gameplay with little or no long term repercussions.You tend to forget that you're actually playing out the history of a family since there's very little in the game that actually makes you feel invested in your ""characters""; each individual is so ephemeral and unmmemorable with zero personality beyond ""does this one love his/her spouse y/n?""In ""lategame"" you actually do get some manegerial decisions involving your city/state if you're in a position of power. However, you quickly realize how shallow the mangement is because it's literally just basic linear progression (plant more crops to make more food so you can plant more crops, invest in infrastructure to make more money so you can invest more in infrastructure) year after year with some RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥ harvests once in a while. YOUR family is never really under any pressure because only the nameless peasents starve, whereas in KODP you actually worry about running out of food because your clan IS your family.			"

												What Ancients Begat is a complete (~15 hour) romance of family generations surviving the rise of western civilization. Survival is the ultimate goal. The sub-goals, you choose, craft their story. Experience an abstract telling of the lives of our earliest recorded ancestors. Part board game, part machine, part nod to computer games of yore, it begins with a simple mechanic. Spend tokens to traverse the wheel of life. Earn tokens by tempting the jaws of death. Then, like layers upon a pearl, game play expands, introducing fresh tactics and strategies which, turn by turn, drive a sophisticated, emergent narrative. How you play defines the lives of one family's generations through the changing ages.			"

												While 7 Grand Steps gets a lot of points for thinking outside the box, I think the game is mostly unsuccessful in blending a casual play mechanic with gaming that requires careful planning. I was often frustrated, and didn’t find myself wanting to come back for more. There is obviously a lot of depth to this game, but I wasn’t intrigued enough to keep digging. I will be checking out Mousechief’s other games, just because this is such a different concept, and I’m intrigued to see what else they have to offer.Read my full review of 7 Grand Steps for Nerdy but Flirty: http://nerdybutflirty.com/2013/06/06/review-7-grand-steps/ "

												This game is essentially a single-player boardgame.  The interface is clever, resembling a more mechanical entertainment of a prior era, but unfortunately that is all I can say to recommend it.Ostensibly, the object of the game is to control the path of a family through a vague recreation of early recorded history.  However, the history is a mishmash of concepts where your family starts out vaguely Egyptian and becomes vaguely Roman, and the game plays out more like a Filial Disappointment Simulator where you watch your most promising son prance about naked at his coming-of-age ceremony and then get bitten by a snake, leaving your unmarriable daughters to inherit.

												I am not entirely sure I know what this game is. I am also not sure if I actually enjoyed playing the game.The overall goal of the game is that to lead a family through various generations, and by your decisions lead them upwards from common laborers to become artisans, merchants or even priests and kings. A turn based game, you either move your charges to new positions on a spinning wheel based on a variety of tokens you have on hand, or spend a turn earning new tokens. Ultimately, you character will have children, and these tokens can also be used to teach these descendants new skills, which will - once they have grown up - limit where they can move on the game- board. It is a unique game and for that alone is worth the price of admission.I'm just not sure it's really that much fun. Game mechanics are poorly explained, and too much of the gameplay is determined randomly by the computer. This makes it exceedingly difficult to create any sort of long term strategy and - especially as the game progresses - advancing the characters upwards through the social ranks takes more and more time and becomes increasingly onerous. I suppose this bears some resemblance to real life but since I use games to escape this sort of drudgery, it doesn't entice me to keep playing. It doesn't help that there is precious little visual chrome, with little variety to keep up interest. Ultimately, ""7 Grand Steps"" is  an interesting but sadly flawed experiment that failed to keep me entertained. "

												It's a pretty neat game that feels very much like a strategy board game with (mostly) pretty good mechanics. The ""board"" is this sort of spinning wheel that you move across each turn by spending tokens. There are 4 lanes representing social castes, you start on the inner most lane, the labor caste, and can build up points to move out one track at a time.(artisans, noble professions, ruling class) Each track up increases complexity slightly until you reach the top rank where an additional mini game begins each turn you have to make civ-like decisions on how to distribute grain through the city or how to use troops to attack neighbors, etc. I had fun for a few hours until I reached the end of the first age, the copper age, and once the bronze age started just got sent back down to the artisan caste to work my way back up again. Soon after this I realized the game was just going to be this same thing pretty much over and over until whatever ""age"" it decided it was done. (description on steam says it's 15 hours and I played about 9, I'm not sure I'm really up for another 6. Anyway, the game is fun for a few hours but compared to other games you can get for the price I think $15 is a bit steep. I'm pretty sure I picked it up for ~$1 in a humble bundle sale. If you can get it cheap it's worth checking out if you like a good strategy board game.			"

												For casual gamers, this is pretty decent. For those who need a minor distraction from things, this is great. You slot coins into the playing pieces, the pieces move, the wheel spins. You make a family line where you can track their progress. Other than the coin slot, there isn't much interativity until you get to the ruling caste. There is some challenge there but its pretty mindless and the only thinking you have to do is to figure out where your next pieces should go, and how much should you invest in the next generation. So for casual gamers, who enjoy things like facebook games and stuff, I think you might enjoy this.I thoroughly enjoyed my five hours playing this game, and I would continue to play more...If it didn't crash that often for me. I have no idea if its my computer, or the game, but I have crashed about 5 to 7 times in the five hours spent on this game. Although it could be because I'm on a windowed version. Seriously I'm here enjoying the game, then it crashes. I restart it, it usually picks up where it left off... or the saved bit. I honestly cant remember. After a while the steps start to blend. There is some lost progress occasionally from the crashes, but that loss of progress doesn't irritate me. I just spin more and make better decisions.But oh man the crashes just irritate me. Seriously. I've never written a review before and I've felt irritated enough by the crashes to actually write one. If the devloper reads this I hope you can work with me to figure out why it crashes so often.			"

												Human history is often presented as a grand story of great individuals. Movements and ideas are humanized, given life. But for many years history was defined more about the ties of family. In 7 Grand Steps you start as a couple living hand to mouth in the fields of the Copper Age. These two are married, have children, work with and against their fellows to survive and perhaps thrive, and then they die. But their death is only the next step as you take the role of one of their children and continue the story of this ancestral line and, in doing so, you continue the story of the human race.The grand wheel of life is represented by a playing mechanism where your descendent and their spouse are placed along with other ""families"" along a track in a quarter of a wheel. The wheel contains spaces with pictograms, and you move you and your spouse ahead (literally symbolizing ""getting ahead"" in life) by playing tokens matching those pictograms. Each turn you make your move, and then the wheel of life makes it turn, pushing you back. You must keep ahead of the end of the wheel, lest your mother and father tokens meet an early end. You must decide when to not move forward but make an investment in order to have the tokens to move later. You must compete with the computer-controlled players for ""advancement discs"" that allow your tokens to become a hero of legend, make a new discovery or raise their social status. And when the wheel comes to an end for your husband and wife, you must pass your inheritence onto your children and hope they can achieve what their ancestors left undone.The game is clever in how it creates metaphors through game mechanics. For example, one goal you can set for your family is to rise in social status. If you do this, your characters move to a different, literally high track on the game wheel. There's a new set of pictograms on this track, and you may find your characters transitioning between classes for a generation or two. The higher the track, the more diverse the pictograms (representing more varied economic opportunities for those in higher social classes) and the track of the wheel goes longer per generation (representing the increased life span of those in higher social classes). The central conceit of the game - using early 20th century carnival game machines to represent the ""wheel of life"" - is an interesting take an old and hackneyed cliche, thanks to the strangely nostaglic feel achieved in reproducing an analog machine.7 Grand Steps has that addictive ""just one more turn"" quality of a game like Civilization. However, it does not have the kind of strategic depth of Civilization, or at least not the breadth of strategies. There's certainly strategies to be a more effective player of the game of life (lives, really, untold generations' worth), but the core mechanics of the game are fairly narrow. The game mechanics open up when your family reaches the ruling caste level (the highest level), but for the first three castes the game focuses on the push-and-pull of investing tokens to achieve your family's goals while having enough tokens to move where you want to move on the board and avoid being pushed off the wheel to your death. Random events occur that can result in your family gaining or losing tokens, which can be annoying as you have no control over when these happen or whether they are positive or negative effects. You play this over and again until you reach the ""Challenge of the Era"", a scenario where your current family member must survive a catacysm of the era using the legend status and inventions of their family. Survive and you move onto the next age. Fail, and you'll go back to an earlier ancestor so they can try to succeed where the other branch of the family could not.This is the first of what seems to be poised as a series. Despite the title, I don't think that having seven games in this series is going to happen. A sequel to the game is promised at the end of this game, which contains three eras, and functionality that will allow you to import your family from the first game is promised. In fact, a file is saved at the end of the game for this purpose. I'm not aware of any date of release for the second game, but 7 Grand Steps: What Ancients Begat stands on its own as a fun game for those who want to chart the course of human history through the struggles and triumphs of a single family line. If it sounds dry and academic, I assure you, it's not. It's maddeningly addictive as you become attached to the family you've created, generation by generation.			"

												A qualified recommendation here, the game feels a bit unfinished. The tasks become repetitve quite quickly.  if there were more variety, it would be quite a bit better. There is some challenge and it could be quite good, but until it is revised or improved, don't spend your funds.			"

												Got it with the Humble Bundle.After 5 hours of playtime I can say that, so far, it is not half as boring as it looks like. The game is fun, although you follow the same patterns every generation and there are only minor variations when you make a discovery etc.. A downside are the somewhat weird written messages that in my opinion seem mistranslated. Iam not fully convinced that the game is going to be fun in the long run, though. Only grab it when it's on sale.			"

												I'm not an expert gamer, nor have put in the hours that I imagine many other Steam users have played. I bought this game during a sale period (02/15/2014). I found it to be mesmerizing. It's a little confusing, I'd admit. I don't know all the features, but found it enjoyable. Before I knew it, I'd played for several hours straight and was surprised how much time I'd played. The phrase, ""Time flies when you're having fun"" fit. This is not a ""shoot-'em-up"", tactical warfare, zombie, or even strategy game. This is a game to amuse you. I'm age 37, and in many ways I felt like I was in the casino.			"

												Summary: This game is kind of slow but mesmerizing. You're turning the massive gears of a beautiful clock. It oozes one-more-turn once you figure out what's going on. I recommend it for patient people who enjoy working out intricate single player puzzle systems. If that's not what you want to do, you will bounce right off.In this game, you move a married couple individually, Candy-Land style, along a wheel of a few tens of spaces marked with symbols. You move by spending coins with a matching symbol, which represent skills, or maybe technologies, like Brewing, Sailing, Writing, and so on. Other people, basically your neighbors, are also moving along the wheel, spending their coins. Some spaces contain points that fill up a ""legacy"" meter. So first, you are basically racing your neighbors to them.The way that you get coins is by moving backwards to your previous neighbor, then teaming up to do work together. Each person has individual skill levels and produces different coins based on those skill levels. If one spouse you control teams up with the other one, they both produce coins at once. When you meet different neighbors, you can also trigger random events that may affect your people's personalities and stockpiles.Each turn you have to decide whether to go forward or back, one move per person. After every turn, the wheel rotates backwards toward crocodiles, death. So there is first this balance between exploiting and replenishing your resources.If that were all, the game would still be pretty simple and your decisions would be pretty constrained. But then you have babies.When the married couple meet as they journey on the wheel of life, they may produce children. Children are stupid. They have no skills. Each turn, you can decide whether or not to train your children by spending coins on them. Trained children can themselves be used to produce coins in skills they are especially good at, which can become critical if you need a particular move.Every turn of the wheel, the biological clock ticks down. Eventually, the current generation ages and cannot advance for more tokens (death is a wall), and doesn't have room to go backwards to do more work. So you have to pass on your family legacy to your chosen heir. If their skills suck, then when they take over the game, they will have a harder time succeeding.So each turn becomes a series of agonizing tradeoffs. If you train the kids, you can't move out for points. If you go backwards and fall behind the group, you have to spend a lot of worthwhile tokens just to stay alive. It's a diabolical resource management puzzle.If there's one thing I would change, in contrast to other fun dynasty/legacy games like Crusader Kings II, you don't usually get to make choices for your characters. Usually in an event there is one option to click on, which violates my sense of role playing and agency. Or in the succession event, all the options can look crappy. Are you: a) evil; b) dumb; c) cowardly? It could be improved by making the pros and cons of each option a little more visible, or a little more obviously pro.Also, the progression can feel pretty slow, especially when there are no points in sight on the board. In such a case, it can feel pretty grindy to train up the chosen heir as much as possible and squeeze every drop out of the parents. After a succession you can feel like you're not going to make much headway if your heir is crappy. In general, you feel like you're working a lot for rewards that are few and far between.At the top of the progression there is even more game as you become a city administrator and make even more decisions. I've just gotten into this, but it promises the same interlocking connections between the different levels of the game.			"

												A suprisingly compelling game. a dynasty simulator boiled down to its most simple state. takes a little while to get the hang of. beware the inability to go back to previous saves, you will live with your mistakes for generations. picked this up as part of a bundle to pass an hour or so. surfaced 4 hours later having played only a small part of the game. At 75mb you can grab this in a few minutes and its simple enough that it could be played on a calculator. fantastic time waster.			"

												I like the concept of 7 Grand Steps, but this game drags on too much and is too repetitive. Getting to the noble class is interesting and the game takes a cool turn by adding a bunch of new mechanics and a victory condition, but otherwise it's a plodding Candyland-style board game. It does has a mix of strategy and RNG that should please most board gamers. I enjoyed it for a couple hours, but when I fell out of the noble class and had to trudge the 3rd level a second time I was bored with the repetition. I like the aesthetic, theme, and parts of the gameplay, I just wish the whole package was wrapped into a game that could be completed in 30-60 minutes.			"

												The basic premise of the game is fun. The board moves toward the crocodiles every turn, and you have to stay away from the crocodiles by using tokens to move forward, but you have to move backwards to get more tokens. Collecting legend points gains you advances and when you make a discovery you get 10 tokens of whatever type you discover, and basically have a monopoly on them for a while.The problem is with the random events in the game. you're going along fine, doign well, and then the game randomly kills your character. Not because of anything -you- did, mind you. Just because it randomly decided to. I wouldn't mind if I'd doen something stupid and gotten killed, but no, you don't even get to make choices. It just flat out says, 'Your character's been killed, too bad.' This is poor design, and makes an otherwise fun game not worth playing.			"

												Meditative, fun, with a bit of challenge.If you enjoy games that can put you in a zen-like state, but still have enough going on to keep your attention, then I recommend you give this game a chance. It plays like a board game, where you collect resources in order to further your lineage and advance through the ages. While it doesn't require intense strategy, if you screw up too much you may be left behind and your whole family line could die out (game over).This game is not meant for those who want to play through something start to finish in one sitting. The whole board game progression can take a few hours to go through depending on your luck. The game works best if you can invest smaller amount of time over a long period.I recommend it definitely overall, jsut make sure you know what you are getting.			"

												This game is not enough for me the way you save and you do save is basically like EUIV on ironman mode you cannot deviate you cannot change anything after each dial turn & yes it should be difficult but once you got somewhere you want to be it should not be made harder by the fact that the RNG of this game is not good it is not worth playing now because it makes everything you do on a roll of a dice that you cannot even see I have about 30 save games 26 of which are complete failure I primarily have a singular line I never do the love thing I force a child out then I do everything possible not to get hitched SO my heir to my estate always has plenty of tokens because all the others ways I find never never never have enough tokens but with A heir I come out with AA or AAA or if I want a particular token then an INDIE stat I never go for anything else other than social climbup  everything else to me is irrelavent because of the said RNG, I would like it to be random but if in each wheel you have you can repeat the wheel you are currently on otherwise this game is not worth buying simply because of the RNG mechanic of the game, I've tried finding ways to make it feasable to make the game worth playing but it is WAY to random  like let say one of the events is like the Comet event in EU it's you trying too steal food and the game makes a hardcoded decision so that your children either has food or dies from starvation GOD that is INFURIATING if you had a mini-game of stealing stuff on a 2D environment & forced you a different coloured block on this to steal food from a place then GREAT you combine story with gameplay mechanics and your children don't need to die simply because of a single event with no meaning just to name for starters.P.S. I AM REALLY REALLY WANTING THIS GAME TO BE GREAT but no it's not worth it I need to see the random part of this game gone for me to like it the way it is, is not worth buying I'd wait for some other gaming company to pick this company up and make a family story telling game out of it like Paradox interactive maybes.

The only con that I believe worth mentioning is the frequently odd and convoluted sentence structure the designer uses. Often I have to read a paragraph a few times to puzzle out what's going on, and sometimes it strikes me as something churned through google translate.

												Human history is often presented as a grand story of great individuals. Movements and ideas are humanized, given life. But for many years history was defined more about the ties of family. In 7 Grand Steps you start as a couple living hand to mouth in the fields of the Copper Age. These two are married, have children, work with and against their fellows to survive and perhaps thrive, and then they die. But their death is only the next step as you take the role of one of their children and continue the story of this ancestral line and, in doing so, you continue the story of the human race.The grand wheel of life is represented by a playing mechanism where your descendent and their spouse are placed along with other ""families"" along a track in a quarter of a wheel. The wheel contains spaces with pictograms, and you move you and your spouse ahead (literally symbolizing ""getting ahead"" in life) by playing tokens matching those pictograms. Each turn you make your move, and then the wheel of life makes it turn, pushing you back. You must keep ahead of the end of the wheel, lest your mother and father tokens meet an early end. You must decide when to not move forward but make an investment in order to have the tokens to move later. You must compete with the computer-controlled players for ""advancement discs"" that allow your tokens to become a hero of legend, make a new discovery or raise their social status. And when the wheel comes to an end for your husband and wife, you must pass your inheritence onto your children and hope they can achieve what their ancestors left undone.The game is clever in how it creates metaphors through game mechanics. For example, one goal you can set for your family is to rise in social status. If you do this, your characters move to a different, literally high track on the game wheel. There's a new set of pictograms on this track, and you may find your characters transitioning between classes for a generation or two. The higher the track, the more diverse the pictograms (representing more varied economic opportunities for those in higher social classes) and the track of the wheel goes longer per generation (representing the increased life span of those in higher social classes). The central conceit of the game - using early 20th century carnival game machines to represent the ""wheel of life"" - is an interesting take an old and hackneyed cliche, thanks to the strangely nostaglic feel achieved in reproducing an analog machine.7 Grand Steps has that addictive ""just one more turn"" quality of a game like Civilization. However, it does not have the kind of strategic depth of Civilization, or at least not the breadth of strategies. There's certainly strategies to be a more effective player of the game of life (lives, really, untold generations' worth), but the core mechanics of the game are fairly narrow. The game mechanics open up when your family reaches the ruling caste level (the highest level), but for the first three castes the game focuses on the push-and-pull of investing tokens to achieve your family's goals while having enough tokens to move where you want to move on the board and avoid being pushed off the wheel to your death. Random events occur that can result in your family gaining or losing tokens, which can be annoying as you have no control over when these happen or whether they are positive or negative effects. You play this over and again until you reach the ""Challenge of the Era"", a scenario where your current family member must survive a catacysm of the era using the legend status and inventions of their family. Survive and you move onto the next age. Fail, and you'll go back to an earlier ancestor so they can try to succeed where the other branch of the family could not.This is the first of what seems to be poised as a series. Despite the title, I don't think that having seven games in this series is going to happen. A sequel to the game is promised at the end of this game, which contains three eras, and functionality that will allow you to import your family from the first game is promised. In fact, a file is saved at the end of the game for this purpose. I'm not aware of any date of release for the second game, but 7 Grand Steps: What Ancients Begat stands on its own as a fun game for those who want to chart the course of human history through the struggles and triumphs of a single family line. If it sounds dry and academic, I assure you, it's not. It's maddeningly addictive as you become attached to the family you've created, generation by generation.			"

												This game is essentially a single-player boardgame.  The interface is clever, resembling a more mechanical entertainment of a prior era, but unfortunately that is all I can say to recommend it.Ostensibly, the object of the game is to control the path of a family through a vague recreation of early recorded history.  However, the history is a mishmash of concepts where your family starts out vaguely Egyptian and becomes vaguely Roman, and the game plays out more like a Filial Disappointment Simulator where you watch your most promising son prance about naked at his coming-of-age ceremony and then get bitten by a snake, leaving your unmarriable daughters to inherit.

												I have never played anything like this before. It plays like a casual, strategic peg solitare board game, but it produces engaging, thought provoking stories. In the game, you guide a family's journey through thousands of years of history. You set their aims and decide how they handle their fate. To give you an example, I played as the Archian family named after the family's discovery of the Arch building technique. The first child of the family remained an only child despite the parents' many attempts to become pregnant a second time. The child became known as Raziya the lovable, for she was much loved. Raziya married Amen and started trading in pottery. Her first born, Kawab, grew up to have  a very pessimistic view of life. As he was gathering courage to propose to the love of his life, she went on a boat trip where she married his best friend. Kawab felt his pessimism confirmed and became a fatalist: All that happens is meant to happen and cannot be changed. Kawab's friend knew of Kawab's love and felt immensely grateful towards Kawab for giving up his own happiness. He became Kawab's most loyal friend and ally. Kawab married a woman whom he did not love, but who was deeply in love with him. He later became a local hero as he stopped a massacre on his village. Kawab begat two children: Etan and Osahar. Kawab was a genious irrigator and ran a very successful farm. He gave both his children the opportunity to study, but Osahar also followed his father into the fields and thus learnt from his genious. Kawab tragically ended his days, when his was killed by the city guards on a false accusation of stealing. His wife struggled as a sole provider. Etan became head of the family, for Osahar loved his brother and would never speak out of turn against him. Etan entered the family into the trading business and they rose in society. His father's irrigation geninous, however, was not carried on. Etan married the love of his life, but she did not love him. She only married him because he was rich. Thus Etan in a way ironically suffered his fathers's fate reversed.All this from only 3 hours of gameplay and the game has barely started. I warmly recommend this game.			"

Become a local hero, be the genius behind various discoveries or invention, or rise from the hard labor of the poor through the classes to the ruling elite of the kingdom. All the major milestones are recorded for you to review. I give it 9.5/10.			"

												It's an interesting concept but a lot of times it feels like the game is conspiring against you. The game is about managing your resources and preparing your children for the next generation. You can do everything right and the game will almost always throw a random event at you to, if not, screw everything up then make it a lot more difficult. I've had quite a few high level kids killed by random fires or generations where 3-4 of the other people were enemies. It can get very frustrating.It's interesting but definitely not for everyone. Be sure to try the demo before you buy it.			"

												It's a pretty neat game that feels very much like a strategy board game with (mostly) pretty good mechanics. The ""board"" is this sort of spinning wheel that you move across each turn by spending tokens. There are 4 lanes representing social castes, you start on the inner most lane, the labor caste, and can build up points to move out one track at a time.(artisans, noble professions, ruling class) Each track up increases complexity slightly until you reach the top rank where an additional mini game begins each turn you have to make civ-like decisions on how to distribute grain through the city or how to use troops to attack neighbors, etc. I had fun for a few hours until I reached the end of the first age, the copper age, and once the bronze age started just got sent back down to the artisan caste to work my way back up again. Soon after this I realized the game was just going to be this same thing pretty much over and over until whatever ""age"" it decided it was done. (description on steam says it's 15 hours and I played about 9, I'm not sure I'm really up for another 6. Anyway, the game is fun for a few hours but compared to other games you can get for the price I think $15 is a bit steep. I'm pretty sure I picked it up for ~$1 in a humble bundle sale. If you can get it cheap it's worth checking out if you like a good strategy board game.			"

												If you are interested in an interesting and innovative experience that lasts no more than approximately 8 hours of play for the average player, I recommend this. However, at the current price point, other than the novelty of the game there's not really much in the way of meat on the bones. The core game mechanics are entirely random and there is no way for the player to understand the consequences of their choices as they play. Essentially, this is the same as playing a slot machine, with a randomly emerging narrative that the player has very little to do with. If it were 4-5 bucks, it might be a great buy for a new and innovative experience. That being said, it is *not* worth buying at this price point if you expect a lot of game time or an in-depth, user guided emergent narrative because it isn't there. I give it a gold star for effort, and I will probably tinker with it from time to time, but it is not so much a video game and closer to video gambling.			"

												This is an interesting game to recommend as I know a lot of my friends won't enjoy it but I definitely found a glimmer of something special inside. It's very much a moving boardgame in the sense of visuals and playstyle; the player must tactfully advance across the board while playing tokens they earn by doing specific task (or luck). The point is to raise your family line into something great; this however doesn't necessarily mean becoming incredibly wealthy or status oriented as one can become important in the lower tiers of the game as well.It can be tedious at times but I find the interactive story events charming and intriguing as you advance through family generations and across different ages of time. If you have the patience it's definitely worth your time. $9.99 is a fair price price I feel.			"

												It's the same puzzle, over and over, but with a random factor in how well you can build it. Transition from era to era works awkwardly and will, little by little, cause more and more issues.Which is a crying shame because this SHOULD be a fun little way to spend a few hours at a time, once every couple of months.

												This game is essentially a single-player boardgame.  The interface is clever, resembling a more mechanical entertainment of a prior era, but unfortunately that is all I can say to recommend it.Ostensibly, the object of the game is to control the path of a family through a vague recreation of early recorded history.  However, the history is a mishmash of concepts where your family starts out vaguely Egyptian and becomes vaguely Roman, and the game plays out more like a Filial Disappointment Simulator where you watch your most promising son prance about naked at his coming-of-age ceremony and then get bitten by a snake, leaving your unmarriable daughters to inherit.

												I am not entirely sure I know what this game is. I am also not sure if I actually enjoyed playing the game.The overall goal of the game is that to lead a family through various generations, and by your decisions lead them upwards from common laborers to become artisans, merchants or even priests and kings. A turn based game, you either move your charges to new positions on a spinning wheel based on a variety of tokens you have on hand, or spend a turn earning new tokens. Ultimately, you character will have children, and these tokens can also be used to teach these descendants new skills, which will - once they have grown up - limit where they can move on the game- board. It is a unique game and for that alone is worth the price of admission.I'm just not sure it's really that much fun. Game mechanics are poorly explained, and too much of the gameplay is determined randomly by the computer. This makes it exceedingly difficult to create any sort of long term strategy and - especially as the game progresses - advancing the characters upwards through the social ranks takes more and more time and becomes increasingly onerous. I suppose this bears some resemblance to real life but since I use games to escape this sort of drudgery, it doesn't entice me to keep playing. It doesn't help that there is precious little visual chrome, with little variety to keep up interest. Ultimately, ""7 Grand Steps"" is  an interesting but sadly flawed experiment that failed to keep me entertained. "

												Strange game.. feels like a boardgame, a bit slow and really at the mercy of RNG. Some choices don't really make sense (like if you are rejected by a love interest, and then you court them a second time it gives a completely different result). Got in Humble Bundle - so sure why note, recommended for cheap - though I lost interest by about the Bronze Age.			"

												Yes, it is a board game. Many negative reviews here seem to be holding this game's mechanics against it, but the simplicity and chance are the point. Watching your dynasty morph and rise and fall depending on the drop of a coin or the unexpected outcome of a cyoa choice is what makes it such a joy.This game manages to create the feeling of passing through an enormous and tumultuous swathe of history with grace and simplicity thanks to the well-designed mechanics and some well placed, but not overwrought, pieces of flavor text. The writing isn't showy, and there isn't too much of it, but it is just the right amount to keep this epic story of a family's progress through the generations feeling vivid. The slot-machine mechanic may seem strange at first, but it models feeling of being desperate for food with too many children, or feeling driven to climb the social ladder to avoid being crushed beneath the wheel of history, incredibly well. Basically, this is like Crusader Kings II except you roleplay the peasants. CK2 gives you a map of the world and armies to place throughout. 7 Grand Steps gives you a coin and a wheel. You provide the luck and determination.			"

												I thought this game was fairly cute (I think I got it from humblebundle). Yes, it is on the repetive side, and it is a very simplistic board game (programming wise). It is fairly easy to fail, die without an heir, and screw up the generations. (at least the few times I've played it I realized I've made quite a few mistakes that limited myself quite a bit). I felt like there wasn't enough time/moves to do all the things I wanted to do, or that I wouldn't make enough because the education of my characters and off springs weren't enough. So, each turn you have a chance to make tokens which have symbols on them. Depending on which generation/age the symbols would look different. You can choose what your families ""legacy"" would be ( to invent things, be heros, and the forgotten third option..>.>) If the family has siblings and you treat the kids unevenly, the sibling in the next generation will screw you over, borrowing money and never returning it, ruining your reputation, and the likes. There are also people would be jealous of the person you married, and they would block your move or prevent you from making enough tokens with other mysterious players on the board. There are also friends that will boost how many moves you make in one turn and the amount of tokens made. The game looks simplictis and the rules are very easy to follow, but does take quite a bit planning to have a ""successful"" legacy.			"

												This game, although interesting, feels terribly misleading.What makes the title interesting:You follow a family line as it progresses through different ages of history. What makes the game fun is the constant counterbalance you have to make between whether or not to collect beads (Items on the game board that lead to three different types of advancement), or to focus on collecting tokens to invest in the next generation. A certain degree of stratagem exists in the game, stemming from the nuanced ways in which certain game mechanics interact. For instance, Do I have my couple work together, which runs the risk of them spawning a child, when I already have 3? If I do I might get some more tokens, but I also could end up having another kid to shove tokens into if I ever want to advance the eldest (the one that carries on the family line by default).One of the best stratagies I found when you have two people that do not love each other and already have at least one child, is to position your two characters behind the others. If done correctly, you can net some free beads from standing in place, while simultaneously getting beads when other characters fall back to make tokens.The game does not really hit its stride until you advance to the ruling caste, where a multitude of mini-games appear each age and allow for some really fascinating gameplay.All this being said, the game has some major flaws that would make me suggest not getting it unless in a bundle where it can be acquired on the cheap. Some of those flaws are listed below:1)The game's rite of passage system is bare bones as ♥♥♥♥. Instead of actually getting to make a decision, you press buttons until the game seemingly flips a coin and you either succede or fail, and are then given a selection of character traits. The traits you get are either good or bad, which offers some variety, but are static (e.g. ""Success"" always gives ""Benevolent"" Failure always gives an option of ""Meiser"".) This wouldn't be so severe an issue, if there were not only 4 choices.2)It is unclear how the personality elements of the character actually impact the game. Often times even good personality traits will not save you from adversities.3)The story elements offer virtually no choice most of the time, and often times the results of any of your choices are extremely random. This may be conducive to simulating reality, but is not terribly good for the purposes of understanding or playing through a game.4)The title costs $20, this is absurd to me for one paramount reason. The title you are displayed with at the beginning is ""7 Grand Steps: What Ancients Begat"". This drew me to conclude that the title was going to span 7 grand ages, each step divided into smaller ages. I thought it'd be interesting to see how history progressed through the game as time went on, and how the various castes interacted. But at the end of the Iron Age, you are sent to an End Screen, with the full title ""7 Grand Steps: What Ancients Begat - Step 1"", and a lead in to another game they title as Step 2.This naming convention seems almost predatory to me, and I do not think $20 is anywhere near a fair pricepoint for the content offered. $5 would be reasonable, but anything more is pushing the envelope from my vantage point.

I love BoardgamesI get the feeling when playing the game that it's like I’m playing a board game in some sense or a strategy game. You move your piece or pieces and get upgrades to make your characters better. In this case are you upgrading your future children to develop your family and rise in age and wealth. The thing about this game that aren't as most board games I play or strategy games is that this game is not fun. It is so boring and repetitive all you do is move some pieces and even though you probably could be very smart and do some good plays and dig into the game would I never do it since it is so boring and there is so little to the game. All you do is upgrade your family as you spin around the wheel, die repeat. You can compare it to the casino game roulette where you spin a wheel and bet on what color/number it is going to land on. All you have to do is remove the fun and excitement when playing roulette and you have this game. It is 20 bucks when writing this and I can't see it get anywhere near that price range from what it's worth. There are so many other better games for that price or free for that matter. "
