												Summary:Pros: Frantic gameplay after the first couple levels. Great art style. Pretty challenging to get gold for more gamer-y gamers. Not as ""linear"" as some might make it out to be in terms of gameplay.Cons: Soundtrack is droll and repetitive (turned the music off after 3 levels). Could have added a little more identification of clickables in the busy background art (I might just suck at the game as well and blame not having an attention span).For a casual game it is actually pretty good. The basic mechanic is that you have to decide in which order you are going to click things in order to achieve maximum efficiency. It sounds like this might be rather simple and the first couple of levels are (tutorial levels essentially). But after a few levels the difficulty ramps up if you are trying to achieve a gold rating on each level. I have only managed to get a gold on the tutorial levels >.<.I was actually suprised at how frantic the game can feel. You are constantly looking at the time and trying to speed things up in order to get that gold rating. The reward for completing levels is money which can be used to fancy up your house, though this felt rather lame as it is essentially just a still frame picture that you are slowly turning from a crap house into a decent house with a good garden. I have not finished the game yet so maybe you get some super cool cinematic at the end, but I don't think that this was necessary and I would rather have had a little bit in the way of story instead of making a prettier picture.As far as gameplay I only have one real complaint and that is the fact that it is hard to notice when the resources come out. Maybe it is just cause I suck at the game and don't notice but there isn't any flashy visual cue that shows when your tools or wood have restocked. What happens is that the little guys working at the huts stop moving and the resource appears but this is usually lost to me with all the other running arounds and what not. I just wish they had put in a glow around the clickables or something as more of a reminder. There is a slight audio cue but it is lost in the extremely short repetitive music that gets stuck in my head, but in a bad way.I recommend this game for slightly more than casual gamers because of the frenetic nature of it, but I would recommend turning off the music after a couple of levels as it gets too distracting while trying to listen to the audio clues. All of the downsides are rather small quibbles and I would still recommend picking this up.			"

												This game is addicting and fun.  I wouldn't pay $9.99 for it but when it's on sale i'd grab it in a heartbeat.  If you like time management games you'll LOVE this game.			"

												If you like time management games with rebuilding villages and houses, you will love this game. The game is about rebuilding people's gardens in order to get money to save your grandparents out of dept. The art design of each lvl is wonderfull. Each lvl has a bonus task and it's up to you to figure out how to solve it. Watch out for that fishy mafia looking guy!Edit: After completing the game I have to say I was pleased with the purchase. I was very surprised to hear that people found it hard, but then again this is also the genre I play the most. I didn't have any trouble completing each lvl with gold time (expert time). So as a conclusion: the game might be hard if you're not very used to the genre, but if you are used to it, you won't feel bored. :)			"

												Funny little casual game. I hoped it was more open (like Hero Of The Kingdom) but instead its very linear where you have to follow a specific path while completing objectives. The goal is to restore other people's gardens and that way earn money to help your grandparents keep their home. File this one under 'time management'. If you like those kind of games try Chocolatier instead. It's better in my opinion, but this one isn't bad either.[Rating: 70/100]			"

												I was given this game to make me stop wining about waiting for other games. At first I was like yay another casual game bleh. I did the first level and was like I hate this game. Since it was a gift I gave it 2 more levels to make sure I hated it. I'm 20 levels in now and I still hate it; I'm also still playing it.This game is deceptively hard. Let me say that again, this game is hard! Trying for gold every level is almost painful. I'm ending up doing all the levels twice or three times just to be 2 seconds off the gold time. They say this is a time management game, and they are totally correct. At first you think you can just queue a bunch of stuff up and win, and you might, but you wont get gold for the level. Then you realize you really have to micro manage your time and your little helpers. Another reviewer said this game is frantic, I believe this is the best word to describe it. As a side note there's no actual gardening in game, unless you consider click a predefined space and selecting a flower as gardening.The story its self is very generic for casual game; house is going to be repo'd if we don't get the money in time! Oh there is a contest where the prize is the exact amount of money we need! If we fix the house up we can win and pay off the house in time! Never mind the fact that fixing up the house costs about the same amount of money to that you need to pay off the house. Overall I give this game a thumbs up because I went from hating this game because it was a dumb casual game with no actual gardening to hating it because it's frantic and very hard. I'm not completely sure you can call it a casual game there is a lot of strategy that goes into playing this one.			"

												It's a fun game. Gameplay is similar to farm frenzy. There are a ton of stages and they're all fairly different. Lots of new things on almost every level. I think it shows that this game was made with love. It's a feel good game, it's fun.			"

												Keeping it brief:At 12hrs I have finished the game but didn't get my mansion completed (just not quite enough gold)Some levels I got gold level easy without trying, others I am having issues with.I class this as strategy, not sim because you get very little real choice on what to do. There are set paths and the only real choice you get is to upgrade a shack or what colour plants to put in.... Enjoyed and I will give the second one a crack. What a nice ""time waster"" that had me swearing when I looked up and realised I had been ther for 7hrs and it was 3am ;) "

												A very nice time management game. Some levels will make you repeat them to get the ""gold time"", but honestly it's not a huge challenge. I only had trouble with level 42 - I used the walkthrough to get the best set of moves.Above all I liked the story and if you are fan of TM games like myself you will enjoy it. "

												As a lover of time management games I was a bit unsure when purchasing this one. From reading the description and other reviews I sort of expected a kind of farm frenzy style game. While it has some elements of that style of game play, it is much more in the style of the build-a-lot games. I've completed around 15 levels all gold so far in 3-4 hours game play. I can't see much replayability with this game but with the price (especially while it's currently on special) it's definitely worth it if you love these types of games.			"

												These types of games are great if you want to kill a little time. Don't pay full price, but get it if you enjoy casual time management sims.			"

												I usually don't like time management games but this one is pretty fun. And with a theme as tame as gardening, no less. There are lots of different varieties of level themes, mechanics, puzzles, and challenges to keep things fresh. Graphics and sound are aesthetically pleasing and fits the theme well.My only real complaint is that levels with the fog mechanic almost always require a 2nd playthrough to earn a good time because you need to know what is behind foggy areas to determine the most efficient strategy			"

												Weird, but I liked this game...hmmm...game on training wheels.  The point is you fix up 30 or so gardens save the cash and make your own pretty in the meantime.  There is always a best way to fix up each board and no real way to loose. Good to play with half a brain when you are doing something else like listening to podcasts or reading blogs. Don't expect a good story as the ending throws away any ""tension"" in a non-sensical finish.			"

												Pros - Doesn't require a super computer to run - Challenging game-play that doesn't require Superman's reflexes and Batman's intelligence to get past the third level. - Visually pleasing, doesn't rely on hyper-realism - The storyline is decidedly not about people murdering each other in a gory war between good and evilCons - Very weak cliche storyline - There isn't really much time during the actual level to plan what to do and it can quickly devolve into a mindless click fest (Usually to your detriment in later levels) - Somewhat counter intuitive interfaceI rate this 3 moe out of 5 kawaii			"
