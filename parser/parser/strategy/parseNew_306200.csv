												For the price, it's not a bad game at all. It's kind of cutesy and amusing and has some city-building elements along with patches of story. It's a bit shallow and a lot of the options like where you build things are fixed. Your path of growth is more or less laid out for you. The graphics, however, are quite nice and the characters are adorable. The atmosphere and lack of urgency is relaxing. It's, in every sense of the word, a casual game. It's also a gentle introduction to city-building for someone who has never played one before and isn't sure they want to drop $10-20 on one of the more genre-defining titles. Like I mentioned before, the city-building aspect is rather limited, but it's quaint.You get what you pay for and it's not a bad game to add to your collection.			"

												Nice casual time management game. It's tagged as strategy game, but I have to warn you: it's not a strategy game, so if you're looking for such, keep looking. But if you're looking for simple game, and you just want to take a break of saving the world, this might be a good choice. Graphics is really nice, music and sounds also. Game still has some small bugs and there is lack of achievements.Generally you get definitely more than you pay, so it's worth it.VERDICT:Try it if you are looking for few hours of simple fun.But if you're looking for strategy, even simple, find something else.Like this review?

												An easy, very casual resource management game with no time limits.  Basically the player builds a city for their zombies friends by setting the zombies to work, gathering food, farming, cutting wood, quarrying stone, and collecting gems and money.  The point is upgrade everything, when everything is upgraded the game ""ends"".  There are a few quests that need to be done such as helping a witch or growing a tree.  It is a bit involved since to make money one needs to use the laboratory, workshop, and kitchen.  And while managing all that the main warehouse gets attacked periodically by flying pigs, shining knights and grim reapers who steal the food.  The player must defend the main warehouse by clicking on the thieves until all have been defeated. (Flying red pigs with a black mane that remind me of Monty Python's flying pigs.)Best thing about this game besides the lack of any time limits, is that it is more or less an open type world where the player controls who and what is being done.  Plus the town square can be built however the player choses by buying street lamps, paving stones, fountain, and benches.  A simple easy game for when one wants a break from time/resource management games with timed linear fixed campaign levels.			"

												This game was a disappointment for me.  Not because the game is bad, it's not great, it is a fun casual strategy game, but it was a disappointment because it was a downgrade from a previous Alawar/Buka Entertainment game.  The Promised Land is a previous game from Alawar/Buka that was released in 2012, it was a game that I really enjoyed for what it was.  With this game I was hoping for more of the same but maybe a bit bigger of a scale or maybe with some more depth.  The Happy Hereafter however seems to be a downgrade on The Promised Land rather than improving on the formula that made me a fan .  For this review I'll touch on a few of the points that I felt really soured me on this game compared to the one that made me buy this game.So the game is about starting off a colony, managing the workers that you have to finish tasks given to you so you can upgrade your buildings and continue progressing.  Right off the start the worker system showed a big downgrade from the previous game.  The workers are all generic and it doesn't matter what each one is doing, in The Promised Land, each character had a description, stats and preferred job(as well as disliked job).  Each worker in The Happy Hereafter is interchangeable, it doesn't matter what job each is doing and you can just throw them wherever and it doesn't make much difference.  In The Promised Land you had to plan out where each new worker went and what the best fit was to maximize their ability to collect resources and perform the best for your colony.  Each worker in The Promised Land could also gain experience making them better at certain tasks which again added depth in worker placement.  Workers could also be stationed in one area and they would continually work that area and if they ran out of resources they would patiently wait till resources spawned again.  In The Happy Hereafter if a worker tries to collect resources from a depleted area they will just wander back to town and if you didn't notice it (there is a pumpkin head character they hide behind) then you have an idle working doing nothing.  And lastly on the workers,  You can not assign more than one worker to collect resources from an area other than the very last resource you can collect, it really prevents you from progressing and puts you in a situation you don't need as many workers as you could have space for as most of them will stand around doing nothing.There isn't really as much story as The Promised Land either, there wasn't much in The Promised Land either to be fair but again something lacking in this title.Art is great in both games, again not much of difference or upgrade, but it's not terrible and is nice to look at.  It was pretty good in their previous game so why mess with it.There is also random enemies that will try to pillage your storage area.  These are more annoying then fun to deal with.  They are also incredibly easy to deal with and pose no real threat, a couple of clicks and your back to the game.The resources in the game for building and upgrading as well seem to be poorly balanced.  I had max workers on all areas to collect as much wood as possible and I was still constantly running out of wood, while having large stock piles of food, stone and gold (as well as other resources).  This could have been an easy fix by allowing more than one worker to collect resources from the mill, instead I had to constantly micromanage the workers to have one collecting while another was delivering.  As much as that might seem like it ads some difficulty or complexity, for me it just seemed tedious and takes away from the fun of these types of games. To sum it all up, The Promised Land is 3$ more on steam, but you'll get a lot more out of that game compared to this one.  If you are looking for a short, casual, indie resource collection, strategy game, I would suggest The Promised Land over this game.  If you already have The Promised Land and you are looking for something very similar or better, skip this game entirely as I just didn't find it be near the quality or fun that The Promised Land was.

												The Happy Hereafter is essentially Virtual Villagers - Lite set in Halloween Town.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good game on its own.  But there are a few lacking components and bugs that make it not as impressive as other similar titles in the genre.For starters, it's incredibly short.  So short, that I finished it in two nights.  If you follow the quest order you can probably get another hour or so out of it, but that isn't a good thing.  There are a lot of stretches of time where you're doing nothing but waiting.  It certainly isn't as long or as tedious as Facebook games, but it lacks item collection or achievements like Virtual Villagers to help pass the time.  If I had known from the start to improve resource gathering facilities the second the tech was available, I probably could have shaved off almost another hour of play.Second, the bugs.  And there are more than a few that can be annoying, if not progress slowing.  On occasion there are times where villagers stop gathering from resources at the bottom of the map.  While it makes sense for them to stop gathering when a resource has run dry and is in the process of regenerating, they don't always stop for this reason.  I found myself at the start of the game constantly having to reassign someone to harvest wood at trees because they just decided to stop working after collecting one load.  With a little luck I was able to get them to automatically harvest, as they are supposed to, but it did get annoying and tedious, especially at the start when you are entirely reliant on these nodes for resources.Another bug that is annoying, but not game breaking in any way, re units sliding around or getting stuck on decorations.  Sometimes when you tell a unit to harvest something, it will show the gathering animation but they will slide all the way back to the town square.  This doesn't prevent them from completing their job, but it is annoying.  Also, idle units have a habit of getting stuck under things.  Benches, lights, buildings.  It is easily fixed by picking them up and telling them to do something, and doesn't harm your production since they were idle, but it is another minor annoyance that one would think could be easily fixed.The characters are interesting and it's obvious that a great deal of effort was put into their creation, but they are sadly under-utilized.  Each character has one, maybe two quest chains, that are incredibly short, and then they are never used again.  The mermaid has I think 3 or 4 quests, spread across two ""chains.""  I say ""chains"" simply because the first chain has 2-3 quests for her and the second is a single quest given by the witch.  Once completed you will never see her again.  It's sad to see detailed characters and environments used so sparingly.Ultimately, I have to say this game is a ""Pass.""  While it can be fun, for its length, bugs, and simple play-style, there are just better games of the same genre.  At sale price, it was a nice distraction; at full price it would still be ok, but for a few dollars more you can get similar games with more depth and over-all entertainment.			"

												This game is exactly what it says on the tin.  A sim game, you build your town.  You start with a small area, and get larger, get more people, need more materials, make more items...it is a logical progression.It is also very short.  Once you get the town built, the game is over.  There is very little challenge, very little tension...you just go from point A to point B.  So why do I reccomend it?Well, it is also very cute.  The artwork is good, the characters are cute, even the town looks cute.  The gameplay was also smooth.  Things worked the way I thought they would the first time through, there were no crashes or hang up.  My daughter also loved it and while she can't beat it in a couple hourss like I did, she doesn't care.So no, this game is not for the hardcore gamers, but it was a fun ride, and one that my daughter will enjoy a lot longer that I will.

												Definately worth the dollar I paid for it!  It's a cute game, and the environment and sounds make it easy to play from beginning to end.  I found it easy on the head.  Ya know those times when you just wanna chill out, but not play anything intense... this is the kinda game that's good for that. You basically get asked to do tasks to unlock areas and buildings then more tasks to level them up.There are a couple of bugs but nothing to your panties in a bunch over... ;P  I showed one possible bug area in the Part 1 of my full playthrough.There is also a misleading mission asking you to fill an order for 5 units of wood (should have been worded ""Planks"" of wood).  Here's Part 12 of the playthrough I made to clear up any confusion about it.  It also contains the Fake Gold Mission.

In short... I got it dirt cheap during a sale and I'm glad I bought it!  It also has Steam Trading Cards which is a bonus!			"

												Ah! At last a time management game in the style of 'The Promised Land' (sorry, didn't check which one came first) that's not actually disappointing. It's even very good, ideal for a time waste. There's basically no story, the graphics & audio aren't as bright and engaging (but not as gloomy as one might think), but the 3D models are super cute. Gameplay-wise it's pretty satisfying, too.Do you want challenge? Go see somewhere else. Relaxing after a few hours of work? Go ahead!			"

												A cute little village building game. You collect resources, assign your villagers jobs, & build different buildings to unlock different abilities. Has a little bit of a Halloween type theme to it since your villagers are zombie-looking people and you wield magic. Seems to be a tablet game come to the PC, but without all the annoying ""wait 12 hours for this building to finish"" stuff. I cleared it in one sitting & it took about 4 1/2 hours. Most of that time was sitting around waiting for resources. I don't think it is worth the $4 price tag, but if you see it on sale, do pick it up because it was enjoyable, especially if you like games like this.			"

												It is a casual version of a city-building genre with predetermined buildings placements and almost none negative events to take care of. And the art design is great and coherent in the ""cutesy-undead"" style.Downsides being, that it has only one map, which eliminates repetition of high-player-agency early game, where most city-planning happens, unlike later-game fine-tuning. And considering that all placements are uncustomizable it's better that way. You can chain games in this sub-genre one after another, pretending that you play different levels, while having new aesthetics every time. And the problem with the mid-game is that even with all upgrades, resource gathering is too slow and you just waiting with nothing else (like fighting fires, crime or epidemics) to do. Next is the story — you are just start doing stuff and don't know why, nor do you know who or what attacks your town. Speaking of which, defense is not only mechanically pointless, but even lacks any feedback, like your godhand throwing lightnings or something into enemies.It kind of works with UWS UHD Surround, but GUI scaling hides important parts of the map from the player, so it's better to just play it windowed.Overall it's a one nice and pleasant feelgood playing session of several hours with podcasts or youtube videos on second (fifth) screen.

												Maybe I've just gotten too strategic with games similar to this, after playing others like FarmVille (don't judge) and Virtual Villagers, but I definitely think this was too short-lived. From what I've read, others agree, too. I think the characters are adorable, the missions straightforward and the overall concept really entertaining.  It truly is a lot of fun, just don't expect for it to last too long. I know that I really wasn't expecting to get the ""The End"" screen when I did. Despite the two or three mini-bugs I encountered, I would definitely recommend this.			"

												[Please note that this game, ""The Happy Hereafter,"" is a slow pace game; it's not for everyone.]Game Visual/AudioThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're amazingly well done. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.GameplayThe Happy Hereafter is an strategy simulation game. Where the individual can control the actions of their workers by assigning them certain task[s] to carry out like gathering resources from the environment around them. All the while maintaining their happiness that max level.There are plenty of colorful and zangy characters to meet in the game. Some of them do have quests that needs to be fulfill.There are plenty of artifacts to find and collect around the environment. Some of them can be easily found right away.The building plans are locked because they're connected to the quests that given out by characters. They can be used to build new buildings in the environment. When building a structure it'll take some time. However, it can go much faster, only if add another worker to speed up the building process. [This same strategy can be applied to clearing away the garbage from roads and such.] The newly built buildings can be upgraded as long as the required item[s] are found.There are two ways of scroll (""Click & Drag"" and ""Edge"") in the game. There's little and/or no mouse control for ""Edge"" scrolling. There's plenty of mouse control for ""Click & Drag"" scrolling. I prefer ""Click & Drag"" scrolling it makes everything a bit easier.MiscellaneousThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam’s Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it’s Booster Pack Creator. Badge can be crafted and upgraded with these trading cards. This feature is only available for Steam’s version of this game.Final thoughts, I definitely enjoying playing this game all the way through to the end. As for the replay value I would say it's low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price. "

												Bought this at full price, a whopping $3.99 (US dollars) which is less than popcorn at the movies. I didn't really expect much and thought it'd be a very mediocre, forgettable, indie game.I'm so glad I was wrong. The Good:  It looks like a handpainted style game with a more cartoonish flair, and it's got a very cute whimsical soundtrack to go with it (the music that plays in the game, to clarify).  I love the fact that it has quests/missions in the first place, and they never make you feel too rushed but give you enough pressure so that you want to hurry up with whatever needs doing. The quests are worded in a very quirky style and made me chuckle a few times! I loved the fact that there were cutscenes within the game and they varied from traditional style cutescenes to an image artsy style cutscene, almost like a graphic novel. You start with 3 little ""helpers"" and it goes from there, depending on your resourcefulness and needs, and by the you can have many more, each working on permanent jobs or temporary ones. I like that you can always reassign who does what and when. And lastly, you NEVER have to save (omg what!). That's right, you can exit whenever you feel like it or whenever you draw parent aggro (girlfriend, boyfriend, wife, hubby aggro!), and when you log back into the game it starts exactly where you left off. Wish more games did that, instead of the runaround some games do to try and never let you exit their games. Yes, I'm looking at you Assassin's Creed. Also, there is a vendor system in place, where you can sell and buy. Comes in handy!The Bad: bugs! Now, I only encoutered 2.5 bugs. One was when I first started the game, I was not able to use magic on an altar. I simply restared the game twice and never encountered this problem again. The second bug was when I was dragging a worker to a location, I got a popup tutorial (I had not ticked tutorial off at this point) and my worker disappeared from my screen! Turns out she ended up on a ""dark"" undiscovered part of the map. I got her back when I discovered the area, but it did take me a while to get there. And the 0.5 bug was more of a glitch ""oversight"" on the developers part. One of the components for building crystal houses is listed as ""stones"" but instead requires ""gems"". I was trying to upgrade my houses to a rank 2 but was unable to, I had plenty of stone, so I bought from gems from the trade post and sure enough I was able to upgrade to rank 3. Now the last bad thing, is the length of gameplay. It's short (about 6 hours) if you are playing to do the missions/quests, however, once you beat the game you have the option to keep playing.Worth it? In my humble opinion, I would recommend anyone to buy this game. While it is short compared to most games out there it's got a lot of replayability, the game keeps you engaged and interested, and you can tell the devs put a lot of hard work into the game, so quality is on your side! Plus, at 4 bucks (3.99 US dollars) you can afford you buy it and hate it, but you will probably like this one. Hope you guys enjoyed it as well!			"

												Let's keep this simple: This is a resource management game on training wheels. For a younger audience, this could potentially be recommended, with caveats - but that doesn't make it a good game in the genre.Developer Alawar and publisher Buka Entertainment are well known amongst casual gamers. Farm Frenzy and Treasures of Montezuma are two of the most well known series they've worked on, and the rest of their respective lists of mostly mediocre yet decent enough games are pretty long. They also collaborated on The Promised Land, another resource management game, but one I actually enjoyed; it was *heavily* reminiscent of Virtual Villagers, and even without ever managing to come close to the fun mechanics and attention to detail that made Last Day of Work's game a hit, it provided a few hours of entertainment.The Happy Herefter feels like a game that attempts to capitalize on the moderate success of The Promised Land, and fails. There is nothing innovative about the resource collecting, building, crafting, quest fullfilling treadmill the game puts you on, and there is also no attempt at permitting the player any input or attempt at strategy. You follow the cues, you fullfill one (re)quest after an other, everything with an arrow pointing at things just in case you missed them. Except when you do miss them, because quests are worded awkwardly or mechanics are insufficiently explained. Certain mechanics also feel too much like busywork to be fun, like resources that deplete very fast but only for a few seconds - long enough for your toons to wander aimlessly around not knowing what to do and needing to be dragged back. There is a distinct lack of polish here, in the copywriting, in the UI, and in the mechanics, to the extent where it feels like no one really playtested this game.So if you have younger kids, and if you are willing to sit around for a few hours helping them when they get stuck because something is worded wrong/awkwardly or a mechanic is badly explained, then this might be a fun game for them. It's utterly linear, impossible to go wrong, somewhat cute, with a silly story, and not too long. If on the other hand you're an adult casual gamer, might I suggest The Promised Land? Exactly in the same vein, just better executed and more polished.			"

												English review:These games have long been a lot. Games like this are like a flash application to the websites. Nothing new I not opened, but was happy. Bought as soon as I saw. I knew that the game will be short, easy and cheap. Hooked idea that this ""strategy"" about zombies.The gameplay is very simple. You give a world where almost everything is done for you, you can't choose what and where to build, so the buildings appear always in the same place. The extraction of resources standard, exhaustible resources. Buy new jobs and send them to work. Improving industrial buildings, residential and other. For beauty, you can create beautiful objects, meaning in it, but just for fun. The quests you are given upon the opening of new locations (as of beginning openly little). Tasks on extraction of specific resource specified number.The characters are funny and the animation is the same sweetheart. There are little splash of four pictures. The plot is missing, but interesting to play.The world was made 2D, 3D charactersThe negative side of the game:1. The game is short2. Some resources are significantly less than those that are needed. For job often give gold, and which is so very much.3. There is possibility to construct buildings where want.4. The limit of buildings by reason of paragraph 3.May I wrote cons of the game, but this is minor. The game is relaxing and upliftingThe game is fully completed.                     Overview written 21.07.2014Русский обзор:Таких игр давно было много. Такие игры встречаются как флеш-приложения к вебсайтам. Ничего нового я для себя в ней не открыл, но прошёл с удовольствием. Купил, как только увидел. Я понимал, что игра будет короткая, легкая и дешевая. Зацепила идея, что эта ""стратегия"" про зомби. Геймплей крайне простой. Вам дают мир, в котором почти всё уже сделано за вас, нельзя выбирать что и где строить, так что постройки появляются всегда в одном и том же месте. Добыча ресурсов стандартная, ресурсы истощаемые. Покупаете новых рабочих и отправляете их на работу. Усовершенствуете промышленные здания, жилые и прочие. Для красоты можно создавать красивые объекты, смысла в этом нет, но ради забавы. Квесты вам дают по мере открытия новых локаций (по началу открыто мало). Задания на добычу конкретного ресурса конкретным количеством. Персонажи забавные и рисовка то же милая. Бывают коротенькие заставки из четырех картинок. Сюжет отсутствует, но играть интересно. Мир сделан 2D, персонажи 3D Отрицательные стороны игры:1. Игра короткая2. Некоторых ресурсов заметно меньше, чем тех что необходимы. За задания чаще всего дают золото, которого и так очень много.3. Нет возможности строить здания там где сам хочешь.4. Лимит зданий по причине пункта 3.Пусть я и написал минусы игры, однако это мелочи. Игра расслабляющая и поднимающая настроениеИгра пройдена полностью.

Pleasant style graphisme and atmosphere.This game have fairly polished graphisme, they come with ambient music and few funny mouse triggered audio.Gameplay is intuitive and simple. Very accessible I would recommend it to anyone.Worth buying.Got it for a very little price on sale. I enjoyed the time spend on this game. A bit short that's for sure, it has the typical sim avantage (or not)... You don't immediately realise the time you spend on it.Some cool bonus.The Gallery with a nice feature on statues.Trading card are fine.Here come few cons.I regret there is no Steam Achievements.Audio could be improved with more ""life"". I mean ok, they are all dead, but they could be less silent.Gallery could be much more funny with audio on statues.My task sold 5 wood stuck at 0/5.Some decorations goes through other building, also some building have peoples who can pass through.

												Hooked me right away with the straightforward gameplay and beautifully stylized graphics. It's a good casual game that doesn't require a lot of emotional investment in a new story, and a welcome refreshment to worker and resource management. I felt like the model is strong enough that they should invest it making more than 6.4 hours of content—and I did everything. That's the only downside; it's not a long enough distraction.  :)			"

												I wish there was a ""neutral"" to the recommendation question. This isn't a bad game, it's cute and fun, but it's very short. It feels like the tutorial for a longer game. When the hand-holding instructions stop coming, it feels like you'll be able to just tackle objectives and upgrade your town on your own from then on-- but actually, the game just ends at that point.I got it on sale for $1.50 and for that price, it seems worth it. I finished the whole thing in one evening. $4 is too much considering how short it is.Fun concept and cute art, though. I wish there was more to the game.			"

												The game is short. It's also very easy.   For a couple of bucks like I spent it is worth it.   I bought it for the trading cards which I managed to sell for the cost of the game.  After was all said and done, I actually found I enjoyed the game too despite it being extremely easy.  It has a charm to it that appealed to me.  Basically use undead to build things, sell things to make your ""city"" bigger.  Bigger city = more revenue to have more undead join your community which you then set to work to get to next building etc.  Once you use the Circus at highest level the game ends.  If you like games with high difficulty or expect brain teasers you won't get them here.   It's basically point & click and collect and on to next task.   It's definitely ""casual"".  It's a yes for a couple of bucks.  Any more than that and you should wait for it to go on sale.			"

												This ranks a ""Meh""I wish I had played this before ""The Promised Land"" and I might feel more positive towards it.It's a casual resource management game with a cute aesthetic where you allocate various minions to collect resources and make products for sale or for upgrades .... and that's pretty much it. Occasionally, you get attacked, which mainly means clicking on the attackers, that come in 3 forms, always in the same numbers, and always from the same directions. You also get warnings prior to the attacks, so that they merely become a distraction rather than an interesting mini-game.ProSound and graphics fit the spooky theme.No bugs, a decent mobile port.ConI know it's a casual game, but it's far too simple, no challenge.Very short (compared to the dev's other game ""The Promised Land."")Minions have to be micro-managed and dragged to certain jobs.The game ends abruptly with ""The End"" on a black screen leaving you wondering what the goal was ....Much of the map feels undeveloped with empty areas never used.Overall, if you haven't played The Promised Land, this might be worth checking out, as it really feels as if this is the training wheels for that game. On the other hand, skip this game and play The Promised Land, for a much more polished, interesting, longer, and entertaining game.			"

												At first glace this is a funny, slow-paced city builder game, fairly short and simple. However, I would recommend against buying it, since it is not properly debugged and starts getting on one's nerves just as you get into it. Advancing at a pace faster than the intended game progression (which in my opinion is rather tutorial-style), causes all sorts of glitches. Workers stop moving, performing tasks and/or bringing resources to storage. Hungry workers just stay in one place instead of automatically going to feed. The cherry on top is the moment when the game randomly spits out a """"Yourname"" profile is corrupt, profile deleted"" message and makes you start over without any option to recouperate and start from an earlier point. All in all: KEEP AWAY FROM THIS ONE.			"

												For the price this game is totally worth it. You can get many hours of fun out of this cheap little game. It's so cute, fun, and enjoyable, it truly was a blast. My only complaint is that later in the game you will have to wait for quite some time to save up resources for later upgrades. In the meantime, you can just manage your workers, trade, and search crypts. Its not the most in depth sim game by a long shot, but super casual and very fun (great Sunday afternoon game). I got it on sale for $1 and have gotten almost 6 hours out of it so far, and I intend to beat it! i give it a 9/10!			"

												Lots of fluff, no real substance and really lacking polish. I found a number of errors in the quests and the building descriptions. Essentially this is ""The Promised Land"" (same publisher) but without any challenge or depth. The in-game economy consists of waiting for enough wood to be gathered to build the next whatever, as all other resources are ludicrously plentiful at midgame. There is no endgame to speak of, just an endless chain of ""build/upgeade this"" until you've done it all.			"

												I'm kinda torn about whether or not to recommend it, as there aren't intensely strong reasons for either leaning, but I've ultimately settled on 'no'. This is basically Virtual Villagers, but it doesn't run in the background, so you take a much more active role, which is pretty good, for the most part. Unfortunately, the way they've gone about this is to triple the level of micromanagement. For resource gathering there are basically three categories:60% Short run: These resources have 5-10 units of the resource, so your people make 5-10 trips before they stop working. They will regenerate gradually, in this time they add to the one-shot category.25% Stable: These resources are able to support up to one worker permanently .15% One shot: There are a fair amount of resources, but they can only be harvested once before they need to regenerate.Between the above, one-time resources and, one time production queues, there's a LOT of telling your villagers every. Single. Thing. To do.  At least they return to the town center so they are easy to find.Periodically, you village is ""attacked"" by sprites that spawn from the same location every time and proceed to your warehouse to steal resources. The way to vanquish them is simply to click on the repeatedly. This is pretty silly, but I guess it's better than trying to incorporate some kind of extreme micromanagement tower defense...The biggest problem I had with this game is that it was very hand-holdy, basically the entire game was a tutorial. There was a main game quest for, literally, every single building and upgrade. When it comes to these kind of village sim games, half of the point is that the map is very small, static, and unexplored. So, you're constantly thinking, 'dude, just leave me alone'. Obviously you're going to need to build a workshop type building at some point, and obviously you will need to upgrade it, it's not necessary to treat me like I'm four. You play games like this to explore and problem solve. That does not happen here. Even the things you know you will need to do at some point, like clear brush (without any special tools, just with hands), cannot be done until the main quest sprite places an arrow over it. That's pretty frustrating.The interface and game, itself, is pretty bug free. Sometimes when one of the millions of quest windows pop up, it clicks through the world and pulls people off of whatever they were doing, but it's not a big deal. The greatest oversight is the wording in the quests. For example, there's one where you need to sell wood. Okay, wood is an actual resource that you get from trees or sawmills, but the quest actually wants you to sell planks, which is a production item made from wood. So I spent a good deal of time thinking that quest was broken. It only occurred to me it might have been referring to something else after a similar situation with a cooking assignment.Ultimately, the game was not ""unenjoyable"". It was alright, although could have been a bit better. I have played 4.6 hours of it and that's exactly how much content there is. For the dollar-twenty I paid for it, that's pretty good, but I would have preferred it had more challenge, less tutorials, and more replay value in exchange for a higher price tag.			"

												This is not a strategy game, this is not a ressource management game.It might be a nice game for your kids but otherwise I can\'t recommend it.I got misleaded by the comments thinking this would be a casual strategy game, which it is not.The soundtrack fits well the scenery, the characters are cute and that little of a lore you have is interesting.The game plays as follow: a mission icon popping out, tells you to upgrade \""X\"", an arrow points exactly where you have to click, congratulations, the next quest is on, click \""Y\"".There is no real ressource management as you will practically never run out of ressources, sometimes you may start building faster than you can produce but it has no penalties at all, you just wait until you get the right amount of ressources.As it is supposed to be casual I was surprised to find out that there is a \""line\"" of quests to follow. I would get stuck if not building in the exact order the game suggests me to do.The usual \""clickers\"" are more of a challenge but again, your kids might have fun.I got it in a sale making it a little less frustrating now that I went through it.

The characters look like they could be straight out of a Tim Burton movie or something, and there is no depth to them at all, which is kind of cool, but kind of not, because now I could potentially make up my own stories about them, which is cool, but it would've been nice to have more to the characters canon. The game is really adorable and I haven't experienced any bugs yet, but I have seen a couple reviews of people who have. Either way, it's cheap, especially on sale, and it's a cute time-killer or something to entertain kids (one of the kids I was babysitting was asking em questions about it and he was being entertained). Overall, it's a pretty solid investment.			"

The game also is lacking a separate worker page - until you get the circus and can just spam performances, there's not a very good way of tracking hunger/happiness levels.Wood is the bottleneck for most of the game - be prepared to wait all game long for wood to build your structuresLate game after exploring all of the locations becomes a grind.  Regardless of the problems, I'd say it's worth $1 to try it out the next time the game is on sale.			"

You assign your workers to do tasks for you, gathering resources. You use those resources to upgrade your buildings. You get little quests along the way which are usually just to gather X many resources or upgrade Y building. I don't like the look of the UI and ultimately everything is quite shallow, looks/feels unfinished and had no replay value or end game content.			"

												I actually have really enjoyed this game so far. Simple and fun with lots of stuff to do although waiting can be a bit tedious at time and the UI for menus needs some tweaking so you can't click things in the background while you have a menu open.A nice game for someone's first city-builder that's simple enough for someone younger but still engaging for someone older who just wants a game they can casually play. I have a finer review in video format if you'd like to check it out here Jalo Reviews.			"

												The Happy Hereafter is not a terrible game. However, the reasons why I cannot really recommend it (even to fans of the genre) are basically these:a) It seriously lacks replayability. Once you play through the ""story"", that's all there is to see. No other missions, no sandbox mode, nothing that usually make games of the city-building genre interesting.b) It gets repetitive. Fast. It's like grinding through levels on a WoW character or playing a Facebook/mobile F2P game: build, upgrade, upgrade more, gather, build, rinse and repeat. There is no real depth whatsoever and the ""challenge"" is basically optimizing your material production so you'll be done with the game as soon as possible.c) Short. You are done with the game in 4-6 hours or so, depending on how quickly you learn the ropes and how well you manage your workforce and assets.Though it is very cute and the graphics and overall theme are very appealing (which is why I bought this in the first place), I'd only recommend this for younger players wanting to get introduced to the genre. For anyone else, there are better city-builders out there.			"

What is The Happy Hereafter?The Happy Hereafter is a resource management game in which you are the mayor of a small town of Zombies and Ghouls. By letting your townspeople collect resources you are able to progress by constructing new buildings and upgrade existing ones, attract more inhabitants and discover the surroundings of your village.There is a story, devided up in a lot of missions, which is mainly about developing your town and getting to know the characters you come across whilst playing.Why I do not recommend the gameLet me start off by telling what I like about the game. I enjoyed the graphics, the characters you come across and some of the missions. There are also scrolls and statues to be found that give you bonus material upon completing the game.There were, however, a lot of things I did not like about The Happy Hereafter.The story is basically a tutorial that lasts throughout the entirety of the game in the form of missions: gather this, build that, go there, andsoforth.Secondly, gameplay consists of dragging and dropping villagers onto the resource to gather, buildings to build or research to complete. Nothing more, nothing less. You do not know how much resources there are left to gather per location and how fast they regenerate so as the map expands due to exploration, revealing new resource locations, this becomes increasingly tedious work.The game is also not balanced. Villagers grow hungry during gameplay and eat your gathered food, but if you periodically perform a bit of magic in the circus their appetite is reset. Resources are plentifull in the midgame and apart from the bore to collect them, are quite easy to stockpile. There are some enemies that try to steal resources, but defeating them is easy enough.Last but not least, I have encountered a few bugs. Some made the villagers non-responsive to me trying to drag-and-drop them, but I also had to start over once as the barrier I needed to clear in order to progress would not budge, no matter what I tried.All in all, this is a game without enough varied gameplay, lacking a real story, poorly balanced and occasionally bugged. Though I like the concept, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												while the first few minutes of gameplay are kinda fun, the game is serious lacking in anything new or interesting to make you want to continue.after slogging through all the gameplay that this game has to offer, i can safely say that this is a boredom fest... seriously watching grass grow or paint dry are slightly more entertaining activities.- you get to watch your towns'undead'people build in predetermined places, harvest the same stuff over and over and over and over just to upgrade everything to level 3... then the game ends.- there is no storyline beyond the intro, all the quests are grind this many bits of whatever and ill give you something you can already get by having your 'minions' grinding those items and using the trade depot thing.- quests dont help tell a story- nothing really new or exciting to make the game replayable in the least currently.- you can get 'special bonus items' for the extras/bonus menu things in the main manu, but the items are mostly just strewn around the map for you to find when you gain a level and can enter a 'new' area for you to do the same crap it... the items are only 3D statue things and pictures of stuff from in-game that really doesnt add anything new to the game to work for/towards. there are only 2 items i think in the entire (current) game that you get from doing specific quests.- glitches with a few quests and some of the upgrades for buildings and stuff dont really make any sense because you have to level the 'workshop' or whatever to level 3 to get level 2 items to build to level up some buildings to levels 2 and 3... when for everything else you need level 2 and level 3 items to get those specific buildings to levels 2 and 3 respectively, this actuzally makes sense.- the enemy, no ai/variety/etc.... there are only 3 types of enemies currently and the only difference between them is that you have to click one more time to get rid of each type: type 1 - click 3 times, type 2 click 4 times, type 3 click 5 times... thats real variety there and a whole bunch of fun, really?! this is the best they can come up with.if they took the time to actually put some story/strategy/variety into the game then this could be something that i would endorse, but currently do bother because its a SNOOZEFEST!, and will remain so unless more choices for things are given to the player.

												Casual indeed. This game does not offer much of a challenge for gamers. More of a resource management game than a city-builder.Pros- The style/atmosphere is somewhere between ""A Corpse Bride"" and ""The Book of Life""- Easy to play and understandCons- No flexibility in building (i.e. you can't pick and choose where to build)- There is no storyline or narrative to follow- The UI is terribly bulky and covers up corners of the map, limiting your vision and even covering NPCs- You receive an excess of some resources, and a great lack of others  "

I enjoy sitting down with a hot cup of tea and pecking at my quests for an hour or so. It mostly kills time when you have nothing better to do.			"

												This game is like spending the night drinking tequila, except that hours later you do not have a killer hangover or fun tattoos.tl;dr - This is just like facebook games, except you only pay once. Don't buy this game unless you are willing to wait for extended periods of time without much action.My mother had a Farmville addiction that was tearing the family apart.Thankfully, she's moved on. Unfortunately, she's moved on to all the other facebook games.I needed a cute little game to keep mother away from the facebooks, so I got this during the Halloween sale.I wanted to test it out a bit before placing my laptop in front of my mother, so I decided to play for a few minutes.Hours later, I ALMOST regret having started to play this game. What at first had seemed like harmless fun has turned into a great part of my day that I cannot remember except for sparse moments of lucidity where I recall sitting in front of my computer yelling at little zombies to work faster.This game is addicting, but not very fulfilling. STORY:There isn't much of a story, just enough to keep you from questioning why on earth you're sitting in front of a computer waiting for a little undead girl in an adorable dress to mine ore to build a house in a world that doesn't even exist. ART:The art is ADORABLE. Aside from the dopamine release when a project was completed, it was the art that kept me going until the end.PACING:The quests are appropriately paced to keep one interested throughout nearly the whole game, but they really start to lag towards the end. This is an issue when you realize that the game will ONLY properly run in FULL SCREEN mode.BUGS: Speaking of properly running, the little worker zombie positively don't. In the beginning, while there are only a few zombies, the little fellows walk and work happily. However, after about a dozen or so, issues start to happen and you have a bunch of workers not working because they're stuck in between objects. This is easily remedied by clicking on them and placing them elsewhere, but it gets out-of-hand towards the end.Buy this game if you like to make questionable choices with less than rewarding results!

												Pleasant family-friendly building/resource management game, probably takes about 5 hours to complete first time through.Resource management is crucial or you will be waiting around for building materials.  Personally I was always short of gold, but there is a limited production/trade chain which I could have used to better effect.  You also need to manage your own 'mana' to repel raiders and entertain your workers.  There is some spotting of objects scattered over the map but not much is made of this.The map is small and building placement pre-determined.  There is a constant stream of directions from your 'assistant' which ensures no-one can ever get stuck with this game.  The instructions are not imo optimised - so you can ignore them and construct/upgrade available buildings as seems best to you - you will get the building reward eventually and the game doesn't quite run on rails.And there is a very naughty leprechaun....

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is Point and click simulation game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere is a music slidebar available.There is a sound slidebar available.There are many resolution sizes available.You can play in fullscreen mode or windowed mode.You can have different profile slots.About the game.The game isn't scary or difficult at all and doesn't require alot of brain cells. You have to help these undead little friends building up a city or gathering resources. You have a set of workers which will gather resources or make buildings for you. But they do have a happiness meter and they will only start working if you assign them a location. Once they have a ""job"" they will keep working on the job until you will assign them to somewhere else or the resource spot is temporary empty. Workers will not go to the diner table by themself to refill their happiness meter. Which means you have to keep an eye on them and drag them to the tables.Game is short.You can't scroll the screen with the right mouse button. Which is a shame.Has an ingame options.Decent graphics.Ingame tutorial.Could be Monotone/repetitive.Calming music.Has collectables.Other things.None.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10			"

												The Happy Hereafter hooked me into the world (or rather, underworld) and I became addicted very quickly. The quests, cut scenes and map progression kept me interested, ah la carrot on a stick. Only a few minor bugs I found - a quest that couldn't be completed, minions bugging out and not being able to find their way to the depot from a section of the desert area (but could be manually redirected), and minions that had the same name. Seriously, I ended up with at least three minons named 'Phil'! Phil 1 - top hat, Phil 2 - green hair, and Phil 3 - top hat with slightly more weight on his right leg... I'm kidding, I really couldn't tell Phil from Phil.Which leads me to my main critisisms of this game -  when I finished, I got the feeling the developer had run out of ideas, or time, or...something. The ending was a little disappointing in the way it ""wrapped things up"" (I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't elaborate on specifics). Unfortunately, the way it concluded left me feeling unsatisfied - like I hadn't been rewarded for all of my hard work. Well, the minons' hard work...whatever. Also, the invasions (which I assume were included to keep the player on their toes) were easily overcome with a few clicks, and didn't really bring the element of stress to the table that this genre usually brings. In fact, there weren't any moments where I felt stressed or was punished for my mis-management. I'm not saying it needed to be super difficult, but maybe just slightly more challenging, or even offering a challnge scale option. However, I suspect it was the developer's intention to make the game relaxed without being boring. I think younger audiences will find this the right level of challenge though...unless they're some kind of child genuis. All of that said, I'm still going to recommend this game - it looks great, it was engaging, it was cheap to purchase, and I had fun -  all qualities I value as a casual gamer. It would have been super amazing if there were some achievements included and some improvements to the above mentioned. But in the end, it's a casual, 'busy-work' kind of game that is worth checking out. If the hereafter is anything like this game, sign me up! As a master of course, not a minon. Cutting down trees and mining will never be my thing - in this life or the next.			"

												This game is a quirky resource management and item creation game that is fun, but unfortuantely lacks in replay value. I'd recommend grabbing it on a sale, as it's worth the first run through, but once you've finished the map it's easy to lose interest.			"

												I like it, is funny and cute. BUT: in a certain level, after upgrading everything after level 2, my zombies are just walking in place and are incapable to work, which doesn't allow me to keep playing. So, I'm not as happy as I was after starting the game. Anyway, if someone can help me fix it, it will be perfect.			"

												It's a very soothing game.If you want a break from your games which you play 'seriously',it's perfect for that. Well don't expect a challenging strategy game, because as it is told in the tags is a casual game.Graphics are super cute and gameplay is fairly user friendly and enjoyable.If you need a relaxing game for a time off, give it a go without expecting too much.

												This game was very ""cute.""  It reminds me of a simple mobile game, except you dont have to wait more than 30 seconds for something to be built or gathered.  If youre looking for a very casual game that you can play while you watch TV, this will work.  The art style is whimsical and cartoon-ish, so its fun for younger kids.			"

												A nice casual game focusing on building and managing resources. Some kind of a solo offline village builder (with no artificial wait and no ingame purchases).			"

												This is one of the most addictive games I've ever played. I got it as it was extremely cheap, thought it'd be an alright time waster, but about five minutes in and I loved it. I can't even really say why I love it. Maybe it's due to the tasks being constant so I didn't really stop doing things, and there's a lot to do at once, so I didn't get bored. I will definitely continue playing this: the only reason I'm even stopping right now is that I should probably try to get some sleep.			"

												I absolutely loved this game. Played twice from start to finish. Really fun and addictive. I highly recommend it. I also loved the graphics and the general feel /atmospere. Felt really easy to play especially the second time, as I had figured out all the special abilities and combinations necessary to progress.			"

												This game is a really cool premise, and the management style is really cool. I also really enjoy just the cute morbidity of it all. Having said that, this game gets real boring real fast. I spent so much time just trying to get wood, and all I got was an upgrade! There are only about 5 essential things to build, and nothing really changes visually when you upgrade them. Had this been a free mobile game: perfect. However, it's really just a boring game after 5 minutes.			"
