AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Rush for Glory Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: Tower Defense; Strategy My Overall Grade: B Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 9-15 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre REVIEWRush for Glory is a relatively short and relatively sweet little tower defense game.  With only 5 towers and 10 levels, a handful of abilities, simple map structure, and minimally varied enemies: don’t expect this game to revolutionize the genre.  Nevertheless, for anyone looking for a new and solid tower defense game this will probably do the trick, for a little while at least.There are various difficulty levels which can (and should) be played in ascending order which essentially expands the 10 levels to 30.  The reason you will probably want to play through the campaign 3 separate times at each difficulty is because whenever you do very well in a level you will be given a “star,” which you can use to upgrade your towers and abilities in the meta-game.  Upgrading your towers and abilities will then allow you to do very well in the levels at the next difficulty, thus earning you more stars.  You get the idea.The store page claims there is an “elaborate techtree,” which there is not.  There are no branching options; you simply use stars to upgrade basic stats for each tower and ability (i.e.: range, damage, fire rate).  The upgrades are not permanent, so you can shuffle them around depending on what strategy you want to use for each level.One cool feature is the way your “lives” are calculated.  Most tower defense games give you a certain number of lives for each level, and it will be the same each time.  This is not the case in Rush for Glory.  Instead, you have a pool of lives that is maintained across all levels.  You can also accumulate a surplus of lives to a point where you will be able to beat any level easily— however, if you lose many lives in one level you won’t be earning any “stars” for upgrades.There are also minigames which are basically levels where you can only use limited towers and abilities.  The minigames are best utilized to stockpile a surplus of lives for the real levels.In summary, Rush for Glory is certainly a typical and simple tower defense game.  It doesn’t really bring anything fresh or different to the genre, except maybe for the cross-level-lives mechanic.  If you are looking for a solid tower defense game that you haven’t played yet, this is probably worth a shot.  If you are looking for the best tower defense game you have played in years, then look elsewhere.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Still playing through the game, but it has a couple of flaws that deserve a second look before a buy.1) LocalizationThe game tutorials and menus are full of typos and are occasionally incomprehensible. This would be more of a problem if the game's mechanics weren't almost all re-used from other tower defense titles. It isn't hard to figure things out, it's just that the game doesn't really explain them.2) MechanicsIf you've played Sol Survivor or Prime World Defenders, you've seen everything the game has to offer already. Except neither of those games was restricted to five turrets. You get a slow turret, a generic shoot everything MG turret, AA turret, anti-armor, and a mortar (AoE) turret. The ""research"" is ticking boxes off a list for an undisclosed ""attack boost"" on a specific turret or unlocking a randomly activated special ability. Upgrades on turrets are perfectly linear, with no real encouragement to do anything other than front-load your upgrades for maximum efficiency.In fact, the XP system on upgrades REWARDS stale front-loading.3) GraphicsI'm listing this here not so much as a flaw as a suggestion to look hard at the screenshots of gameplay. The graphics aren't fancy, but they are serviceable. 4) Personal Beef: Lack of OriginalityThere are plenty of TD games out there. Some are good. Many are not. This one does not really introduce anything new to the formula, and to me, that is very disappointing. Defense Grid did basic TD mazing best, Sol Survivor had a massive variety of turret types and active abilities, Prime World had its odd CCG-esque collectibles. Nothing in Rush for Glory makes me want to play it more or differently, partially because there are so few options to begin with.Things the game does well:Speed bar is really well implemented. Admittedly I run the game on full speed more often than not, but that's a personal thing I do in most TD titles.I'll be putting in more time with this later, perhaps, and will hopefully come up with reasons to change my recommendation, but so far Rush for Glory isn't filling its price plate.

												A decent Tower Defence game. It really is overpriced, I'd suggest 4-5 bucks for it. You build, you defend, you upgrade, you repair (never liked TD games where you have to repair your towers). Protect the base. You have 100 lives/people. Graphics are not much of an interest, music is nor bad nor catchy. Maps are a bit of challenge. Towers variety is poor, I'd say. Enemies are regular (No NecroTanks or something that makes you say ""Wow!""). And the good thing is that no matter what all that together is fun. At least this game is more exciting than many of it's genre. I'd give Rush for Glory 6/10 in it's genre. Thank you for your attention.			"

												This TD seems to be a tower spam clishee game at first untill you find it it's much more. The balans between firepower, leveling up the towers, keeping some money to get more 'people', calling in waves early and repairing makes all the maps interesting. The game is made 3d in a nice engine and good UI: keyboard shortcuts for most actions, all the information you want from a TD. Pro's: - New interesting idears: leveling / upgrading towers- Hard (dont expect to spam towers and finish the game, not even on normal)- Good UI- Polished working finished game- Leaderboards (just hope they wont be taken over by hackers like in Fieldrunners2 and DGrid)Cons:- Confusing at first, limited tutorial. Info like the 'people' are carried over each level wasnt made clear (to me)- Tower placement is unclear where you are allowed to build and where not. - Few maps, only 10 (with minigames and 3 levels)- The towerplacement in combination with the map design does not allow much experimenting with the tower setups. - Few towers (5, and 5 powers) "

												This game reminds me a lot of Savage Moon on the PS3.Long story short, it is a tower defence game, but a good one.  In the same way that savage moon was.  I quite like the small camera rotation moments when you move back and fourth, gives it a little sense of a camera being there, not just movement around the screen. You can also view the game from a turret perspective which is a nice little extra.  Though I like the little animations as you upgrade a tower, it would be nice to have an animation of the tower actually building on, for example,  starts with 1 gun barrel, then animates and slowly grows the second gun barrel.  I guess just like savage moon.  I really loved that game on the PS3, which is why I love this game so much, its very similar.  I recommend purchasing this.   I'm enjoying it so far.			"

												I have played for about an hour and here are my first impressions of this game...You start with 100 population in the beginning and everytime some enemies go through your defence, your pop goes down. So if you play bad for the first few level you are able to continue but at some point you are not able to do any mistakes because the game would end if population reaches 0.There are 5 types of towers to place. A fast shooting machine gun for air and ground units, a mortar for aoe damage, some freezer to slow down enemies, one for air units and the 5th tower is like the first tower but it shoots faster and attacks only ground units. For killing units you get gold and after some time your towers receive enought exp by killing units so you can upgrade them a few times and they have a bigger range and shoot faster. There have to be some space between the placed towers, so you cant just spam many towers in a small area. Each tower also got a passive ability that has a special effect on each type of unit that activates randomly.Each mission (i assume there are 10) can be played on 3 difficulties and you get either 1, 2 or 3 points for upgrading depending on the difficulty you chose. You can choose out of 40 things to use your upgrade points on. Things like earning more gold for kills or a lower re use of traps may help you to come back to precious played missions again to do them on a harder difficulty. Furthermore there is a minigame for each completed mission to get 1 upgrade point each. So it should be possible to unlock eall 40 things in the skill tree (10x3 points for missions + 10 for minigames)That brings me to the next point: traps/skills.When you progress in the game there are up to 5 special skills unlocked that have to reload after their use. They cost also some gold to use.The graphics are pretty nice. Even though im not a big fan of super nice graphics because a good game counts more for me.The sound of guns is pretty awesome too.10 missions plus 10 mini games should still take some time to complete. On 2nd difficulty it is pretty challenging too and you do not get everytime 2 points (2 points for 2nd difficulty) when you let too many units walk into your base. So it may be smart to do every mission on easy and try again later with more skills unlocked.Ok, there is no pause button ingame, so sometimes it gets a bit hectic especially when some enemy is close to your base and you have to think of what trap/skill or tower to use to stop it. But you can prevent that by not running the game on a high speed so you can look at it early enought.So all in all it is a nice game of a small developer team and publisher. I would give it a 8.5/10 rating			"

												I purchased Rush for Glory because I liked the look of the graphics. The levels are incredibly different from each other and well thought out. It does have a short story behind it, but wish it could have had more depth. (Maybe for the sequel?) The game actually gets quite challenging on the hardest difficulty as you will spend a lot of time micro-managing your units. A couple wrong moves can end the level really quickly. The game is quite short (10 levels) but for the price it's well justified. Well recommended.			"

												Cute little tower defense game; if you're into the genre, you're going to like it.It's around 4 hours of play (not playing the bonus levels), but you can replay it on increased difficulty until you get all the stars for a level (3 stars max) which you can use to buy tower upgrades (apart from the usual upgrades during the missions).

												For my online blog http://gamoha.eu i wrote an article in German about this game. Now i will sum up the results of our review and like to invite you to visit our blog: With the Tower Defense Game Rush for Glory Immanitas Entertainment and Parseh Game Studios developed a game which is easy to understand and offers an uncomplicated start for newcomers and fans of this genre. The ten different levels of this singleplayer game provide different game play experience and fun while playing. The various opponents contribute to fun as well and challenges the player during the game again and again. For the future we like to a have multiplayer mode and additional levels, because ten levels are not enough :)If you like to read the review in detail you can visit our German blog http://gamoha.eu/rush-glory-tower-defense-game-im-test/ "

												I did not play too much with this game, maybe I will give a try again later.- But at first, even the menu, and the ""descriptions"" of the towers made me laugh.Not because it is funny (or not the way, as it could be), but because the typos and the missing information from them. (It is a boss, have to kiss it asap...) Pff... thanks it helped me a LOT.- The gameplay was also boring for me, not becasue the troops were easy to kill (it were not on hard), but I did not feel that why I should hold them back. The camera angle is not changeable, so I should always move with the camera, to see the necessary things. One more negative thing for me, that the turrents can not be placed next to each other, and the radius of the ""unsuable"" area is not visible, so the turret placement is not easy at fast rate.+ To say something positive from the game, the turrets and the enemies were look quite good.As I see, there are more, much better TD games (even for mobile) which worth the money (e.g.: Kingdom Rush, Sol Survivor, Sanctum... just some of them which I played, and really liked).If you would not like to collect all tower defense games from Steam, than this could be skippable.

												Rush for Glory is a pretty mediocre tower defense game. You are defending the planet from alien invaders. There’s nothing too special here.  Building, upgrading and repairing several tower types. You also gain several power attacks that can affect all or multiple enemies at a time. The enemy variety is pretty good and even the enemies have special ability units that can heal surrounding enemy units, etc. There is an upgrade tree where you use stars obtained by beating levels to buff the stats of your towers and powers. The way you gain stars could be improved. You start the game with a total population of 100. As you play through the levels, if an enemy goes into your base the population will decrease. You only gain a star when you beat a level and your population is 100 or over. If you want to replenish your population, you are basically forced into playing the mini-games. They are special levels with a single task that net you a bunch of money at the end. Every 500 gold is 1 person. So if you lose 20-30 people on a level, you won’t gain any stars going forward until you play several mini-game levels. It feels like padding to increase the length of the game. There are 10 campaign levels, which took me about 3.5 hours to complete on normal. This was also doing a few mini games. I don’t really care for tower defense games, so I wasn’t going to replay the levels on a harder difficulty. But, you do gain more stars by raising the difficulty. The biggest problem with this game are the spelling and grammar errors. They are everywhere and sometimes I couldn’t even figure out what they were trying to say. I also wish there was a “Repair // Upgrade All” button. It’s very tedious to go around and upgrade each individual unit. Also the blinking icon for the pending upgrade can be lost in the background during a fight. Pros+60fps+Challenging even on normal+UI is good+Level variety Cons+Tower variety+Spelling & grammar errors everywhere+Process of gaining stars (read my explanation above)I would recommend this to any TD game fan. However, only if it’s on sale. $14.99 is too much for a relatively short TD game with tons of typos. 5/10 Average "

Fabulous little Tower Defense game who's only fault is that it is too short.Rush for Glory certainly deserves more attention as a very well done Tower Defense game -- the graphics are great, animation is smooth, game is challenging yet quick to pick up, and the game itself is simply very fun.  One thing I thought was particularly well done was the idea of spending your Star Ratings received on a level for turret upgrades for subsequent levels where you can improve a turrets range, damage, chance for its special attack, and all sorts of stuff!Another idea I haven't really seen that I really liked is the idea of Turrets earning their own XP when they kill an alien.  As a Turret earns XP on a level, it can be upgraded to its next rank (for a cost), but the turret now has extended range, more damage, and/or increased health.  Those that do the most damage, can get upgraded the most -- nice!On the Good Side:+ Great Fun+ Very well done and polished game.+ What levels there are are all varied and none feel the same, in fact, they seem more complex than typical.+ Good graphics, animations, and interface.+ Able to place towers just about wherever you like; the placement restriction comes in how close they can be to one another.  Great idea.+ You participate, not just by placing towers, but by activating Traps or Bombing Attacks.+ Towers themselves earn XP by killing aliens during a level. And when they are upgraded to the next level their range, damage, or health may increase.On the OK side:~ The campaign is just TOO SHORT -- I wanted more!  I can't mark a game down because I wanted ""more"".  The campaign, for me, was a very enjoyable 4.1 hours, though I'll be going back for a few more Steam achievements and possibly a harder play through.~ Voice narration would be welcome (as opposed to text)~ No intro, outro, or inter-level inematics introducing a story or level; again just text.On the Bad side:- I admit I'm being picky, but the sudden gunshot sound effect for receiving your Star rating is much too loud for me.  I play with headphones and that sound is just not at the same level as all other sounds in the game.  One of the few times I'm thankful I could only manage a single Star rating on most levels. :-)This fabulous little game could be my #2 favorite Tower Defense game after the ""Defense Grid"" series...if only this had a longer campaign.  9 out of 10.

												This is a decent tower defense game, if you're into the genre. I got it in a bundle, I would not recommend it at full price though.There are only 10 levels, but a global upgrade system and 3 difficulties reward extra playthroughs. There are 5 items/abilities that have cooldowns which are very helpful. To be clear, this isn't on par with something like Defense Grid, but it was still fun. Some negative points that stood out to me:Restrictive tower placement options along sides of pre-determined roads/paths -- no creating mazes hereThere's no indication of a tower's footprint, so finding the closest you can place towers together is trial and error (and you can inadvertently block a preferable tower placement with a nearby tower)Only 5 types of towers and no customization options (beyond special attacks that happen at random)Minor UI annoyances -- upgrade notices hiding behind the tower's current rank, hard to see upgrade notices with all the weapons firing, tower types are hard to differentiateLack of at-a-glance information such as how much a tower costs to upgrade and/or repair, and what an upgrade will changePoor English translationLittle to no battle sounds when zoomed out to any reasonable degreeHard to tell when you lose a tower vs. an enemy unit blowing upIf you don't spend an upgrade point right away, it disappears and you'll have to replay the level to get it backThe annoying ""sell everything during the last wave to get money"" tacticDespite all of that, it was still a pretty good game. It's not best in class, but it's nowhere near bottom of the barrel either.  The visuals are good for a tower defense game and it doesn't feel like it belongs on a mobile device. I can't imagine playing this over and over again beyond the 3 difficulty levels, and there doesn't appear to be modability or additional maps available.I took me around 3 hours to get through the 10 map campaign on Normal difficulty, which included a couple of the ""minigames"" (the same maps with specific restrictions, but you can earn cash to bolster your population).

												Typical tower defense game, with the first couple of levels seemingly too easy, then a major boost in enemy numbers and a stack of poorly defined game features.The path that the enemy takes is too wide for your towers to actually reach all the way accross. This forces you to try to build more towers than you can afford, with the ultimate result neing failure!Another problem is that towers very often just do not shoot at the enemy. This provides them with a get out of goal free ride all the way to their target!This game is pathetic, do not buy!			"

												A terrible game.Do not waste your money on it.There are only 10 levels, only 5 towers, not to mention that you can't access or use these towers until you finish few, super irritating, exceedingly annoying levels using just one thing, that isn't a tower... a freakin ""trap"" that disappears after 2 uses.So basically, before each wave you have to spend 10 minutes placing them around the map, waiting for cooldown to go down (cooldown before waves start? how stupid!)

												Its a solid tower defense game that is nice and polished. But its just soooo long.At first the game is epic with like 5 wave games. Not too short not too long. Keeps you at the edge of your seat.But then as you progress, the developers mistakenly think that more waves = more fun and the games start becoming like 20-30 wave games without the ability to pause or save in the middle. and it takes HOURS. Literally you will fall asleep at your keyboard.Instead of being a game of strategy and fun, it becomes a game of endurance. To force yourself to stay awake till the end "

												I walked into this game thinking ""This game was dug out of like the trash, this game is gonna suck really bad.""I walked out of it thinking ""Wow, that was actually really fun.I was geniunely surprised by this one.  /// PROs \\\  - Good sound design. - Good graphics. - Decently designed enemies, +they look good - Decently designed towers, +they look good - (Opinion) No pause between waves, constant barrage. - Balanced and good designed maps. - Easy to learn. - Fun! /// MEHs \\\  - The Snower is kind of annoying to listen to. - What story? - Typos/grammar - Doesn't allow for custom key bindings.  - Price. Maybe at most should be like 10 bucks. /// CONs \\\  - Really easy. (I mean, I did have my difficulty set to normal, but it was really easy.) - There is no real ""Upgrading"" your towers outside of waves. The way it's done is kind of bad. - No 'tech tree' or anything of that sort. - Tower placement is kind of bad and weird. - Few maps outside of minigames. - Doesn't allow for much variety/experimentation with tower placement on maps. - Few towers. (5)I don't really know what else to say about this game, other than I would recommend it if you're into this kind of tower defense casual gameplay.			"
