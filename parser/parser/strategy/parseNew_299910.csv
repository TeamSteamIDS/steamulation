												I'm a huge fan of Magic: The Gathering, and own most of the duels games they have put out, but the last few entries have been pretty disapointing.  Thus, when I see new CCG games come out I rush to give them a try.  Forgotten Myths is one such game and I really wanted to like it, as it seems to have a pretty good combat system and during my play time was bug free, but I found one huge thorn in the otherwise level playing field that forced me to give this game a not-recommended rating.Pros: Solid CCG, has what seems to be quite a few cards, factions (colors), and game modes.Good graphics, smooth animations for the most part, though watching my energy (mana) card animations got old fast.No game breaker bugs found like crashes, dissconects, etc.Cons:Really only one, and that is the huge paywall that is rather transparent at first but once you start trying to earn coins (the grindable free currency) and diamonds (the much less grindable real money currency) it becomes apparent.  Your energy cards come in 3 rarities and add 1, 2, or 3 to your pool when played.  You start with all 1 energy cards, but the computer controlled starting quest enemies soon start throwing down 2 and 3 energy cards, forcing you to play against someone with 2-3 times the resources very quickly.  This is especially apparent because you can be unlucky and not draw an energy card to use every turn.  You computer controlled enemies do not seem have this drawback, as in roughly 50 games I never saw an AI opponent not have an energy card to play untill it had exausted its hand at turn 5-6.  They also seemed to have a 2 energy card (if it was in their deck) about 1/3 of the time in their starting hand.  The ONLY way to get 2 and 3 energy cards is to use diamonds (you dont have enough at the start to even afford one) to buy ""energy card"" booster packs.  Yup, they shoot you in the foot before you even get started.TL;DR: This particular free to play game is sadly not free to play.			"

												Hi,Don't judge a book by it's cover!I say this because originally I didnt like this game. Like some of the other reviewers here, I spent very little time in the game and formed an opinion after seeing just the surface.I admit that the tutorial needs some work and there are some gameplay mechanics that aren't obvious. I've chatted and emailed with devs and have seen them make changes and fix issues pretty much immediately. There are still things to fix however they know about them and are working on it.So, to the game review!This is somewhat similar to other CCG games where you create your deck with cards and then play against an opponent (2v2 and guild wars coming soon).You start with one of three starter decks and quickly get a booster pack. I was very frustrated in my first hour because I was struggling in the single player missions (there are a LOT of them). That being said, as soon as I leveled up a few times I gained +2 energy cards which made a HUGE difference.Coins (the free in game currency) come fast enough that I was buying extra booster packs and even individual cards to strenghten my deck.One interesting aspect of this that is different from MtG and Hearthstone is Fortifications. They are back-row units that offer bonuses and can garison some other units for added firepower.Community is very good, I haven't seen a single troll in game and only 2 spammers (which get shut down right away due to the anti-spam feature of the chat).I suggest you give this game a try and have patience enough to get past the first few levels, it really opens up after that.The game has a referral system which confused me at first. Basically when you start it asks for a referral code which is the case-sensitive username of another player. As soon as you put in a code, you are rewarded with 2000 coins and some free cards (no need to purchase, just make sure you put in a real referral code). If you end up buying emeralds then the person you entered as referral gets a bonus just on your first purchase. If you put in my referral code: DeimosI will give you free cards if you end up buying any emeralds as a thank you. Please note that you need to reach level 10 to access the auction house which is how we can trade cards back and forth.Even if you don't purchase anything or even use my referral code, feel free to chat me up in game and ask any questions or even play a game against me.Hope to see you in game!tldr: Game gets much better once you get past the tutorial and gain a few levels.use referral code: Deimos in order to get 2000 coins and free cards, I'll also give you more cards if you end up buying emeralds as a bonus			"

												What FM does right:+ Offers plenty of rewards for active players.+ Offers an incentive to play and do well in ranked (Gems are awarded at the end of the month based on rank.)+ Offers strategic lane-based gameplay that is very interesting.+ Allows both players play the game simultaneously with alternating phases and initiative changes every round.+ Allows players to buy Common/Uncommon singles of all factions and to sell unwanted cards.+ Functioning Auction House.What FM does wrong:- Offers exclusive promo cards behind a paywall (which you can't buy with Gems earned for free unless you make an initial purchase of Gems.)- Tiers newer faction boosters (Green, Blue, Forgers) behind a level restriction (6, 8, and 10 respectively), unless you buy them for Gems, which is a bit much and can easily be misconstrued as P2W.Overall, Forgotten Myths is still very much a diamond in the rough, but if you give it a chance, you will find it to be a very rewarding and enjoyable experience. =)			"

												Heyas everyone!This is the first time I ever bothered writing a review. And i do this because this game earns it. Multiple times yes.Yes, the logout button i missing. Yes, there are minor flaws where one might need some helpful advice.And thats where this game really shines: The developer keeps watching the live chat and answers your question within seconds. I have NEVER encountered such a great support in any other game (and I have played many a game.)The pay-2-win accusation came up within me very quickly, and I actually talked about what to spend my (very few) gems (ingame 'pay' currency) on. The dev instantly advised me to save them for now because the game is still being developed. Many of the gem-only boosters will get a coin (free to play currency) soon.Of course there will be an advantage if you buy gems. Everyone knows that. But the longer i play this game, the more i realize how much you can achieve with just planning your decks and playing against the AI in a plethora of single player content.This is not an EA/Blizzard/Ubisoft game. Please keep in mind that indie means that the devs put their blood and sweat into this game!Two thumbs up from me.			"

												Review changed since release.When it first came out on Steam, this game had less polish than the Cossack Hetmanate in the 1600s. Luckily, the developers have been releasing pacthes rushingly, so it might just become a great game, if they don't fall into the mistakes of other indie devs, that is, abandoning their project once it made enough money.Regarding this, the game is Free to Play but borders on Pay to Win. It's still enjoyable if you don't buy stuff, but you'll be accordingly less weaker.The combat system is easy to learn and difficult to master. Some might enjoy it, some not.Give it a try and see if it pleases your palate.			"

												I am enjoying this game, though i will admit it took me quite a few attempts to pass the first few missions, but once you have an understanding of the mechanics it is actually pretty good. Try it and stick with it until you have finished the tutorial and i am sure you will fall for the game like me. Hopefully i will not be the only one to do one of the tutorial missions 7 times to pass it :)			"

												Short and Sweet: ""Forgotten Myths is Free2Play Mid-Level dTCG that will appeal to players looking for a card game which is much easier to access for normal players - while diehard players can get into exceptionally high skill ceilings, a new dTCG player will still feel comfortable playing this.""(Note: The ""Pay 2 Win"" accusation in one review is silliness - out of the dozens of dTCGs I've tried, this is one of the 3 least pay-2-win of the genre, it's by far the cheapest to get into, and one of the two easiest to get a full playset in without spending a dime)Disclosure:- I first got directed to look at Forgotten Myths in 2013, in its early alpha stages. Gave my critique then, and forgot about it for the most part (though I did cover the initial starter decks as well, as I am prone to do, being known for TCG coverage)- A few weeks ago, several active members of the Forgotten Myths community started popping up on my old coverage saying the game was coming to steam and I should come look at all the changes (several of which were things that I mentioned and that they fixed :D)I will post a video at the end of this review where you can watch the game in action, the first half covers the user interface, costs, etc. and the second half covers gameplay (you can click an annotation to skip straight to the gameplay) - if you don't feel like reading, that will be your best option.Main Bullet Points:Pros::: Affordable ""F2P dTCG"" - It is free to play, and it is possible to get a very respectable collection fairly easily wtihout spending real money (in fact, in terms of dTCGs, this is undercosted - it's cheaper than almost every other dTCG out there, and paying money is not required to advance - doing the Single Player campaign alone will net you enough for a few decks, without spending a dime). Community is also fairly active at helping people get the rarer cards they may have trouble getting. You don't need to break the bank or spend months grinding hardcore to get a full playset (unlike Hearthstone/Duelyst/MtG/Hex):: Good Entry or Mid-level dTCG - It is an accessible dTCG, simpler than some, but still enough depth of strategy to be enjoyable - diehard MtG enthusiasts probably won't be impressed by its depth, but fans of games like SolForge and the such, will find its got several layers of strategy and a number of nice features.:: Good Community - the community has always been nice, sure with the surge of Steam players that may change, but there's a strong friendly community that's been there for 3 years, and will help you out. If you see a DoW member, you can usually ask them for help.Cons::: User Interface still a little unpolished - being honest, it could use a little bit of work, it's still fairly rough looking, though it has improved - the gameplay is all there, but there's a few things they could do to make it 'feel' more satisfying (without changing the mechanics, the actual game is fun):: Prices are ""weird numbers"" - this is likely where the ""Pay 2 Win"" comment is coming from, the crystals are bought in weird amounts, and the costs are weird amounts, making the 'quick math' a little more annoying. They are planning to fix this though and adjust bought emeralds to match this. They were very open to the discussion on it, and took my experience with the genre into account during the discussion.I can go on further, and if you have any questions about the game, I'm more than willing to answer them myself - as I've gotten nice crash courses in many of the things I missed as a new player.

												I can't make sense of some of the other reviews here - I think this game is a lot of fun. I thought the graphics overall were very nice, gameplay smooth and the AI reasonable. Even if it didn't have great visuals, its a card game, what matters most is the game mechanics. That said, there are a few issues, although, they're nothing that I am going to hold against the game. 1 - Some of the reviews have mentioned that its almost pay to win. Look, the developers have to make money somehow and if the cards that are for sale aren't good, then people aren't going to buy them. However, not everyone is going to do this. Most people aren't going to bother paying, and when you face off against these people, its all fine. Honestly, even by purchasing the special decks, its not a guaranteed win. The problem is that there aren't a lot of people playing. If there were hundreds upon hundreds of people playing this game, this wouldn't be an issue. If you only have like 20-30 people playing then its a bit more of a problem. Because the game is free to play, I think it should attract more new players. The devs definitely have a very viable path to success that they're on now.2 - The biggest challenge with this game is the balancing. This is going to make or break the game. Its still in development, so there are a few issues at the time that I am writing this. I think this will sort itself out over time, and that's why I am not holding it against the game right now.  I would say that the different factions aren't all equal but I feel like this is something the devs can easily resolve if they listen to their community since the foundation for the game is already there.Overall, I would recommend this game.

												Unlike alot of the Negitive comments, I feel like this game has alot more to offer then many Card games I play irl. The UI needs some work and maybe some Dialog to make the game more interesting. The Gameplay itself is simple, fun, and Looking through some of the cards u can buy via in game gold u get from just playing npcs, you can make a very decent deck within 1 hour into the game. I see many stratagys so far and Ive only been in the game for about 45 minutes. I recommend this game.			"

												There's a lot of mixed reviews, but I quite like Forgotten Myths.Unlike other games like MtG or Hearthstone, Forgotten Myths plays fast, but doesn't have the potential for first- or second-turn winning decks, at least not that i've seen so far.I don't think it's worse than similar games, just different in a good way.Pros:Lots of interesting mechanics such as-lanes each creature must fight through-fortresses which boost creatures in the lanes they watch over-No HP cap on creatures (if you heal a card that has taken no damage, it's health will increase by 3)-Garrison (a personal favourite, creatures can enter fortresses and deal damage to opposing creatures before combat starts)-Ways to combat fortresses and garrsion (I haven't yet had a fully set up field of fortresses blasted to smithereens, but it will happen at some point)Very well executed game designSeems fairly balancedPossible to aquire Gems and Cards through tournaments, not just pay-to-winAbsolutely free, so you may as well give it a try if you like card gamesThe devs have responded to a lot of what was mentioned in previous reviews in recent updatesNeutral:Energy cards used to be unbalanced, but a recent update removed that. If a previous review cites +3 energy cards as being overpowered, they now have a chance of discarding another card in your hand.Cons:F***ing elephants. I hate elephants now. Also Rhevan PheonixThe Single-player campaign starts off fairly easy, but gets much more difficult as you progress, due to how the A.I. decks work. It has no card limits on decks, and combined with the certain cards mentioned above, this can become annoying.Althought this isn't the devs' fault, there's a small player base, making it difficult to find a match for duels. Again, this isn't the devs' fault.Three factions aren't imediately accessible at the beginning of the game, as they came in later expansions.In conclusion, I like the game, although I understand how others can be put off. It's free, and a very small download, so I suggest you at least give it a shot. It might just impress you.			"

												While the game is literally stacked against you, that doesn't actually make it more challenging or interesting.The basic mechanics are familiar to anyone who has played a TCG before. This particular game uses the ""stationary blockers"" approach, where you play units that will attack whatever unit is in front of them, or the player if they are unopposed. There is no mulligan and you are entirely at the mercy of the energy cards you draw (slightly mitigated by the fact you can discard a card to draw a replacement each turn).The UI is weak. Aside from the popup display settings when you start the game, all you can do is adjust the volume. You can only click to view cards when it is your turn to act, which means you may not know what the opponent actually did to cause something to happen. Also, viewing cards tend to get stuck on the screen until blind clicking eventually closes them. A lot of game information could be better displayed, as well as including tooltips to say what given abilities do.I only played for four days, each day running through one pass of the first single player mission set  ""Humble Beginnings"" each day. ""Humble Beginnings""  consists of five opponents and you have to play them 4 times to unlock the next mission set. This wouldn't be a problem except for how bland the opponent decks are, and the only difference that I noticed as the difficulty increased was how much life they start with, and how much energy. As you increase in stars, you face a bigger and bigger disadvantage, but as long as you can survive until the field is full, more than likely you will win in the end.I'm a fan of grinding, but this game grinds my patience to thin. Its definitely worth skipping.			"

												In my oppinion this is an ok CCG. It gives you a nice set of cards to start with, the packs are relatively cheap (about 30 wins = a pack).You can buy individual common cards for cheap (in game currency, no need for real money) so you can quickly upgrade your deck.The single player is standard.PvP needs more players and I had some connection issues during the short playtime.What needs to be upgraded, is the interface. And the game needs a better tutorial so I know what Archer,Flying, Garrison and other card types do. Because so far it is realy realy basic. Could put description in the Library (though maybe there is and I have missed it? But again, interface...).Overal: It's an ok relatively cheap CCG.			"

												Look, I'm sorry, I tried to like this game. I really did. The seeds of a good game are here and I did my best to stick with it as long as I could. But I honestly just couldn't like this game because, well, it's really, really badly-made.That's it in a nutshell: the game's mechanics are decent, but the overall package is just the most amateurish thing I think I've ever seen in a digital CCG. From the horrible-looking and awfully unwieldy full 3D rotational main menu, low-rez card art and crude-looking Unity assets, to the appallingly clunky in-game interface and impenetrable gameplay stemming from the godawful tutorial and complete lack of tooltips, the game just looks like a student project, or an early alpha. Never have I seen a game this carelessly user-unfriendly- after playing dozens of games, I still had absolutely no idea what half the mechanics did because they weren't explained in the tutorial, the game completely lacks tooltips to explain them (I never realised how vital these are until I actually played a game that lacks them) and there's no in-game documentation explaining them either. I questioned a few people in the chat channel and managed to get a few answers (ones COMPLETELY different to my best guess, which shows how unintuitive these mechanics are) and was basically told that I should have looked up the rulebook on the developers' website. Now why the hell isn't there actually anything in the game itself telling me that? Why should I even have to do something so clunky and counterintuitive just to learn how to play the game?That aside, the mechanics really are rather simplistic. You play Energy cards to increase, well, your Energy pool then use them to throw creatures down onto your attack line, structures down behind them, or play actions in your actions phase. You can't move or dismiss your own creatures once you've played them and who goes first in each phase toggles each turn, so a lot of important strategic decisions have to be made basically blind, reducing a lot of the gameplay to guesswork. The Energy system really bites hard- Energy comes in +1, +2 and ultra-rare +3 variants and, while you get a number of +2 Energy cards as you level up your account, the only other way to get them is by buying expensive Energy Boosters, packs that contain nothing but Energy cards. This system is painfully crude, the game is borderline unplayable until you get enough +2 Energys to replace you starting mess of useless +1s, and you're very prone to getting Energy screwed. The player who draws more energy will usually just win outright. The system is far cruder than Magic's Land system, and far less elegant than Spellweaver's Shrine system (which contains MULTIPLE mechanics to prevent you from getting Shrine screwed) and it's a serious flaw in the game.While the array of cards available for you to use are interesting, there's big problems with a lot of them. The game uses the same 5 colours of card as Magic, black, white, blue, green and red, as well as a neutral faction. Deck construction is limited solely by which colours are willing to work together- you can put black and red cards in a deck, for example, but not black and white. While I didn't experiment enormously with deck design (since the interface for deck construction is atrocious even by the standards of the rest of the game), there don't seem to be any limitations to how you build your deck. The problem is there are WAY too many card interdependancies. A LOT of cards gain bonuses from being played not only with specific classes of card, but even specific cards themselves! This means if you don't actually own the card that provides the synergy, the card is more or less useless, or at least drastically underpowered. There's way too much of this sort of thing in the card set, and the difficulty of acquiring new cards makes it even worse.I need to give special mention to the tutorial as absolutely the worst I have ever suffered through. It didn't so much handhold me as handcuff me, giving me my starter deck and forcing me to play through a number of boring mini-matches to learn basic mechanics in the most excrutiating way possible, every single action restricted to the letter, even if I could see an obviously better one available. After that, I was forced to play through the first 5 missions of the game's absurdly expansive PvE campaign before I was even given access to the rest of the menu options, including my Inventory or the Store- that's right, I couldn't even see my own deck until I'd beaten the first leg of the campaign! And these weren't simple formality cakewalk opponents either, my starting deck was so rubbish that some of them were actually quite difficult because they simply had better decks! It was so terrible I almost quit before I even cleared the tutorial. Apparently the devs heard the massive outcry about this and improved it quickly, but I can't speak about that since you can never replay the tutorial, so I have no idea what it's like now.You might see a number of other reviewers rubbishing the idea that the game is ""Pay to Win"". Now firstly, don't be absurd, ALL CCGs since the invention of Magic: the Gathering have been, by definition, P2W, or at least pay to get better cards which will increase your odds of winning. But I do have to contradict anyone who calls this game ""generous"" by CCG standards. To be honest, the game is EXTREMELY stingy. Packs are extremely expensive (3-4k gold when you get only couple of hundred for winning a game) and initially the all-important Energy Boosters were Emerald (real money currency) exclusive! Fortunately the devs realised what a terrible idea this was and made them simply cost more gold than normal boosters, but it still stings. You can earn Emeralds by doing a few daily missions as well as a couple when you level up, but they trickle in at a pittance. I've played a LOT of F2P CCGs and I've compared the free stuff they give you, and Forgotten Myths is definitely among the stingiest of the lot- where games like Spellweaver or Infinity Wars will regularly give you free boosters, Forgotten Myths will toss you a few Emeralds and tell you to appreciate it. Oh, and there are special promo cards that can only be bought individually with Emeralds, playable in all modes. And you can't buy them until you've spent real money at least once. The devs justify this with ""they're not especially OP"". Um, that's called ""selling power"" guys, that IS P2W and it's inexcusable.Technically the game is ugly as sin. The 3D 1st person rotational main menu is just plain annoying (you don't have to go out of your way to be special, guys) and the rest of the interface really shows its Unity base. Some of the card art is pretty good, but even on maximum settings it's jarringly blurry and low-resolution. There are almost no sound effects and in-game animations are extremely sparse. The music is initially OK, but rapidly becomes irritating in its intrusiveness until you want to turn it off.Oh and the PvP is so counterintuitive I was barely able to play a single match. There doesn't appear to be any matchmaking system at all, you have to host a game and wait for someone to challenge you, or challenge someone who's hosting. Maybe there's more to it than that, but once again, absolutely nothing was explained at all and I was sick of messing around with trial and error.Like I said at the start, I wanted to like this game. The devs seem to be trying and I can see the core of a decent game here. Unfortunately the game wrapped around that core is just really shoddy. I'm sorry to post such a negative review, but I can't be anything other than honest, and Forgotten Myths is just one of the least-impressive free CCGs I've ever tried.			"

												Oyunun en güzel yanı daha önce kart oyunu oynamış ve ya kart oyunu bağımlısı (ya da turn base oyunseveri) olmanızı istemiyor. Şahsen çok az kart oyunu oynamış biri olmama rağmen her gün oynadığım bir oyun oldu. Elinize sağlık. Herkese tavsiye ederim.			"

												From a CCG fan, i think this is a rly good CCG game, could be one of the best actualy but the interface is rly rly bad, they should work on that and redo some poub cause its a rly great game with good idea.Nice caimpain not too hard rly well made. Auction house you can use at lv 10 and buy card from other player make this game FTP 100% and easy. you get free card each day too and for each quest. LOTS of cards, nice strategie.Please work on a 100% new interface and maybe a little on the card and make some bug cause this game is rly good.			"

												It's not a good game. The software is still full of bugs and the Graphics User Interface (GUI) is pretty bad. You have no idea what's going on. You basically have a deck, 6 spaces for an Attack Zone, 3 spaces for a Fortification Zone and you try to wheedle down the opponent's HP to zero before your's does. Dear Anchora Games, please ensure that the game is properly tested before release. Thank you.PROS1. Similar to other CCGsThe combat system is similar to games like Might and Magic: Duel of Champions (MMDOC) with multiple lanes and auto-attacking units. CONS1. BugsLots of bugs. a. You have problems registering an account, b. The atacks are not animated so you have no idea what is attacking.c. Certain objects stack upon one another in the loading screens2. TutorialExtremely silly. You are forced to play the tutorial in a fixed manner, rather than a menu of all the actions.3. Extreme Pay 2 WinJust like any other CCGs, you must buy more cards with cash. In this game, it's even worse as Rare cards are more powerful than their Normal counterparts.			"

												to many bugs, everything is so slow when u try to scroll around. not able to fullly make decks from all colors. example. u can make red and blue deck ect, each color is has 2 colors that it can combine with.i got this bug that my files keep getting messed up or something, i would go do a file check to fix and would just get correpeted after i run game, in which prevents me from logging in game server. or i just get a blank screen when u load game. there is no pause button in story mode. the maket place is stupid everything cost way to much. game server is small and only about 5 guilds in game, so that in itself is not worth it. stay away from this game.

												Forgotten Myths CCG is a free to play CCG.  It worked, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok.  Has some different features on the battle table, like fortifications and it is 6 card slots per side.  I am not interested in this game, so i didn't play it much.Try it, you might like it.

			Forgotten Myths is a Free-to-play CCG that I covered a few years back, but the devs have actually done a lot of work in preparation for a steam release very soon.

												game getting better the more you play, but its not balance ad all. The difrence between the cards is to big, not that its hardcore pay to win, there are cards in all classes and rarity that are unbalanced OP/UP.Game idé is good, but before they nerff some of the cards its not worth my time.

												Recently, the developers admitted that they can no longer support the costs of Forgotten Myths.""Nevertheless, there is a solid game design in FM, with a wide range of features, and a lot more to come. It has massive potential, and we know that many people who play the game actually think it's better than most of its competitors, but the lack of activity or sloppy implementation kills the fun. All it needs is proper implementation and marketing (which I can't do on my own and without any funds). So, if anyone is interested in purchasing FM and keeping it alive or nurturing it, I am more than happy to do that and see it live rather than see it dead.Moreover, I am more than willing to continue working on FM, if the new owners can compensate me or pay me""This are the words of the designer and developer of Forgotten Myths CCG. I am part of the community and i don't want to let this game die. I personally think it has potential and it would be a great source of income, if good invested. You can also watch the Kickstarter trailer gameplay for more visual information.FOR ALL THE COMPANIES/PEOPLE INTERESTED INVESTING IN THIS BUSINESSCONTACT THE DEVELOPERsupport@forgottenmyths.com or emre.ozturk@anchoragames.com "

												GAME SERVERS SEEM TO BE SHUTDOWN NOW.________I know that below, I've listed a bunch more cons than pros, but the game is new and these problems are easily fixed. If they remain as problems, I may eventually change my review. Overall, I think the game is worth a try currently.Pros:Gameplay is pretty fun.Similar to the defunct Might and Magic card-game combined with Magic: TG.Cons:Poor UIBlurry graphicsEnergy system is not only bad, but a big p2w barrier.Tutorial forces you to make bad playsImmunity cards (Protection from ____ )Can't inspect enemy cards on their turnClicking on things doesn't always workLimited deck building interface			"

												Hi guys! :DAfter playing this game a lot(i've played in all previous beta) , i must confess, this is the best CCG/TCG ever on the market. The staff keep involving the game all the time and puch it to a new level! Artwork is the most beautiful of all card game. Forgotten myths is very well balanced and easy to perform without buying gems(spending money in game). I recommend it to everyone and at least, give it a try and you will probably be like me: Addicted to it ! :DHope i'll see you in game!You can add me as refferal for a boost start: karg			"
