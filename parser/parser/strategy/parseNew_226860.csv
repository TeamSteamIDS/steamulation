												In and of itself, I would narrowly consider this a good game.However, I write to note that when compared with Gal Civ II, which I played extensively, there seems to be little more in GCIII than an updated UI and cleaner graphics. One must buy a dlc to unlock 2 of the major races that were originally in II. I followed the emails and other updates during development, and also participated in the beta, and I feel that GCIII is more of a cash cow than anything else. There was a ship designer in GCII; they emphasized that it would be improved in III before release, but it is almost identical to that of GCII.This game is worth $40 only if they gave you all the dlc; buy it on sale, or from a cdkey site for a discount. Otherwise, enjoy GCII which feels more realistic and balanced in terms of AI behavior. It's amazing how they can make $50 of dlc for a $40 dollar update of GCII.I leave with this: is it fun? Yes. Is it more fun than GCII? Not really. If you enjoy masochistically having your wallet ransacked, this is your opportunity. I have liked Stardock in the past, especially with Sins of a Solar Empire, among other games. They, unfortunately, now resemble EA or Activision.			"

												It is the night before release.  I have spent a lot of time over the past 14 months with this game.  I loved Galactic Civilizations 2.  I had high hopes for version 3.  In the last few weeks of the beta things really started to fall in place.  If you enjoyed playing GalCiv 2, then this is the game for you.  If you enjoy building an empire, exploring and establishing relations with other species, crushing them under your heels, building an economic monster or just spreading the wonder of you then you will enjoy this game.  If you enjoyed the ship designing in Galciv 2.  You will find the offset and mirroring tools to great additions.  The support through the beta has been first class and they had indicated  that they will to produce new content for a long time.			"

												I can not currently recommend this game for the full $50 price. Maybe later when the price drops or some patches come out to fix some things. There is just some real irritating flaws in the game that when combined with the other problems drop the game down the the blah level. Most could be fixed easily. Two and five probably will never change which is what will keep this game not much above the blah level.1. Capitals on a planet, The AI places them at random wherever it wants. Considering capitals give bonuses to surrounding buildings it makes a big difference on where it was placed. It seems to me that if I find an unsettled planet I should be able to choose the location of the capital. So because the AI chose a dumb spot for a capital you lose those bonuses because they go to waste. The best example would be if hexes were about the size of Australia and you were to colonize a planet with land masses like Earth, why would you place your capital in Australia and forfeit all bonuses?2. No retreat option for combat. Similar games (Master of Orion and Endless Space) at least gave you the option to retreat during combat, meaning you could take some damage and/or losses but at least have a chance to run away. So later in game if the enemy is bigger and faster then you do not stand a chance of getting away. At that point you might as well concede the game. Simply because a fleet can attack as many times as it has movement points.3. You can draw production in a shipyard from multiple planets over long distances to build colony ships, but somehow people just can not make that same trip. Yet these same people are going to climb into that ship you just built and travel ten times that same distance. So now you have to waste multiple turns just putting people into your colony ship.4. Technology specialization. What was the point in this feature? The specialization technologies can traded and you can find the specialized in anomalies. Which if you receive a tech you have no made a choice, you lose that choice. So if you wanted to specialize in a certain bonus, but a friendly AI gives you a different specialization tech, then maybe next game, unless you get lucky and find another AI to trade for it. The fact that you lose your choice of specialization is extremely lame. Never mind how it can get exploited in multiplayer.5. Battles are either ""quick result"" or ""watch battle"" meaning you have zero control on that battle. All of the battle tactics are based on what job tags you gave the ships in your fleet. Which means no singling out a target to kill first. The battles for the most part are not worth watching anyways because either option is going to give you the same outcome. 6. Construction ships and using the station option to call for one. Someone had a great idea to be able to have a space station go ""Hey I need a construction drone to build another module"" and you click that button. Then a construction drone will be built and sent to that station. Sounds cool right? Real cool up to the point that this feature will clear any orders an existing drone currently has. So if you manually sent a drone to build a new station, it wont reach it. So that means you have to wait to use this feature until your manual drone is done. This feature will clear orders a drone already has, but will not clear guard or sentry, so makign them in advance and planning on using this feature does not work.7. Excess research and production is lost. When the game calculates the end of a turn if it finishes building or researching something any points over that mark are NOT carried to the next project, the points are just gone. This just seems to make the game drag on and it also makes specialized manufacturing planets nearly pointless because so much can go to waste.8. Ship designer spamming designs. Whenever you get new technologies the ship designer will spit out new ships designs, which later in the game leads to having way too many designs to sort through. Stardock solved this in previous versions and other games by adding a feature able to turn off the auto-designer. Considering that feature exists in multiple other Stardock games the feature should exist here.9. Cultural expansion is ridiculous. It expands faster than you can explore early on. If you never explored it then how is your culture affecting it? About equal to the Roman Empire holding cultural sway over North America before they even knew it existed. The only way to catch up later is you disposable scouts with stacks of engines, lifesupport, and scanners which is about mid game. Since I have only played insane maps, then smaller maps probably run a higher chance of culture flipping.10. Rush production is really flawed. If you rush a production in queue then no other production points are gained from that planet or shipyard for that turn. On top of that rushing production is a set amount, even if you have the production item almost complete.11. The pirates are pointless. Four hundred turns in on a insane map size and I am discovering the same low tech pirates that were encounted in the first dozen turns. This makes them nothing but a nuisance, one that apparently the AI ignores. Not even sure if they attack the AI or not because the pirates will not attack anything stronger than them. So basically then end up as nothing but clutter to make your end turn processing longer.These are the just the basic things I can think of that should have been ironed out during the beta. Now for the technical aspects.1. The sound for cut scene movies. Apparently someone forgot to include cut scene movie volume with the sound options in the game. So it just comes out as a bunch of mumbling. 2. End of turn processing on large map. This is really what kills the gaming mood. I made it up to around 400 turns on an insane map before it was just too ridiculous to play. The time to process became about 2-3 minutes a turn, which really sucks if the only thing you do on your turn is spend a few seconds to click next turn.     The other issue is every time the end turn process it kicks in all the fans in my computer into overdrive just to keep up with the processing. Meanwhile you can not touch much with getting the ""not responding error"" from Windows. Which by the way if you are seeing that blue circle between turns, it aint a Stardock logo thing, that is Windows saying ""hey this program aint responding."" Which leads me to wonder if running the game is really good for the computer.3. Ship designer, great feature (seriously.) One tip though, you might want to save your game before using it. Otherwise you could be sent back to your last autosave it decides to crash. 4.  I received the achievement for the completing the first part of the campaign game simply by clicking to start it. Sounds petty and nitpicking, but think about it for a moment. That is really sloppy coding and testing. Where else in making the game were they sloppy? I think the first patch today fixed this along with a dozen other achievements, which basically proved my point.5. After about 200 turns the text on the UI starts disappearing. Which is really annoying with diplomacy options.I was one of those customers burned years ago by Stardock with Elemental: War of Magic. This release reeks of the same issues. The whole ""release it and patch it later"" attitude. About the same effect as buying an early access game when they are on the .8x builds. So in short, if you are on the fence on buying this, let me knock you off it. Wait and watch, in the mean time take a browse through the forums. Sure in six months of patch it might be a decent game, but news flash I doubt it will still be $50 price tag on it.If you are mainly thinking about the game mainly because of the ship editor then do yourself a favor and go find a free 3d animation program like Blender and learn something in the process.

												I put a couple of hundred hours into this game right after it came out. It was way too easy then, and I lost interest after a few games. I tried it again after the 1.9 update. The good news? The AI is vastly improved and occasionally competitive even on normal difficulty. The bad news? Bugs, bugs, and more bugs. The game hangs constantly. You can't always click on certain things without following elaborate work-arounds. Dialog boxes get hidden behind other boxes. Some dialog boxes open and close so fast they're unreadable. Settings for starbases and shipyards change for no discernable reason. My rule is this: I'll forgive a few bugs unless you're putting out paid DLC. If you've got time to work on paid DLC but aren't making sure the basic product is high quality, then you've got ethical issues as a game company. Developers seem to think that killing bugs isn't as profitable as DLC. I bet they're wrong. I can afford to buy all the DLC for GC3, and I would if it were working properly. Stardock is also quickly becoming one of my 'never buy' companies along with the likes of Paradox. If you put out enough bad product, eventually your reputation will catch up with you. Not recommended.p.s. I'm playing on a 2-week-old Windows 10 gaming desktop. If it won't run well on this, it won't run well on anything.Edit 2/20: I'm trying it again on v2.0. They still haven't fixed the bug that causes dialog boxes to occasionally open behind other screens. Or the bug that makes dialog boxes flash past too fast to read. Or the bug that makes some items in various lists unclickable. But I hear they're working on some kind of new #%@# DLC!Edit 2/23: I just got the bug where the game hangs. So they went from 1.9 to 2.0 without fixing a SINGLE BUG. Pitiful.			"

												General features (can be viewed as pros):-Race customization is fairly detailed-Ship designer is good, even better because you can use pre-existing models and modify them to your own tastes-Certain resources are linked to certain celestial bodies eg antimatter surround black holes, elerium in nebulae, etc. So a savvy player, upon seeing a nebula knows to explore it fully incase there is elerium and that a black hole is likely to have some antimatter surrounding it. -powerful resources like antimatter are more limited, but using them is non-destructive so there wont be buyers remorse, ie you'll get the resource back if you destroy the building/ship that uses it. This also allows you to use resources early in buildings tech, and then recycle it when a better option arrives, meaning that a player who can manage his resources well will do better than one who just holds onto resources until a ""top tier"" usage for them is unlocked.-massive maps are possible, so with the right settings it doesnt feel like a ""small"" galaxy or that you're running out of space (until late game)-starbases used intelligently can give an edge at all points in the game, especially economic starbases. eg rather than waste a building slot on your planet to raise approval, just get the approval upgrade on the starbase linked to the planet.-able to finely control research/economy output/dedication on planets individually, but also with the ""govern"" tab you can do this en mass, saving time. Same applys for upgrading ships, etc.-every planet has an event, which some may find annoying, but I think is good, allows you do add a slight layer of uniqueness to each planet as well as develop your ideology.-its actually more beneficial long terms to dabble in all ideologies to some extent, as long as your primary ideology has most points you wont have an ideological shift. This means you dont have to do the unrealistic option (as in some games with ideologies/religions) and devote 100% to an ideology. This also means, if desired, you can play on the basis of the moral choices involved for events/planets and still do OK in terms of ideological benefit (as opposed to number crunching the statistical/numerical benefits for each choice planet, etc)Cons- diplomacy at first seems well developed, but that's only for early game. Late game diplomacy is at best, shallow, at worst, buggy. ""Benevolent"" ideologies seem to hate pragmatic ideologies as much as ""malevolent"" ideologies, which is silly and means that as a pragmatist, you need to kill anyone else who isn't a pragmatist and can only really form alliances with other pragmatists. This makes a diplomacy victory in a large game close to impossible without a decent military (because you need to kill anyone who refuses to ally with you), which means its always going to be predominantly a conquest based game.--continuing on for diplomacy: enemies will gladly colonise planets within starsystems you have partially colonized and there's no warning to tell them to♥♥♥♥♥♥off (as in games like CIV 5), and the same for resources. Early game is basically en-mass resource grab if you dont want to be screwed over mid/late game.-pirates/barbarians in 4X games are normally some kind of great equalizer early game to prevent a military/expansion snowball (eg sins of a solar empire, civ, etc), but in this game they're just annoying and dont do much besides kill the occasional scout. also, AI dont appear to be bothered by pirates, so its just a player handicap.-once you start going balls to the walls crazy large military, the game will start glitching out your ""military power"" parameter, which means for the purposes of diplomacy, one turn later everyone will think you're the weakest, declare war/♥♥♥♥ with you even though you could wipe them out. this also contributes to the impossiblity of a diplomacy victory (without killing loads of people) -terraforming in the incorrect order can cost you between 1-3 tiles per planet, which is a fair amount. eg if you use a higher grade terraformer on a ""easy"" tile, you wont be able to terraform the ""harder"" tiles, as late game you can terraform as many ""easy"" tiles as you like, meaning its better long term to hold off on terraforming until you've researched it fully as it isnt always clear which tiles are ""easy"" or ""hard"".-money is weak, it can take anywhere between 5-15 turns to be able to afford to rush construction (pretty much the only use of money, besides upgrading your military ships) whereas focusing on manufacturing allows you to build anything in 1-3 turns. Basically as long as you break even with your economy, you can just focus on manufacturing and research. Its actually usually better to just decommission old ships and build news ones rather than upgrade them (which will make you bankrupt quick if you have a large army)---In other words with the diplomacy + economy balancing, there is no viable economy based strategy or peaceful based strategy. No matter what, you will always need the strongest military regardless of your intended method of victory (unlike some other 4X games, where you could have an adequate military and with good diplomacy/economy still obtain most victory types you desire). And basically to get the strongest military you need to focus on research and manufacturing.- united galaxies is but a shallow addition to the game, furthermore, if someone ever defies (which is almost always), they are permanently booted, which can lead to the ridiculous situation of having a united galaxy meeting of 2 members, while the other 6-10 races are ""defiant"" (yet have not formed another united galaxies).meh features:-culture. you must have decent culture to stop other races culture from ""flipping"" your planets, it also creates territorial space and (I think) it allows your ships to fly further into enemy space. problem is that if your culture is too strong it flips the planets of other races, including that of your allies. this makes your allies weaker and it entirely possible for them to be wiped off the map (further adding to the difficulty of a diplomacy victory). It also may land you a bunch of crap planets that you dont want to deal with. Fortunately you can give the♥♥♥♥♥♥planets to the minor races (who are immune to culture flipping)note: most of these issues dont apply to multiplayer games, this is predominantly a critique of single player. although culture flipping feature will suck when playing co-op with friends.Do I regret buying the game at full price? a bitam I enjoying the game? yesshould you buy this game full price? only if you plan to win/enjoy by conquest every time or if you only care about multiplayershould you buy this game on discount? yes, if it were at 25% discount it would be a good priceit should be noted that stardock have a good trackrecord for improving/patching their games post release, so I anticipate that some of these issues I have raised will be gone in the future.

												This game is so good... Too bad it's also pretty bad... :-(THE GOOD, THERE'S LOTS OF IT!!! - There are campaigns! Like, a real story mode in a space 4X. Awesome. - There are numerous different unique races to play. - Each race has its own very unique characteristics, and its own tech tree. - The aliens are well animated, and engaging.  - The graphics are top notch. - The immersion is real. You can roleplay this game, no problem. - The galaxy creation has all the features you want. And you can make it tiny, or large enough to blow your mind. - Discovery is fun! The best part of the game, really. - World building is fun! The second best part of the game. - Empire management is both challenging and fun! - You can design your own ships!THE BAD, THERE IS A LOT OF IT :-( - Many little things don't work right, and it adds up. For example, if you have multiple ships/fleets surveying anomalies or exploring the galaxy, they will all go for the exact same spot, so you have to micro-manage them, even though there is an ""auto"" mode - Often when multiple fleets are on the same hex, you will think you have one selected, only it's the other, and you will waste turns fixing movement and action errors; - Fleets will take an arbitrary and often nonsensical path to their destination, and there is no ""go through this way"" movement. You click and it goes, and you can only hope there is no enemy fleet in the way that it arbitrarily chooses; -  During events a screen will pop up and ask you to make decisions that will affect some aspects of your empire, without any way to check your stats before making the decision. So you are forced to decide blindly. - Basically half the interactions are badly implemented and ask you to make decisions without providing any way for you to call up the information in order to make the decision in a way that actually makes sense. - The AI cheats. Blatantly, even on the easiest modes. Get the most technology-favored race, and optimize all your worlds for tech. When you meet even the most tech-unfavored alien race, they will already be WAY AHEAD of you. And so on. - Too many things are completely random. One game I had 5 level 20+ planets (really awesome worlds) while other civs had none, and sparse level 10-12 worlds. Other times it will be the other way around. One time the strategic resources were pretty much absent, but one medium-sized empire had all 7 antimatter deposits in its control area. So basically the game randomly decides who will win before you play the first turn. I would be OK with randomness if the AI played on a level field with the player, but it does not.CONCLUSIONThere are so many good points about this game, it makes me want to love it. Yet, there are so many bad points, that this burgeoning love is never allowed to grow. Stardock really *COULD* fix the numerous issues, some of which form a collection of minor annoyances which are only hurting the game due to their numbers. And then there is the AI. It is said that GalCiv2 had one of the best AIs around. I have no idea what they did here, but there is no AI, only cheats.Bottom line, if you want to play a game where the outcome is decided almost before you start playing, then you should get this game. Otherwise, sadly, I recommend you pass, because you'll be disappointed.  Of course, there is also the multiplayer, although I have not tried that.			"

												I preordered this game, and I wish I hadn't. Returning players will find only disappointment; This game is less feature-complete than pre-expansion GalCiv 2 wass. Repetitive events, no espionage, single-minded AI. Even a year later, it's still plagued with bugs, glaring typos and art assets that seem like placeholders.Stardock have kept their focus on milling out DLC after DLC over solving persistent issues. Some of these cash-in DLC are brazenly based on features which used to be GalCiv/GalCiv 2 gameplay staples. Go play Stellaris instead, or Endless Space.			"

												This game feels like a pale shadow of GC2. I loved that game. My parents bought a battered copy of the collectors edition for me as a Christmas present many years ago. I remember obsessively reading about the development of the expansions in PC Gamer and I bought all of them on Stardocks unique service (which I haven't used in years). When I saw GC2 on steam, I bought it in a heartbeat and got a good 50hrs of play out of a game I had already played thousands of hours over the course of my childhood. I honestly consider GC2 to be one of the best, if not best, 4x games I have ever played. So it  pains me to say GC3 feels like, in many ways, a step back. It lacks much of the complexity GC2 had at its end of development state. Gone are the unique tech trees and planetary super weapons. I hear asteroid mining has finally been added and the AI has been brought up to a respectable level of quality so thank god for that.Perhaps what irks me the most is the loss of detail and ease of use when it comes to managing your very large empire. GC2 had sliders for everything and a big, in game spreadsheet where you could interact with all your planets without having to view each one. This made playing super large maps very easy and while the new circle slider may look pretty on small maps, it is painful to use when you have 100+ planets under your sway. Then there's the starbase management. This was a problem even in GC2 and you think they'd come up with a solution in all these years.My final gripe is the DLC. Really Stardock? I used to admire you for releasing respectable expansions but this is just pathetic. Lump all those DLCs into one or two expansions packs because the one you have (mercenaries) is paper thin by your own previous standards. I don't understand. Do you guys feel you need more money so you're releasing tidbits of content? If  that's so, why did you almost immediately sell this game at $25? I would have gladly paid $60 if it meant you guys would actually put out meaty expansion packs.So yeah, I don't recommend this game. It looks a little bit prettier than GC2 but is inferior in just about every way to a varying degree. I feel like crying after writing this.			"

												At this time I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone except the most die-hard space 4x fans. I want to love the game. I really do. I've played it a lot but most of my time has been bug-fixing. Fixing typos, errors, and what can only be described as sloppiness. It feels like I'm beta-testing a game and trying to patch the game myself. I've tried to push through this, but even ignoring all of the bugs and crashes gameplay itself is shallow. Civ5 has much deeper gameplay. GalCiv3's gameplay is just so simple. When you get down to it, past all of the glitter, it feels almost like a mobile game. There just isn't a lot of depth to the game.If you are a die-hard 4x fan and can't get enough turn based space games, then go for it.The rest of you? Stay far, far away. GalCiv3 in its current state is a bug riddled, bloated, crashy, unstable mess. Expect your game to crash to desktop without any warning or error messages. Fortunately it has autosave, but there are so many stability problems that you're going to need those autosaves.To start with, the positives. The game is gorgeous. It looks so very pretty. The ship designer is amazing. You can design almost any ship you want, anything from an Imperial Star Destroyer to one of Starfleet's finest. The level of customization is immense. The game is also very easy to mod as it is based on xml files, so tinkering is easy. All you need is notepad.Unfortunately I've now finished the list of positive aspects of the game.The game is riddled with typos, both spelling errors visible in the game as well as typos in the xml files that run the game behind the scenes. Research buildings are flagged as factories. Ship blueprints are poorly written, so that ships will be built with the wrong ship modules or missing vital ship modules entirely. This also leads to a very poorly performing AI because it is stuck with the stock ships. You can design your own ships, and by designing a well balanced ship you will be able to smash the AI.To make up for this, at high difficulty levels the AI blatantly cheats. This game doesn't have an advanced AI. Its only made challenging by cheating. The AI ignores fog of war. It gets free production, free money, and free science. Its ships get more range and can install more modules than you. It also outright gets free technology every few turns. It needs all of these things to keep pace with a human player, and even then, the AI isn't much of a challenge except for sheer brute force due to cheating.The AI isn't clever. It appears to pick a random planet to attack. It builds lots of ships and keeps flying it at that planet until it gets lucky. Unfortunately the AI forgets to build any transports on a regular basis, so it has trouble actually capturing planets. Diplomacy with the AI is very limited. You can trade things with the AI and you can declare war/peace with the AI. Thats about it. Want to get one AI to form an alliance with another AI? Can't do it. You can ally with everyone but you cannot broker peace in the galaxy. The AI's diplomacy is also mostly based on power. Do you have the most ships? Everyone loves you. Do you have the weakest fleet out of everyone? Everyone hates you and will declare war on you. Thats about as fancy as the AI gets.The game is immensely bloated. 6gb of RAM isn't recommended. 6gb of RAM is barely the minimum. The game can use upwards of 5gb of RAM just by itself. Windows is going go use anywhere from 2-3gb of RAM. You need at least 6gb of RAM free. Not installed, but free/unused RAM. So you're looking at 10-12 of installed RAM to properly play this game. In terms of visuals the game sure is pretty, but its pretty on par with Civ5. Its a turn based strategy game. However the memory usage far exceeds that of Civ5. Your computer may be able to play Civ5 without a hitch, but its going to crawl on GalCiv3. For some reason the game uses vast amounts of system resources (mostly memory) but it doesn't use them efficiently in an way. Expect your page file to get a lot of work. Your virtual memory is just a swap file on your hard drive. This file is going to get a ton of usage due to the memory requirements for this game. Hard drives are very slow things and virtual memory is to be avoided at all costs due to its terrible performance. Well, for GalCiv3, thats just what happens. Expect to chug along, especially if you're trying to play on a bigger map.Management of your empire in game is also a chore. It chugs along. There is zero macro-management and zero automation. You have to micromanage every single planet, starbase, fleet, and ship in your empire every turn. On a tiny map its tolerable, but on big maps? Its micro management hell. And its not the fun kind of micro management. Its pure busywork. Its pure tedium. Starbases are particularly bad. They require a staggering degree of babysitting. Even planets, if you have a lot of them, get bad. There is no way to automate any planets in your empire. On a big map you might have dozens or potentially even hundreds of planets on the biggest map size. Every single planet must be manually ordered to do everything. Its just not fun. It is absolutely tedious.That said, negatives aside, the game has a lot of potential, but it feels like I'm playing an early beta build. Its just so rough. The game feels so unfinished. This game is not ready for release yet. Not even close. This is not a finished product nor should it be advertised as one. It hasn't even been optimized yet. It is a bloated, buggy, incomplete mess, but at the same time it is a gem in the rough.Unfortunately gems in the rough aren't worth much. They need to be polished first. GalCiv3 is lacking any and all polish. For comparison, I'd say that Dwarf Fortress has fewer bugs and is more stable than GalCiv3. Dwarf Fortress feels more polished than GalCiv3. Thats right. You heard me right.Dwarf Fortress  is a more polished, stable, and bug-free game than GalCiv3.So if you're a die hard 4x fan and want another 4x game regardless of how unfinished it is, by all means, pick up GalCiv3. Just be prepared to forgive a lot of problems with the game. You're going to have to overlook a lot of issues with the game.			"

Early Access Review
								I was a huge fan of GC2, and purchased the beta several months ago. While the rollout of the beta updates has been slower than I would like, the game is finally at a point where it is playable. It still needs a lot of work and a significant ramp-up of the AI, but I am starting to see the game take the shape I was hoping it would.Note that I have played every AI difficultly so far.Feedback for the designers:- The game engine is running well. I rarely see a point where it is just sitting there processing something or slow/clipping. Keep up the good work as everything is added in!- Have the AI place a higher price on their ships. I am able to trade for a enemy ship with cash only and pay FAR less than it would cost me to rush production. The price for a trade or a rush should be a lot closer. This is most evident in the initial survey ship. I find it hilarious that I can quick research Universal Translator and immediately buy everyone else's survey ship by trading open borders and a small amount of cash, leaving all anomylies on the map to me only (which pays back that cash VERY quickly, not to mention the awesome bonuses).- The price they place on their starbases is more appropriate than the ships, but could also be raised a bit (especially mid-to-late game).- Have the AI be more effective when trading techs with each other, and come to the human player with trading opportunities. It is almost laughable that I can ""make the rounds"" in the diplomacy window every 25 or 30 turns, only trade one of my techs, re-trade everyone else, and end up so far ahead in tech, cash, and ships as a result.- The Ultra-Terraformer is TOO EPIC! If it is that powerful it should cost a lot more of research or the AI should place a lot higher value on that line of research. So far, I have been able to ping-pong back and forth between manufacturing and research techs (keeping tech pace with the other races through trading), then start researching the terraforming line once the majority of my planets have built the majority of their buildings. Once I get to Ultra-Terraformer, the game is essentially over because I am able to build top-tier ships in a single turn due to the manufacturing adjacency bonuses. Another example is that with only 2 economic-centric planets I was able to get a per-turn income of 8K just from those 2 planets; no more need to trade techs...just buy them from the other races!- I'm not certain how the Hyperion Shrinker actually works. The ship designer doesn't allow me to build a design specific to a shipyard (that I can tell), and the help text on the Shrinker seems to indicate that it only affects the shipyard the planet is sponsoring. Am I able to fit in more ship components on my Shrinker planet somehow? Or is the help text just wrong and it actually applies globally?- I have run into many crashes, which have mostly been a result of me trying to perform operations too quickly or taking actions while a turn was running. I assume that these crashes are reported to you automatically, but might it help if you pop'd up a message window on crash where I could explain what I was doing? In many cases, I could almost write the bug report for you because by the 2nd or 3rd crash repeat (loading from autosave) I have a very good idea of what type of (if not the exact repeatable) action that I know caused the crash.- After playing around with the various ""Rare, Uncommon, Common, Abundant"" settings, I am a bit confused by how the map creator determines what is actually generated. It would be great if you could provide an approximate number of black holes, stars, planets, ratio of habitable planets, etc on the game creation screen so that I could adjust the dropdowns so that the map is created how I expect. My personal ideal map for small and medium sizes consists of 2-3 habitable star systems per race which contain a total of 4-5 habitable planets within the system group. So for 6 players I would want between 12-18 stars with habitable planets and 24-30 habitable planets spread amongst them, but I am having trouble determining how to get the generator to actually create that consistently.

												Lets take the rose tinted nostalgia glasses off for a moment and really address the issue most negative reviews try to bring up about GalCiv3.  ""This is a pale comparison to GalCiv2"".  Gal Civ 3 is better in 95% of the game than Gal Civ 2 was.  Its bigger, looks better, has the massive majority of the same mechanics, and offers some new things as well.  I was playing GC2 literally up until the point that GC3 became available to me so I have a pretty good frame of comparison for the two.  GC2 was an amazing game, 10 years ago that is.  I haven't noticed any bugs, never had any crashes, and often play very long games on the most massive of maps.  Is the game perfect?  Absolutely not.  There are a few frustrating mechanics, the UI isn't as intuitive as it could be.  I felt like the star base mechanic wasn't fully realized.  Do these small problems make it worse than GC2?  Absolutely not.  Play 10 hours of GC2 and you will be able to jump into GC3 and know exactly what to do.  Its an upgrade of almost the same game.  Its weird when a bunch of 26 year olds can't understand why a game doesn't engage them the same way it did when they were 16.  Well you've changed a lot since then, your mind doesn't allow that same kind of wonderment due to the endless amounts of stimulation.  There are a lot of reasons people look back on the past as being better than it really was.GC3 is a great 4x space game and a pretty big improvement over GC2, despite what nostalgia laced fan boys might want you to believe.

Early Access Review
When is beta a beta?When about half of the UI buttons are greyed-out and read ""COMING SOON"" and your game is missing one of its' major mechanics (the Diplomacy in its' entirety)... Yeah, I'm sorry Stardock, but you don't get to call your game a ""beta"" yet. Late-alpha at most. Certainly nowhere near beta.When the chance of getting the game running off the bat is something of a 50-50 due to a graphical bug that can render all UI text invisible, you're not a beta.Now, I only recently got into the Gal Civs 3 ""beta"" but from what I've gathered on the game's forum, that little issue has been around since the last apha build. So there's that to look forward to if you just got the game.The issue's ""easily averted"" by telling the game to not use your dedicated graphics card. And once you're past that, well then- Welcome to Gal Civs 3: COMING SOON. Ok, I won't rip on an Early Access game for not having all its' features present. But really?""Beta"" implies you're ""feature-complete"". I.e- you've implemented all of the major mechanics and features you intend for your game and are balancing and tweaking them for best effect, along with dusting for the odd bug.The current state of the Gal Civs 3 ""Beta 1"" is missing all sorts of features. From tactical combat to the above-mentioned Diplomacy mechanic. Instead, once you meet another faction you're immediately considered ""at war forever"", which makes playing against more than one opponent tricky at best since they will all kinda gang-up on you. Even if they them selves are technically at war with eachother, the AI will much prefer targeting your ships and colonies over other factions'.Targeting ships and other stellar... targets (wow, such vocabulary) in itself is kind of underwhelming since fleets in themselves aren't really a thing yet either. Meaning most of the combat will involve single ships. Winners are auto-determined by a stat-check and apparently nobody bothered telling captains that retreat is an option.The game also seems to have a hard time letting go of its' pre-made ship designs. It generates a ""new version"" of the stock designs every time you unlock a new technology (even if it had nothing to do with spaceships). What's either sadder or funnier about it (also irritating) is that they're not even slightly different than the previous version it gave you. Unless you've unlocked a new module, that Corvette M1459 will be the same as the Corvette M1458. It just adds the next number up after the name of the design. No, game... I know you spent many a sleepless night over those blueprints but why would I use designs that are inferior to the ones I come up with. That and mine are inspired by Star Trek... Yours look good and all, but again... Star. Trek. (I mean the designer literally has all the parts you need to make your own TOS Enterprise or TNG Warbird.)Speaking of the ship designer. Who's the genious that made the background pitch black and then gave the parts' no lighting effects when viewed from below? I already wear glasses. You're not helping, game... The camera controls are also glitchy at times and somewhat frustrating, but that can be deat with. The designer also fails to tell you what direction is forward. Or to give you a unified indication of which direction you're augmenting a part (dimensions are relative in space). So if you ever wanted to see how the USS Enterprise moves in reverse... You can do that...Other than that, I don't have any major complaints. Some part models are missing thumbnails and the player-made ships don't have thumbnails as well, but at this time, that's a non-issue.The designer is really impressive, quirks aside. Other ""reviewers"" compare it to the Spore one, since I'm guessing the one from Gal Civs 2 is before their time. But to compare it to its' past iterration would be like comparing a crossbow and a rifle.Although not that graphically advanced, the fidelity of the game's textures is impressive. I can see why they're going for the whole ""64-bit development only"". And both the devs and I do mean it- if you're hoping to somehow frankenstein this on a 32-bit machine- forget it, the warning at the top of the Steam page is there for a reason. Even the smallest maps available are quite big and the game renders everything at all times. Ship icons on the map are the fully-rendered model of the ship in question, rendered to its' fullest. There can be a dozen black holes on the map, all animated and spinning at all times, as well as stars with planets and moons; and although planets don't spin around their suns (yet?), the moons do. There's also nebulae, dust clouds and asteroid fields, as well as randomly generated wormholes that can be used as shortcuts around the map (if you don't mind not knowing where you'll end up). And everything's always on. For all factions. The game doesn't drop a single model off memory. Which means that A) It runs like a truck. Alt-Tabbing is guresome, albeit not impossible, even when running it in a window. Loading times are also a pain. With optimisation it's probably gonna get better. But then again B) The actual in-game response is really nice. Once everything's been loaded at least once, the only long waits you're gonna have are if you're loading between multiple saves. You'll still get the odd stutter but that's usually when the game autosaves and takes only a second.The technology and ideology trees are vast. Really, really vast. If you thought the ""tech-web"" from the upcoming Civ: Beyond Earth was staggering... This might just one-up it. While not an ""interconnecting web with randomised technologies"" and still sticking to the tried-and-true linear tree, each faction gets its' own, separate, technologies with different benefits, increasing the variety available to the player. The whole ""age of expansion, war and ascention"" thing means that at certain times, different techs will cost more or less turns, depending on what tree they're from. Since the ages actually progress as you research technologies under them, it also means that you can't actually research every single technology (as far as I can assume, haven't gotten to the end yet; will change as I do).The ideology system is equally interesting, albeit as of yet not fully-featured. As you colonise worlds you'll get events with a Pragmatic, Benevolent or Merciless resolution. Each adding to a pool of points you can spend towards some form of passive benefit. That's pretty much all there's to it right now but I'm intrigued at how they advance this feature.And that sums it up, for now. The AI is from what I can tell limited to ""expand as much as possible and produce as many ships as possible"" which usually means they have control of about half the map by the time you encounter them and from then-on you get regularly assaulted by the stock ""bomber"" ships of the faction of your choosing, only later, and then still rarely, being ""graced"" by a larger vessel's incursion. Imagine someone releasing a swarm of mosquitoes that only comes in small waves and you have a bug-zapper and infinite supply of repellant. Not really a challenge unless on higher difficulties but I'm expecting that to change once they add Diplomacy and fully-feature the tactical combat.Other than that, I have nothing else to say about the Galactic Civilisations 3 ""Beta"".Due to Steam insisting on the ""yay-or-nay"" system, I'm going to ""thumb up"" this just because I have faith in the franchise. However. I will insist on what I said in the begining. A ""beta"" is ""feature-complete"" and Gal Civs 3 is anything but that. Do not buy into it at its' current version (""Beta 1""/Ver 0.40) unless you're absolutely OK with not having a fully-featured game. As a long-stanging Kerbal Space Program fan, I can deal with that. But you need to answer that question for yourself. Think before you buy.Addendum: I would strongly recommend the opt-in patch.			"

												I have 111 hours on record as of this review, so I have played it a bit.Now, I'm sure whomever is reading this is looking at those who do not recommend the game, and take their criticism into effect when committing to purchasing a game. I do that as well. When I say I would not recommend this game, it is not because it is not a good, or even great, game. I absolutely love it. However, this is not a game for everyone. This is not a game most of my gamer friends could get behind, even those who love strategy games. It is far too...exotic, that it almost feels like it strives for a niche market instead of a mainstream game. Thus, I would not 'recommend' it. But, if you are reading this, then you have interest in 4x, grand strategy, or at least some form of strategy games. And in that regard, consider it, at the least. It is one of the most intricate and complicated strategy games I have ever played, from Warcraft to Total War. But I do not recommend it for the following reasons.1) This game is hard to learn. Or at least quickly. My first few playthroughs on the campaign, I was always beaten, and on a custom game, I was crushed. The learning curve is brutal. It was very oppressing to have enemies invading you with these advanced ships, or with many times your own fleet, because you don't understand the minute specifics of the game. Once you grasp it, it becomes SIGNIFICANTLY easier. But for those whom do not have the patience to learn it, or are just not willing to reduce themselves to learning strategies online, this game will likely disappoint.2) The A.I. is far too predictable. Now, perhaps it is simply me, but after a few playthroughs, each race had a fairly predictable course of technology and action. Some focused on creating a tremendous amount of influence to make others not hate them, some tried to be great merchants and sell and buy everything, some tried to bully their way into everything. It eventually comes to a point where the game is far more interesting to craft races to combat.3) Military might is overpowered. Now, I understand why, at least a bit. However, those races that choose the malevolent path, and focus on building the power and size of their fleets, will utterly crush the opposition. Playing on the largest map setting, by the time I had started exploring the galaxy, I found that those who were invading conquerers were plentiful compared to the other paths, as they did not have the means to survive their enemies. This could be overcome by enemies that split their focus a bit, and researched technologies in other trees, but for the most part, opponent A.I. is very singleminded, and thus, only the strong-minded survive.

												I loved Gal Civ 2, and have played if vanilla or modded well over 100 hours. I had (and still have) high hopes for this game, bought into the prerelease and followed its development. I'm a fan of Stardock, and have often suggested their apps to clients in my PC repair work.This game takes the overall Galciv formula, which is an amazing take on 4X allowing both depth, as well as intuitive/satisfying gameplay. The reason that this series is one of the best 4X Space games around is that it gives a wide range of customization, with very little micromanagement. Gal Civ 3 brings in a bunch of great new features such as off-planet shipyards, specialized ship components, some improved game customization, and the much needed new pile of content for those like myself who have burned themselves out on the wonderful universe of Gal Civ 2.I really love the on-planet adjacent tile bonuses, and the strategic resources. Strategic resources add a whole new realm of combat, fighting over otherwise empty systems and giving you some great design choices to buffer against research lag (Building a few ships utilizing special mass drivers and elerium beams saved me from a race that suddenly appeared equipped with advanced missile defense technology after I sunk all my research down that weapon route; giving players more tactical options like this really gives the gameplay some depth).There are quite a few changes that I don't agree with, but I think have some merit and can develop into improvements in the long run: The replacement of world projects with luxury resources, ship defenses decreasing when used instead of applying against every attack, the new research screen (thank goodness you can still switch over to the standard tree view). I also miss the space station appearance changes as you upgrade them (they persist in this version for only the first few upgrades, after which you are stuck with a very generic looking station).On the subject of space stations, the military one is seriously nerfed in Gal Civ 3. Whereas before they were incredibly helpful fortresses to build around your most integral planets, now they really just provide minor buffs. They’ll tip the scales but by no means serve as the your defense forces’ fulcrums any longer.I have a few minor gripes such as where did the AI personality go? The only messages I get in game are the generic “You’re a noob to have so few warships. I’m going to eat your parents!” messages when my ship count is low, or the “Yeah I’m going to invade you now, l8r” transmissions. I’d love to see some more personality in the AI scripts that split them apart a bit, and maybe even some storyline/quest like communications that can be thrown in.One other minor bug is that whenever I exit the game I have to go into task manager and kill every process that doesn’t look normal to get my computer to run at anywhere near modern computer speeds (Some component seems to glitch out and take up tons of resources but does not show up in procmon).Two major areas are killing this game though- 1.	A vast number of features that have simply been stripped in this iteration, including several that had previously been the source of much of the games charm. Where is asteroid mining, ship leveling, espionage, the charts screen, civilization party elections.The Tech tree has been cut down SEVERELY. The nebulous tech tree in Gal Civ 2, with its charming comedic wit has been reduced to a very simple and limited version with much drier text. The lack of witty or even useful descriptions and tooltips throughout make the whole game seem much more sterile and flat.2. The MASSIVE Battle Results bug. So the battle viewer doesn't work well to begin with, cinematic view just sits there doing nothing, but the real issue is that battles that you watch seldom actually turn out the way they are displayed. For example you have a fleet of four ships, so does the enemy. They start pounding away at each other, and half of their ships get stuck at 0HP, but are still firing away, well no big deal because it glitches for your ships too sometimes, maybe it evens out. Get to the end of the battle, you lost two ships while the enemy lost all four, *whew* tough battle, click ""OK"". It cuts back to the galactic map and what do you know the enemy has two ships that survived and your whole fleet has been destroyed. This occurs in my games in about 50% of all battles, and 9 times out of 10 to my detriment.Because it often works against the player I think the problem may be with some of the new ship components such as weapons rechargers that make your guns shoot faster but do less damage, or maneuvering jets that get you in range of the enemy quicker and allow you to dodge a few of their shots. My guess is these new components work correctly in the viewer, but the actual battle results use a different equation solely based upon weapon and defense numbers. The AI doesn't use these components much.As it is, this a game breaker. Playing in pre-release with no battle-viewer was boring but acceptable for pre-release. This now working (kinda) version does nothing but add frustration, and if my hypothesis concerning new components not working in battle is true the situation is even worse since the new ship components are one of Gal Civ 3's few major pluses over its predecessors.I hope they continue to flesh out this iteration. The game engine, though a bit glitchy and poorly optimized (jump from one side of the galaxy to the other on a large map and the game hangs for a good 15 seconds) seems remarkably versatile. I think there is some great potential here, and I look forward to some improvements.As it stands if asked if you should purchase this game I’d be split 50/50 at full price, but I would say definitely get it if they fix the battle results bug. Until they do I cannot justify the purchase unless it’s on sale.			"

												Don't bother until a price cut and inevitable DLC.Poor job Stardock.  Very poor job.  I'm enjoying it because I love Galactic Civilization 2.  I'm winning on my first game because I know how to play Galactic Civilization 2..  It's the same freaking game just with a 3 on the end.  Why is there no innovation?  Why am I paying $50 for a game that has no significant improvements from Galciv 2?   Why are things that were IN galciv 2 missing if it was supposed to be a faithful sequel?  You had ten years and you rehashed the last game pretty faithfully.  Well rehash isn't the right word.  You released the same game with glaring holes for dlc to fit in.  Where's the experience system for ships or espionage?   Less races to pick from.  Half the things like ship designer are mostly cut and paste from galciv 2.  Why can't I set taxes?  They missed so many opportunities and offered in most ways an identical game with some parts cut out.			"

												What I see is a weird mix of polish and missing features.

However at this time - playing this game feels like doing chores ... the hard way rather than having fun. This whole ""Sell it now fix it later"" mindset is ruining so many games that could have been great ... and our wallets are the victims.			"

Early Access Review
								First things first - this game is in BETA.That means it is not finished, and therefore an objective review is not possible.If you're going to base your opinions of a game on reviews of unfinished material then you'd might as well go home now.On to business, I'm writing this to provide a more objective review than the wave of negativity.The state of the game at time of writing is one in which the basic functionality works, but not everything is implemented.  If you'd like to try this game do so with the knowledge that features may be missing or not working yet.Overall impressions are good - the game feels identical to the previous installment and yet brings with it new mechanics and features which greatly improve upon it.I was skeptical at first as a big fan of the previous game, and the genre in general.In the early days I would tend to agree with some of these negative reviews, lots of bugs, lots of crashing, lots of lagging - but what do you know, they went and fixed all that (an example of why you should ignore reviews this early on!).Colonies are much easier to manage than they were in the previous game, you simply choose you buildings up front and as you research new techs everything is upgraded for you.There's a nice little feature where colonies can share space ports, allowing you to have (in theory) double the amount of production in that centre.  This is great for players who focus on money, influence or other factors.Starbases aren't finished yet so there is no point in reviewing them.  Same basic mechanics as the last one with the addition of new modules and mining mechanics.Combat is greatly improved, no longer do all of your weapons fire immediately and your mass of lasers simply destroys everything up front.Now weapons have more realistic and varied fire rates, which can be modified by ship modules and research to customise your ships more (for example, loading lots of rapid fire mods onto powerful missiles).Defence needs a bit of work IMO as defence are quickly worn down by weapons.  Two shots from a laser with 30 damage will take out a ship with 60 shields.  Sounds sensible, but there's nothing to stop you loading dozens of fighters with huge lasers to wipe out capital ships.  Most Space RTS suffer from the same issue, so this is more a personnal bug bear than a problem.Diplomacy is relatively straight forward, what you see is what you get.  Tech, finance and treaty trading.  The UN resolutions add some more dynamics but they soon get old when you realise 90% of them would hinder you... Influence has been improved a lot, now if you occupy a planet deep within another player's influence it will be almost immediately transfered to the other player.  This stops those pesky AIs colonising Mars for no discernable reason!The tech tree is great in this game as you can either research improvements or new techs.  ""Do I really want a new type of laser, or do I want to improve the one I've got?"".  Obviously the answer to this will be ""Eh, I'll take both thanks"" but it's a good start and does much more to change the way you play ""One more tech then I'll make my new ships, promise!"".Ship design has gotten a whole lot easier as internal hardpoints are now hidden, so it's much easier to attach things where you want them than it was before.  Great for creative types.Nothing on planetary invasion yet, so I can't comment here.To sum up it's a good start and definitely work keeping an eye on it.  Unless you're really interested in it's developmet there isn't much point buying it just yet (unless you're keen to get bonus stuff when it comes out like they usually do...).Plenty of +/-ve reviews out there, none are helpful in the slightest at the moment.  Keep watching, keep reading and reserve your judgement until you play it yourself or the full game comes out.  Hope this helps clarify what's what objectively at this stage.Oh, the dev team has also been very good in responding to bugs and issues.  I've seen bugs posted fixed within days (may be coincidence, but still!).  Kudos - can't wait to play it. "

												As of the 1.0.1, the short version is: watch for updates and wait a little before you decide whether to buy this.And the long version:Pros:The general principle of play is sound. It's often indistinguishable from Civilization V, but that's not a bad thing (unless you're paid to judge works on uniqueness.)The depth added by designing our own combat units is interesting and allows for more freedom than other similar games when planning strategy. For example, rather than stumble about blindly or use up mass allowances on combat vessels, you might take a page from modern AEW&C. Or perhaps develop a raider doctrine with long-range, independent vessels capable of hunting alone. Or combine the two and create hunter-killer teams. There's huge potential to evade some of the worst aspects of min-max play in just this one concept.Spaceships! Cons:Rather buggy for a game priced in the AAA range. Not that AAA titles are bug-free at first release, but that doesn't make it less annoying to pay more to buy less quality earlier. The ship designer in particular is a bug-ridden mess. And that's not a small problem for a game with few other reasons to play it over similar titles.The ship designer user experience--bugs withstanding--would have been reasonable ten years ago. Not today; especially with other, cheaper, vehicle building games out there such as Kerbal Space Program. It's so out of line with modern user experience it feels like Stardock is laughing at us. I've little hope this will improve much, as perusing the early access forums reveals players were pointing out some of the current problems long ago.At times, it feels like Civilization V with a different skin; same pleasures, same annoyances. From the direction early game faction scouts and settlers drive play to the over-engineered leader ""discussion/diplomacy"" screens containing dialogue even less relevant than a response from Eliza, it can feel an awful lot like an outside contractor team revamped Civilization V without understanding it--and therefore not knowing how to qualitatively improve it.The user interface glitter and glam leaves the impression the team wanted to match Civilization V dollar for dollar, but ran out of time or money. And that is a shame, because so many great games have shown us glitter, sprinkles, and twirly umbrellas in the user interface don't fundamentally improve the play experience and here that money and time was clearly needed elsewhere, e.g., the help system.The help system. Or lack thereof. A few tutorials that start strong and fizzle out. Little to nothing in-game and no real manual to speak of. This is a game much like chess, where mechanics are made up solely to balance one another and so one's intuition and life experience have nothing to contribute (and folks who paid even slight attention in physics or astrophysics 101 are going to be at a disadvantage.) So direct explanation of mechanics of play is essential, and almost entirely missing. Again, for cheaper titles with established forums and wikis, this is palatable. Not so for a title priced in this range.And, the big problem. The play simply does not balance when playing the largest map sizes. And the largest map sizes are presented as a significant differentiator from other like-minded titles.I hope Stardock builds upon this in the coming months with updates; it's a game I'd love to love. There's a mountain of potential here if they find the budget and courage to come at some of the genre's problems and their solutions with fresh eyes. But, today it's not in the same league as other titles in the same price range nor is does it have the unique personality or creativity of its cheaper, indie brethren.[Updates]I've played around with this a little more. Few more things I've noticed:The opponent AI feels inferior to Civilization V, or even to Eliza. I feel as if I've I've as much chance of calling a random die roll as guessing what an AI-controlled opponent will say or do. Not to mention to the glaring inconsistencies, e.g., declaring war one turn and telling you they'll probably declare war on you the next. There's no sense of connection or rationality.The battle mechanic, or lack of one, is uninteresting, even pointless. You move your ships onto enemy ships (or vice versa) and a seemingly straight calculation is performed to determine the winner. I've tried saving and loading a dozen times before a few close battles and saw zero variation in outcome. Moreover, you have no input on battle tactics other than selecting as part of ship design what role a ship will play, i.e., you fix ship roles before construction. But that's not a real problem: roles are too simplistic to have any profound effect. You cannot call a retreat, ships gain no experience and have nothing to differentiate them from one another. Very like chess, very unlike other modern, deep 4X titles.After a little more play; the feel is even more cardboard, generic, soulless. There's nothing to differentiate it from deeper, more accomplished titles except the concept of a ship designer; and that sabotaged by a poor implementation in comparison to its competitors.			"

												If you liked GALCIV 2, play that instead.Fact is, they are playing the same game that Maxis has with the Sims: release the same game with better graphics and dumbed down gameplay, then sell expansions that basically just add in some of the features from the previous games' expansions.The AI is dumb, the gameplay is dumbed down, there are fewer races and special events, there's no choosing a government now, you just upgrade to a better form over time.It's still a fun game, I guess, but the fact that I really wanted to play a space game and couldn't find the email/password to my old stardock account is probably the only reason I got so much mileage out of it. Don't buy it unless it's on sale.			"

												Galactic Civilizations is a classic, and I purchased this game almost immediately while it was in early access. Unfortunately this game has missed the mark, Stardock just didn't do enough with the franchise to give it 'new life', and while some things they did were exceptional (the customization of everything, see below), it has too many negatives to warrent a recommendation, especially for the price of $50, this is not a $50 title.What GalCiv3 did right:- Ship customization is FANTASTIC, they hit the ball out of the park with this one.- Custom race creation and balance is really interesting and in-depth, great stuff.- Custom game setup options are plentiful, letting you tune the game to the experience you want.Areas GalCiv3 falls short:- The Combat animations are bare bones at best, and while this would be bearable (the particle effects are good, as are the ship models which are completely customizable as mentioned above), the camera controls/modes for viewing are beyond poor, the ship pathfinding for movement is really poor (battles just proceed in exactly the same paths again and again) and the space skyboxes are AWFUL. This really lets it down.- As just mentioned the space skyboxes are not very pleasant- The Campaign is not really worth bothering with. It sadly feels like a last minute stitched together skirmish game that unfortunately really doesn't show much love and care.- The User Interface isn't fantastic by any means. While it's not terrible, there are many unnecessary/overly complicated tabs and windows that just don't need to be there. A Perfect example is the comparison between the Research page in this game compared to the Research page in another Stardock (published) title ""Sins of a Solar Empire"", SoaSE does a much better job than this game in terms of UI in areas like that. GalCiv just feels clunky.- No where near enough new content or innovation to make this a worthy successor to GalCiv2. I could have forgiven it if it was an almost PERFECT execution (I adore Homeworld: Remastered, while it does have a few faults, that game is a stunning remake), this game just has so many flaws I just don't get excited when playing it.TL;DR: Customization options are fantastic, but the game just doesnt feel polished. Clunky UI, clunky battle camera, unpleasant skyboxes, campaign is eeeeh and overall just not a worthy sequel to GalCiv 2.			"

Early Access Review
								If you love 4x games, you'll love Galactic Civilizations III.  I'll mention what, for me, makes this game great:* A wicked AI.  Seriously.  I prefer to play 4x games solo.  I need a good AI to keep me challenged and interested.  On the Challenging difficulty setting, the AI expanded at about the same rate I did (sometimes a little faster), kept up with me technologically and economically, even sent warships ahead of its colony ships to clear out pirates so it could colonize worlds before I could.  It designed its warships to counter the strength of my warships (since we shared a border).  It understood the threat when I moved warships close to its border, which affected our diplomatic relations.  And so much more.* The Ship Designer.  No other 4x game (or other game that I know of) gives you so much freedom and control in designing your own ships (if you want to; it has a basic template of ships if you don't).  From a palette of basic ship parts, combined with powerful design and even animation tools, you can create awesome looking ships that actually work and fight in the game.  Yes, weapon, defense, and other components matter in the game and can mean the difference between defeat and victory, but designing my own ships and seeing them in the game is just SO COOL.  I even created a warship that looked like a mythical dragon.* Custom civilizations.  Powerful but simple menus allow you to create your own civilizations quickly, providing many different traits, behaviors, and strategy options.  Ten opponents not enough?  Make 20 more!  Each of them different.  You can even play sandbox games as one of your custom civilizations (which I do).* Modding.  This game is designed with modders in mind.  Don't like something about the game?  Change it!  There is hardly any gameplay aspect of this game you cannot mess with.* Insane map.  I like big maps and I cannot lie.  Okay, not everyone enjoys really big maps with thousands of stars.  But if you do, the insane map is for you.  (Beware that management of your empire can take awhile on a map like this.)There's lots more and I highly recommend this game.  And, Stardock has committed to supporting this game for years to come.  As good as the game is now, it's going to get even better.			"

												Buy only if you like giving money away                    The base game is bare and not finished, so they keep giving us dlc that adds stuff that should already be in the game. thats fine, alot of games do that but the dlc is over priced for the content they are giving us. They could easily put all the ""dlc"" in one big one and it should cost 25- 30 dollars and that is pushing it. With the price of all the dlc u could by a new game that is finished, and like a year from now you might be able to buy two new games with the price of their ""dlc"" because they still keep giving us more ""dlc"", why do people keep buying their sh*t. i like the game but it got boring fast and it became a money pit, so buy the game or dont, i dont care but i have warned you.

												While I've had some fun with it, I cannot in good faith recommend this game. There are many interesting systems and choices for the player, but there are an unacceptable amount of bugs/blatant mistakes in the game.to give you some examples:-The tech tree is poorly written, it is often difficult to understand what a given tech does.-There are several typos in the tech tree. By typo I mean when an item or tech obviously has the wrong value. -Races and ideologies are not balanced in the least.-The player get to decide how the enemy will prioritize which ships to shoot first (no no that's not a battleship, it's an interceptor, I swear!)Still, if you get it for 10€ and don't expect the pieces to fit together properly it can be good fun.

Posted: June 13, 2015
												First off and probably most importantly: The game is about as stable as a house of cards built over a geyser. It took me about two hours of researching to find solutions and playing around with the game's files to finally get it going for that first time. Then, the game continued to crash during play time. So, yet another hour or so of my time to find methods of keeping it running properly. The mothertrucker still crashes to this day at times. That right there costs the game some big points in my esteem. When I pay 50 bucks for your game, it better damn well work the first time I click on it (unless my computer is the problem-- which it was not in this case.)Technical issues aside (as glaring as they are), this is a really lackluster, mediocre game. Nothing special to see here folks. Diplomacy is pretty standard with nothing deep going on there. It's the standard trade agreement that we have already seen in hundreds of such games before (give me this tech for that tech, declare war, etc). The diplomacy system in older games (Alpha Centauri among others) is probably much more complex. If anything, diplomacy is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the AI factions acting all bi-polar on you. They shower you with praise and credits at one moment, then they declare war two turns later. I enjoyed the quasi-United Nations thing they had going there though (planetary alliance or something). That was a neat highlight. There is no ground combat / planetary invasions - defense game system. It's a very random thing. In most of my playing, taking over a planet is pretty automatic. Very rarely did I need to send in a second wave of invading forces. You don't need to prepare too much in advance. Planets that are outfitted to the wazoo with defensive things still get taken down fairly easy. Honestly, why has no game of this sort not put some thought into the ground game? Look at Emperor of the Fading Suns. There's a great old game that did that in a very fun and engrossing fashion. Seriously, no one has even touched the ground game in years. The space combat is ridiculous. You have zero options or control. Starships fly and charge at each other like cavalry. Once close to the enermy, they then begin to rotate around each other in a dancing fashion and deal their damage. Seeing capital starships fly in circles around one another like fighters in some kind of demented NASCAR dogfight took a lot of punch away from the highlight of the game (starship battles). I found myself skipping the combat scenes pretty early on because A) You can't do anything anyways and the ships are governed by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cavalry charge tactic. 2) It makes me laugh because it's so off putting... the way the ships dance around each other in a circle. Seriously, give the player some tactical control. Make the game interesting by still having a chance to win even if you're the underdog with the smarter opponent having an edge of some kind. The universe is pretty dead. Ships take forever to get to all the corners of the open space. No jump drives or something that could speed up fleet movement over the map. This isn't even slow burn tension, it's like driving a golf cart for 8 hours. The only thing that I really enjoyed about the game was the custom faction option. I had fun populating my map with Warhammer 40K and Mass Effect inspired races / factions. I played with my own custom made Kilrathi Empire faction. I had more fun creating factions than actually playing the game though.So, no, on the whole, this game isn't worth 50$.			"

												Not in love with this game at launch.  It's not a bad game.  It just isn't exceptional.  Ship building is bugged currently.  The game itself froze up on me a few times but after a fresh install seemed to run better.  It still stutters at times, even on the small tutorial map.  Combat is uninteresting.  You have no capacity to command your units, not even to flee.  So you send your guys in and hope for the best.  Worse, the combat camera is fairly horrible and you spend a lot of the time listening to battles happening off screen.  It's a bit chaotic.  I have read that diplomacy is a greatly improved in this game.  If so I didn't see it.  In the two games I have played so far my allies seemed fairly erratic, almost like a crazy person you find yourself dating after an online hook up.  One minute they threatened to obliterate me for not following their doctrine.  The next minute they are showering me with credits as though they feel badly about how they acted and are desperate for you not to leave them.  If there is colony management automation I couldn't find it.  Managing your economy is a matter of moving a slider.  Again, not bad.  Just not interesting.  The Universe in the couple of games I have played seems fairly lifeless.  At first black holes look really neat.  But there are no civilian ships to be seen.  No convoys.  Besides some basic animation of a moon orbit or the odd comet it seems like you are looking at a stagnate game board.  Again, not bad per say.  Just not interesting.  Towards the end of the games I found myself clicking a lot to just shuffle through turns so I could finally get to the tipping point of overwhelming my enemy.  This involved stripping his final system of defenders and then doing a sort of auto resolution troop invasion.  Then a wall of exposition and a victory screen.  It was around this point that I realized that finishing the game had been more work than actual fun.  There may be a solid core of a good game here that can be greatly improved upon with further patches and DLC.  But for $10 more you can buy Distant Worlds Universe.  With a bevy of mods that make it a living breathing universe.  Or just play some Gal Civ 2.  Or Sins of a Solar Empire.  I do not recommend dumping $50 into Gal Civ 3 at present.  It needs a lot of work.			"

Early Access Review
								First of all it is critical to understand that the game is still in beta testing and therefore has some glitches.  That said it has been pretty stable for me.   (Four year old dell xps 8100 with 16gb and a 750 Ti video card).   At present the plan seems to be to a go for a final release in May.    There will be frequent patches before then and perhaps a beta 6 release (beta 5, with enormous additions, was released yesterday (Mar26).      If you don't like encountering bugs and reporting them to help the game, then wait for the release.   Of critical importance remaining is tuning the AI to be smarter and more aggressive, imo.That said, with yesterday's release the game is really starting to take shape.   I played and enjoyed Galciv2 (for which, coincidentally, a community update is being finished at the same time).    But GC3, even a couple of releases ago, just looks so much better, and the game will optionally be so much bigger (largest size is ""insane"" and it is just that, largest number of factions...100!) with many more custom races allowed, more minor races and a much improved ship designer (which is a game in itself that one can get lost in).     Colonizing of planets is more tactical with the new adjacency bonuses and on planet resources.     The battle viewer will remain a strategic choice rather than a tactical  (one can organize one's fleet with different numbers and classes of ships, of which support ships are critical) but it also looks much  better than GC2.    You can change camera viewing angle during the battle.   Watch a 30 vs 30 ship battle, enough said (check stardock.com to see live stream game examples).   Then there are various galactic items like nebulae which restrict defence and accuracy as well as numerous strategic resouces to mine in addition to relics that give civilization wide benefits.  The ideology table gives some sharply different choices depending on whether you feel good, bad, or neutral.   Diplomacy is rapidly improving but has some way to go (as I said)  and will I think be a key to success in a big game.Well, I could to on and on.  I am a long term 4x player (started with civ 1 in the day) and my advice is that this game will give a 4x challenge that feels, looks, and plays much different from, say, Civ 5, but with the same next turn tension and the same scramble for multiple objectives that makes a 4x game enjoyable.Update May 13 (day before 1.0 release)  I am updating this review because the official release is roughly 24 hours away, and because the numerous patches and updates since my original reviiew have changed the situation.  First, my comments about ""glitches"", at least for my system and experience, are, as I predicted they would be, largely history.  In fact, the improvement in the performance of the game is beyond what my expectations were.   For example, as of the original view my CPU was running in the low 70 C range, (which is not a problem, mind) but since Beta 6 it has been running in the mid-60s C, a surprising improvement.   As a second example, a typical issue I was having was freezing in the mid to late game.  I have not seen this whasoever for several weeks.   As two more examples, key issues were occassional battle viewer and invasion hang ups. These appear to also to now be completely solid.    Perhaps the biggest change, though, is the enormous increase in content, of which  I might mention the inclusion of custom classes, meaning that I can now create my own races with an enormouse range of choices for abilities and characteristics, or borrow other peoples' creations (which I have done), to  include in my games.  I can, and have, played against the Angry Joe Army.   I have about 30 available right now, all tested and working.I should add that this is important if one want to play on the ""excessive"" or ""insane"" size galaxies, so that there are sufficient factions to fill in the univierse.  Yes you can play with dozens of AI opponents and the game works.In other words, as we count down to official release, my take is that things have progressed better that I predicted or expected.   I think that is important to mention.   And looking forward there is a schedule of a steady stream of patches, updates, expansions planned for GalCiv 3 over the ensuing months and years.   I wish I could give 2 thumbs up.			"

												EDIT: Someone explained that my impression that I could not concentrate production was false, and after checking into it I realized they're right. I also wrote that I couldn't find political parties, but forgot that this came with a diplomatic research option in the previous games as well, so I am retracting that point too. Adding 2 more things I noticed after playing another 1.5 hours today, though.1. The zoom on the minimap seems to reset every turn, so you have to keep changing it to the scale you want.2. Money is not prominently displayed like it used to be, so financial decisions are a bit more of a pain to make.None of the things I'm finding are gamebreaking, and I doubt that I will be posting any more of them here. The point I'm trying to make here is that there shouldn't BE all these little things in a finished product. They should have been caught and fixed in beta. To the individual who thinks I'm ""an old guy""... don't really have an answer. I don't think I'm that old, and I invested hundreds of hours in GalCiv 1 and 2 when I was younger. That was something like 7 years ago. But as for being stuck in another gaming era... perhaps. I remember how I felt when I played GalCiv 1, and what a huge improvement GalCiv 2 was at the time. I just don't feel that GalCiv 3 currently offers any major improvement on GalCiv 2, and it doesn't feel as polished as well.Sorry?-----ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'm a little disappointed, to be honest, that there don't seem to be many reviews that are completely honest about the state of the this game. I love Stardock and the GalCiv franchise, so this negative review is being written out of love, not spite. It isn't a bad game, but it certainly isn't yet what I'd term ""ready for launch.""I'll start with what I've noticed in the first couple hours of playing, so that anyone else who's thinking about shelling out $50 for the game has at least some idea of what's what. 1. Battlecam is a mess. In the normal mode, ships eventually fly out of view of the camera during battles and you can't see what's going on. If you switch to free mode, the controls are so sensitive that the slightest touch will send the camera flying off into the far distance or way too close, making it impossible to see anything. It's very difficult to get the camera into just the right frame.2. Tutorial is not very thorough. I've played GalCiv I and II quite extensively, and there are a number of new features in this game which are not adequately explained in the tutorial, i.e. intricacies of adjacencies, behavior of ships in battle based on various stats, and more.3. No espionage. I heard this will be included later as DLC, but why are they going to be charging for something that was a feature in previous games?4. Units don't gain experience in battle anymore.5. AI frequently says inane things to you during the game. I had a computer that was ""close"" to me in diplomacy who nonetheless kept threatening me for no reason.6. Soundtrack is not seamless, with very noticeable pauses between switching tracks. 7. From what I can tell, you can't concentrate production values on individual planets anymore to focus on military, research, or social production, nor can you adjust taxation level to help with morale. If I'm wrong about this, then that just goes to show that things are not well-explained in the game. 8. No more asteroid mining to help with production.9. It seems like there's also no more political parties, meaning you can't be ousted from government. I'm not really sure what morale does, in this case. Either way, it makes the game less interesting.And a number of graphical stutters. I'm sure I'll find more issues as I continue to play--and I do intend to continue to play, and will update my review once I've had more time with it. I have a lot of love for this series, and I want it to succeed. I know from playing the previous games that Stardock will pour a lot of effort into making this the best game they can. However, I cannot honestly say that this game feels ready or polished and, in fact, it rather feels like a rehash of old territory, but with features taken away.I really hope they make significant progress. I want this to be the best GalCiv yet. It just isn't so far.			"

												Okay so I have about 22 hours under belt so I am going to weigh in here.  While I owned and played a good deal of GC1 and GC2 they were always so/so to me.  I enjoyed them and got my money out of them but they never really engaged me as much as I would like to have been able to say that they did.  GC3 so far is holding my fancy though pretty good.  It has some flaws, the AI like most 4X games sucks at diplomacy.  The biggest sell to me is the HUGE maps.  I like games that go into the 500-1000 turn range and this game has that in spades with the larger maps.  The game does suffer from some CTD (Crash To Desktop) from time to time but that is when I am on huge and larger maps, and it is somewhat expected with a new game.   The CTD haven't really hurt my progress as I save often but they could cause someone to be upset if they don't save enough.One bad thing is that Stardock is clearly in the game for the long haul and has plans to release DLC and expansions regularly.  This is a plus and minus.  I like a steady stream of content but there are some things that I feel like were left out of the game just to be an easy sell later on like Spies and other races.   This isn't a huge deal though as I am a game collector and I don't mind decent DLC/expansions.  I spend a small fortune with games like Crusader Kings 2 and Europa Universalis IV so I am used to this sort of deal.  However if you want a full experience I would suggest waiting later and picking up the game in a few years (if you can wait that long) for a complete edition at a sale price.   But if you enjoy the genre and don't mind having to pay as you go for features to be added here and there the game is worth the money.			"

Early Access Review
								Having spent many, many hours playing ""Galactic Civilizations II"", I was really excited to get my hands on this.  It's a for 4x space strategy game for the uninitiated, but much more than that for those familiar with its inner workings.  For one, you can custom design your own ships from the ground up as opposed to being restricted to certain designs.  ""Galactic Civilizations III"" dances to a familiar tune but introduces some new gameplay mechanics (like Ideology) that fans of ""Sid Meier's Civilization V"" will be familiar with (it's similar to culture).  Having played the Beta for some time (I managed to get early access), I'm pleased to report that it's shaping up to be everything I expected and more. While I explore this game more, feel free to check out an hour's worth of Beta footage via the below videos:

												Well I bought the game yesterday and I am a big 4x fan but donot have any experience with Galactic civilizations games, And at the moment I can not recommand the game without any objections.But first I'd like to talk about the positive things in the game:1. The races: they differ from each others, and have traits, which make sense and have impact on the game mechanic, but not so much, that I can say, that specific trait(s) is/are overpowered. But I think the old Master of Orion is still somehow ahead of it.2. Ship design: although I am to lazy to play the ship designer, I believe there are people out there having huge fun with it. and customize their ships to every little detail.3. Fleet command: you can order specific ships to a rally point or set a rally point for newly build ship from a single or all shipyard quite fast. That make your ships better to organize.4. Techtree: You got ""normal techs"" everyone can search but you have ""specializations"" which you have to choose from three, and the other two you can not research but trade with other players. which make every gamerun somehow different. But unlike ""Endless Space"" you do not have race specific research.5. limited building lot on planet represent the quality of planet. on a ""Paradise"" planet you can build like 15 buildings and on a ""barely habitable planet"" only 4, sure terraforming can change it quite a bit, but not like other 4x games each terraforming research you do only let you terraform 1!!! tile (in the early-middlegame) and you have to research further terraforming research to convert more.6. adjacent effect of buildings: If you build more fabrics together, they get bigger bonuses and a embassy boost the market places around it. So you have to plan your buildings ahead and for example leave a space in the middle of a big industry complex for let we say a refinery or a power plant to hugely boost its output.7. last but not least the really special thing I realized: The spacestation: unlike other space 4x games, you customize your space station with modules and well a ""ring"" around it (just like DS9) the ring is limited to 1 per station and determine which additional modules you can further install into a station. For example you can not build a culture modul into a station with a mining ring. And not only are station used to protect your boarders, they give moderate bonuses to planets around as well.From my point of view, I have seen all these positive facts expect point 7. somewhere else, but it make sense to combine them, it make the gaming experience rich and complex. But now I have to talk about the negative facts:1. The game do not really feel finished, from my opinion it is a late beta version. the descriptions of technology you research is a total mess: everywhere you see like, ""maintenance -10%"" you think great, it gives you a flat bonus of 10% on every building. WRONG: you have to look carefully and read the flavor text of the tech to see, it's only specific to ""commerce building"" or ""research building"" and there are still bugs while the symbol of a bonus don't match it description. and there are thing like the technology ""industrial specialization"" which gives you ""manufacturing cost -5%"" and another ""manufacturing cost -5%"" so is it 10% or is it only 5% and there is a bug? And in general the game do not tell you in a intuitive way. For example, I still do not know how my raw production and raw manufacturing/research and net income is calculated. So 1 or 2 more months is needed to get rid of some of these and make other things clear I hope.2. ""Planet potentials"" you know your planet is class 16 with 16 tiles you can build on, but how far can it get? my capitol can only be terraformed to class 18 and another to class 24. So it's kind of a pocker, how good your planet can get.3. Terraforming: It is not really clear that there are different ""terraformable tile quallity"" -->  salvageable, decent, less, and almost useless quality. the tech ""terraforming plant"" f.e. can be used on salvageable and decent tile, but keep in mind, that in the late game you can terraform all salvageable tiles but only ONE!!! decent tile. So you will ""waste"" your ""terraforming plant"" if you use it inefficiently.4. No Espionage. What shall I say, I read about that GC2 had it and GC3 will get it per Addon...5. Culture/border/spacestation: If you are a highly cultural race, you will push the enemy border back and take over their planet, but not their spacestations, in fact AI stations will continue mining your precious resources and you can't do anything not even build your own one next to it or buy it from AI, you have to blow it up. And on top of that, AI at peach even build station actively in your territory, that make it more difficult to play cultural race.So from my point of view, this game is really nice, but at the moment, things are still not final, that's why I do not recommend it to everyone interested. Wait a few month, there will be a discount on price and the game will be ""hopefully"" more finished.			"

												From what I have seen so far the game is wonderful. You can miro manage down the the detail of every decision or set automatic orders. For example you can order you ships to automatically do a thing an notify you when they encounter something that needs your attention. You can also do this for ship, space stations, and even planets. You can create such a large universe that games can last up to hours order even days. Thankfully it has a save game, even for the multiplayer which I have never seen before.Now for the problems. It just loves to crash. My drivers are all up to date. I deleted the entire game and reinstalled. I have no mods. I have even tried it on three completly different computers. I just don't understand how people are playing this game? On one computer I simply start the tutorial and it crashes when I press OK on the intro screen. On the other I play a single player and it lasts anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 hour then crash. Often the save games are kind enough to save three turns before the crash. Of course once you launch the save game it crashes again after three turns but you keep loading hoping if you do something different this time you can get your game back. Sometimes you do and sometimes your hours of game play are gone forever. I am not asking for my money back because I beleive this game has promise. I loved previous Galatic Civ games so I plan to shelve this one until I see a patch.			"

Early Access Review
								I have been a long time fan of the Galactic Civilizations series and GCIII is long anticipated and as good as I have hoped.The game has been greatly expanded and is much more than an updated version of the previous games. Those who are fans of the previous GC games will find the features that hooked them still in the game but much, much more. Expanded and improved combat, with a great battle cinimatic battle viewer, custom factions and a map generator that allows up to a hundred opponents.If you liked the previous GC games you will certainly love GCIII. If you have never played GC but enjoy turn based science fiction games, GCIII epitomizes everything we enjoy about 4X gaming.I just wanted to update my review to say that the game keeps getting better. The AI is fine tuned now and it is without a doubt the best 4X AI I have ever played with.Lots of new features added, great pirates and custom factions are now in the game. I promise you will like them.You will have a hard time putting this one away for the night. I have seen the sun come up more that I like to admit.			"

								Do I build a long range colony ship and try to colonize that planet on the edge of another faction to hopefully get it before they do? Should I colonize a rmediocre  planet close to me or build a constructor to make a starbase that will allow my fleets and colony ships more range to be a better planet farther out? Build up infrastructure while neglecting military to improve my economy, but risk being seen as ""weak and vulnerable"" to other factions? Build your own ships, but then what to put on them? Some defenders with low range and speed but a lot of punch? Fast ships to raid or intercept? Should I make friends with some ais to get treaties so I won't have to go it alone? Be a warmonger or a diplomat? What should I research first? Longer range and better engine techs for upgrading ships to explore with or weapons or manufacturing or planetary improvements? Then do I resarch Commerce or diplomacy? It is all up to you to decide. There isn't really a wrong answer, well, until it blows up in your face :) Each game is different. Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know you decisions were right until crunch time. Also keep in mind Stardock plans to support this game for years! The game is pretty darn good now, but like the orignal GCII through the expansions, it only will get better.			"

General stuffGalciv3 is a worthy sequel to its predecessor, and a good 4x game when compared to modern titles in the genre. This coupled with a developer with a proven reputation for supporting their games for a long time makes this a safe buy. Journalistic reviews are very favorable as well. If you are in for the long haul this game has amazing potential for the future, and unlike most other games in the genre recently has the financial means to deliver. Big Features-Fully 64bit & DirectX11: Perhaps the games most important feature, removing one of the genres biggest limitations: the 32bit 4gb memory limit. This allows the scale of the game to increase by a order of magnitude in terms of map size, amount of ships, planets and stars, and complexity of AI routines. -Adjacency on Planets: The way you place planetary improvements matters. If you put 2 improvements of the same category next to each other, they will buff eachother. Combined with terrain bonuses native to the planet and clever terraforming means you can get factories or research labs with 6+ bonus levels on your high quality planets quite easily, massively boosting your production. -Map Size: The largest map in civilzation: Beyond earth and Endless Legend are around 10.000 tiles[forums.civfanatics.com]. Galciv3's biggest map size is 432.061 tiles, appropriately named Insane. Keep in mind that a insane map requires at least 8gb ram to even start. -Campaign: A rarity in 4x games, this game offers a campaign. The main benefit this brings is that it allows newer players to jump straight into a game that in well in progress, giving them a chance to see the beauty of 4x games without having to struggle trough the learning curve to much, it starts of with a couple of large space battles to give players a taste of what is possible. A experienced 4x player can probably beat the campaign in one of two afternoons, while a new player might take a bit longer.-Ship Designer (cosmetic part): A iconic feature of the series, the in game ship designer is a powerful tool that lets you build virtually any ship you can imagine, such as ships form popular TV series.  Chances are you can see a bunch of them in the screenshot section. The game comes with a bunch of pre-made designs and workshop integration will allow for easy downloading of other players ships if designing ships isn't your thing.-Ship Designer (gameplay part): Choose the stats and combat roles of your ships. Research ship components like enginers, weapons, shields and life support, then put them on your ships to create your own style. build anything from large capital ships, carriers that launch strike craft, bombers and interceptors to freighter hulls loaded with lazers. Customize your ships to be optimal against the enemy you are fighting. You can assign your ship combat roles that determine how they behave in fleet combat (ie interceptor, support ship, assault ship, etc) This part too is not mandatory, the game will dynamically generate ships for you as you research more parts, those ships will do the job but might not be exactly what you want. -In Depth Faction Creator: upload your own pictures and icons (or videos) to use for your faction, choose what positive and/or negative traits your faction gets, your ship style and looks, UI color, tech tree, etc. Set up how the AI should play your race if you want to fight against it by giving it personality traits and priorities.-High moddability: The devs went out of their way to make this game easy to mod, allowing virtually every aspect of the game to be changed. In June steam workshop support will arrive, allowing for players to easily share their mods, custom factions, ship designs and components, custom maps, balance changes, etc. Usual 4x features-Large number of opponents: The game supports up to 128 AI opponents for truly insane games, where entire factions will die out before you even meet them. -Multiple Victory Conditions: Standard feature for any 4x worth it's salt.-Faction specific tech trees: The tech tree is large enough that in a regular game you will only research certain parts of your choosing form it. Each race has a couple of unique techs, and gets certain techs earlier then others, each tech tree has its own full set of flavor text per race. Specialization techs offer you a choice between 3 techs of which you can only choose one, though you can get the others trough trade if you want.-Ideology: Colonizing planets and galactic events present you with ethical choices allowing you to choose a benevolent, pragmatic or malevolent path. Each choice might have pros and cons for the planet you are colonizing, and gives you ideology points to spend on perks. The perks become quite powerful in the higher tiers and each path offers strong options. -Multiplayer: Play with friends and stuff. 4 player multiplayer atm. At the time of writing there are still some stability issues to work out but that is slated to be fixed within the next weeks. -Diplomacy and AI: Still a bit in it early shoes but is constantly being worked on. A common pitfall amongst 4x games is that this area lacks on launch, nevertheless the AI performs quite well compared to other games. The AI will regularly contact you with trade request, comment on your relationship (move ships out of my area, dont build up troops near my borders, your army is weak, i like that were trading, i dont like that your friends with the other guy, etc.). It's noteworthy that the AI doesn't cheat nearly as much as a lot of other games in the gerne, it can't see the entire map for example. Future Support-Dev has stated multiple times that the life cycle of this game is around 7 years. -3 expansion packs and 12+ DLCs are sheduled. Expansions include major new game systems, DLC includes non-mandatory things like extra civilizations, custom scenarios (evil squirrels take over the galaxy scenario confirmed), ship parts, etc. -regular free content patches are planned during this period. This includes basic gameplay features like AI updates, Ui improvements, steam workshop/mod support, bug fixes, etc.-Features slated for expansions include: espionage, fleet commanders, hypergate long distance travel, increased starbase complexity (and hopefully starbase designer), increased diplomacy complexity, planets with population from multiple races. ofc no promises no official announcements have been made.Info on Developer-Dev has a history of being nice to customers and supporting their games for a long time.-Dev is financially solvent and game was fully funded before development began, game is selling like hot cakes (100.000 units sold before launch, beat GTA V on top sellers list for two days after release), so there is no risk of the game being abandoned for financial reasons. -Dev communicates well with customers, there has been a dev stream[www.twitch.tv] every week for over a year before release, where they take questions from viewers. They are active on both the steam forums and their official forums. Even the CEO of the company has made multiple appearances on the stream.			"

												Simply put: Get Galactic Civilizations 2 instead.  It gives nearly every feature this one does without the worst issue of this one.This game tries to build off its predecesor, but the AI is cheating so overwhelmingly that the game just isn't fun.  Either you're stomping easily through everthing, or getting stomped.  No real middle-ground there.On Normal difficulty in my last session for example, most of the AI were on par with a typical player like myself.  But a few will be approximately 15x stronger and that gap will increase rapidly as the game progresses. I'm at ~180 power rating, most range in the 130-300 range, except that one guy sitting at at 2700.  If they decide they hate you, well, your game was never a game because you never stood a chance, and you won't find this out until you've already wasted a number of hours on the galaxy.The game desparately needs the AI to act more consistently and evenly for the difficulty set.  As-is, it just plays like a bad version of the previous title in the series.			"

												I really wanted to like this game and have this be my new go-to science fiction 4X TBS. However, simple features that should have been in the release version of the game are still missing (features that exist in the predecessor, Galactic Civilizations II which I also own). Where is espionage (You know, the biggest reason anyone would choose to play the Krynn, one of the MAJOR factions in the game) ? The game has been out almost 4 months and they just finished ""Mega Events"", half of which ended up in a separate DLC that costs $5. I can't recommend purchasing a game from a company that doesn't deliver core game features before releasing DLC. Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together Stardock.			"

Posted: March 17
												Let me start by saying that although I rated this game as a ""No"", I keep coming back to it beause of the cool features. THe reason it's a ""No"" is because once I have played it for a short while I realise that the game has the potential to be the best space faring strategy game of all time but for some reason the developers have stopped short of including all of the little things that would make it perfect (and these things are not ot be found in the DLC).Nevertheless the greatest feature of this game is the ship designer and ultimately the only reason anyone plays it.So a list of things that could and should be made better to creat a GalCiv that would stand the test of time...Improve the imersive experience and the UI:1. The experience. All the elements are there for this game to really capture the wonder and majesty of space exploration, colonization, diplomacy and battle, but unfortunately the only thing that's done well is battle with everything else second fiddle.A. Let's start with Exploration: This is pretty vanilla. The Devs clearly have great imagination but for some reason don't apply it to making this element more fun and more significant. What I really want to be experiencing is wonder at discovering new life forms, anomolies and the like and not only that but having them make a real difference one way or the other. Sure you sometimes get a few bc and maybe a tech increase but what I'm suggesting is more: Quests and story arcs that can result in more bc, tech or other bonuses but not right away, only after the quests have been completed. Next, planets should have to be explored first before they can be colonized, to determine resources but also to spark more quests and bonuses and the like. What's on the planet should continue to have an effect, be it artefacts, subsentient beings or dangerous events.B. Colonization. This is all good in principle, but wouldn't it be great if there was more to it? As mentioned explore the planet first and while I like the ideology idea, I'm more interested by the stories that prompt the choices when you colonize. It is a real shame that the story elements themselves are never again mentioned when dealing with the planet as they could add a fantasticly rich and imersive gameplay experience. Next, if the landmass was more relevant to the improvments and there was just more to do from the colony screen the experience would again be improved beyond measure. Imagine if there were options to export certain native resources, wildlife etc. or if there was more detail on the mix of races and tensions there. There are so many possibilities!Next, perhaps different races are more suited to different atmospheric conditions or the like, a Class 10 planet to one species might be a Class 9 to another and this could be balanced by actually having a greater number of that race on the planet... something like that.C. Diplomacy. This is where the devs have made some great improvements but its still very one dimensional. My greatest disatisfaction is that most of the treaty stuff is useless. It's worse than Civilization. Again, look to Paradox and specifically the latest  Europa Universalis or Crusader Kings for how diplomacy is ideally dealt with in a strategy game.D. Battle. This is not bad and is the best part of the game. My biggest gripe here is actually UI related. For some unknown reason the pivot point of the camera has been changed from GalCiv2 to GalCiv3 and now it is difficult to maneuver and take in the whole battle from every angle you desire. The focus and pivot point should be the centre of the battlefield. The camera also breaks down in free mode at certain angles. The camera usablity nearly destroys the one thing that makes this game unique and great. This is a MUST FIX. Make the camera more user friendly or you undermine the point of the designing your own ships.Next, is planetary invasion. This is again too simple. THere should be more tactical requirements. Cheaper transports but separate ground based military. Think Distant Worlds: Universe.2. The UI. Stardock could really learn a thing or two from Paradox, who do this really well. Again I'm talking EU or CK here.  There are a few times where information is unavailable or it is squashed into a box too small for the content. This needs an overhaul. My biggest gripe is that once you form a fleet the movement points of the fleet are not visible in the bottom left but they are when hovered over. 3. Improvements:A. History!Another big point for me is history. In the dim dark reesses of my memory I seem to recall there used to be a ""notes"" section for planets in GalCiv2. If there wasn't then there should have been. This simple feature (i.e. allowing notes to be made for each planet in the colony screen) would again drastically improve the game experience. Here players can record the history of the planet or reminders of strategy or the like. Ideally, a history log of each planet would be automatic but adding notes gives the player greater flexibility.While I'm on this notes thing, imagine there was a record of each ship you ever commissioned as well. For some reason that makes the experience better for me, to be able to look back as say ""Wow, the T.A.S. Victory was a mighty fine ship, destroying X number of ships before being destroyed at the Battle of So-And-So"".B. Great People. I know its a rip off from Civilization, but let's be honest so is a lot of the GalCiv idea. This is a concept that, if done better than Civilization does it could add a lot more depth to gameplay. This would need an overhaul Anyway, Enough rambling. I doubt Stardock will ever see this or think to fix these issues as for most people games are about beating the game and winning but for me it's about the experience. I look at games as entertainment, not acheivement. I don't go to a movie just to say I've watched it or to beat it, and in the same way I don't play a game to beat it or win, but rather to enjoy the experience of playing. "

												First, a caveat...I actually do enjoy this game, at least some of the time.  Now, onto business...Pros:+ Potentially expansive universe with what could've been nearly endless options.+ A notably unique storyline with interesting details, and races at least some of which don't seem quite ""cookie cutter"".+ A ship designer such that, to this day, no other 4X game has.Cons:- Maps typically end up more like Battle Arenas than strategy maps, for a couple of different reasons, but the most important of which is that even truly beefy computers are greatly taxed trying to run an Insane map of any kind.- Far too short a campaign, that could've been entirely epic.- Too little variation between how each race plays.  Essentially, there's only one winning strategy, and the tactics each race uses to follow that strategy are only mildly varied at best.  The game had a lot of potential for a lot of unique mechanics for each of the races that would have actually drastically changed how they play, but this wasn't done.- Ship designer somewhat clunky and unintuitive. Great variety of parts to choose from, but missing a good selection of truly simple, universal ""core"" parts.- The AI is abysmal.  There simply is no other word for it.- There are still far too many bugs, and far too little polish, for what was supposed to be a top-shelf, finished game.- Excessive emphasis on DLC rather than actually improving the base game.Summary:This game could've been one of the best 4X space games of its generation, if not of all time.  It could've been better than even Stellaris (though I haven't played that yet, so I could be wrong).  Enjoyable as it is, some of the time, it's just not quite enough on its own to earn a recommendation.  Coupled with how much potential it had but missed out on, I just have to flat-out not recommend it.If it goes on a decent sale, however, I wouldn't fault you for picking it up anyway.  It can be really fun in small doses.  But it just doesn't carry the kind of epic grandiosity that one reasonably expects from a game about conquering (or liberating) the galaxy.  It's unfortunate, but here's hoping that they did well enough in sales, and are willing enough to learn from their mistakes, that a Galactic Civilizations IV will happen, and be better than ever.

Early Access Review
								NOTE:   This is a review of the Final Release Candidate for the game, so it should apply to the released version.Having been a long-time GC2 player, I eagerly signed up for the Founder's Edition early-access over a year ago, and have followed the development of GC3 since then closely.Let me tell you, getting a 4X game that incorporates all the features that hard-core strategy gamers want, while remaining both relevant and competitive, is really hard. As in, EXTREMELY hard.  StarDock has done an excellent job with GC3.  That's not to say there still aren't quibbles over the direction certain features have taken, but the reality is, that if you actually want to release a game, certain decisions are going to have to be taken, and you're sure to♥♥♥♥♥♥off someone who wanted that feature and didn't get it.  But GC3 is a solid and entertaining game, if not a radically innovative one.On to the specifics:A big positive is a revamp of the ""alignment"" system from GC2, which was, frankly, pretty primitive. The new one is far more nuanced, and continues to be relevant through the entire game.The game has changed from square-based to hex-based, and whether or not you love it or not often boils down to whether you used to be a paper boardgame player. I for one much perfer it to squares.  Movement and area of influence or effects are much smoother and visually linear.You'll note that the game is 64-bit only. There's a reason for this: GIANT MAPS.  This is a highly-threaded, fast game engine, and high-end gaming boxes can play on a map of 1000+ planets and 50+ opponents.  Turn times are reasonable at this point, but you still want a darned powerful box if you're playing on these ginormous box.  It plays nice and smooth on a typical i5 with 8GB with modest graphics card, against 10 computer opponents on a 50+ star map, and there aren't any noticeable bugs at this point; it certainly is stable and non-crashing.   My rig is high-end (8-core Xeon & 24GB of RAM, with SSDs and a Nvidia 750), and I have absolutely no problems at all on my 200-star maps and 25 opponent games.The planet improvement scheme is VERY much improved by adjacency bonus; it now matter as much as to HOW you place your buildings on a planet as which ones you build.  And, speaking of buildings, there's easily twice as many different ones to choose from, and three times as many ""bonus"" tile times.  The AI generating the tiles still needs a bit of tweaking to avoid some stupid layouts, but that's a minor quibble, and likely will be improved more via free updates. The ship builder is more complex, and much more interesting to use. Ships now have a wider choice of weapons (including chosing between ones with different ranges, rates of fire, etc.), and larger engine selection. Unfortunately, I find it a bit clunkier than the GC2 one. The Battleviewer is pretty much unchanged since GC2.  The promised tactical settings (i.e. ""offensive"", ""defensive"" for your fleet tactics) has yet to materialize.  Probably won't until later this year, and either an Expansion Pack or DLC.   There will be no Tactical Combat player screen. I'm very happy about that (I don't want TBTC in my 4x), but some others feel it should be there.The Graphics are excellent for a 4X.  Personally, I think they're just right - nice, without being over the top and loading my system down with work for something that's really not gameplay-relevant.The tech trees are custom to each race, and noticeably (if not entirely) different. A new feature is exclusive choice in some techs:  some technologies have 2 or 3 sub-techs in them, and you can only chose one.  This means you can't just load up on the entire tech tree, but have to be careful about how you pick your path through it, because certain choices simply will exclude you from possessing others. Diplomacy and the United Planets are greatly improved over GC2 - far more meaningful interactions, and many of the ""cheats"" and such possible in GC2 have been either closed off, or are actively penalized.  Being diplomatic is just as important as being militarily strong.Trading and the Economy are better overall than GC2, but require a bit too much micromanagement at this point. If anything, I hope this will be further improved by a post-release patch.  It's certainly playable now, just it gets hard when you move up to the really big maps (managing 5 dozen planets can get a bit tedious right now). Espionage IS NOT included in the initial release. StarDock has said it will be in the first major Expansion Pack, as they want to make a considerable effort to radically improve it over GC2.  So don't expect this until 2016 sometime.Finally, the A.I. is solid, but rather bland at this point. However, there is a saving grace:  this is a learning A.I.  StarDock has hooked it into SteamWorks, and will be datamining all user strategies to improve the A.I. performance, and will be updating the A.I. regularly when you sign into Steam.  So, as the GC3 community gets better, so will the A.I.Overall, solid 8 out of 10 for the intial Release. Also, note that StarDock has explicitly committed to several ""substantial"" DLCs per year (read: things that actually improve gameplay, not just skins or bling, but stuff like more races, new ship flavors, etc.) and at least 3 major Expansion packs over the 6-7 year lifespan. Given there track record, I fully expect that these DLCs and Expansion Packs will take the entire game in new directions, and make a very substantial impact on keeping the game relevant over time.I fully expect that GC3 will graduate to a 9.5 star game over the next couple of years, and, given StarDock's track record of listening to its customers, much of the direction of GC3's improvement is going to be up to the community.

												Seems unfinished. I'm getting an issue where the whole screen just goes black except for the mouse cursor, and the music continues playing. The only way to fix it is to restart and unfortunately it happens often.I am excited about the possibilities of 64-bit gaming, and I'm glad Stardock went this route.I love the GalCiv games but don't buy this one just yet. I would've held off on spending $50 if I had known that this many bugs were still present.edit: A few months on and I have to say I'm still disappointed. Major races are still missing (what happened to the Torians? The Drath were freaking cool too.) and the DLC has so far added...events, a goofy alien campaign (for a minor race no less), and well that's about it. I also have to say that I'm disappointed it only supports windows, with the Win10 debacle I've been moving towards linux slowly but surely and the lack of linux support is disheartening - especailly considering that linux is a huge force for 64-bit OSes. The game is by no means terrible, and it had big shoes to fill to begin with, but these things still stick in my mind.EDIT------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now that a bit of time has passed, I though I should update this. Lots of bugs have been worked out, and the AI is finally up to par with the previous games in the series. I'm still disappointed by the lack of races - where are the Torians and the Arceans? I really wish the Drath and the Korx were still options to play as well. The DLC released so far is OK, but I'm going to wait for a sale since it doesn't really add anything that I'm dying to have in the game. If they were introducing new races (besides squirrels!) that would be awesome. Really my only complaint with the game is the lack of races. Right now, I would say if you really love this kind of game then buy it. If you want to ahve more races to play with/as, then I would wait for a sale. I would say that the game is worthwhile as long as they keep expanding it and adding new options.			"

Instant crash to desktop every time.We all got our money back, so at least the one thing that worked was Steam Support.10/10 crash experience, highly immersive **UPDATE**We have discovered the issue, it seems to be able to play with your friends they MUST have the same DLC as you. So if you intend to game with friends, be sure they have all the DLC that you do, otherwise you are wasting your money.			"

A promising work in progressThe game was updated to version 1.03 on June 8: http://forums.galciv3.com/466812Since the official launch on May 14 the developers have kept patching the game, updating it almost once per week. Although the game officially isn't in early access beta any longer, there are still several bugs left to be fixed, multiple game balance changes are made in each patch, and miscellaneous other improvements are still being worked on besides those already implemented in the two first patches. The feeling one gets from all this is that this game hasn't reached gold quality yet, but that it'll happen in a few weeks or months. Several issues remain to fix, including fully implementing some features.Galactic Civilizations III is an ambitious update of the popular predecessor, Galactic Civilizations II, with numerous changes of the game mechanics, and a general improvement of the graphics, both of which take advantage of the possibilities that 64-bit operating systems provide. A consequence of this is that this version uses much more of the computer resources, such as CPU, RAM and GPU. Since the game isn't fully optimized yet, despite being sold as a finished game, there are some performance issues like lags and freezing, although the latest patch to version 1.02 seems to have brought several performance improvements.Some of the biggest changes are the upgraded ship editor and the new battle mechanics. The ship editor has become more advanced, with new functionality which makes it easier to create good-looking custom ships. The space battles are now more complex, with each ship having a designated tactical role which is selected when saving a new ship design.Diplomacy and espionage has been changed in several ways, but neither is fully implemented yet, so the current version is more limited than the previous version was at the end of its development.The manual is still a work in progress, so reading the forums is sometimes necessary to find out how some aspects of the game work. Some features aren't yet fully implemented, so some frustration with strange behavior and even inability to continue playing in some situations have to be endured in the current condition. The developers are hard at work with patches, and an upgrade to version 1.1 is expected in the near future.My overall impression at this moment in time is that this game is a promising 4X turn-based strategy space-themed game which currently can be viewed as a playable public beta. Recommended only if you want to start learning the game mechanics, and explore possible tactics and strategies, while waiting for all the features to become fully implemented, and if you can stand the various bugs and unfinished balancing of the game. It'll take some time to master all the aspects of this game, so playing it now can be considered as preparation for the real gold version in the near future. The developers listen to feedback, so posting in the Gameplay Feedback forum is recommended.			"

Posted: May 17, 2015
												Despite really needing that game to be awesome, because I need a good modern 4x space game (Endless Space doesn't count, I already spent too much time on it), I really can't recommend that game.Let me be clear on that : the game is OK or even Excellent on several points. Some nice ideas, alright to brilliant visuals, nice tunes, OK diplo, etc. But the game design... dude... This is a nightmare. The kind that slowly, creepily, haunts you at night.So for starters that game is ultra slow. If you like your 4x turns to take about 30s to 1min, then this game is alright. But if you want one full game to last less than 30hrs, then this game is NOT for you. Pacing is always a big issue in designing a 4x game (as Jon Shafer explained in a couple of great articles), and this game is proof. I remember ranting about Civ 5 taking too long to complete even on Fast setting, but this... See, at the time I'm writing this review, I'm clocking about 20hrs of game time. That's 1 tutorial and 2.5 campaign missions. Thing is : the tutorial took half of that.Why this game is slooooow isn't a computing problem (I've got a nice machine, turn goes by without even noticing a slowdown, everything goes fast), it's a game design problem. The perfect recipe for a 4x game is when you have much things to deal with at each and every turn. Meaningful and interesting choices if possible (yes I'm talking to you Pandora). Is Galactic Civ III, turns went past me by the dozens just because everything is this game take 20-30 turns to happen. I soon realized that every single strategic choice I was making was to improve the rate at which things where building JUST to push the damn game forward! That wasn't a real strategic choice, that was just a comfort choice, so I could make something happen in the game under 6 hours.When you end up fighting the game rules to speed up things, something went wrong...For instance : you have a build queue on every planet you have. Great. Alright. Buildings and ships are built that way. They all cost a certain amount of ""Manufacture"" (Prod) and conveniently, your planet generates ""Manufacture"". If a building needs 45Man and you produces 15Man a turn, it takes 3 turns to complete the building. Right?Now if you have three buildings that all cost 15 and you build them on a planet that produces 45 a turn, how much turn do you need to produce all three of them? One? WRONG. You need 3 turns. Because it doesn't push unused ""Manufacture"" to the following builds to the point it can build multiple things at the same turn. so even if you get a planet with 150Man a turn, and a bunch of buildings each costing around 45-60 Man, you will NEVER build more than 1 building per turn.So a build queue that could have taken 3 turns, ends up taking 10-15 turns... for nothing!So of course, every turn, you have something new to deal with : ""Hey! here's a new building we could have built 6 turns earlier, we just wanted you to know we don't give a damn! And NO you don't have anything to do with it, this is just a message filling your log that you can't do much about!""So much for a good 4x recipe...That's just an example of how the game makes you go mad. Here are a few others :- Ships are put into Fleets, Fleets have a maximum size measured in ""Logistics"". Each ship in a fleet costs part of this ""Logistics"". You can have Logistics reduction on ships so that they end taking less room in the Fleet so that you can put more of them. The problem is that ""Logistics""stat is stored in a decimal value (but displayed as a integer value). So you end up with Ships costing 1 Logistics that cannot join a Fleet of 28/29 Logistics... because ♥♥♥♥ you.- Some technologies (Specialisations) expect a choice from you. Most of them have 3 possible choices, mutually exclusive and definitive. Some of them won't go with your plan, some others will exactly fit your master plan. Turns out these techs are available for diplomatic trading, but since each Specialisation choice is a separate tech, you may end up earning a Tech that you didn't choose based on the fact it was a exclusive choice. Such technologies won't appear as ""Specialisation"" tech in the trading screen. Now you're stuck with the strategic choice of another civ... because ♥♥♥♥ you.- The Ship Designer is a complex and rich piece of software that lets you assemble, scale, rotate, fiddle with, even ANIMATE ship parts in a very, very, very profound way. You may end up spending countless hours designing splendid vessels to contemplate ingame. The same goes if you ever want to build a working useful ship. There is no ""Just give me a ship with Defense AND Attack please"" button. There is no ""Just fit my ships with what they need, even if it's not perfectly optimized just build them"" button. But there IS a core listing of ships that the game provides for starters... but these ships are only complete and in working order when you research some specific Technologies first. You can build them, fly with them, but they'll only be of any use if you get to those techs. But it WON'T TELL YOU WHICH ONES... because, again, ♥♥♥♥ you.- The planet screen lets you place buildings on its available tiles. The basic buildings all have multiple upgrade buildings (better versions of the latest) that you build on-top of them. At any given point, if you have the technology to build an upgrade version of an existing building on the map, it will show on the list of available buildings that you may place and build... but you can't place them anywhere you want because they only appear there so that you are reminded that some of you buildings may be upgraded (which is already the whole point of having a big ""up arrow"" on top of those buildings with an ""Upgrade"" button next to them). So it is just there to further dwell you into madness and anger... because ♥♥♥♥ ergonomy. Anyway, who cares about ease of use nowadays?!This game is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to play. I needed this game to be great, so I kept playing, and playing until something happened to make me love it, but it kept striking me with stupid UI design, bad pacing job and worst game design flaws that absolutely forbid this game to earn its legacy's reputation.This game doesn't need a patch, it needs to be remade correctly.

I enjoy the ship customization as I can tell the advansment from the second game. I can see once this game is released it'll be a great turned based strategy game that me and my friends will be having lots of fun with!

												I played the hell out of GalCiv2. Then, much more recently, I wanted a fix of GalCiv-like 4X gameplay, and picked up Endless Space to hold me over unti GalCiv3. And proceeded to play the hell out of it.I was really excited when GalCiv3 finally dropped. But half an hour into playing it, I realized something surprising: I like Endless Space a whole lot better.  Endless Space feels more like ""real"" galaxy exploration instead of moving tokens on a gameboard. The discoveries and events feel more story-like, wheras in GalCiv3 they just feel like excuses to click through and get resources. The graphics in Endless Space are far more beautiful, and the music is far better.The truth is, for me Endless Space IS GalCiv3. And GalCiv3 is... well, it's GalCiv2 Remastered. I've gone back to playing Endless Space, and I'm looking forward to the sequel.			"

												As a big fan of Gal Civ I and II, I was excited for the third.  This game is not like those.  The originals were epic and complete strategy games with a charming miniamilst indie-style.  Part 3 is actually a DLC purchase simulation game, where gameplay consists of buying and downloading tons of nickle-and-dime DLC, which trickles out every so often.  The original game is so short and shallow, I thought I had completed the tutorial only to discover the campaign was over.  This game was just a shell onto which endless DLC is piled.  Features that were in the original games were removed from the third, and repackaged as DLC (with some features still missing).  Stardock once held the title as ""most trusted developer"" in my book, but things have changed at the studio, and their products are absolutely awful rip-offs now, and Stardock should be considered a scam company. (See also, ""Elemental"" for another example of a rip-off game from these developers).			"

I was ranked as having less power than all my opponents and yet with 30 ships (3 fleets) i rick rolled all my competition. No balance in tech power to ship count. The the dlc released so far doesnt even fill in the missing races from gc2. This feels like stardock has taken on the EA marketing model. Better to wait a few years till the game is completed and sold at a lower price or wait till something better comes along.			"

								I play a lot of 4x space games and GC II was one of the best.  I was excited when I saw GC3!  This game looks like it is going to be really good, but as it currently stands (in beta) it has many issues;  strange freezes, minor bugs, and missing content.   You can definately see the potential in this game but it is nowhere near finished.   Currently it is somewhat playable but frustrating at times.  I recomend waiting until full release or buying it on sale.   Full price for an unfinished game is a bit lame.I am going to give this a thumbs up ONLY because of its potential and what it is going to be (you can easily see the core game is good in this beta), but currently AS IS, I can't recommend it.

												Lots of great ideas in this game, but really badly broken for a supposedly complete game, especially one that spent a lot of time in beta with a lot of players and feed back and extra development money rolling in. I still might have recommended the game, which will hopefully eventually be fixed, but when I went to check the support site to see the status of these errors they link you to a page that asks you to try to fix the game for them, asking you to do just about everything short of a clean OS install to try to get their product to function before you even think of submitting a ticket. It sure feels a lot like blaming the user and it makes me wonder if they are so overwhelmed with error reports that they felt they had no choice but to try to discourage people from submitting anymore. I'll happily change my review if they fix this game in short order, but right now this really tastes like a lemon.			"

												I have been a supporter of Stardock. But everyone makes mistakes. This is theirs.This game is the bottom of the barrel. The only way it could get lower was if it were vaporware with no refund available.It was released way too early. It is essentially a beta. And it has no depth to it at all and is riddled with bugs. It also lacks a lot of managerial functionality that makes playing on larger maps nearly impossible.Not only is it an unfinished product, it is a bare bones framework of a game.Save your money. Come back in a few years when it is on sale in a pack with all the DLC and expansions. (If it lasts that long.) "

Early Access Review
								I bought this game the day it came out almost, quite harsh and alot of the old reviews were (in a few cases still are though no where near when it started) really buggy. Some times you were happy to play a half hour at a time. The fan base for this game though is such that it is develouping faster than I expected. Mostly due to the fact that this is one of the devs flagship games and they take the fans serious.The game is very much what you would expect from the series. I was hopingg the dread lords would become a playable character with a new uber antagonist replacing them, its still in develoupment though so crossing my fingers. All the origonal playable characters are still there (Currently still 2 to be released). They all now ""feel"" like self realised races though and not just stat bonuses and a spattering of race only techs.Alot of the reviews in the negatives for this game was for the fact that they put it up for sale not long after the release. A fact that has nothing to do with the game and is all about the customer. Its a shame really how hurt this games reviews are due to that. So here I am 7  months into the game develoupment now. Paided full price, was not upset about the sale as I being a reasoned adult know that means more people on the game helping the DEV's. From what I seen so far I give 4.5 out of 5. My ownly complaint being no new races. If you liked GC2 Your going to love what this game appears to promise on compleation.			"

Posted: May 17, 2015
												I cannot recommend this game at this time, for several reasons.First of all, it is an incomplete game, lacking espionage functions, politics, and even the ability to create random opponents in the random map generator.  These and other missing aspects of any decent 4X game will be sold at a later date in expansions.  In the end, this game will cost you over $100 just to get what it should have in the base product.  I do not like this trend in some games we are seeing, where an incomplete game is sold for full price as though it were a finished product, and then over the next months and years, the game is finished and released at extra cost.Secondly, this game is not a third installment, but more like a 2.5 installment.  If you played GC2, you have already played this game.  Almost everything is exactly the same as its predecessor.  Once more, planets have no moons we can exploit, dead planets cannot be mined or otherwise used, black holes and nebulas, are little more than space walls that impede traffic (apparently in space, there is no 3D travel allowing us to fly under or over these obstacles), asteroids belts cannot be mined, either.Planet development is the same as GC2, with random tiles conferring random bonuses.  There are no telescopes in this game, so we cannot know what the universe looks like, what planets are like, what stars have planets, etc. until our scout ship (or some other vessel) goes there.The races are generic and dull.  Apparently, in the galaxy all races breath the same air as we do here on earth, prefer the same atmosphere and climate, and want the same gravity.  The race creator is as uninspired as the races themselves, being a rather shallow system where you get to pick from a handful of options to create a not all that unique race.  There is no high gravity races or worlds, no aquatic races, no radiation races, nor anything else unique.  The races are more like different groups of humans than species who have evolved on different worlds, except for the fact that they look rather alien (mostly).  Think of the races as humans, and humans wearing costumes.The tech tree is as imaginative as the races.  Generic is the word to use here.  None of the tech is interesting.  There are no fascinating tools like shields that extend over other ships in your fleet for instance.  Just a series of faster engines, a series of stronger missiles and bullets and lasers.  You can unlock more squares on your planet, you can get some terraforming so you can live on cold or hot planets...basically, this is the same generic tech tree in every 4X game in the past 7 or 8 years.  There is nothing interesting here, but there are silly fluff techs you need to research in order to discover that you need to research weapons, or engines, and so on.  Even with the fluff techs, the tech tree is so short, that you easily cap out your research.  In order to slow down players' research, there is an age system.  There are three ages, and during each age, you can only research so far up the tech tree.  Why?  Because, that's why.  We don't want players researching too quickly, the AI opponents will feel sad, I guess.Trade is conducted the same way as in GC2.  In this game, you can send constructors to build starbases that mine special minerals and such floating in space.  These can be magically shipped at great distances to your planets, even passing through alien, even enemy, territory at no extra cost.  Pirates do not interfere with your shipping of these valuable resources, nor do other factions.  the only way to impede this magic transport of rare resources is to destroy the miner base.  Not capture it, no, just destroy it.There are a couple things Stardock did improve on, however.  The lousy morality system in GC2 that never even worked all that well, was changed to an ideology system.  The same three morality perspectives--benevolent, pragmatic, malevolent--still apply, but as you acquire more points in these ideologies, you can unlock the ideology tech tree.  The ideology tech tree is more interesting than the regular tech tree, but it is very small, and somewhat redundant across the systems.  There are some variants and interesting things in it, though, and this is easily the only part of this game that is actually any good.The other improvement, which is a bit of a mess as implemented, is adjacency bonuses on planets.  Various structures can provide bonuses if they are built next to each other.  Also, certain random bonus tiles on the planets can provide bonuses as well.  This is a mixed bag because the tiles are random, and you will often find yourself unable to take advantage of certain bonuses, or set up a grouping of buildings that feed bonuses to one another.The other attempted improvement is the creation of unique tech trees for the races.  Unfortunately, the tech trees are so generic, that the differences are extremely small and not worth mentioning.In short, this game is just GC 2.5, but without espionage or politics.  I can only recommend waiting for two years, maybe three, for expansion packs to flesh out this incomplete offering, and get released in some kind of deluxe edition for a reasonable price.  However, I am confident that no expansions will solve this game's greatest drawback:  genericness.  This game is generic mediocre gaming, and it shows in every aspect.  There is nothing innovative or interesting when exploring or colonizing.  Combat is abstracted and forgettable, just as it was in GC2.  Techs are the same, races are humans in costumes, and so on.

												So apparently Galactic Civilizations 3 is trying to each me a lesson about life.  I tried to play the good guy, not declaring war, only wiping out invasion fleets, then offering peace, if no peace, then I invade, if no peace, then I conquer, then I still offer peace.  So after wiping out 1 race and having a 2nd make peace only after capturing their home world.  So 11 hours into the game my ally decides to declare war on me.  It makes a sneak attack on every system in my space, conquering some and just causing a super huge pain in my♥♥♥♥♥♥as my fleets were closer to my former enemy.  I hit the retire button,  lesson learned.  EVIL is the only way win at life.  Conquer all or be conquered.  Peace is an illusion.  God Send Death.			"

								As a long time fan of the Galactic Civilizations series, initially I was concerned this game would be merely a graphical update on the (fantastic) mechanics present in GalCiv II.However, GalCiv 3 has taken the core of what has made the series great thus far, as well as the best of both the old and new Sid Meiyers Civ games to craft something BEYOND fantastic.Naturally, in beta, it still has polish passes and a few more features to implement, but the potential is there, evident and clear to see that this game will honestly be the greatest modern offering in the genre.Beautiful, strategic and deep, it offers up every feature (and then some) you could hoep to see in a turn based strategy game.I can only look forward to what Stardock have planned for future expansions too, as GalCiv 2's expansion made it arguably the best game in the genre to date, I'm excited to see where the future of GalCiv 3 takes it.But until then, I'm ready to play Space Emperor, with GC3 as my interface.

								Buying this, when I did, was not a good idea. The game is quite a bit earlier in the developement cycle than I had thought. Advancement is slow with some updates being made every 30 or 40 days. To say that the game is currently ""playable"" is a large stretch with very few game types functional and very few races available but there is no way to actually finish a game presently. The ship designer kind of works, and you can research stuff (well, you can pick stuff), but there is no combat at the moment.I wouldn't drop this kind of money on an unfinished product again. I know these guys will finish this and do damned good job, but it is too much money for a game that is a long way off with too many things that can happen between now and then. I'm also a little angry because it is totally diminishing my anticipation of the finished game when it releases. I've unistalled it.			"

												Galactic Civilizations IIILove this game. It is much improved over GC II. This is a turn based strategy game.RacesFirst, you can create a custom race anyway way you want to. Steam Workshop has some cool factions for the pictures and you can customize those as well.There are several races in the game. Typical humans, of course, an evil race called the Drengin, and others. I think the background diversity of the races is really neat. The Yor are metaloids with no morals = not evil, just amoral. The Krynn Syndicate are composed of minor races, and the Altarian Resistance is the do-goody cute girl leader. There are other major races as well.The minor races are also neat. They do not expand but make good trading partners. Their worlds are also big if you want to conquer them.EconomyVery nice. Each planet based on size has tiles to build improvements. These give small bonuses initially but add up with all of the other bonuses and make a good difference. I usally make most worlds finance so I can rush produce items and have a large fleet. Terrforming is one tile at atime which cuts down on management.ResearchI am impressed with the research trees in this game. There are slightly different trees for each race. I like the fact that there are many non-military technolgies as well as a large amount of military upgrades.Star BasesThese make a big difference. Powerful in the early going they become obsolete fast against dedicated enemy fleets. However, Star Bases and planets can have up to 60 points of ships stationed there right from the beginning. The key for star bases is that they have many upgrades for economies. Small increases add up. Up to 4 (sometimes 5) star bases can surround a planet and with all the upgrades the bases will increase the planet economy 200% (so you are getting triple the base). This stacks on the planetary improvements as well. And, there are different types of star bases = economy, military, mining and culture.Precursor ArtifactsThe Precursors inhabited the Galaxy long ago but disappeared. They left behind some goodies. WIth a Star Base you can claim these artifacts and they give bonuses to the whole empire.CombatThis is played out in real time. I like it. There are lots of sounds and shots and explosions. This is very cool. The role of a ship (selected when saving the design) determines where the ship is at battle's start. There are even fighter pods for the ships once researched. I really like the combat in this game.Planetary combat is just one screen and no action. You select your attack type and get the results. Different attacks are researchable.The Music is very good. Overall I like this game.			"

												The game is really Gal Civ 2 with a few changes that could be done as a DLC. The same graphics, icons, portraits, civilizations, technologies, buildings' names. There are a few new technologies, buildings, ship modules and a new ship creator, but overall it is still the same game - all basic functionality did not change: you can survey anomalies, build starbases, build buildings on planets in exactly the same way. If you want a few extras for Gal Civ 2 you may like this game, but if you got bored with Gal Civ 2 and expect something new - you will be disappointed.There are multiple bugs:- SAVING GAME IS OFTEN UNSUCCESSFUL - game crashes when trying to load certain saves. This prevents you from interrupting the game because you never know whether you will be able to load that saved game or not, which in turn makes a game unplayable- you can sometimes build unique buildings twice- sometimes the technology tree shows that the technology was not yet discovered even though it was, you have to close and open technology tree again- the technology tree doesn't show descriptions of other specializations than the one you researched (specialization is a technology such that you have to choose one of 3 available, however you can buy the other two from other races)- bugs/mismatches between technologies' descriptions and actual effects- AI is pretty dump, they will declare the war against you because they don't like you, but will ask for peace next turn because you are too strong- path finding is dump, it will often choose a path through enemy teritory even though equally long path through your teritory exists- impossible to rename the planet immediatelly after colonising it, you have to go to the map and back to the planet- if there are multiple messages after others turn (war declared, new race found, auto-surveying ship found an anomaly) only one of them is shown- when you change production distribution (research/manufacturing/economy) the buildings queue is not refreshed, you have to either change something in the queue or switch to map/another planet and then come back- multiple typos in technology tree- various graphical bugs (shots not displayed correctly, some weird textures behind some of the texts etc.)- ideology traits saying that they give you some bonus which in fact is not applied at all- on larger maps the performance is really terrible, when you scroll the map you have to wait for a few seconds for it to load, opening any other view such as planet management or diplomacy also takes 5-10 seconds, a ""quick battle"" actually takes about 10 seconds of ships waiting on the map before one of them shoots and the other is destroyed; if you try to zoom in (to see actual models of entities instead of their icons) you will probably decide to zoom out again after 20 seconds of game being stuckAnd multiple annoying ""features"":- you cannot see the path or the range of the ship, click will initiate movement which cannot be interrupted- if a ship is moving towards destination and you press ""next turn"" button, the ship will move but all remaining movement points are lost, you are not promted to do something with the idle ship- the same happens if the ship is set to ""automatic survey"", once it reaches a destination anomaly site, all remaining movement points are lost- it is very difficult to control enemy ships movements - all are done at once and there is no log or ""enemy turn replay""- all remaining manufacturing/research points are lost at the end of turn so if you have 2k manufacturing points per turn and want to produce a frigate which costs 200 points, you can only produce one per turn anyway- you can assign multiple planets to provide their manufacturing points to single shipyard, however you cannot assign single planet to multiple shipyards- buying ships/buildings ceases the normal production, i.e. if building A has 1 turn remaining and you buy building B, next turn building A will still have 1 turn remaining- although in ship designer there are tabs for ""core"" and ""user"" ships, there are no such tabs when upgrading existing ship, which means that you have to scroll through 20 ""core"" designs to find the one you made- micromanagement - each planet's potential can be split between wealth, manufacturing and research (defaults to 33% each). Let's say that you want a research focused planet so you set research to 100%. Once you discover a new type of laboratory, the upgrades will be put onto the building queue automatically, however they will not build because you have 0% manufacturing. On the other hand, if you have 20% manufacturing only for this purpose, once all laboratories are upgraded and building queue is empty, you just lose 20% of planet's potential- there are list to view all your planets/ships/starbases but the order in them is completely random with no sorting options- music is different in every view (map/ship/planet/governing planet/menu) which gets pretty annoying e.g. when you need to go over 20 ships to upgrade them and you hear 3 first seconds of two different tracks over and over again...EDIT: There is a beta patch availablehttp://forums.galciv3.com/467453/page/1 however it DOES NOT address any issues listed above... Stardock is promising regular extra content with the first expansion at the end of summer, however the game is so full of bugs that it is really unplayable. Don't waste your time and money on it.

												Galactic Civilization III is a great update from GC I or II. Best thing is to go 64bit, so there is plenty room for an upgrade. ...and upgrade is badly needed, btw. Game is playable, but sometimes still feels like a beta which was released way too early, while all buyers are getting used as semi-proffessional-testers. There is so much to do, that you have enough fun to explore all aspects of this game. They had some rather good ideas...unfortunately they didn't follow the road to the end. As in shipyards. You could sink hours into building your own custom designed ships....but you can't lead them in a battle. All you could do is to have higher numbers then your enemy and wish good luck. They brought in a cinema like view on the 'battle'...but you could do NOTHING to change the outcome. As for multiplayer. They totally forgot about founding different versions by simply translating the game without compensation. Us players had to bring voice toward the devs about their hard to stand mistake. About half a year the game wasn't playable in multiplayer. Lately us players found the missing key inside english localization files. But...at the end game is still not working in multiplayer...not for technical issue, but for bad design. All players are in LOCAL lobby to find mutliplayer games. If your local area has no GC3 players, you paid for a multiplayer game which you can't use. There is another bad design....they sold the game on GOG, but GOG players' versions are not compatible with STEAM players' version. They even didn't bring up a simple IP-connection...for their own reasons. Looks like GC3's multiplayer was just announced to have it but never implemented for internet users. Just a word: if I would like to play multiplayer with my neighbour I would have bought a tabletop. Multiplayer is used to be played worldwide not local. As for creating your own custom faction. Factions aren't anything other then branches from only one alien race. All do compete on the same ressources, all do compete on the same sort of planets. All 'aliens' do start on little sunshine world same as all other. Devs changed the way those custom factions were stored several times...but you could never find out which one use old (=obsolete and gamebraking) design when you subscribe one from workshop. As for Steam cloud. GC3 offers steam cloud for savegames, custom factions and your very own ship designs. Unfortunately it's simply impossible to delete them. Even Steam is not able to delete them completely. But if you have saves from earlier game versions...it is able to break your game. Instead of offering a simple switch to turn Steam cloud on/off for GC3 they just tell you to switch off Steam cloud for your entire account to avoid issues with GC3. As for diplomacy. It's there...rudimentary, but it's like living in the '60 where all things are good or bad but game shows no offer for playing it other then by force. Still you can't prevent aliens from spreading colonies or outposts...even within your own zone of control. Player is still forced to run and hestitate to get some of the planets and goods before the aliens grab it. My first guess is, the devs cutted out deeply needed parts to sell it later for good money as DLC. Worst of all decissions in my eyes. First one has to bring a totally satisfying game, then one could upgrade his good product with more flavor. Stardock may learn it from Paradox...I'm really dissappointed about the game in current state and also frustrated about it for a very long time, where no one was able to adress multiplayer issues for longer then half a year. It has great potential to be better then the actual design...but I fear the devs are a) unwilling or b) unable to do better. Have to adress my good impression about Stardock's helpdesk, those guys really try to fix issues...but unfortunately they can't adress bad design from devs. Yeah, one could say it's all merchandizing...but if I stop to buy things from Stardock, they defenetly regret. Seems there is no other way to get the message through. Besides there are allready competitors underway which avoid those issues. Have a look at 'Stellaris', 'Endless Space 2' or even new 'Master of Orion'....all announced 2016.  "

												The game is great and has plenty of potential. However, it's suffering from self-replicating DLC syndrome and the AI cheats horribly and is anencephalic compared to other turn based strategy games.Get Galactic Civilizations II and use the opt-in update instead. It's not as pretty or fancy but it's great, cheaper, and the AI is actually intelligent.			"

Early Access Review
								I haven't played very much, but I've played GC 2 a ton and feel I have a good enough base of knowledge to compare this game to, though as I play this game more my review is subject to change.First thing I noticed while playing: ""Coming Soon!"" was everywhere. I hated seeing this. I understand it's in Beta, but the only options for you right now are to start a new game or start a quick game. Everything else is blocked off. I haven't played multiplayer so I'm not sure how well that works. I'm not too upset given I spent $25 on the game, but for those who fully supported Stardock back in GC3's $100 asking price I feel right now you aren't getting your money's worth.Second thing I noticed: Holy hell this game is beautiful. Seriously, every event that you have to make a decision on has its own piece of art to look at in the background. It sort of looks like concept art, and it's extremely well done and I enjoyed every event because each one had its own art to see. The graphics are nice, a huge step up from GC2, and understandably so. It has more of a hex-based system of movement that was present in GC2 but it's emphasized more in this game.Music: Great as always. It sounds pretty much like a Galactic Civilizations game. If you liked the soft, ambient music of GC2 (at least during peaceful times) then you'll enjoy it in this one.Gameplay: Not fully fleshed out, as I'll get to soon, but for the most part the features that are more developed are amazing. The tech tree is massive and overwhelming at first, but with time you'll figure out which techs to rush first and optimize properly. The overall consensus is that ship building is fun, but in my brief period of playing I didn't get around to it. Planning on building placement in planets is pretty much the same as GC2, I'm pretty sure all buildings from both the base game and expansions from GC2 are available in GC3 along with a plethora of other buildings I didn't see.Changes in the way fleet management and production was interesting and something I had to get used to first due to my extensive time spent in GC2. Instead of building a Starport on your planets to make them able to build ships, you have to produce a Shipyard which you build just like a Starbase, which has its pros and cons such as not taking up a slot on your planets, but being able to be destroyed by enemies.So far I feel income management isn't fully developed. When you look at your income all it tells you is how much you're making. I think there might be an option to change how much you focus your spending, but it was a little finicky to get to work, at least in my inexperienced eyes.Wars aren't done yet. The battles are close to GC2, but when I got invaded, all that happened was a pop up saying ""You're being invaded"" and I clicked OK and my planet was gone. Ship battles are nearly done, though overall battle is a little barren. This is probably one of the bigger deciding factors in buying the game since battle is one of the X's in 4X.The tech tree is absolutely impressive. There's sooo many things for you to research that it overwhelmed me at the start. I didn't know where to begin. I think one of the main problems was I wasn't used to how the game ran so I was always at a loss to what I needed to research next, like should I focus on planetary improvements or focus on military or focus on expansion? I was randomly researching a little bit of everything until the Drengin Empire declared war on me and subsequently stomped me.So the ending question is ""Should I buy this game?"" And I think the answer is yes. The developers seem very passionate about making this the best Galactic Civilization game thus far, and I believe that with time it will be.But there's one more question: ""Should I play this game right now?"" And I would have to say no. I say pick this game up when it's on sale (like it is right now) or if you're willing to spend the $40ish dollars on it because the full release of the game looks extremely promising. BUT, I would also say that if you want to experience Galactic Civilizations in all its glory, buy and play GC2 Ultimate Edition until GC3 is more fully developed.			"

												UPDATE AS OF MAY 2015:  The game is now out.  IT STILL CRASHES LIKE IT DID IN BETA.  I'm kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that its been an entire year since I bought this and it hasn't improved more.  There are lots of little things that were promised that were never finished, such as resolution and interface settings. All this being said, I am playing it a lot.  Its fun. But I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tactics Stardock used to get the money sooner.  Also, I got an email the other day that they are launching their next 4x game.  Pretty irritating since this one is still not finished a year later. UPDATE AS OF NOV:  I am upset that the game is on sale 50% on the  Stardock website with no mention of it being a beta.  I paid $45 for what was an alpha and now they are selling it for $22 -- and the game still doesn't even have combat. The only rationale for this I can think of for this is that they expect the game will suck when completed and want to sell as much as possible now. ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:I do believe this game WILL earn a recommendation, and therefore I am cautiously assigning it now.  BUT BE WARNED: as of October this is more of an Alpha than a Beta.  It is not that fun to play yet, as tactical combat and diplomacy are still forthcoming.   The game structure is strong, and I believe it WILL be better than most 4x space sims out now ... but not yet. I have faith that Stardock is working hard on this at the moment, but I may change this to not recommended if progress slows too much.  (I am not really a fan of this -- ""pay for it now, you will get it later"" business model but I just couldn't resist trying the game when given the chance)			"

												Ai are the dumbest ai across any game. They have no sence of technology, no idea how to trade with any reseanable ability except to keep the player constantly busy as he/she out-trades all ai with ease.. Trade offers are always a laugh. Ai will always build predicable bases with no attempt to defend it - ever.Zero tactics building up to combat and battles are just a movie.. Yawn.anomalies spoil the game as only the player uses them correctly, every time.. Example :- the AI are allergic to shipyards.I have tried to play many times where I've set up the game to purposefully hinder me and I still find the ai are too dumb to be a challenge to me, let alone a 5 yr old.I've been buying all dlc as released in hopes to make it better but no, its just a time killer with no end game elation.

												Once upon a time I recommended this game and even posted a positive review here about it. But the more I played it, the more I realised how much of an unbalanced mess this game really is. Let's start with the AI shall we?When this game first came out the AI was rather dumb so you had to crank up the difficulty so they'd put up a fight. Stardock released a patch that was supposed to fix it but instead pushed things too far in the other direction. I'll admit I'm not a strategic genius but when I'm on the easiest difficulty and it feels like I'm going up against SKYNET something's gone wrong. This isn't helped by a certain bonus the AI gets on every difficulty level: They pay no maintenance on ships. Zero military maintenance. So they'll sit there endlessly cranking out ships while a human player can barely keep a couple dozen ships in service. The AI recognises it's huge military advantage and........GAME OVER.I could go on. I could talk about the weapon types, the useless ship defenses, the hit and miss map generation, the bugs and typos that still exist after so long...........And you know what rubs salt in the wounds? While this game sits here with more balance issues than a one-legged hippo Stardock are doing nothing but releasing overpriced, pointless DLC that nobody asked for. Do yourself a favor and buy literally anything else.			"

								I've had this game since the start and have loved it from day 1. I knew I would, it came with the ship builder and even back then was one of the best builders I have played with. Addicted to the builder I didn't play much of the game so did not want to review it as I hadn't fully experienced all it had to offer. This game has something for every one who has the urge to conquer Galaxy. You can be nice about it or not, it's up to you. You don't need the skills for the builder as there are plenty of ready made ships as is. There has been some bugs the Dev's jump on very quickly. This game is made for the gamer. Will be playing this game for a long time to come. Oh and it has the Snathi!			"

												I'll preface this by saying I have purchased all of the GC games and like them all. The one thing that has become more obvious is the tendency towards releasing a very early, base game and using DLC to spice it up and make it seem more interesting.  A ""Season Pass"" is the standard it seems now....This game, even after a year of being out and having been patched all the way up to v1.8, still has major bugs and memory leak issues. Any of the larger maps are not able to be played to completion due to memory issues and performance lag. The machine I have has 16gb of memory and still has issues. One bug (destroy a planet) has been in the support forums since early 2015 and still hasn't been addressed. The keyboard shortcuts and game documentation leave much to be desired. Not enough shortcuts and too much repetitive ""point/click"" items.			"

												Stardock is the worst company when it comes to customer service.   I bought and played in beta... Got bored cause of all the bugs and waited until now to try the finished product.  I wasted the entire night reading through troubleshooting logs from everywhere on why the game crashes.  There are posts everywhere.  The only thing stardock has is a catchall page that asks you to do a whole mess of things and they still didn't work.   This is just way tooo frustrating.  I can't believe how bad the troubleshoot is.  It's over a year since it released and apparently this company still can't get the game to start.  boo.  So sad.*****  UPDATE *******See my last comment after Chill.   Customer Service is definitely not the worst.  They have been responsive both on here and offline with me.

I know early access are usually♥♥♥♥♥♥ and usually I'm against them, but if you love space, and you love deeply customizeable strategy, this game is definately for you, I'm really impressed and glad my friend convinced me to buy this early access game.A lot of options are deeply customizeable, the only bad thing at the moment is the game seems to have a terrible memory leak. Even on my machine which the system requirements for the game should just about be good enough to run on high it tends to struggle after 2 hours. I think this is due to the nature of it being early access.			"

												Pros: 1. Great ship designer. Actually, I would say that this is the best ship designer around. It has an even better UI for building than Gal Civ 2.2. Somewhat unique tech trees for each race. However, I found Gal Civ 2's trees were far more unique than these trees.3. Fairly easy to grasp gameplay. And, the graphics are pretty good.Cons:1. AI cheats. Even on the low difficulties, the AI still rampantly cheats. They did this because the devs were incapable of actually programming more competent AI during their ""grand AI update."" Nope, instead they just gave the AI tons of bonuses that varied based on the difficulty level.2. Combat is still rock - paper - scissors. Chaff stops missiles, shields stop beams, and armor stops cannons. However, chaff does nothing against beams or cannons. The same with the other defense types as well. This was a gripe with Gal Civ 2 as well. However, the devs decided to give enhancement modules that gave certain bonuses to specific weapon or defense types. Which imbalanced the game even more and made this combat system even more focused on 1 weapon vs 1 defense type. Which, brings me to my next point...3. Weapon balance is terrible: The devs tried to differentiate between weapon types even more. However, the rule of thumb is that missiles have the most threat but are also the largest, beams are middle of the road with 100% accuracy but also with insane upkeep costs that can't be reduced via tech, and cannons are the smallest weapons and rival missiles in actual combat power compared to missiles when massed together, except they are the most costly to build. So, the best weapons, hands down, are still missiles. The game has no balance.4. Threat system is borked. The devs added threat modifiers to weapons and weapon enhancements. This is used to dictate how ""powerful"" your fleets are viewed by the other races. However, it's all completely borked as it's not balanced at all. The rule of thumb is, go missiles (despite not being actually more powerful) if you want to have the highest threat. However, it's really meaningless as the AI cheats so much that they spam tons of ships extremely easy.There's many more cons that I could go through, but I view these four issues as the major issues with this game.Edit:  Just tried patch 2.0 to see if it fixed any of the issues listed above.  The definitive answer is ""no"".  AI still spamming ships out much faster than the player even on the easiest difficulties, combat is still rock-paper-scissors, weapon balance is still completely terrible, and threat system is still borked as well.  To add to that, they included an administration system that punishes players that like to build lots of star bases.  This was to combat people who spam tons of economic starbases around their planets for overlaping bonuses.  However, instead of taking the logical way and just disallow overlaping bonuses, they decided to add administrators that punish everyone.This game is done.  There are faaaar better space 4x options out there that have faaaar less bugs and stupid features implemented.  Hell, even its predecessor, Gal Civ 2 is a far more superior game than this tripe.			"

Early Access Review
								So when I heard Paul was back making GalCiv3 I had to go check it out. Then I find out could preorder the Elite Founders Package and get all future content for $99. It took me all of about 3 seconds to log in and buy Gal Civ3. I have been playing a few games a week since. I will admit I played more GalCiv2 than GalCiv3 in Alpha, but I have not even played GalCiv2 in about 2 months.GalCiv3 is shaping up to be the best space 4X game that has ever been made. The game is about to be released and most all the major CTD or game stopping bugs have been fixed. Now I find myself playing a game as often as I can with several over the weekends.Here is what I love about the game: (I have about 350 hrs of game play atm)-Graphics- Brilliant!!!-Maps- Huge maps up to 5 times the size of GalCiv2, but I mainly play on Huge.-Anomalies- I love getting anomalies with my flagship. I really like atm you can buy the other races flagships to hunt even more anomalies. I am sure this will get fixed soon thou. Also I hope they add back the color system of the anomalies from GalCiv2. I hate clicking on a wormhole until all the good anomalies are gone from my area.-Pirates- It will be nice when Stardock upgrades them to be more like Sins. I would love to pay or give ships to the pirates to attack random AI players. Paul said there is more planned options but for a latter DLC.-Adjacency system-Basically you have to place like buildings near each other to boost the value. Also with this new system there are lots of building types and not all races have the same buildings.-Terraforming-There are lots of terraforming options. Now when you look at the planet management screen you see a map with land masses. Pretty much every hex you see that is on land you will eventually be able to terraform it. Oh how I miss the galactic wonder to auto update all tiles from GalCiv2.-Tech Trees- Each race has its own tech tree. Each tree has 4 areas (Colonization, Engineering, Warfare, and Governance) that are spaced out over 3 ages. A player has to think about what to upgrade now vs just getting to the best weapon/def combo and kill everything.-Starbases- I love building these. I swear I build a neutral zone with one of these every few inches on my boarders. The same bases are back and we get a new one, Mining. Now there are tradable resources to mine for new buildings, weapons, and ship support systems. I will admit I cannot wait until there is an auto build click option for upgrading Starbases. I swear I spent most my time sending constructors to Starbases. At least this time you can have more than one module on a constructor.-Shipyards-This go around not every planet can make a ship. At first I hated this. Now with having a shipyard being sponsored with up to 5 planets you can manage you ship building much more easily. Plus with a great planet set up you can build huge ships in just a few turns.-Battle viewer-Watching your ships in action is great the first few times in a game. Then after you have 20+ battles a turn you are happy Stardock left in the old auto resolve option. I hope they add a click option to always auto resolve. I will turn in on after I have 5+ fleets in action.-Shipbuilding-This time around the default ships are not that bad…Still mine are way better…-Fleets-This time around you cannot just spam build one type of ship. You need assault ships, escorts for your larger ships, guardian ships for your carriers. YES we have carriers this time and they are currently very OP. They start each battle with a number of drone ships loaded up with your best tech to kill all aliens in your path.-Custom races-This just got put in and I love it. I am making races left and right. The default ones are pretty easy to beat. I need more options: logos, pictures, backgrounds, etc… I keep hearing Paul talk about Jennifer, I think that is her name, and how she is god’s gift to coding most of all the goodies in the game along with the UI.-Ideological Traits-Basically your good, evil, neutral options. This time your actions take one of 3 paths which give points to buy traits in one of the three trees. You can stay in one tree or spread them out over all of them. Down side is the more you buy the more it costs. So maxing out all the trees is pretty impossible now. I only can pick about 20% of 1 tree now. The points are still under progress I am sure they will change upward soon.Things I know will get fixed and I am holding my breath waiting-AI-One of the things I loved about GalCiv2 was the AI. GalCiv2 has 12 levels of difficulty and I have only been able to win on level 9 and that is only about 25% of the time. I think one of my best memories of the AI in GalCiv2 was when I was building up my fleets near the neutral zone getting ready to invade when the AI contacts me. I get a message that he has seen me do this before and he attacks me before I am ready and the game was over. Currently I am unable to lose on GalCiv3 the AI just is unable to anticipate my game play or put up much of a challenge. This is not to say it will be that way for everyone. I do have a million or more game plays since 2003. Brad will fix this. He likes it when the AI beats up on players…..-Diplomacy-I love the current UI, the concept, and all the options. The only problem is the AI does not value things the way a player does..YET! Devs read the forums every day and update the AI based on player’s feedback. Although it is pretty fun to sell things I never need to the AI for items they need but think they are better suited in my hands….ha-ha-Control N-I think I miss this option more than any other option from GalCiv2. If you do not know that is how you can restart a game once you have loaded up a map if you do not like what you see. Also works anytime in the game.-Ship Builder-Better UI management and easy way to sort ships you want to use. In GalCiv2 it was easy to only have a few ships at a time in your window to choose from, here not so much.-Steam workshop support-I cannot wait to see what the players come up for mods to play with this game. I also hate building ships but love downloading great ship builder’s designs to use in my games….I hope this review helps…			"

												I played this game on release, and it honestly felt incomplete. Winning was tediously easy, and there just wasn't much to do compared to other games in the genre. Looking at the 50 pounds of DLC available now, I realise why it felt that way. They pretty much ripped whatever they could out of the game in order to sell it on later. Give this one a miss in my opinion, there are plenty of full games you can get for cheaper.			"

Early Access Review
								On a note this game is still in beta/early access at the time of this writing - Beta 4I see a lot of negativity on this game concerning ""boring"" or ""slow paced"" and ""hard to understand/play"" this game feels to me more like a throw back to the earlier 4x type games and to me is a refreshing reminder of the style of games that we once played. With this in mind I was able to load it up for the first time and jump straight into game play without much of a learning curve. It reminds me so much of what I liked about the games of yesterday.There are nicely renedered cutscenes which lends to the overall grand scale atmosphere of the game. Animations are smooth and the units are clear and easy to distinguish fom each other.There is a custom ship design screen where you can change the appearance of the ship. A vast tech tree to climb, and for those who like to micromanage planetary economics it offers enough control that you may do so.  Lastly of course this game is still in development and has much room for improvement, with that said for a beta it is relativly complete but not without its issues. As always Early Access means that there will be some issues with the game that are not yet resolved and maybe some features missing but overall it seems like it is on a very good path.System Specs:AMD 832016GB DDR3 1833MhzGeForce 660TiDual Intel 520 SSD (Raid 0)25"" LG ultrawide (2560x1080 UI scaling was a bit rough at this aspect ratio but looked fine at 1920x1080)Windows 7 64bit			"

Early Access Review
								I tried out Gal Civ 2 first when it was deeply discounted after seeing the demo of Gal Civ 3.   As many are saying there are a lot of features that seem unfinshed and many of the tech tree options are still unfinished preventing some aspects of the game from being fully reailzed. I would consider it Beta not Alpha because you can play the game to learn the basics and there are many techs to explore. The ai can also easliy beat you if you make mistakes in choices.  I would say the early price was a bit high but again I purchased it at a slight discount.   One of the things that really affects your game overall is something I noticed in the last couple of games.  The ships do not always move every turn while I am sure the ai ships do every turn. I have noticed that at times if you do not monitor and move some ships manually they will not move every turn on a pretedermined path set by you.As well unless I missed it there needs to be some sort of notification when a construction vessel arrives at a starbase.  I may have missed the quick way to check it but on a huge map tracking every ship and having to check every starbase for potential upgrades gets annoying.   The ship movement issue is not a Gal Civ issue alone. There are other games that I own that have similar issues but use different game engines.  Hopefully it will be resolved.Overall I would say it is a worthwhile game that looks just like Gal Civ 2 with added features that in time if the MP works well will make this a game worth having. "

												Overpriced for a mediocre game. You can find better, cheaper 4X strategy games elsewhere (I recommend: Sword of the Stars (first one), Endless Space (decent, not great), Age of Wonders (fantasy, extremely good games), Pandora: First Contact  & more.It isn't that well crafted; it is rough around edges, has small, annoying features (relating to stuff like how ship moves are calculated and more). Even Stardock's own 'Fallen Enchantress' is a better game.			"

Early Access Review
								I have never played any of the previous editions of this game; however, I have been playing this game which is still in beta since August 2014.I have been extremely impressed with how well the developers have improved the game play and added new features and options. They provide weekly Dev Streams where the lead designer demonstrates the capabilities of the game, explains their development intentions, and answers questions from the audience. Copies of the Dev Streams are available for viewing on YouTube.So far, I have submitted over 24 bug reports and Stardock support has been very quick to respond to each of them. Most of the issues I raised have already been resolved via game updates or hotfixes.The game is 64-bit and therefore will demand more than 2 GB of RAM to operate. How much memory is used depends primarily on how big the map is. On my PC, a small map starts using about 1.7 GB, a huge map starts with about 3.1 GB, while the insane map starts running at about 4.1 GB. Please note that this is about 50% less than what the game was using three months ago with smaller maps and the developers have not finished optimizing it.I find the game exciting to play, especially in the beginning phase. However, it becomes tedious when my empire approaches 100 planets with only a third of the map explored. Towards the middle of the game it is downright boring due to the number of repetitive tasks (e.g., starbase improvements) and a passive AI. The developers are working to address these issues but they still have a long way to go.The game has multi-player capability but this option is broken in my opinion. I suspect this may be due to how the background calculations are transmitted between players since most of the game freezes and crashes occur during the handoff to another player. I look forward to Stardock resolving this issue.If you want to participate in developing what may be the premiere space 4X game of the decade then I recommend you join in the fun, and frustrations. If you dislike things breaking for no apparent reason or desire a fully implemented game then I suggest you place this game on your wishlist.			"

												Starbases.  Those gorram starbases!  And that an opponent can plop one right above your planet early on and you have to declare war to remove it.  What is the point of having a border!?  I really wanted to enjoy it, the planet interface is nice and interesting, but there is just too many things going on that is distracts from the fact that rapid early expansion is really the only way to play.  Expand quickly and take every planet you can and then pump out starbases as fast as you can and then build up your planets.  That's boring and depends mostly on the luck of the map.  There are no limiters or expectation of steady outward growth.  Just not for me and I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.			"

I can set game parameters, any number of ways, but no matter what I try, as soon as I try to actually play, the game immediately crashes.I've tried every crash fix listed and absolutely nothing works.What canI do?Before this I could at least play for a couple of hours before it would crash.

												I give it a B+.  It's fun to explore, find habitable planets, all the things that make for a good 4x game.  The custom ships are fun.Gameplay-wise, I feel that there is too much pressure to build ships - the ""ripe for conquest"" mechanic is, in my opinion, flawed.  The AIs build huge fleets that would completely wreck the player's economy to attempt.  Some events, like the one that drops artifacts everywhere, are a bit too easy to exploit. I also feel the interface is clumsy - there's no keyboard shortcuts to move through your planets and starbases, for example, and often the targets for your mouse clicks are a bit too small (e.g. build queues).

												I am a long time fan of of the game series. Let me tell you what I think of this latest version.Early access is supposed to hammer out all the bugs. It has not done so. This releasedate 14.5.2015 version is full of bugs.Game experience is not really different from the earlier versions. Graphics have been updated, but otherwise the game experience is pretty much the same as in earlier Galactic Civilizations games.New GUI has some logic problems. Sometimes one needs annoying mouse travel from one command icon to another - and  in the case of certain menus - some items are so close that they get mixed up constantly. Some practical features that prevent annoying micro management in larger scenarios are missing.I tried to find the NEW in this, but I could not.Knowing what I know now, I would not pay the full price for this make over. Try before buy. "

												I bought this game as a fan of turn based strategy games looking for something different.  I've played through a few games and overall I think I got bored of it pretty quickly.I think this is one of those games where if you want to put 100 hours into a round and customize your ships to the nth degree, it could be fun.  But for those without all day long to spend micro designing your fleets, it's quite a grind.Here's my major gripes:1) The culture aspect is super unbalanced.  You can win the whole game by just playing super defensive and focus heavily on spreading your culture.  You can turn planets to your own side by doing nothing.  2) Some aspects of the game just aren't useful for anything.  I.E., military starbases.  They're purely defensive, and they don't even get involved in a battle unless the enemy specifically attacks them.  It would make way more sense if they provided defensive coverage in a ""zone"".3) They spent time creating some visuals for space battles.  You see them in the screenshots for the game.  They add absolutely nothing to the overall content of the game.  Yeah its kind of fun to watch it like twice, but then you just end up turning all of it off because it takes a long time for the game to have a ""space battle"" that had an outcome calculated before the battle started.  Should have spent that dev time adding other cool things.4) Diplomacy AI is weak.  To be fair, almost no game gets this right.			"

								Early Access ReviewThese are issues are found within the first two hours of playing:1) Choose Civilization Screen: Race Trait Popups do not re-size properly.  Some text is not readable.  (practically all information pop-ups seem to have this re-sizing bug)2) Options - Volume or Sound Settings, does not seem to work at all for some affects and movie scenes.  I was eventually forced to turn down my speaker volume.3) First Ideological Trait: I think I accidentally double clicked, but once you stutter click it, then there is no undo.  You are stuck with it.4) This is a Beta Test, the previous 3 complaints don't count as negatives, yet.  (There are lots of uncompleted content in this game in addition to the bugs I noticed.  Be warned.  See my video below.)These may not be bugs, but they seem that way compared to the previous titles.I paid $25 for this game during a weekend sale Feb 28 - Mar 2.  This game, so far, seems like it's on track to be worthy of my $25....  Since, it's not guaranteed to be finished, I'll give it a 6/10 for now.Instead of writing a full review of the many positives, I recorded a video playthrough, you can see it for yourself:

Posted: September 4, 2016
												How to quickly win in GalCiv3: (1) get Prominence III on the Benevolent ideological trait tree (a.k.a. ""Enticing,"" which allows for all planets and starbases within your Influence to switch to your ownership) as you (2) save up a lot of cash.  Then, (3) buy a planet (and any Starbases) from the AI player and then (4) do this for all AI opponents.Nice job, Stardock.Besides that, the rest of the game also feels ""mailed-in"" - it feels like the game's developer (Stardock) was resting on its laurels from the previous two smash hits.Here are some reasons below as to why I do not recommend that you buy Galactic Civilizations III:1)  For starters, the DLC isn't worth a nickel.  If you never bought those, you wouldn't miss much except for a few planet types that are hardly interesting.  Really, almost all of their ""expansions"" and DLC need to be included in the base game.  Of particular note is that you cannot use any of the newer DLC in the Map Editor, which is itself a feature you must pay for.  The expansions and DLC are major rip-offs, and the ""Mercenaries"" expansion pack is one of the worst I have ever seen in all video games I have ever played.2)  The ""wiki"" is a laughable joke.  You will not benefit from it because (i) it does not contain any specific details on most things you can't figure out on your own and (ii) you can figure out the basic stuff on your own.  So why is it there?  It's just a picture book; you will get no strategy or useful information, such as what an Aquatic planet's stats are once you've researched Colonization Focus - but the wiki will indeed tell you that the tint of this planet type is blue.  Good luck.3)  Some of the worst mods on the Steam Workshop exist for this game.  You will be amazed that you cannot find one decent modified race/civilization or map on the Workshop.  The best you are going to find are pictures of women in bathing suits as civilization leaders.  I guess the dweebs have taken over.4) The combat in GalCiv3 is almost a pathetic joke.  You wouldn't believe that a professional game designer would let that out into the market on purpose.  The opening salvo of attacks is pretty cool, but once the two sides ""clash,"" the starships sort of do these slow loopedy loops and curls as they pass by each other, firing their weapons in nonsensical directions, and floating around stupidly.  Absolutely pathetic.5)  Managing your Fleets in GalCiv3 is cumbersome and sometimes pretty lame.  The biggest nag is that if you add a unit to your Fleet, the Fleet gets renamed.  Besides that, looking at the Details page for your Fleet is hardly helpful - names are not alphabetized, and you cannot decipher clear information about individual Fleet units.  Sort of the opposite of a Details Screen, eh?6)  When trying to Upgrade your ships, you won't have a side-by-side comparison to see what you are getting yourself into; you will only see the attack and defense stats of your current build, while you can hover over the upgrade-to unit and get the information you want.  The best you get to work with is the nomenclature.  (Eg.: Marauder M5 going to Marauder M7.)  You will likely be cancelling-out of the Upgrade pop-up so you can hover over your unit so that you can compare adequately (from memory).  Cumbersome.7)  Oh, you wanted an easy way to manually determine your research, revenue, and manufacturing spending on an easy-to-use slider, eh?  You don't get that in GalCiv3, even though it is a major component of playing a 4X-genre game.  You get this odd triangle pictograph around which you have to aggravatingly drag a cursor.  It is very hard trying to get the percentages how you want them; you can't just type in what you want.  Ridiculous.8)  If you want to sort your Planets List by Class, you can't.  If you want to sort the list by Manufacturing output - a number you can't see on this list - then you can.  Huh?9)  Do you like spam?  Me, neither.  Here are some ""intriguing"" messages you will receive constantly throughout your GalCiv3 games: ""Our mutual trade continues to strengthen our relationship"" (from the same civilization, ad nauseum); ""Be wary as you explore the stars.  What is new to you is ancient to others"" (from the same civilization, ad nauseum); and other useless gems where you can always provide only one type of clickable response: ""We will take your words into consideration.""  That's it.  Useless information just to tick you off; no other reason for Stardock to program that poop into GalCiv3 whatsoever.10)  The United Planets screen, like all the myriad spelling errors in this game, is just one more show of ""We don't care about our game like we should"" from Stardock, the game's developer.  Leader portraits overlap, blocking each other in a scrunched-up, offset fashion; the message pane at the bottom covers multiple leader portraits (so you can't see their portraits or their votes); your own leader's portrait is not even presented on this screen; you will never know how many votes you have or how many votes were cast for the various U.P. propositions.  GalCiv2 provided all of this information.  Why does GalCiv3 suck so hard?11) Try scrolling down most lists in GalCiv3.  You will notice hover-over pop-ups blocking your view of the list underneath.  Annoying as heck and defeats the whole purpose.  Also, Stardock's lovely ""free update"" recently included having another list on your main screen letting you know what events are active.  Just one more absolutely stupid decision by these people.  Completely shameful.12)  Remember terraforming planets in GalCiv2?  Man, you could almost do whatever you wanted in that game.  In GalCiv3, the highest you can start with is a 26-class planet, taking it between Class 32 and 34 for most planets, and maybe Class 37 for only one planet (with a certain civilization feature).  Also, the buildable terrain on these planets is rarely connected: you will mostly have two unconnected sides of a planet to build on instead of a wad of tiles in one bunch so that you can build planets how you want to.  This is another key ingredient of a 4X-genre game (building your planet how you want to) that GalCiv3 was made to thwart.  If this was just some form of balancing for the game or a challenge or  whatever, then it would be fine if and only if the rest of the game were better.  But it is just one more stupid thing about GalCiv3 that makes it so much worse than GalCiv2.  On top of all that, throughout the game you are given six ""buildings"" to change/terraform unusable hexes on a planet into usable ones.  I have had several planets on a map where I simply could not use 5/6 of these terraforming ""buildings"" because the strips of usable land on these planets were not connected or not large enough to allow me to add usable hexes!  So my terraforming ""buildings"" just sit there in the planet's building list with nothing to do.  How stupid is that?  I have 5 terraforming buildings that I cannot use?  STUPID!13)  Do you like being in a state of war and not knowing that?  It might be exhilirating, but it is certainly not 4X genre.  Welcome to GalCiv3.14)  I counted sixty three (yes, 63) modules for what is known as a ""Military Starbase.""  63!  After all that time and effort, these ""Military Starbases"" are easily destroyed by low-level enemy ships.  Asinine.15)  So you destroyed a civilization.  Neat!  Now their tens of Constructor ships turn into unarmed, non-Fleet Pirates that roam about space, slowing down your computer for you to find and destroy individually.  Stardock don't care.16)  You don't know how to mod this game.  The few that do either (i) don't or (ii) make stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥17)  Memory leaks galore.			"

								Great game, still early access and thus missing features. But since the battle viewer update it plays and feels like a worthy successor to the Franchise (and even reminds me a bit of good old Master of Orion times... only a little tweak here and there ... whoosh you've spend 2 hours in the Ship editor :) )			"

												I really love this game but is it at all possible for you guys to fix the crashing? i mean sometimes i wait 5 minutes before realizing the game will never catch up i understand the game is massive and even more so depending on the size of the map but when a small sized game can last 24+ hours i expect to be able to sit and play for at least 2 hours before the game completely ♥♥♥♥♥ itself and crashes. Also it would be really nice if you guys were a lot more honest about the ram demand because if you have yet to purchase this game and you run with even 16 gb of ram the game cant wait to crash. This game is definately worth the purchase what little i can actually play before it crashes. The crashes have become even worse now with even more♥♥♥♥♥♥to populate the screen. Can we focus on one thing at a time i do not think we really needed mining facilities on the dead rocks but who the hell cares lets continue to add more and more♥♥♥♥♥♥so the game will never work unless your sporting 64gb of ram. I cannot at this time recommend purchasing this game for in its current state it is infact unplayable.			"

												It's basically galciv2 again. It looks a bit better, and they've stuck Civ's policy tree and strategic resources onto it, but it still has the same problems as GC 2: You need to constantly spam out constructors to build and upgrade starbases but there is no good automation of the process, there's no practical information about where to setup trade routes, and you need to manually build everything on planets due to tile and adjacency bonuses. On top of that, the AI is a lot worse (get used the MUCH weaker races trying to extort money from you and being mad when you refuse) and the combat camera is super wonky. The game is also fairly unpolished, there's various missing texts and the UI calls the same systems by different names in different places which leads to confusion.With all the same old problems and worse AI anyone who has played previous galcivs will soon be bored of this one - save you money, wait for a big sale if you really want to try this. If you like 4x games consider checking out Distant Worlds, Star drive 2, or Star ruler 2.They also sold this to early buyers at 40% off with the promise it was the lowest pre-release price but then sold it multiple times for 50% off during Early Access, which was quite the con.

												This is kind of a cautious recommendation. The base game is good, but as it stands it kind of has the same problem that Civ 5 did at launch, where there just isn't enough content or polish to really keep it going. There are still quite a few typos in the game, the amount of random colonization events is very low (I saw repeats in my first game ever!), and the AI is just not quite there. As it stands, this isn't as complete a game as GalCiv 2 Ultimate is. I feel like after a few expansions, this game will be one of the best 4X strategy games out there, but until then I would only get this if your a fan of the GalCiv series or just really want to play it. Its a good game, but it could definitely be better.			"

												Not a very good game. Not as good as any of the Civ's. Not even as good as Master of Orion 2. I have the impression that the software team was really tallented (the game runs well, no bugs, beautiful graphics etc), but the gameplay is just plain bad. Here is my list:1. The tactical combat screen is pretty, but you have zero control....I have no words....Unbeleavable. I can't imagine why they would do this.2. The AI is brutally bad. I played about 20 turns on beginner to get the hang of it. Then played a game on normal and won easily. Then played a game on expert and won easily. The AI makes a ton of obsolete ships and is rarely aggressive in any way. Also way too easy to see how an enemy is designing his ships (heavy on lasers, missles, or guns), and design against him. AI is oblivious to rock/paper/sissors system.3. The diplomatic engine is bad. By 10% of the way through the game every civ hates me. But they still trade with me, often at pretty even terms. Even after I've pummeled them badly and offer peace they refuse. Your only options are: declare war and trade. You can't do anything else with the other civ's.4. You can build pretty fancy starbases, but they are fairly weak, and get weaker as the game goes on. The AI NEVER attacks them. If the AI, or you, attack a planet with a starbase, the starbase is not part of it. This for me was another unbelievable WTF. The starbase doesn't defend the adjacent planet?5. Obviously quite a bit of effort into the custom ship building, but you'd have to be nutty to be bothered doing it. So tedious. When you deck a ship out with 10 guns, they seem to all be able to fire at once, even if they're on the back of the ship. 6. Planet building is not great. Seems like every planet is always full and you can't do anything else. Gotta wait till you can open up a new hex. 7. The entire money system is trivial. You don't have to build any markets etc and it's easy to have enough money. I 90% ignored the monetary part of the game and it didn't matter8. ok, the tech tree is pretty nice and well implemented9. There are a bunch of galactic resources that the AI seems huge on collecting, but they have a trivial outcome on the game. They can be completely ignored10. There is this insane mad scramble at the start of the game to colinize every available planet. No regard to how to defend these far off empires. 11. it is crazy easy to capture an enemy planet. You create a ship, put 3 million (or is it billion?) civilians in it, and it will defeat almost any enemy planet, even if there are 15 million people on it. The defensive improvements you can make give a trivial improvement to defence and you don't actually create solders or tanks. Lame.12. I liked the way you could have multiple planets support a ship building dock13. No spying. All you have to do is talk to other civs and you can see what techs they have and how they are decking out their ships. Wow, that's more lame stuff than I would have guessed. Well, it's maybe not all that bad. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't a good game. I really think this was a result of the bad management dictating bad decisions. Oh well.			"

Early Access Review
								For a game still in beta, Galactic Civilizations III is already a solid 4X game. But it still has bugs, and the campaign is also not available yet, so if you want to play a complete game, wait until the release. But if you are dying for a science fiction strategy game and can live with the bugs, then go get it. And it will continue getting better, even after the release.You can design your own ships, and not only regarding its weapons and components: you can completely change their look, add blocks and parts to create your own aesthetics and etc. You can make your own unique custom civilizations, give them special traits, characteristics and ships. The visuals are awesome. The game will be fully modable, that is, modders will be able to create incredible things. The battles look epic, but beware that you can't play them, as they are meant to be looked at and see the efficiency of your ships against the enemies rather than to be played. The AI will be getting better and better as the release approaches. There are several events with choices for the player to make, but so far, there are no ""massive"" events that change gameplay or add new factions, which I would like a lot to be added. Also, the devs are awesome and listen to their fans.The game series has a very interesting story, which you can take a look at here (http://www.galciv3.com/databanks/timeline) and here (http://www.galciv3.com/databanks/our-story). But even if you aren't interested in the story, you can always play a normal game outside of the yet to come campaign and create your own backstory.One of the things I feel that is lacking in the game though is a deeper soul. It need politics, bigger events (like I mentioned above) and more things to illustrate the universe and your civilization. But the devs do have plans to include LOTS of interesting things in the expansions to come... so I have hope for these features.*After game launch edit*Well, apart from the obvious improvements and polishing, the only relevant thing I've got to talk about is the campaign. I just finished it today and have to say that it is short. But I didn't do all of the optional objectives - I rushed in several parts, and didn't play the campaign with the same depth and care I would have done in a normal game. That's because I was more interested in finishing it than enjoying it. So the campaign can be a lot longer and more interesting if you play it correctly.My opinion about the game is still good. Honestly, I don't think that the campaign is meant to be the main game mode. It is comparable to the scenarios from Civ V. They are only a secondary game experience. The core of the game is, instead, to play the classical mode - just choose your opponents and map type and win one of the victory conditions. The same applies for GalCiv III.I really can't understand the massive negative reviews the game is getting. I haven't got bugs so far - although I might be lucky regarding bugs - and if you followed the dev streams like I did, you can rather easily understand the little flaws of the game, which the devs said they would be fixing until after the game launch. In fact, they clearly said that they will continue to add new features to the game even after launch through free patches. And if you think the game still need some deeper and more immersive mechanics (which I agree with), such as a more in depth diplomacy, United Planets system and population characteristics, then don't worry, because Stardock has said that they plan to add all of these things in future expansions and DLC, so that they can develop these features with more refinement and polish.

												I have played  57 hours before writing the review, so i dont  judge to early like i did abit with Star Drive 2. All in all i like the game very much. I was a GalCiv2 big fan, and i also was a bit sceptic after seeing early images, that its to much like GalCiv2.As i played GalCiv 3  longer, i noticed the new features and started using them, resulting in different gameplay. I will write in 2 sections about my experience in points, first section overall, second comparison to Galciv2.OVerall :1 + Decent/good AI. I wasnt able to beat the game at highest setting, despite a few tries. Sure its mostly due to its bonuses I suppose but im still happy i wasnt. On  tough and challenging diff it still  bite back and overall did reasonable stuff. I wish there  was another setting between  tough and sucicdal.Also it would be nice if the AI was playing abit smarter , not mostly being hard due to bonuses.2 +The game is slow, as with all GalCiv, so you have to give it some time, learn its mechanics to have most fun.3 +The art and music is very nice.4+ Overall everything one could expect from a good  4x game: Many races, custom races, long tech tree, many events,ship design, shaping your own ideology, good writing and humour...As with all Galciv games, there is no tactical battle tough. (for some its  a plus for soem a minus)5 + Stable. I had one crash in the 65 hours.6 - Imho the early game  pace is off. The expansion race is just silly. There is no mechanic to slow you down. its colonize colonize and colonize some more with maybe a few mining starbases. In galciv2 the economy stoppped you from overextending, it doesnt seem to happen in Galciv 3.I would give the game a 8/10 i think atm. There is still some balancing and AI refining to be done imho.GalCiv 3 new features, compared to Galciv2:1- There are now strategic recources that you can use to build very powerful weapons and improvements early on. So you got this tottaly new layer, if you want to race to grab them on , and rely on them. On other hands they are scattered and its hard to defend the bases that are mining them. It changed my Galciv2 playstyle in a  big way.2-The affinty/morality is  abit different. You got a tiered tree with upgrades that you unlock. Its imho a nice change, i have i  think more fun with this then in Galciv2 approach.3-There are now adjecancy bonuses on planets, so you got to think a bit more about designing it.Overall i hadnt the impression to be playing a reskinned GalCiv 2, imho its a proper sequel.4- Very nice addtion of planet independent shipyards , to which you can assign up to 5 planets. Reduces micromanagement a lot.			"

												I've played every single iteration of Galactic Civilizations ... from the earliest days when this was one of the few games out for OS/2. I have enjoyed all of them. Until now. Yes, sadly.Galciv 3 is as different from Galciv 2 as Civilization 3 is different from Civilization 5 as far as shift in game mechanics on the surface is concerned. There is only one problem with GalCiv3: it is as boring as Dante's Hell. I have not finished a single game. I have started a couple dozen times, and every time, 3, 4, 5 hours into a game I get so bored that I simply loose interest. The map, zoomed out, seems busy, but really, there's little to do except monotonously scout scout scout and pop anomalities. The research has been revamped, but, in my opinion not for the better: it is obscure why the old tree has been changed like this, in a way that it makes less sense, and practically every thing has been recycled, only it's been put in a different place (and you now have to choose between options that were previously all obtainable, but ok, so what, life goes on). It doesn't add challenge, it just makes it less interesting compared to GalCiv II when you have logged several hundred hours on the latter. Even if you expand the research tree so you can see a little better where you're coming from and where you might be going to, it's counter intuitive and just 'bleh' compared to previous iterations.Very hard to give your research direction now. The new planetary maps .... um. Ok, the hex based system and the mutual benefits you can get from matching building types are different, and seem an enhancement. On the other hand, the ''trade goods' that you could previously research and then build are now relegated to being random pop ups on newly colonized worlds, without their influence on the whole empire being unclear. This way they've become more of an irritant than 'something to rush for' that they previously were. Graphically - well, they have spent a lot of effort on this. Assuming you zoom in on things, you are in for a lot of chrome and glitz. Really, it is beautiful. But since I always play as far zoomed out as I can, I don't see any of that. Hey, it's a strategy game, and so I like to work on strategies, and that works best with the 'large picture'. If you want a really good space based 4X, get GalCiv 2 - Twilight of the Arnor. Without a doubt, in my personal opinion, a far superior game. Galciv III is a lame, somewhat aimless re-brewing of old tea leaves that makes me visualize a confused little old lady wandering around at night in the snow under the street lights, not being able to remember where she lives or what her name is. Very disappointing to me. I'll rather load up a game of the very dated Alpha Centauri Alien Crossfire, or Galciv 2, or Civilization 3 to Beyond Earth. Each one has no problems holding my interest with that 'just one more turn' factor that keeps me up into the wee hours. Galciv III just doesn't have that. As I said: a few hours into a new game I just want to turn it off and go watch paint dry.			"

												I've been playing this game for over two weeks now, I finished the campaign, and I'm about halfway through a sandbox match. So far, this is the best space strategy game I've ever played. The ship designer is amazing, the adjacency system is easy to learn and extremely useful for specializing planets, and the ship combat is very well detailed. It was a little jarring to no longer see an invasion battle screen anymore, and the gameplay mechanics were a little hard to get the hang of at first, but in my experience the transition wasn't any harder than it was to transition from Dread Lords to Twilight of the Arnor and Dark Avatar. The only bug I've ever had with this game is the ship designer crashing occasionally, but it seems to have stopped with the recent patches. There's still plenty of features pending for this game in the future, but I'd rather play them as they're added than have to learn them all at once at the end of this game's support.			"

Early Access Review
								This game was almost just an empty hull when it appeared on Early Acces. The progress was slow at the beginning but the game was, and is running stable. There are still bugs but those aren't frequent. It simply feels like a very solid basis and gets better and better with every update. Now the devs are punching out updates quite often and those mostly add many new features and mechanicks to the game. So you don't need to be afraid that the game gets abandoned. Most of the features are already in the game now so you can enjoy playing already. I still think that the AI is plain stupid but that is a subject to change. The game looks beautiful. Lots of nice artwork for colonies and events.Gameplay is like Gal Civ 2 (what is good) but it also has some new features that make sence, so the game looks even better - it is not just a cheap remake.The ship designer for example looks very nice and is better then in Gal Civ 2 already.The battles don't look that good jet but I'm sure that this is not the final version of it anyway. (early acces it is)What makes me feel confident about this game, is that it seems to be built on a solid basis and that the devs know what they are doing so there is not much that could go wrong.I'm really looking forward into this game when it gets finished because I'm having fun playing already.If you like round based 4X games, then grab it, you (most likely) won't regret it.

Early Access Review
								This game is the best 4X space strategy game of the year, no doubt. In short this is civ in space. But better...For every civilization or 4x fan. This you need to buy! Positives There are 8 major (playable) races with different tech trees and ship styles. There are minor races wich are the same like major races but you can not play as them and they are limited to one planet. Custom races!! You can make your own races and when steam workshop integration is released in june you can share or download other peoples races. You can even set how the ai will play as your race.  The gameplay is fun, you research different things every game. You need to make choices.  There are no manual battles (wich I find good). You can quick battle or can view the battle wich is great to see your fleets weakness or strengths. Ships have roles and making good fleets based on those roles can make a difference.  Ideologies (good, neutral or evil). With events you make choices and then use those points to spend on nice bonuses. Like ideas in eu4 or policies in civ.  AI is the best ever seen in a turnbased 4x strategy game.   Ship designer!! You can create your own ships! Or use the default ships if you dont want to bother with it. Its like you can but dont have to.  Mapsizes are insane. The biggest map is so big you have never seen before, it has half a million tiles and is there so you can play with up to 128 civs on one map. But you can still play with 8 factions on a huge map and will have lots of fun. (recommended)  The engine is great, performance is good, turns are fast. DX11 and 64bit and maybe dx12 in future?  Developer interaction is great. They are active on the forums, weekly twitch streams etc. They also already told us there will be 1 expansion every year for the next 3 years and will keep updating the game up to 7 years from now.  Mods!! This game will become great with mods. Its a higly modable game.  Multiplayer!! You can play up to 4 people in multiplayer. There is no simultaneous turns but thats not an issue. You can manage your planets, set move commands, design ships, everything on another ones turn. You only need your turn to execute move ships and for battles. Great game to play coop against the AI.Negatives  One more turn syndrome  Planet specialization micromanagement hell on bigger maps. (Hopefully they improve it so insane maps with 100 civs is playable) "

												As someone who is new to the series I was initially impressed with the game and I still am to some extent however there are rather griping issues that are bugging the hell out of me currently.Ill try to list them: 1) the tutorial is not useful. Instead of it being about teaching new players or existing players about new or old mechanics and how they work and how your colonies work with production, manufacturing etc. it is instead used as a story spring board ready for the campaign.. which I really do feel like it should be for teaching as you know it is supposed to be a tutorial, Of course it has information on how things work but doesnt accurately explain it, in other words its extremely vague.2) Lack of audio communication from Characters. When talking to another race for example, or something your research scientist is telling you about your recent upgrades. I really do feel like if they added some decent voice overs it would bring a ton of depth to the game. I realise many of the old school GC players would not like this that much is clear from what ive read on forum posts concerning this however its a different time now and you need to expect that immersion is important and right now Voice Acting even a little goes a long way, nobody wants to sit their and read paragraphs upon paragraphs while playing. Adding voice acting + a on/off option would solve this anyway. I believe the campaign would benefit heavily from some voice acting immersion. instead of ""oh look we're retaking earth lets click our way to victory yay"". I have a fine imagination I can imagine voices for the characters but it really doesnt do them justice. in a game this big and this well known they deserve a bit more ""soul"" i guess would be the correct word.3) Clarity concerning modifications to your ships and fleet ""military research"". While most of the research details you go through are fairly solid and easy to understand, things like ship hulls and shield strength and how much it actually adds on to your ships current shield or hull strength isnt carried over and communicated properly making things seem tedious and confusing as if your research something for no reason because you dont understand where it goes or what it does fully. Examples would help this or fix it. I appreciate the lack of hand holding in the game, but again for games to be popular in the current industry they need to accomidate new players not just the old ones. Which is why many feel that the game has not innovated on what had come previously.4) Governance is ...outdated. Frankly with competition like Civ and others in the mix Governance is an expceptionally dull part of an otherwise enjoyable game. I personally think if they wish to rival Sid's civ games then they really should of though about going a step further than they have or maybe a few steps. Instead of giving a player a set ammount of tiles you should of been able to zoom in and actually build upon the planet you found place your city yourself and the various things you need to get production and influence going etc and by that I mean actually control workers to do thats etc and have way more than simply under 10 or 20 tiles per planet or even under 5. I realise that many will use the arguement of ""but its not trying to compete with it"" or whatever however companies no longer have a choice these days unless they want to make money and frankly the changes ive suggested are hardly anything that would harm your experience if anything it would improve it. What had so much potential seems squandered.5) Space battles. When launching real time battles between fleets its abundantly obvious that the battle viewer is extremely underdone, ships consistantly fly out of view..the free cam movement is extremely redundant as moving seems almost a chore rather than something you can enjoy as you watch your fleet tear the enemy apart, its clear that this needs to be dealt with and frankly if it isnt, it will be something that ruins the game.Conclusion:A game with enormous potential but fell short of it due to being stuck in the past, the graphics are updated and its new enough not to be called a ""reskin"" based on what ive watched from other videos of GC II HOWEVER this game is stuck in its own past. Instead of innovating they simply stayed still all be it with a few side steps on a couple of things which I personally think is what destroyed my opinion of this game. Now its still possible a lot of the things ive mentioned will be changed or fixed so I will give this game a little more time but this game is far from what stardock hope to achieve which apparently is ""The largest, most advanced, strategy game possible.Verdict? Not recommended, especially at £30. As I have said while I largely enjoyed this game It frankly just did not hit the marks it needs too in this current day and age, Im glad a game is trying to stick to its roots but if a series is to improve itself it must go forward and not be stuck in the past, I will continue to play this game and try a bit harder to enjoy it though frankly if it was a decent game for the era I would already enjoy it thus I wouldnt have to try. What is starteling is im finding im enjoying Beyond Earth more than this and thats for one reason: Depth. Now I know what your thinking ""Beyond Earth, Depth? Don't make me laugh"" but frankly its true if theres one good thing you can say about that alpha centauri mess up is that at least they tried to make the game at least seem like its got a bit of soul. While GC III does a great job of making the galaxy look beautiful (to an extent) and letting you decide what you want your civilization to be it losing out massively on the things ive listed perhaps bar number one as a tutorial shouldnt be the focus of a whole game. Until they add voices and more depth and explainations as to how things work in game by providing an in-game source and fixing the various new features to actually work properly I cannot actually immerse myself in this game not can I call it a good game beyond a simple ""meh its okay"". if you prefer the silent type and unnessasarily complex mechanics in games then this game is for you if you prefer much more immersion and a bit more ease so you can just have fun without having too feel like your reading a book rather than playing a game I would advise you not buy this until that changes. it is stuck in the past and frankly its sad, it has so much potential but falls quiet short of a great game in my opinion.Clearly Stardock have put a great deal of effort into the game but they got too focused on ""sticking to the roots"", you can stick to your roots and still evolve your game, however it seems they had no idea how to beyond improving a few small things and improving the graphics thats about it.

												This game is what I like to call the Great, the Good, and the Ugly.Great:- Instead of having the bog standard 'system builds ship x', there's a new 'unit' that plays out on the map as a standalone Shipyard. This, alone, makes my games so much more easy as I crank out ship after ship and continue growing my empire. I also have less time to wait for more starbases, and can expand at a very high rate of speed.- While I don't play on ultra-high difficulty settings, I can still see the AI is more intelligent. They aren't handed out tools to be made better until much higher settings, they simply find the most fortuitous way to do it involving each playstyle.- Ship designer's return from GalCiv2 is great...but it's in both this category, and Ugly.- Ideology plays a much bigger part in civilization bonuses and activities.- While complex, the fleet battle setup becomes intuitive when you take a moment and set up your ships right. Makes it feel nice when your ships outpace enemy firing, and move as either a cohesive unit or have the 'Guardian'-style ship up front to absorb fire.- Building a planet means finding a balance between what you want (Hey, I might need those five factories on this chunk of barely-inhabitable rock!) or doing what may be the best compromise. Hey, I could put 10 factories on my homeworld and pump out a colony ship every three turns...or I could also add in that tourist destination on the hex that improves that income, a few labs in this large cluster and...whoa! My homeworld tops the chart in research? Sweet!The Good:- Diplomacy has more factors than it used to. While largely unchanged in certain ways, it's still got just enough to keep me interested. That, and factions don't just change their opinion of you over in just a turn or two-it takes time if it's not a big deal. Biggest complaint with Civ 5 was that I'd work with a  civilization for nearly 1500 years...and all of a sudden get to the Diplomacy screen and see that I'm nearly at war with them. What the...- Trade routes seem to be permanent-at least, unless war, cancellation of the route, or the planet being taken happens.- The maps are HUGE. You don't even necessarily run into another civ for well over 100-200 turns if you don't try to. Makes intergalactic war...interesting.- The Tech Tree overhaul from the previous game, with a few added splashes (being able to specialize is...both a downer and an upper. You get bonuses, but you can't get them all. Techs are, rather appropriately, hidden behind certain gaps. No jumping from 'Barely able to invade planet' to 'Planet-busting bombs used in invasions' during the first few turns).- There's quite a few options and attributes that can be selected for a unique faction, though I wish there were a few more points divvied up.Ugly:- DLC. The DLC. DLC. There's 10 DLC packs. While they don't necessarily come up during the game (besides the leader selection menu), it's annoying that some of the things I enjoyed in the previous game are hidden behind cash gates I don't want to open. It's frustrating. I want to be able to get Mega Events. I want some more interesting scenarios. There's quite a few things I would like, but am completely unable to reach.- Ship Designer. Last game, GalCiv2, had a huge designer that incidentally had every part available for every faction. It made building ships so much easier-but instead each faction has a rather truncated amount that has maybe 50% crossover of parts. Yes, I get that I want to put that Altarian part on my Iconian-based design. No, I would not want to swap. Grah.- Paint schemes for ships. I like the idea of making a ship with specific color sets, and can't. No customization beyond prepackaged color schemes in a dropdown menu. Yay.- AI improvements? Yeah. Ship improvements in terms of auto-designing? No. Haven't seen it. In the previous game, if memory serves, you could set it up to split defenses equally when upgrading ships. Here, instead, whatever you researched last is the defense that is on the ship. Yay.- While it was a little hassle, I did enjoy the idea of there being different 'marks' of weapons, defenses, and ship drives. Each variant may have had slightly more power, or less space taken up, or just less cost-but instead, it's not truly reflected as I'd hoped.I do realy enjoy the game, but there's some things I'd love to have changed. 8/10.

It will be a game to Play for a very long time!Edit : May 01.2015!Well Well Well Here we re the game is almost ready for Release! And I fully recommend it now the Depth that you well get into playing the game will amazed you. Colonize, Conquer and Control your Empire to Victory!!

												Having been with this game since Alpha (got the Elite Founders Package) I have watched this game grow into a beautiful masterpiece. Like all masterpieces, it has its far share of issues that still need to be overcome  while it is being finished but the devs are constantly at work to correct as soon as possible. This is and will be a great game for years to come.			"

												I started playing this game a week prior to release (Beta 6.2), mainly because I was really itching for a good 4x title.  I'm a first time reviewer, and I'm posting because Civ: Beyond Earth was a huge disappointment to me, so I'll admit I was ready for another let down.  But this has been a really fun game so far and I want to see good work rewarded!I consider myself a strategy game veteran but not a min-maxer, so I set the difficulty at one above normal and dived in.  I got my butt kicked.  The second time I have been more successful, but I have seen the computer making a lot of smart moves.  For example, it noticed my fleet maneuvers threatening its worlds and preemptively declared war, and another AI tried a military build up while I was distracted and tried to stab me in the back.  I dumped all my production into new warships to raise my relative level of power, and it backed off.  All of this was trackable via diplomacy indicators, which was really cool.  While it is still early, it looks like the AI in this game is significantly better than I am used to in the strategy genre which is a major plus (sorry, I am not a fan of multiplayer turn based strategy).  In fact, the game seems in general “designed” for AI – the systems play to its strengths rather than being cool on paper but easily exploitable by a human player.  The diplomacy is awesome, and that is because the AI gives clear feedback on why it is reacting the way it is.  “I need to research diplomacy tech to offset the penalty from my weaker military and the fact that I am trading with their enemy” is the kind of decision making that is actually possible in this game, rather than just being attacked (or ignored) seemingly at random.Ship design is a blast, and I am a fan of the combat system.  On the surface it appears to be a “rock-paper-scissors” type interaction between offense and defense, but this covers a higher degree of complexity beneath the surface.  For example, some weapons are fast firing and short ranged, others are smaller and more powerful but cost more to research for their level in the tech tree.  So far, it all seems “balanced” and I feel there is a lot of depth here I haven't discovered.I am also having way more fun with the race designer than I should be.  The fact that you can design your own races (every race in the Warcraft and Master of Orion universe for me), give them custom graphics, and play against them is really cool.My initial impressions are nothing but positive.  If you are a fan of turn based strategy (specifically, 4x), I recommend this one.  Nice job Stardock			"

												Extremely disappointing.  I've been a huge fan of the series, and was really excited by the new features promised in this latest installment.  Sadly, none of those exciting features seem to have made it to the final product.  No ""unique"" tech trees (they're actually less unique than those found in GalCiv 2), ""flexible ideology"" is a joke, and the drastic increase in map size is coupled with a drastic decrease in the number of usable planets and stars.  Planetary resources and bonus tiles often end up completely separated from everything else (negating some of their worth), and sometimes a bonus tile is generated directly under the colonial capital where it appears to be utterly useless.Worse, options that were available in both previous games have completely disappeared, while others have been inexplicably made into DLC.  I can't set a seed for galaxy generation, can't filter known planets for colonization, there are no save and load hotkeys, and no ability that I could find to regenerate the map when I'm handed a crappy one (which is often).  Gameplay-wise, the game is unbalanced, and progression is plodding at best.  Frankly, this game still plays like it's in beta, and it's been out for half a year already.  I'm hoping that Stardock will find a way to pull this one out of the crapper, but I don't see how they'd manage it at this late date.  I understand that they were trying to put a fresh new spin on everything, but they only succeeded in reducing the players' scope and options and the game's playability.TLDR;  Even if you're a huge fan, save your money.  They botched this installment big time.  It's not worth it, even on sale.			"

												The game is a sequel to the cult games galactic civilization 1-2 and its easily described as a Civilization V set in space, where you move around in space and settle planets instead of ground. This game moves as Civilization V did to hex grids but it do allow stacking ships something Civ V did not allow. One other major difference is the way units are, instead of having this historical unit or set unit Galactic Civilization expands on the previous entries in its franchise and offer you to customize every single aspect of a ship. Its like having a Lego box with thousands of Lego parts, you want to build a boombox with a head like a unicorn that shoots lasers go ahead. You want to build the famous ships from other games or science fiction media in general go ahead. There is also some pre- built standard ships for each race that you can build if you don´t wanna design or build. There will also be a feature to download others creation trough steam workshop among mods of other things. The game is regarded as a platform for Dlc and free patches with content so bear that in mind, it will be a lot of it, and it will be during a duration of its life cycle 5-7 years. It is an improvement and refinement over Galactic Civilization 2. Various stuff like a perk system, vast tech tree that branches and the mod support is amazing. The game has a bit dated User Interface but it looks great, and the game looks very good. It also plays well and functions well, and can loose one many nights of sleep. It has that one more turn sickness the Civilization fans are so accustomed to at this point. Its a strong foundation of a strong game. And I would gladly recommend it to anyone new players as old timers. I have some gripes with the game that can be considered negative:-Lack of battle viewer for planetary invasions-Poor camera in the space battle viewer -Lacks some key features from older games like espionage (they will most likely return though)-Pirates needs some adjustments before they add something great of interest to the game-It makes you stop sleeping-Some minor memory leaks that most likely will be fixed on the largest maps-Lacking a few option that will be added later I suspect in diplomacy Positive:+Stunning to look at+Detailed+Engrossing and large scope+Fantastic designer+Modfriendly and customizable+Allows for deep dives under its hood, its a deeper strategy game than it looks+Great tech tree progression and many techs to research +It makes you stop sleeping+Diplomacy (the overall diplomacy is great) +A bit old school in a good way with modern improvements "

								Bugs discovered and bug fixes (View Comments for updates)I purchased into the Beta4 Patch 2 build on offer at 50% off like a lot of people here. I had some very big problems running the game but lets face it's a Beta and it has bugs and we're here to help. It took me about 9 hours to get my 3 hours play time so don't give up.Bug 1: Completey random freezing of the game for no apparent reason - Fix disable sound effects (nothing else worked) Bug 2: Clicking on a planet in the planet list other than the idle colony message stats causes a game feeze - Temperary fix click through your messages first.Bug3:  (maybe a feature?) Orphaned Shipyard seemingly causeing a infinite loop bug - fix Attach shipyard to planet that built it and only build one shipyard per planet and if the planet already has one dont build another, yes you can decomission them. (I couldn't find anything out about orphaned shipyards either). Bug4: Trading for techs that grants new ship designs places multiple copies of these ships into your ship build queue, It may be related to the number of tech traded, we as I have had 3 and 4 copies of identical ships appearing in my shipyard queue - Tempory fix go to your ship designer and obsolete the copies (although you want to play the game this is best for your sanity trust me)Bug5: (This is a P.S. bug) Posting a review on steam for Gal Civ 3 while paused freezes the game -fix don't write a reviewExtra: also consider updating your video drivers to the latest none beta version (ironic ha?) in some cases rolling back if you have already updated to beta versions.Well done to Stardock on making the new game feel like excellent Gal Civ 2 only better (ignoring the bugs of course).

								An excellent Space 4X game, during a wonderous resurgence of the genre. Devs update quite regularly and frequently, with good additions and changes every time. Also, the battle viewer is gorgeous.My issue is that it can seem a bit overly complex. Maybe I'm just missing something obvious but the tech tree completely overwhelms me, and I generally just kind of stumble through it without any overall plan.Occasional overcomplexity (which I'm pretty sure is me missing something anyway) aside, this is a great return to the golden age of 4X gaming and gets a solid recommendation from me.

												Game AI makes it almost unplayable in some circumstances. There are frequent minor bugs and occasional major issues that cause freezes or hiccups, and rarely but still-too-common crashes. Inconsistencies in in-game play rules make unit travel and pathfinding unreliable and often nonsensical. Tedious and unfun micromanagement of planetary construction is required, as the in-game AI for planet development is unreliable and does not build in effective ways. Recent updates have been removing important tools for economy and production control. On top of this, many things are being released as payed DLC that should be included features, making the game incomplete and requiring extra payment beyond the initial purchase to access core features. These were released after my purchase, and I had expected regular content updates to the game as it was developed, not DLC releases.			"

												I have not played either of the two previous installments of Galactic Civilizations III. However, as an avid player of grand strategy games, I figured this would be right up my alley.For the most part I was right. The core mechanics are relatively simple, but offer a lot of depth; which makes it easy to get into, but difficult to master. A good sign for any such game.BUT... there is one major drawback. This game is simply incomplete. There are an insurmountable number of bugs and glitches that ruin the fun; sometimes by causing the game to outright crash.On a slight tangent; earlier this year when Paradox Interactive announced that they would be delaying the release of HoI4, I was upset. But, their reason was to avoid delivering a buggy game to the consumers. Such an attitude would have been wholly appreciated here.Lastly, I don't understand why the developers didn't integrate the modding of this game with the Steam Workshop. The ease of adding new ships, alien species, etc. would have been much better and everything centralized.Overall, disappointed.			"

												I really want to like this game, because it has everything I ever wanted in a 4x MoO clone. On top of that it looks good, is modable and has a great community of players.But (at least at this time) this game is a single endeavor of frustration for me.  The AI is of palpable incompetence. Due to focus on expansion I had next to no military fleets and a ""Godlike"" Drengi race declared war on me (finally!) and then did not attack me for 20 turns.  Even then their attacks amounted only to some unorganized probing attacks, while they wasted their time churning up a minor race at the other end of the map.  That is not ""Godlike"", but rather stupid. The diplomacy is hit and miss. I have seen worse and you can work out some nice deals with neighbors. However, as soon as you even start to build enough ships to defend just your core worlds (and not every nook and cranny of your empire) they get worried about your militarism and even the best relations decline rapidly.The worst? Bugs, crashes, crippling gameplay issues that bleed all the fun totally dry.Right now I am +15 hours into building an empire. Am allied with two minor and a major race and at war with two majors and a minor. I do have roughly 20 starbases deployed. Whenever I now hit ""TURN"" for the next turn, a battle between two Drengi fleets and two of my scouts happens. Which always ends with the scouts getting destroyed. Right when that happens, my game crashes. Regardless if I chose ""Quick Battle"" or decided to watch it.So I load the last save. Which was done JUST before hitting ""TURN"". And I have to ""Upgrade Starbase"" again for half a dozen Starbases where I just had said ""Pass"" to refuse the updating as I am waiting for a more worthwhile update later on. So after clicking through that AGAIN and hitting ""TURN"", the battles take place again and the game crashes yet again.When I destroy the two Scouts myself, another space battle (a minor against one of my Survey ships) takes place and results in yet another crash.So .... looks like the +15 hours I poured into that ""Empire"" are lost. Do I want to start over yet again? Not until these crippling bugs are ironed out. Stardock has not done itself a favor selling a beta as a ""full"" game. I do mind paying for a full price game and then having to play guinea pig for blatant and show stopping bugs.			"

Also, the space battles look amazing!- The great AI from Gal Civ II is back, and so are the super short turn times, this ain't your grand-daddy's Civ.Finally, the devs love this game and they think of it as a long term platform. Expect lots of cool stuff to come done the pipeline. You'll be coming back to this game over and over for many years. There's a lot of value here guys.			"

For the full game, I would like to see a tutorial. I played a little bit of GC II, but still fairly new to the game. There are many different features, specializations, ship types etc that are not immediately intuitive to a newbie. A baseline of understanding would be nice.Additionally, when you research new upgrades for your ships, it creates too many options to choose from. Some sort of simplification or explanation of ship types would be helpful. Maybe you could roll this into the tutorial? Or auto obsolete some ships?			"

It's really rather pretty. Tying in to the great ship-designer, watching your personally designed ships cut their way through your enemies looks and feels incredibly satisfying.I don't see myself getting tired of this game any time soon.

The addition of ""shipyards"" simplifies and streamlines military production, as well as adds new strategic structures to fight over. The tech trees additions makes technology feels more interesting.  The ship designer? Oh man, the ship designer. I havn't messed around with it too much, but it's more or less a whole other game. You have nearly limitless options for ship designs. I'm excited for this to come out of beta, and I'm really happy that one of the best PC games of all time has a worthy successor.			"

								This is the next iteration of the Galactic Civilization series. This is monster of a game that requires a 64 bit processor to play and for good reason. The largest map size would take months to complete against up to 120+ AI players plus a few of your friends. If you played other 4x games you could expect 10 minute turn times but no. The AI calculate it's turn during your turn and does so very quickly by using as many processor cores available to it. Turn times is almost instant.The player can also create their own ship designs to fight in the battle viewer that uses a rule set to determine the final outcome. Although you don't have direct control of combat that doesn't mean combat is boring. You design a fleets to invade the enemies space and the the AI is able to adapt to your U.S.S. Pwnage and send you back to the design board. Colony Management has a puzzel-esque feel. Each building buffs other similar buildings. So no two colonies are the exact same. The game is beautiful. Space is filled with nebulas, black holes, asteroids and stars. This is a must have title in my humble opinion for strategy gamers.			"

Early Access Review
								((Game still in Beta))So far the management system is looking rather good.  I like how the next button does not show up if you have an idle ship, planet, research, or space dock.  At first I was not sure about it, but now I find that it’s actually rather helpful, to let me know if I have a ship I forgot and its doing nothing.  So good job on that.About the diplomatic system.  I think its not complete.  There was one bill that came in to abolish all current wars, and everyone voted yes, but the 2 wars I was in was not abolished and I was still being attacked.  Also there was an election for the chair and the two races I was at war with voted for me.  That kinda seems odd, I thought they would vote against me.  So perhaps the AI needs some tweaking.The Difficulty.  Maybe the difficulty settings are not complete, but I was playing on the easiest that it allows, and I still found it to be a bit hard.  I am a casual gamer. In Galactic Civilizations II, there was a good range of difficulty, the where even some settings that where too easy for me, and some that are too hard.  But in GC III, the lowest setting is a bit too hard for a low setting, so I hope even lower, and perhaps higher settings will come in eventually.I have noticed sometimes while I am in the manage dialogue box for a planet, and hover over a bonus slot, the details are not completely readable due to the box not being big enough. There is one thing I am hoping that would be added.  Galactic Civilizations II for me was nearly a perfect game.  It had so many propertys that where awesome about it.  but there was one downfall in my opinion.  The combat system.  Its okay being able to see the battle conspire, but it was still a bit lame.  I hope that in Galactic Civilizations III there would be a combat system similar to Star Wars Empire at War.  Being able to command the ships you build in battle would greatly take this game to the next level.  And I am sure many would agree. "

								Well as a player of the older Galactic Civilizations games i can say im liking the way this is looking. Though i do have to agree that right now its still an alpha. Many of the features havent been implemented and a decent amount of the UI is still greyed out.  For now i give it a thumbs up.			"

								So far they have improved on every part of this game. Except for the tech tree. So much harder to use now, and that makes it harder to plan out your game. Once you get the hang of the new tree though (again you should't have to the old tech tree was great) It's like playing a nicer version of Galactic Civ II. This is a great game and I can't wait to see what they did with the story. I highly recomend buying and playing this game.			"

												I’ve played GalCiv 3 since late beta, running an i7 with 12 GB of RAM.  I haven’t tried the in-game campaign and have played only single-player using medium and large galaxies vs. all 8 in-game AI factions + assorted minor factions.   You can go much bigger than that if your machine will support it, but I've found large galaxies make for very satisfying games.  I highly recommend smaller galaxies for your first games, so that you can get going more easily.  As others have pointed out, the bigger you play, the more RAM you will need.Summary:  Fun game, your decisions matter.  AI factions are entertaining, imperfect, and improving.  Ship designer keeps game interesting.  Stardock user community is active and helpful.  There is a learning curve and some rough edges, but lots of entertainment value for my money (more than most games).Pros:- Most of the decisions you have to make matter.  Each tech you research, each colony improvement you build makes a noticeable improvement -- your ships become more powerful, colonies are more productive, your influence and bargaining power increase.  You aren’t overwhelmed by near-meaningless busy-work or grinding to grow your empire.- Every faction feels different, much more so than, say, in the Civ series. Tech trees change depending on which faction you play, and the strengths and weaknesses of each faction feel important.  Plus, you can make all the custom factions you want, or download others' factions from Stardock's website (Steam workshop support should be coming soon, too).- AI factions have personality and give you feedback.  An AI faction might warn you off if you're amassing ships near their border, or let you know they value the trade route you have with them.  I quickly get to like/despise/fear each faction in the game, and this also changes from one game to the next depending on your choices and how the game progresses.  One game, I was planning to go to war with one faction, but then they surprised me with a small gift, expressing admiration for my society.  So I gave them some help, we became friends and are now fighting an enemy faction together.  This has made for a much more interesting story than the old smash-em-all slog that many 4x games become.- Ship combat is more interesting than GalCiv 2 -- not just rock-paper-scissors, but ships are assigned roles like assault, guardian, escort, support, and these roles affect combat.  Your ship designs and fleet composition make a big difference.  Much like Civ, I would say the battles are fought strategically, not tactically (you're the admiral directing the war(s); you're not the captain making in-battle decisions).- The ship designer lets you make any ship you want; customize load-outs and/or appearance as you like. You can even download and use others' ship designs – some users have already posted some interesting designs.  I get weary of 4x games where every faction has the same old units -- not here.   While I haven't seen it myself yet, word from other users is that the AI will learn to use the units you design too.  Never the same game twice!- Adjacency bonuses – e.g., two factories next to each other make each other better – make planning improvements on your colonies more interesting than just loading up a build-queue.  It adds some strategic planning to your colony management without overwhelming you in too many details.- If you love to micro-manage, you can tinker with just about everything, and most of the numbers you see have pop-up tooltips showing you where they come from.  If you prefer, you can play a rewarding game without worrying about min-/maxing every little decision.- The UI and graphics have improved dramatically over GalCiv 2.  It's easy to move through the turns and most decisions can be enacted quickly and intuitively.- Nebulae, black holes, wormholes and asteroid fields add more “terrain” features to the map than GalCiv 2 had, and these can be relevant for positioning, hiding, or escape.  As well, there are more galactic resources which can be mined for improved technologies.- The Stardock user-community is generally helpful and respectful; if you have questions, ask, and someone will answer pretty quickly.Cons:- If you're not really familiar with the GalCiv games of the past, or even if you are, there's a learning curve.  There is a manual on Stardock’s site, and you may need to scout the web or forums for help.  I’ve gotten answers to my questions from the Stardock user community usually very quickly.  When playing your first game or two, expect to make an occasional unfortunate decision only to learn later that it wasn’t what you might have expected.  - Game is a little rough around the edges (some spelling errors, the odd tech doesn’t work the way it’s advertised, AI occasionally does something dumb), but no disastrous issues and improvements are happening all the time:  2 patches since release and version 1.1 is coming in June.  I've had one CTD, but with auto-save I lost only a couple of turns, so no big deal.  - Espionage is non-existent, and Diplomacy is fairly basic – you can trade and ask another faction to go to war with/for you (for a price).  Like with any other 4x game, I expect more to come in future patches/expansions.- Not all information is accessible when you want it – e.g., you can’t review the state of your empire before responding to an AI’s trade request.  While once in a while this can be awkward, it’s far from game-breaking. "

If you love 4X strategy games then you will not be disappointed by Gal Civ III. I can't recomend this game highly enough.			"

												This review is from the point of view of someone who ONLY plays multiplayer.This game shows promise. However at this time multiplayer is barely functional with numerous bugs and limitations.Game lobby is lacking. Can't see racial information, Can't have more than one of each AI race. Can't see or change game options once people join lobby. Can't have more than 4 human players. Can't play on any decently large maps. Can't use custom races, Can't change color. Can't make private or set password on games. the list goes on. Once in the game you get to deal with bugs and bad MP design. Auto upgrading of buildings queues 4 times for each building. Players play in turn and while you can do a part of your turn between turns several signifigant parts of your turn you can't. this makes for very slow turn cycles.There are also game sync bugs. Issues loading saves, With all of this (and there is more but I'm getting tired of trying to think of everything) There are also all of the general bugs and issues that both SP and MP games deal with.I expect this game will be very good in SP sometime soon. I really hope all of the issue with MP are fixed as well. At this time however I do not think this game is worth $50, or $30 for that matter. Fix the bugs and I'll be happy I bought the game. Right now I feel like I have bough a lemon.			"

												I don't understand how this game has the rating it does. It is unfortunately a buggy mess, it is a very infuriating waste of time. I loved galciv2 and always thought highly of Stardock because of it. I bought into this game because of the multiplayer, The idea of playing galciv2 multiplayer really appealed to me. Unfortunately they have NOT delivered.When I host and my friend joins, it immediately crashes on him like clockwork, so to work around it I saved the game and re-invited him to the lobby of the restored session. Now we are experiencing the turn hang bug, where the turns stop progressing and there's nothing you can do. People have found a work around by loading an earlier save and moving differently in order to continue their multiplayer game. If your idea of fun is coming up with crazy work arounds to try to dodge bugs the devs should've tackled long ago, buy away, you will NOT be disappointed.I on the other hand am very disappointed and want Stardock to fix this mess.

												Huge let down. They played it ""safe"" and made a less interesting, slightly more pretty gal civ 2. Many of the features of gal civ 2 are absent and most everything else is exactly the same. Fleet battles look horrible and are a joke. They are exactly the same as in gal civ 2. The ships aimlessly float toward eachother and then off in all directions. Invasions? No different than before. Just one screen and thats it. Overall the game is heavy on hardware for no apparent reason, boring, without soul or nearly any entertaining qualities at all. Sad I wasted money on this garbage.			"

Posted: December 31, 2015
												My opinion after 16 hours of playing GCIII - game mechanics are almost identical to GCII, and the whole thing feels like a graphic remake of its predecessor, but it also feels incomplete. Here are few problems:Beginning with Interface menus that do not offer even a half of the options you had before to customize your experience during gameplay. Resource icons for example make a mess out of the map when zoomed out, making it really hard to observe the gameplay. I haven't found any options to address this. Taxing system for your colonies is removed and only way to manage your economical income is through single wealth/manufacturing/research slider. I don't yet have a definitive opinion on this, but for now this new income system feels little vague. The hype about incredible AI that utilizes each core of your expensive i7 to provide you the best and most complex GalCiv experience is just hype. Reality is that for 16 hours of gameplay I haven't noticed any singe improvement compared to GalCIv II. The opponents react exactly the same in same situations, making same diplomatic propositions, and making same strategic mistakes as before (small example: just leave barely habitable class 5 planet next to your starting homeworld and AI rush to take it, spending a colony ship and bunch of money for improvements, just to loose the planet after few turns due to overwhelming influence of your nearby homeworld).Spying is completely missing leaving you to guess what your opponents are doing, researching or building on their home planets. I read somewhere that developers plan to program ""deeper"" spying system than before, so they left it completely out. Really? Releasing a full-priced game without a crucial feature that existed in its predecessor, with a promise that it will be included in eventual DLCs that you have to pay for additionally? Why developer haven't taken more time to finish their ideas and then release the full version, or at least implement the old style feature and then improve it later?Speaking to another civilization should lead to trading screen right away (99% of the time this is where player wants to go), rather than opening a pointless splash screen. It is eye candy, but it is very inconvenient as you have to click twice. Furthermore, ""trade with you"", and ""declare war on you"" are two choices just next to each other making it a miss-click accident waiting to happen. There are more smaller and bigger issues to remark and I will edit this interview if I find more or if I change my opinion on it, but in its current state this release is not worth the money as it offers less than GalCiv II.

												It's hard to put 50+ hours into a game and then give it a thumbs down.  I've had some good times with the game but mostly it's been either a game that was so trivial to beat the AI (early patches), or maddening ones (patch 2.0).....all while playing normal difficulty. I'm glad the devs are constantly improving and evolving the game but I think it has a critical flaw in that it has simply too broad of a surface area on ways to play it, which can easily run the casual gamer into the ground...repeatedly. Ultimately it comes down to a ""secret sauce"" formula, as seen on countless fan sites, where you are going to lose unless you get a certain minimum amount of objectives done in the first 20 to 100 turns or else you're destined to lose.  In other words, the whole game is made in the first series of turns....and the rest is simply a process of going through the motions.  I've played Civ1 through 5, GalCiv2, Elemental, FE, etc.....and damn do I REALLY want to love galciv3 but it's just too screwy of a game that seems to be angling more for hardcore players. I think the game needs to be focused a bit more starting with the overwhelming state of the research tree.  Yep, i'm sure that's controvertial but it's WAY too broad.  As a player I get sick of clicking through 4 trees (sorry but it needs to be 3) and having 12+ different choices that only (for the most part) very incrementally change the game.  Research alone forces a player to micromanage, when that's a turn off for a LOT of people. I could talk for ever and give example after example but it's just not worth my time.  GalCiv4 will need to start from scratch if it wants to win me and others back.  By and large it was too similar to GC2 to start with....but made worse by minutia and formulaic measures in order to win.			"

												This game is beautiful.  Its been released, I've played about 10 hours since the official release and have had 1 crash to desktop, not bad (I suppose)... problems are still being identified by both the developers and community and bugs are being repaired promptly.  The developers are very enthusiastic about GalCiv III and it really shows in the game, the graphics are crisp, the customisation is some of the most intricate I have ever seen and the combat is pretty spectacular.  This is a superb 4x strategy game, anyone who has played and enjoyed previous Gal Civ titles is going to love this.Now that the game has been officially released, I have had a chance to complete the campaign, it was good, but a little short... I think they have plans to release more campaigns/scenarios in the future (I will update this review accordingly) but I am a little concerned over how they have been plugging DLC for a while.  For the time being I am happy with this purchase.  The only real negative I have with this game is that the planetary invasion its somewhat of a let down and makes the game feel unfinished, but according to the devs they are going to be overhauling this feature in a future patch.I recommended this title for any person that loves 4x strategy games. 8/10  (but will probably score higher once the invasions are overhauled).

												Lacks so much of what you expect in a modern 4x game. The UI is lackluster, dialogues don't even mention what race is contacting you. You can't check other info before making decisions.Consequences seem to have little affect, even being at war feels unexciting. Special resources seem massively overpowered, and you can rule the game using experimental weapons so much more powerful than conventional weapons. The manufacturing pace feels out of balance. Killing a shipyard mid game and have it respawn the next turn. The game is buggy - I made ship designs in a previous game that required large hull research, in a new game I could build these even though they were overweight if I tried to design it afresh. I've been able to build ships that require special resources with no limit, going endlessly into negative special resources. The game crashed to desktop, frequently, without any real reason. The battle sequences are completely pointless, take forever and look terrible (especially the way the ships slide sideways and backwards awkwardly). Nobody will ever bother to watch one out, a waste of the developers time.All in all the game does what you expect. It's a 4x game with nothing very wrong. Just, everything is sub-par. What you'd expect from a 15 yr old game. Every 4x game I've played in the last 5+ years is better. I expected so much more.			"

												I'm a big fan of Master of Orion 2, Gal Civ was never interesting, because it had no multiplayer.But now, here it is! I bought this game in early access, last year around christmas. The game was very rudimentary and not very polished, so i played a couple of hours and decided to wait till release.And now, I'm looking at one of the best 4x space games that have come out in years! Serious, it has flaws, but overall it is the best 4x space game you can expect these days.Here are my pros:- The Tech-tree is gigantic and very diversified. You have often to choose which of three possible techs you want, the others are gone, till you are able to trade the techs with someone else.- The building system on planets is unique and maybe you need a little practice before you are able to squeeze the last bit of efficiency out of it. - Colonizing planets let you make ideologic decisions, because every planet comes along with some kind of speciality.    Maybe there are natives on the planet and you have now the possibility to decide what will happen to them.   Benevolent, would let them keep their lifestyle, which leads to an increment of your ideologic points and gets you a approval   bonus.                                              Pragmatic, would keep them in a reservat and make a tourist attraction of them. (Also getting ideologic points.)  Malevolent, would enslave them and use as a cheap labor force.      This system makes a lot of fun and seems to be thought through. (Maybe there are balancing issues, but we will see.)- A lot of winning conditions, not just war.- Customizing your race is nearly as good as in moo 2.- Special resources for prototype weapons or buildings.- Ship designer!- A rich map generator, and last but not least...- Multiplayer!The cons:-  Combat is automatic and the battle viewer has some issues getting the scene right and your spacecraft flying in strange circles around the enemy.- No espionage!- Stability issues. (but i could solve mine, by increasing the swap file to at least 4 gb. No problems since. But my friend who wants to play the                                                             game with me, has a lot of problems, although he increased his swap file size too.)  - And there are maybe a lot of other minor things that can be personal preference. As a conclusion I can say:This game does a lot of things right and gives you a lot of freedom which you would expect, if you played games like Master of Orion 2 before. It goes even further by giving the community the possibility to mod the game. You can spend dozens of hours in custom games or in multiplayer and every game could be a new experience. There is also a new campaign, which i haven't played yet, but this is a big plus for the singleplayers.Beside some features i would like to see and the bad stability, this game is (can be even better with some addons) the best experience 4x space gamers can get.(Sorry for the bad english!)

												First, second, and third contact confirmed, sir.Prep the cannons as Irreverend Opinions engages Galactic Civilizations III!---The BlurbThe latest edition of Stardock's 4x turn-based strategy title range, this third title offers shiny new graphics, expansive maps, custom ship designs, and tech trees dependent on racial outlook.Leaving the drama[www.breitbart.com] aside entirely, please take discussions about it to other sites.The GoodAs advertised, 'linear' victory conditions are out of the picture, letting players really achieve the ""4x"" standard - Exploration, Expansion, Extortion, and Extermination all have ""win"" conditions, from following the ancient species to ascension to simply being the only species left standing.Graphics are quite nice, with detail paid to not only planetary design but ship combat processing as well.Gameplay can be tweaked to suit fast, short games or epic-scale conquest.Ship designer allows for immense customization, allowing players to create hundreds of variants for their roles.Modding support enables incredible levels of customization for your game.The BadLack of finishing in the QA process makes this the buggiest game of the GC series.  Crashing to desktop should be expected, and numerous unpatched errors still remain since release.AI is not great, even on higher difficulty settings.Multiplayer matchmaking takes far higher data requirements than theoretically necessary, making unnecessary latency issues for players in a turn-based strategy game.The UglySound is particularly buggy, and players can expect that after certain memory thresholds will fail to function any more at all.SuggestionsA thorough bug fix analysis is needed to cover the issues that are produced.  If you suffer repeat issues, opt-in to the ""beta"" through Steam to help bypass certain cloud-related issues.The Summary8/10.  A solid sci-fi 4x turn strategy title.  Despite issues, can be played quite well, and the ship builder allows for plenty of workshop content even if you're not much of a modder yourself.---If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												This game is great, been playing it for around 18 hours or so. It reminds me of the previous installment. The thing i like the most so far is you can have much larger universes now when playing. The largest map size is called insane. I always played custom games on the previous version on the largest map possible with max civs too. I love playing a grand, long game that takes forever to finish. I really can't say there is much i do not like about the game except that it does not come with a wide variety of pre-made factions but you can create all the custom factions you want to have more opponents if you wish. It's just all the good things i liked about the previous installment on a grander scale. More and bigger is better imo. Keep up the good work. I am looking forward to expansions that add more races and possibly more tech trees, or custom tech trees would be cool. The more techs and variety the better and more interesting the game will be. I guess the biggest weakness at the moment even though it's not a big deal, is the game needs more variety.All and all 8/10 score.			"

												If you enjoyed Gal Civ II and loved it, Gal Civ III is shaping up to be a very nice addition to the series. While incomplete the core elements are very present in the way the game plays. The only frustrations you may have is that this game is still beta so not everything is there yet. Occasionally you will see something that doesnt quite work or doesnt seem as intuitive as it should be. If you dont jump on the beta make sure you come back and take a serious look when it is released.POST ALPHA UPDATE: The game has been out awhile now and has met every expecation. There is alot of depth here and the mechanics all fit together to rewards those that pay attention to detail. There will be a learning curve for those who have never played this type of game before and if this is the case you may find this title isnt the friendliest for beginners. However, if you want to disappear into an 4X game for several days, this is the game is bound to be the gold standard for you!			"

Early Access Review
								I just love 4x Games. I also love big and expansive games that that weeks to play and are slow moving so you can get the most out of each tech. They have made that possible in Galciv III with insane maps sixes and number of opposites. The graphics and interface are very polished. I love the change to planets, what you place where make a huge difference making each planet a unique planing puzzle. I have already lost many nights of sleep on this game. I can not wait to see how the people at stardock add to this game and what the modders do for this game.  My only regret is not buying the elite founders pack when I had the chance.			"

												I don't think this is a bad game. I don't think it's a great game. It is sometimes fun, sometimes frustrating (as it should be) but what it's not is GalCiv. GalCiv2 was what everyone needed after a long time had passed since MOO2. Obviously, based on that success, fans were expecting another home run with GalCiv3. And what they got was a single. There's not much new. If anything, it feels ""streamlined"" and has less overall ""stuff"" than GalCiv2 did. That could just be my perspective but I'm certainly feeling less involved this time around. I have mixed feelings about the AI as sometimes it was incredibly smart if not too smart and other times I shook my head in embarassment for them. It just doesn't seem consistent at the mid-to-high difficulty levels. Visually, which is usually not a 4X game strong point, it's pretty but it's not mind blowing. The game has held my attention for 4 or 5 moderately long sessions so far. I'll play it through a few times but if you're expecting something above and beyond GalCiv2, I just don't feel that it's here. That said, this is WAY better than the MOO reboot in Early Access. Yikes, that thing is a mess.			"

												I have been a 4x fan since MOO 1, and it is my favorite genre.  When i found out they were making Galactic Civilizations 3, i was looking forward to it.   But it has been a bit of a let down (especially for $50).  It lacks some critical elements: you cant control ship combat, no spying, and the tech tree just isn't quite right.  I would suggest you wait until the price drops, 50 bucks is just too much for this game.			"

												I played the first two gal civ games for quite some time.  This third one seems get the balance between micromanaging and the fun of 4x games just about right.  I do kind of miss the galactic news reports from the previous games, some of those were hilarious.  The tech tree can be a little overwhelming for those of us that like to research everything but now it acts more like a tool for customizing your game play style.  Over all I recommend this game to anyone that liked the previous iterations of the game or that likes 4x games in general.  I came to the party late so didn't get to experience the world wheel for each colony but I think it was ultimately a good thing they got rid of it.  The focus buttons make life easier for those of us that like some micromanagement but aren't compulsive about it.			"

												GalCiv 3 has a lot of potential. It could be the best space strategy game out there. However, two major shortcomings prevent it from fulfilling its promise. First, the interface is entirely inadequate to manage large scale empires - one of its supposedly major advantages over its predecessor. Once you control more than a a few dozen worlds, star bases and ships, this game becomes micro management hell. For example, there is no way to upgrade a whole fleet, you'll have to do it piece by piece. GalCiv's other major weakness are bugs. It's not unplayable but there are just too many to really enjoy it. Why is the guard function not working? Why does it crash or hang every so often? Why does the AI behave so erratically, declaring war and begging for peace the very next turn? I've decided to stop playing for now and give it another try in a couple of updates. Stardock did improve GalCiv 2 a lot during its life time. I'm confident they'll make an enjoyable game out of GalCiv 3, too. At the moment, it just isn't.			"

								Huge fan of GalCiv 2, GalCiv 3 is the long awaited update and expanded version without losing any of what made the series so great. This game is one of, if not, my favourite game[s]. Absolutely brilliant.Howether if you are a newcomer, add it to your wishlist and wait for the full release, it is a hugely complex game when you really get into it and its unfinished state doesn't quite do it justice. Go download GalCiv 2 and get used to that whilst your waiting for the full release, then you'll understand what all the hype is about.			"

												This game is really addictive and fun, but buggy and unstable.  I keep starting games and right as they get fun I have to abandon them because they keep crashing to desktop.  Specific random events trigger this, one I pinpointed to a shipyard being destroyed, and I just encountered it again after wiping out the last Klingon planet.  Often if a downloadable ship belonging to a different faction than the one you're playing is chosen, the game crashes too.  And that's not counting the litany of weird little quarks, like having the starbases randomly revert to the oldest, worst kind of constructor ships when they ""order"" their upgrades.I would love to recommend this game.  It's a nice, quiet 4x afternoon with a lot of beautiful custom ships from the modding community, but it's just too buggy right now.  Hopefully the product managers let the devs focus on stabilizing the game instead of trying to pump out more DLC for 5 bucks a pop.Stabilize the game guys, then I'll buy the DLC, I promise.  Until then, meh.			"

												Started playing back in Beta. had a ton of issues and what not, thats to be expected. their support was good. course i have the distinction of playing this game while i have windows 10 technical preview. which at the time of the review is not supported by stardock.Even so as i waited for windows to get me a decent update. which it finally did. i poured a bunch of hours into this game.realy good game i must say.Now after Beta and full release. Thanks to Windows 10 i once again had issues playing. but that got resolved once my graphics card sent out a windows 10 driver. which soon allowed me to play this game again. and i soon put in another 20 hours on the spot playing the campaign. Which i found to be a lot of fun so far. Overall this is a good game and will be supported for some time to come. like 7 years of support!Down side is, yea it's 1.0 and still has bugs, but what game doesnt? Would i recommend this game?? yes!! even more so if you love 4x is it worth the current price?? yes!! but you can put it on your wishlist and wait for a sale, thats what i did during beta.Now i just have to wait for win 10 to be released, which should clear up any bugs i have now. game runs fine otherwise.

												A great and unique game concept but....... Galactic Civiliztions 2 is however a far superior game to this DLC and sorely lacking game. Both games are very similar. Gal Civ 3 has superior graphics but not really by much and Gal Civ 2 was a far better game overall bar a memory leak issue which basically killed the game for long term players and stopped any serious modding. Gal Civ 3 does not impress me at all with no real new features, some old ones missing and a dev team more involved in squezing DLC money out of the consumers pockets than actually making a good game. The community really supported the developers the whole way and continue to but they continue to fail to actually bring anything new or impressive. The community practically built this game for the developers with serious bug testing and fixes coming from the very early days. As soon as the engine was running the community has been playing, testing and developing. And what thanks do we get, well none at all. the game is barely finished and if you really want to get angry just check the DLC section. The developers basically sold half a game and are asking more money for very little. Only now is it considered playable with serious issues occuring after official release and continung still but again the community works around it or simply fixes the problems themselves. My faith in the developer is gone. You've detroyed a game i loved. On a final note your modding system also sucks. You should have stuck with the old system that everyone understood and loved instead of the travesty you settled on.			"

												I was one of those ppl that decided I loved Galatic Civ II and I got that  for $5 on a steam sale so after 800 hrs of that I felt it was well deserved for stardock to get the $99 for the Founder Edition and so far I am utterly pleased.I admit some features in the earlier betas where a little shaky and placing untold fears in my mind, however by beta 6 these fears were entirely vanquished.In short this game is the first game to use 64bit (a technology over a decade old yet due to consoles was never used in gaming before now). As seen with this AI this step into 64bit has made this game exponentially better, as it is the best 4x AI I have ever played against. This AI is multi-dimensional in terms of play styles and personalities of each of the Races and the it has this impressive ability to pick up new factions. For example you create a race via custom race editor that you can play which is really cool. However it gets grander when with a few settings the AI can actually play your previous race creations as Major factions. I repeat Major faction not minor so this they way you can customize your entire gameplay experience even if you do not like the default vanilla races, or expand it and have 16 races instead of the original 8 lol.This idea also applies to the Ship designer in regards to simplicity and adaptability it is very easy to pick up and learn the basics and as you play with it you quickly discover it has incredibly powerful advanced options from size, 3 axis offsetting parts, all the way to even adding animations to individual parts or sections. This allows you to be incredibly creative further more these ships can be saved and exported to other games later on as this feature can be quite a time-sink making you fall in love with your creations. Therefore the import and Export tool is incredibly satisfying to see thought was put into taking a old feature and keeping it great if not make it greater.since it meets my expectations all around I have little negative to say at this stage I have not attempted Multiplayer at this stage so I cannot comment on this (it was not working during beta 3 but since then have not tried again)rare crashes in beta 6 but based on release patch notes these seemed to be fixed. Ok this ended up getting a little longer then intended and quite biased in the positive direction that said I had an idea of what to expect and it delivered so I dont have many cons at this time hahaha sorry			"

												I'm a big fan of Gal Civ 2 and when I saw that they made a new one with I was very excited.  From the screen shots it looked very pretty and I particulary like the hex maps.  Unfortunately playing the game is a lesson in frustration.Right from the start, even with habital planets set to abbundant the nearest dozen starts to my starting location have no useable planets.  When I finally can reach the other civs territory they have a lot of planets.  This of course has a massive effect as the game progresses.  They are able to get a lot of planets right out of the gate, which means they get a big boost to every stat.  Looking at the graphs, all of mine have very little growth and theirs sky rocket.Oh and let's talk about how civs will go hostile to you for no reason and reguardless of what your diplomacy is.This wasn't just one game, this is every game.  I've restarted several dozen times and it's the same story every time.  I've tried changing the settings from the start and same results.  I can only conclude that either I'm unlucky in the extreme or this sort of thing is done on purpose.I'm going to unload the game for now and wait for another update and see if anything changes.  For myself this game is just to broken to play and there is no way I'll spend any more money on expansions in the hopes that they somehow compensate.  Very disapointed.Update:  I reloaded the game with the latest patch and I've noticed something.  The AI civs never go to war with each other, they only ever go to war with the player.  I've played several games at this point and each did the same thing.  The AI civs will declare war on me even when they are out of range of my civ.  As this is the case what is the point of having more than one AI civ per game.  They only act as a single unit to fight the player.			"

												This is a beautiful game, no question about it - the music is perfect, the aliens look good, the ships and map are pretty much perfect, but... It has a few flaws that are quite frustrating among the stuff that actually are good.To begin with, aliens declare war at the drop of a hat for no good reason, and as soon as war is declared, it's a pain to get peace. That means that between warring aliens and pirate bases trade become useless unless you provide escorts (slow, expensive escorts that would be better used at the frontlines) to maybe reach a currently reasonably friendly alien planet. Secondly, the ground combat is resolved with a mouse click. That's it. No invasion cut scenes, no ground combat tactics, no fighting done. And it is done within 1 week. Yes. With one transporter, you will take over a planet in one week. That's so bad words can't describe it. The game is a bit silent. The music is perfect, and it's never tiring to hear, but there is the usual (scientifically wrong) booms in space, and there's no voice acting, not even from the science advisor in your team. That's a pretty bad flaw too.It does get a bit repetitive over time, especially on large maps when you are in a perpetual war from pretty much the start: build a star base to increase the operative range of your fleets, invade a planet, collect your fleets again, rinse and repeat. But apart from those flaws, the game is fine - the customization options are endless, and fiddling around with the designer to make your own ships is a ton of fun. Overall, I'll give this a solid 6/10. Well worth a buy, but not at this price, so wait until it goes down a few bucks.			"

												Note: Updated to reflect the status as at Patch 1.5If you are looking for a 4X game that is well crafted and allows you to play in many different ways then Galactic Civilizations III is recommended.  However, if you are looking for an innovative 4X game that redefines the genre norms, you might consider the design a bit too safe.  The GoodThe race customisation options are very cool, there is decent variety in the technology tree and ideology tree.  There are lot of ways to play via the different victory types, set-up options and campaign (albeit brief the missions are fun particularly at higher difficulty).The galaxy has a good range of events, bonuses, resources, pirates and minor civilizations particularly if you play with the Precursor Worlds DLC.  The diverse personalities of the races is very noticeable both in the diplomacy interactions and the way they actually play.  Playing against other custom factions available via the Steam workshop is quite fun.The AI is okay but well behind Gal Civ 2.  The AI can build colonies up well but doesn't use some mechanics effectively such as Diplomacy and has extremely weak late game strategies.  The game can provide a challenge early, though.The User Interface is intuitive and easy to use.The game really is quite beautiful graphically for the most part (except the battle viewer, we'll get to that below).In summary, I've enjoyed the game a lot more than I expected and had plenty of playtime.The BadThe game is very poorly balanced and there are a large number of excessive exploits available to the player.  In particular, the diplomacy system is the most expoitable system I can recall in any 4X game ... ever.  I've posted save games on the Stardock forums to no avail e.g. Alliance Victory on Godlike Difficulty on a Huge map in just 36 turns etc, etc.Starbases are a micromanagement nightmare.There is a lack of innovation in the game.  Some consider this a positive, and while I agree there is a formula that shouldn't be messed with too much, I couldn't describe the game as leading the 4X genre as a result.  At least not yet.The combat is really dull and in particularly it's graphically lame (disappointing given how stunning Sins of a Solar Empire was to look at from Stardock).  Unfortunately there are no cool end game threats (saved for expansions no doubt).  If you want World Destroyers, Stellar Converters or other cool stuff, you'll like have to look elsewhere.The LowdownMost 4X fans will enjoy the game but some are going to find the lack of innovation a turn off.  If you are on the fence about this game I would probably wait.  Stardock are committed to continuing to improve the game and do offer pretty deep sales from time to time.  That said, as a Space 4X fan, I'll likely continue to load it up again after each major update.			"

												Sadly, another release too early.  Beta I could go with the flow with bugs etc.  Now with full release, that's not happening...  With my update to this review months after, they're almost worse.  Multiplayer still is plagued with bugs.  The devs don't have enough sense to play their game themselves so they set up ""10 computers and let the AI run overnight""...   I think from all the negative reviews they're scared to try it on their own.  Even the log in screen for multiplayer bugs out constantly (Something even 1 billion computers running AI overnight wouldn't reveal).  It doesn't even have a password protect so everytime you're waiting for your friend to join, some other random numbnutz joins your game.  You can't kick him from the lobby so you have to exit out, restart, then hope they don't do it again before you quickly try and start the game.  Seriously though, the means Stardock has used to test their game is really really really sad.  Too bad because 2 was awesome and 3 is like 2 but with multiplayer which is why I bought it...  The game still is horribly bugged from the latest patch.  Yet another weekend wasted with having my friend come down from out of town to play a game.			"

												A nice upgrade but graphics are very poor, especially on the galaxy map view (the main view) where there's way too much bright blue and purple that distracts you from any sense that you're looking at a galaxy instead of what looks like an old fashioned arcade game. So games like Civ5 and other more recent 4x games are far far more pleasing to look at. As far as gameplay, it's very well done except, with the distances so large, and the ships movement so teeny tiny, it takes forever to get a ship or fighter or whatever, from point a to point b. I mean, each ship can only move about 2 hexs during the first 10 hours or so of gameplay before more research is done. Considering that typical planet is  20 hexes from the next nearest point, that's totally insane and feels really like you're in slow motion. That's about my only complaint.It's too bad the graphics are so weird on the big map. They ARE useful and tell you what you need, but unfortunately are totally disgusting to look at.			"

								Fantastic game. Still in Beta so there is a lot that isn't available yet but it is coming and i just cannot wait. Though I spent most of my time designing ships rather than playing... more so that I ended up getting destroyed because I'd build for so long, I'd forget what was going on in the galaxy. Though one thing I don't really understand is the opening video... or trailer. Talks about this war, Humanity doing all this and that but... when you play the game, it is baiclally you start off as Humans (or Terrians) on Earth, you just go boldly where no man has gone before to explore strange new worlds (sorry, hat too :P). Not really sure because it looks like a campaign kind of thing but i don't see how that will work in this kind of game.... but whatever, it is still really fun and I cannot wait to see what they do with it in it's final release.

												This is an amazing 4x space turn-based strategy with some depth and an AI that isn't asleep at the wheel.  Unfortunatley I've finished 1/4th of the games I've started in single player and none of the multiplayer games.I got this game for myself an my wife, we love the Civilization series and I had played previous Gal Civs before, we picked it up and got hooked.  But then the game crashed, eh that happens no worries.  But it keeps crashing, we've jumped through the various tech support hoops and its still unstable as the day we bought it.Specific and unavoidable parts of the game seem to force the game to crash on a regular basis, like someone defying the U.P. Vote in multiplayer seems to always kill the game for myself and my wifes copy independently of each other.  This, along witht he trouble shooting we tried, tells me the game is faulty.tl;dr crash happy fun 4x game.UPDATE (9/9/2016):  So I guess one of the Devs replied to this review, my wife's copy crashed first game in after these 'stability improvments'.  Will contiune to hope for functionality.First multiplayer game froze, crashed out and sent error report, then it wouldn't let us start it back up.UPDATE (9/11/2016):  The same bugs exist, crashing with defied UP votes, troubleshooting offers no relief, still a robust game with no stability, do not buy.UPDATE (9/16/2016): Final update.  I contacted their technical support the first time on the 8th, over a week an no one has contacted me at all other than here...to tell me to contact them...wow.			"

												More of the same.  It's prettier.. It's newer.. But it's the SAME game with irrelevant updates.  I've tried hard to find some way to appreciate this, but it always comes down to the same game as the last version.  There's just no innovation here. It's just a new paint job.  Don't waste your money.  Support real innovation. "

												As a owner of all the olders Galactic Civilizations I figured jumping into this one would be easy but nope had a lot of new things to learn about this edition and version of the game franchise. While I did get all of the add on packs for it I think more could have been in them and the game in the way or races, battle strageties and even seeing the take over ground battles on the planets like the intro video shows. It's a turn based game with little live action or cut scene videos that is basicly an upgrade to all of the old versions of the game. I'm not a huge fan of Multiplayer on-line gaming so playing it single player the AI's are predictable over time in attitudes and intent and easy to figure out who you can be friends with and who will always end up and enemy. If you do not create on your own new verion builds of ships as you gain the tech in reaserch all of your ships become obsolite and quickly end up defeated with the AI's increasing abilities. While I have been a firm suporter and owner of StarDock games this is the last version of this Title I will invest in. If I had never owned or played the older ones I would be fine so first time owners and buyers chances are you will enjoy it if you are not a live action game fan and more a strategest.			"

								It's getting there. Frustrating during first few patches with key features missing, labeled as a beta but played more like an alpha for a month or two. Recent patches greatly improve gameplay though, definitly looking like its gonna be worth a shot, especially if someone can convince them to allow user control of ship targets in combat (yaya its not a space sim, but seriously dont make me just watch the dumbfounded captains of my ships fly right past their target without firing a shot then wheel around and start firing at them from behind... all while taking fire...).

								I've got a ton of hours on both Gal Civ II and Gal Civ III.  I'm a sucker for the 'Just 1 more turn' core loop.  The beta has played solid on my 3 year old machine.  It would play much better if I had more than 8 GB of RAM.  I love the huge maps and that doesn't make it easy for my old box.  As a stats-watcher from II, its been a struggle to adapt to playing III without having all the charts and graphs.  Each update is a step forward, but I've got to slow down a bit or I'll be burned out before the full version launches.  After 100+ hours, I'm always looking for the next update!			"

												Wow, I really love this game.  There's no tutorial (that I could find) so it was a little confusing at first, but there a lot of familiar concepts that are in other games like Civ 5 so it wasn't that hard to figure out.  Overall I really loved the feel of the game and it's pretty solid and polished for a beta.  Glad I bought it and I look forward to see the new stuff coming in future beta updates.Update: There's a tutorial now which definitely helps hit the ground running, but it still helps if you're already familiar with similar concepts in other Civ type games.

												Do you have good enough friends to waste several months in one multiplayer match with?Then it's your lucky day, since best spreadsheet space emperor simulator finally got multiplayer! There's a chance that you will need all computer power in the world to calculate AI turns if you're playing on biggest map option several days in, but space emperors must be patient, for there's whole hexagonal galaxy to explore! Full of intelligent lumps of Christmas lights and bloodthirsty Space Squirrels, of course.Just keep an eye over your survey ship, if it's brave captain decides to SURVEY A MOTHERFLIPPING WORMHOLE, it will take years for this ship to get back, their families will be long dead by that time and, most importantly, you will play through early game without anomaly bonuses.Ever had a feeling that you will only play ONE MORE TURN before going to sleep? And then you realize you grew a beard and missed your daughter's funeral? That's exactly what's gonna happen if you get too sloppy! In Galactic Civilizations 2 i played until  there would be either too much fleets to control every turn without overloading my brain or until i run out of RAM and won't be able to save anymore. It may be VERY specific kind of fun for VERY special autists players, but it's basically like Pringle's: you'll eat all of them even if you have whole warehouse full of these lumps of cancer.There's traditionally not much fun in war and invasion, mainly because instead of controlling ships directly (god, i miss hijacking Antares ships in Orion 2 so much) we're getting pew-pew-laserbeams-sound-in-space-flying-bricks viewer, and so far it seems to miss really fun mathematics Endless Space had in that field (meaning a solid bunch of ship builds and fleet combinations to play around in multiplayer), but even if war mechanics aren't really top notch, AI in this game, that is probably much smarter than general public of this greenish-blue ball we live on, won't let you get bored.One of the trademarks of Galactic Civilizations series is that AI is a DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK. On high enough difficulties they will try to turn absolutely any situation to their advantage. In previous game you could've spend weeks to annihilate powerful enemy which will later surrender to even more powerful enemy, giving them all their remaining worlds just to troll you (you can, of course, abuse savescam if it made you mad enough). Or long term ally will gradually build colonies around you to protect you from common enemy, and then they will ally to crush you because you had too much ascension crystals. On top difficulties you basically have no choice than abuse known loops in game mechanics to win. It will take time to understand how the whole deal works in long multiplayer matches, game after game of course, but it seems that there's not much diversity of playstyles to exist, even with multiple victory conditions.Overall improvements in planetary and empire management seems to be really solid, but adding connection bonuses to buildings without option to choose initial colony building seems strange. I can't also find tax slider anywhere. Well, Stardock promised to polish things and add stuff even after release, so they will probably tweak minor gameplay inconsistencies. I personally liked shipyards in space VERY MUCH.I still didn't fully dig enough into all mechanics and, frankly, didn't reach actual lategame there, which always turns into hell incarnate at some point, but so far, i give this game 50 000 shades of infrared out of 50 000.I miss helicopter jokes from old science robot tho.

												I'm a fan of the Galactic Civilizations series, however I feel this game steps backwards in a few areas. The shipyards, while a cool idea, can be annoying. If you don't have a fleet strong enough you can't defend your shipyard from aggression, so they made the shipyard overpowered in the early game which can be annoying if you have pirates right outside your doorstep. You also can't build starports on your home planet which is probably because you'd have a planet building two ships at once. But all you need to do is make it so that a planet with a starport can't build ships at shipyards. The fact that you can't build starports on planets is contradictory to the campaign where Earth built a massive armada at the height where planes fly without a shipyard. The last negative is the campaign. While this game's main draw is the singleplayer sandbox, the campaign deserves the same attention the gal civ 2 campaign got. There's three missions, 2 cutscenes (the first one being the best part of the campaign) and some nice dialogue. I beat the campaign in two days. I won't spoil the end, but trust me it's not worth it. Also it doesn't explain the rest of the story, which I was hoping for. I was also hoping Stardock would explain how the Iridium Corporation came to be in game. That way you wouldn't have to search for it on the website. But at the end of the day it's all about the money and I think Stardock is going to release a dlc and force it's customers to pay to complete the story. I was really hoping Stardock wouldn't stoop to that level. As for the rest of the game I think it's a fantastic game. I wished they still had those mega events from gal civ 2 because as far as I know there are none. Final Verdict is 7/10, mostly because the story was very disappointing and the shipyards oh god the shipyards. However I do recommend the game for 4x fans.			"

												I do like a good 4Xing from time to time, and when I do, Galactic Civilisations 3 (GC3) fills that hole for me. This is important because I have the following options to satiate my need for space empiring: Endless Space, Sins of a Solar Empire: Revellion and Homeworld. If I had to choose between the 3, I would choose GC3, followed by Endless Space.My main gripe with GC3 is the lack of species to choose from. I feel like the devs spent this time on developing and integrating modding tools into the game to allow anyone to create their own civs very easily. Creating your own civ involves having some artwork, selecting/creating some ship designs, writing some fiction and ultimately filling in survey with a lot of tickboxes to determine the AI's behaviour and the advantages of the species - and perhaps because of how easy they've made it, I find it irritating that they couldn't have added many many more species. There are around 5 species in the vanilla version. I think the mercenaries DLC adds two species.The range of ships also suffers from a lack of content but not to the same level - I am less upset about this however as the ship editor is excellent and there are some modders who have created impressive forgeries of licensed ships such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Games Workshop and BattleStar Galactica. Civilisations from these licenses are also available but this content is far less impressive and none of it comes close to the quality of vanilla content.Galactic Civilizations 3 is pretty good as far as 4X space games go. However it's more akin to games like Civilization 5, Age of Wonders and Endless Legend then it is to other space 4X games like Endless Space and Space Empires. This is not necessarily a bad thing however, and as the quality of what is there is so high I end up playing GC3 over it's competitors anyway.Overall I would recommend the game at 20 NZD which is ~ 30 USD.

It looks the same, plays the same, research is the same. Maybe the campaign is different but who plays that anyway? Its all about the custom game. I would only recommend this game to new comers when its on budget as it could be disappointing on first look, it takes hard hard work to become compentent at this game.			"

												Not only did I want to like this game, I TRIED, I REALLY REALLY tried to like it. I love Stardock and Sins of a Solar Empire is one of my favorite 4X games so I tried to give it a good shot. GL3 is one of the only games where I've tried to slog through the tedium, poor mechanics and bland unoriginality in the hopes that I was just missing something and this was actually a great game. Alas, after trying the campaign, tutorial and a straight forward, no strings attached game... I resigned myself to the fact that this game is just a really boring rip off of Civilization IV with worse AI.Okay, the ship and race creation aspect is pretty cool, but it's basically aesthetic and adds little to the game overall. And in fairness they've also copied a few aspects from Civ V as well, like trade routes and city states. The only really original aspects of the game are space stations, which the computer pumps out constantly and will completely cover the map before you've advanced enough to stop them. Even if you're tearing them down with impunity, the computer can churn them out just as quickly as you can blow them up. The reason for this is that the AI is so diabolically bad that the devs have bolstered it with a series of cheats to stop AI races destroying themselves before the game even starts - like attaching robotic legs to a horse that died in the paddock so it can still run in the race. But they're not fooling anyone.Apart from that, I was honestly having flash backs to a game released 10 years ago: diplomacy is identical to Civ IV, right down to the other races constantly nagging you for hand outs. Combat and troop types are similar, despite the ability to watch a little battle cinematic, and entirely pointless once you get to Corvettes anyway. The biggest difference in combat is that you have to send a troop transport to capture a planet, but then Birth of the Federation was doing that 17 years ago, so again it's hardly a game changer. The split tech tree struck me as a simplified version of Beyond Earth's. The worst part is, I could actually forgive them for ripping off all their game mechanics from other franchises if it weren't for the fact that this game is just slow and boring. One of the great things about the Civ series is that, even when you're not doing a lot, you're always working towards something - you have a plan, or a series of goals or you're keeping your eye on a possible opportunity or building up to something. GC3 is mostly just a load of empty nothingness - habitable planets and resources are far between, conquest is too slow to be effective, economics yo-yo wildly with little discernible reason... It's just sloppy.My overall impression is of a game made half-heartedly with the intention of copying a couple of successful 4X titles in the hopes of making some easy money. Stardock - I'm disappointed.			"

												I purloined this in a Humble sale - which is the only reason for actually getting GalCiv III, I wouldn't purchase it independently - I have looked it over in the past as 4X and Space are definitely my 'hing. Like Stellaris, Endless Space, StarDrive and Sins of a Solar Empire. It's similar but has enough unique things to keep it notably distinct.After the basic tut I jumped into a large match and over the course of my 12 hour game I figured things out for myself. I wouldn't say I'm addicted but it's been the only title I've played for the past week but I'm sure the novelty will wear off soon as it does with all games - enjoyed it none the less, and I'm expecting the new DLC/Xpac?On that subject, I think the reason GalCiv III got shafted is because the DLC aren't really DLC, they are major game components that should have been in the game first. After looking through the options I actually seperately purchased the DLC that was worth having (Precursor, Snathi, Mercenaries (Questionable) and ignored the rest which all had scathing reviews).At face value I did turn my nose up at Gal Civ III but after being enticed by a good Humble Bundle, I've found myself enjoying this title a lot even in spite of it's faults and marketing practises, even so far as to buying DLC. So if you can find this game on the cheap like I did and you like the genre, snag it. At worst you won't be terribly disapppointed but at best it won't dazzle you either.			"

												I am writing this review after playing through the game a couple of times, rather than after a limited amount of game play. Overall this is a simple strategy game which is easy to play however it has a number of flaws.  Firstly you have no tactical control over battles which I found increasingly annoying.  Secondly if you build a large empire you wind up with a miserable population as there is a massive penalty for having a large empire and no matter how many approval boosting buildings will overcome this.  Equally if you have a large empire winning by conquest is very easy as the other empires aren't large enough to oppose you. The introductory graphics seem to suggest large fleets and this is simply not possible.  I tend to find I have Capital ships facing a few small ships and it's then like dropping bombs into barrels of fish so easy victories.  If these issues can be addressed it would be a decent strategy game but as it stands not recommended			"

												GalCiv II was a stand up game, it's devolper embraced a business model that really rewarded loyal fans. They've since destroyed that reputuation. Fallen Empires or whatever they called it was a bug filled mess barely fixed years after, then pumped full of so much DLC you felt dirty opening it's steam page. Galciv3 I thought a chance to return to their former glory, but no, again DLC nightmare that makes the Total War franchise look giving. The game is half missing, with features available in other 4x games not present, maybe a 10 dollar DLC will have those, or maybe it will be 3-5 10 dollar DLC's doubling the price of the game to maybe complete it.

												I really wanted to like this game.The lack of ability to control combat is a major missing feature.If you have a bunch of ships set to move long distances over multiple turns, you can't hit a key and have them all move without ending your turn. This causes a micromanagement nightmare even on small maps, and is also the only game of this type I know of missing that function.The ""coercion"" penalty is complete nonsense- totally unrealistic and un necessary.Sometimes when you watch the battles if you win, you actually lose when you return to the map, and vice versa.Some of the events are really stupid, like: If you have an AI you can't reach because it's out of your range and it declares war on you, and won't even talk to it eventually you get this stupid 'robot ships are attacking any player at war' event the computer spawns a bunch of super powerful ships that run around destroying every ship stationed at all your planets.

												A lot of people complaining about bugs. When I first got the game there were loads. I used the opt-in feature to download the test patch and the majority of things were fixed.Gameplay is great fun, lots of factions to play, waiting for other unexperienced players in multiplayer is boring though, but expected. Singler player is excellent.Campaign, far too short. Completed it in about 2 1/2 hours. Cut scenes not bad, could be a bit more to them though in terms of length.The ""view battle"" option is fantastic, you really get to see your ships fight, and they fight exactly how you've done the research. I actually think TOO MUCH effort was put in to this part, because you rarely watch them after a while and just hit quick battle.The ship designer. Again, awesome, but more time spent bug fixing than adding the masses of features a lot of people will skim over was poorly prioritised.Still a few crashes here and there when attacking planets, but it auto-saves every few turns. It's clearly had a lot of effort put in and the team are evidently working hard to fix any problems.I'd say the game is priced £5 higher than I would pay for it with the bugs. But should they iron it out it's well worth it.			"

												Okay it is a good game.  Let me give you a few details though.Custom Races are really neat.DO NOT PLAY an insane sized map.  When it gets big, it becomes unplayable.Combat is always auto-resolve.  This is more than just random numbers though, it is actually intricate.  Unfortunately you don't participate.The Tech Tree is designed to make it so you can go a lot of different directs and still be viable.  It is very bland as a result, and there are no descriptions containing flavor text.Planetary development favors specialization, but doesn't punish diversity (to much).Unfortunately...Invasions can be tedious.Planet Development can be tedious.Large numbers of ships can be tedious to control.You can have a ""Planetary Governor"" auto-build you planet buildings.  Which by the end of the game is like basic telling the A.I. to do everything.It sort of feels like the game was made for the A.I. to play the A.I.Basically if you love the micromanagement of Civilization 2, and enjoy an incredibly ""Accounting"" heavy game this is a great game.  It is not Civilization 5 though.			"

												This is the third time I've changed my review.  This time it's from a recommend to a a not recommend.I had faith that Stardock would fix the many issues with the game, but come expansion pack 1 and so many issues have yet to be sorted out.  Rather than holding onto hope you have to just look at the reality of the situation.  Stardock has also pretty much stated that they are pushing any meaningful changes to the game into a standalone expansion next year.I have put a lot of hours into the game, though 3/4 was during the beta and most of that spent in the ship designer.  It is my favourite feature, but even that gets boring.  It also hasn't seen any love since early beta, though to be fair the game had a lot more issues to deal with and intended features that we are stil waiting for.  The point is I haven't spent much time playing the game as it were.  The fact I have been able to or bothered to finish a sandbox game (and I don't play on particularly large maps) since launch is not a great sign.Things might turn around in the next year.  Maybe bug fixes and DLC will make me change my mind (again).  We'll see.However, the 4X genre is an exciting one at the moment with the new MoO, Endless Space 2, Stellaris, Polaris Sector, etc all on the horizon.  At one time I thought GC3 might be able to offer a bit of competition to them.  I no longer do.  Therefore it might be better if instead of paying US$50 for this to wait for one of the other games to come out.  Though maybe just keep an eye on GC3 for the standalone expansion due for 2017.  Maybe it can bring the magic back to the franchise.			"

YouTube™ Video: Galactic Civilizations III Impressions and Summary 

			Views: 1,020		

			The Commissar gives his impressions of the fully released, Galactic Civilizations III and gives a few tips and tricks along the way.		

I've always been a big 4X fan. Ever since I was introduced to this series with GalCiv II, I've been a fan. Quite simply, these are the Sid Meier's Civilization games, just in space and stretching over a massive hostile universe and incredibly worthy of the ""just... one... more... turn"" phrase. From epic ship design customization, aliens who are complete♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and randomly seeded galaxies just begging to be conquered, Galactic Civilizations III is the successor I've been waiting for. While some may note the lack of major differences between the older games and this one, trust me, that's actually not a bad thing. Improved graphics, tweaked game mechanics, this is actually the best game in the series from what I've experienced so far. Now forgive me, I've got a galaxy to conquer.			"

												This is a good game. I haven't been able to get addicted (yay addiction!) to a space 4x game since Endless Space and I do miss a few things about that game. But Gal Civ 3 improves on every aspect of it's predecessor. I'm not one for writing long reviews, in fact I almost never write them at all, but I'm really tired and this little window poped up on steam asking me how I liked the game so here I am. Anyway 4/5 for this one.			"

												Excellent game, though it does have a few issues, I'm confident Stardock will iron them out. I've only briefly looked at the campaign, mostly just setting up galaxies to fight over, but I'm enjoying it a lot. A lot of crashing, but that's probably my computer (which just meets the minimum requirements). If you enjoyed the previous Galactic Civilizations games or the Civilization series, this game is probably right up your alley.			"

												To be fair, GalCiv III had some isses at the start as most games do these days unfortunately.  It has progressed though, through a steady stream of updates and DLC's.  As it is now, I think it is pretty good.  There is nothing that really sets it apart from its predecessor really aside from better graphics, and a few minor updates.  Its a safe bet if you like II. As a side note, I did buy Stellaris, and decided to shelve that until it gets updated after playing a couple of games.  I came back to GalCiv III after a long break, and I am currently enjoying it. 8/10			"

												I've played some good games, and I've played some incredibly disappointing games. This is somehow both. This is also the first review I've ever felt inclined to write.This game is like Civilization, Eve Online and the board game Twilight Imperium all rolled into one. Sounds like an awesome game. But a lot of the features feel largely incomplete. There are a lot of balance issues, and things like tourism and other money making things seem like they haven't really been fleshed out. Money seems almost superfluous. All great ideas, but even a rudimentary economy needs more attention than these have been given.Early on in a level, my capital and starting planet have some level of importance. I care about what structures I build. But as the game winds on, planets and resources and even my territory and units just seem so pointless. Maybe it's the lackluster battles involving an oddly large amount of micromanagement to prepare for, but no real control. Maybe it's the constant spelling and grammar errors. Like, I'm the kind of person that notices spelling and grammar errors in basically every game I've ever played for the past 20 years. But this was insane. And the stakes just seem so low when the game feels so unfinished. Awesome concept, and there is definitely a game somewhere in there! But this is not a finished game. This is what we come to expect from these pre-released games. Everyone buys into it, and they try to make these deadlines, but they've mostly moved on to the next project. Again, I look forward to future updates, and I will keep my eye on this game. But as it stands, I don't feel it was worth my money, and it does not feel like the ""V1.0"" that the reputable companies of yesteryear would have produced. Hopefully that changes, because there are some really great games out there that rely on pre release funding, and if you don't finish your game, you bring the whole medium down a peg.			"

												Fun until you encounter anything else. Then the computer instantly reduces your entire civilation to rubble. The computer also likes to focus only on you, while even warlike undiplomatic races will set up trade routes with hated enemies and then attack you. The computer also knows exactly where all colonizable planets are, so that by the time you discover them they've grown their influence to the point where you are unable to cope. They then insult you. All the while, their economy is in the tank at -200, but here it comes with full fleets of ships to decimate your border colonies in order to pave the way for their capital ships they can still deploy despite not having the income to do so.And that's just on easy difficulty.

												Galactic Civilizations III is a great game, containing a mix of familiar mechanics and new ideas that can keep both fans and newcomers occupied for a frighteningly long period of time.The best thing about the new Stardock-created turn-based experience is that it is so customizable, and the experience of playing in the resulting galaxies creates stories that are consistently fun and filled with surprises.I'm currently having fun with the workshop mods for this game as well,  I recently added some Mass Effect and Star Wars characters and ships to the game and the fit in so well in the game that you can barely notice they don't belong.

												Having been a big fan of the Galactic Civilizations 1 and 2 franchise, I had high expectations for the third rendition of this exciting 4x platform strategy game and I was not to be disappointed. This game is a big improvement over an already great Galactic Civilizations 2 game that I spent countless hours playing in the past, somewhat to the detriment of my chess game. Galactic Civilizations 3 is a great choice for those who like a thrilling diversion form the real world. However, to win you will need to develop accurate strategic planning in multiple dimensions such as planetary economics, galactic diplomacy, research, social and military construction. This game is well worth the regular price which I eagerly paid and is a steal if you can get it on sale.			"

								this game is or more will be great i have enjoyed what i have been able to play which is my first complaint but ill get to that later. honestly i cant wait for it to be done as it rivals many games out there with what you can do; there is a very fun and kinda finicky ship builder function that really is my favourite feature of this game,  of what i have been able to play the different galaxy types and sizes are serious matters as to how you buld yourself. HOWEVER this game is still a BETA and as such has problems mostly being that it crashes........a lot actually i havent had a single game where ive even met an ai which normally would be something of a topic for any bdy wether you are thnking of getting it or already have it or what have you i have yet to make contact and as such cant say a thing.i feel that if i had played either GC1 or GC2 i might have gotten more out of te story and what i hope to be the rich background behind each of te factions/races/whatnot i still felt that each one was unique and that they all have thyre own stuff in the ship builder(props to them that must have been really painstakingly boring/time consuming).all in all its fun but its a beta5/10 for now (mostly due to the crashes and lack of content)but i hope / expect that to go up to either 8 or 9 out of 10 thanks for the great game PLEASE UPDATE MORE XD			"

								I like the game but found there to be too many bugs to be enjoyable. I created a ship using the Ship Designer and it worked fine (at first) then I created another ship spending 45minutes getting it just the way I like it. I went to save the ship as a template so that I could change the loadout on it when the game saved the file as my original design! I lost all that work that I put into the ship and will never see it again! This is the frustrating part of playing a beta, the bugs are frustrating. I have since tried to make several quick test ships and they all have the same problem, they all save as the first ships design. When I highlight the template to try and delete it the game crashes. I like the concept, but wish I had waited for the full release. I cant at this time recommend this game until the bugs are worked out and all the functions are functioning.*UPDATE* My game, much to my surprise has miraculously made a full recovery. I did nothing but log in one day just to see if I could correct the issue and found that the issue has corrected itself! With Crashgate behind me and a good 20hrs sunk into this game, I can now reccomend it. However, there is a caveat attatched, your individual results may vary when playing this game and you could grow to have a love hate relationship with it (in Beta). That said, I do like the game when working properly, AI is weak but that is common knowledge and the game could do with some better dialogue but all in all a very enjoyable experience when working properly.I would like to see the diplomacy improved a bit though (probably already being worked on by the devs) but I just find it a little disconnected for example I'm at war with the Yor, and I open up diplomacy and they talk to me as if we're best friends and yet their status is furious. Things like that take away from the experience, but as I said the Devs are probably already on it.I would also like to encounter more random things in the galaxy like space born lifeforms etc just to give the game some more depth, suprise and intrigue. In it's current state when working properly I'd rate the game a 7.0 out of 10 and that is without a lot of the features in the game being active.			"

								The game is just great, even before complete release, and I've fallen for its grace, detail and especially the Ship Designer. Only thing I miss is for some of those Terran models that has a hangar door in it to be bent - I'd love to create circular shapes or hangar arms if possible. That is all I'd like to be added.The gameplay itself is fun enough, but limited due to it still being Beta - some things are however still in 'Alpha' - the AI for one. The planets are nicely detailed, if not a bit lacking in construction. A few more building slots would make it a little more fun and easy.The mechanics largely work as well, but saving any custom ships or save the game still does not work properly, and loading a game is impossible, since saving one is equally impossible. But it will be remedied later.In overall? I strongly recommend this game to GalCiv fans, and people that enjoy games similar to it - and especially to people that just love or even LIVE the game JUST to design custom ships - or redesign ships from other franchises. But when it comes to buying the game, I say it is up to you.Admittedly, given so many core mechanics and side-mechanics are still missing, I have to agree with Waddles the Pig; the game is still in alpha, or late alpha, mostly.That is about all I have to say, I think, and anything I've missed will likely be covered by someone else.I do however really hope that Stardock adds the ability to export and import our custom ship creations, either to use in a different game or in another Civilization, or give it to other players. A bit like mods, I guess - that would be sheer perfection! Ship-sharing!This is DanRagr47, signing off! Have a good one!			"

								This is a review/bug report so far as of 12/14/14 in early accessBugs that i encountered so far.--sound bug was common, when several things are heppening that would involve windows and decisions, the sound would cut out. occasionally would come back after the same thing that caused it would happen, windows switching and all. otherwise i would have to save game and re-launch-when ships are stacked, it can get a little tedious trying to manage them, they get stubborn and wont move for that turn so you have to pass, extremely tedious to upgrade ships in a fleet, as you have to eject ship from fleet, then move it into a different location as the fleet, then upgrade it. and if you have 20 ships to upgrade, this can take some time.-what does ""guard"" option even do?-at around 650-700 turns in a huge map, after pushing end turn, it got stuck on the AI move. tried to save and re-launch and the game crashes if i load that particular savethose are all the bugs i really encountered so farReviewi will say that i am newer to turn-based strategy, RTS was my usual thing but cant compete in turms of management since your mouse cant move fast enough in an RTSi wont do a pros and cons list since cons will be useless to an early access game of this sort. but i will list a few observations that could maybe be worked on.-as stated above, the upgrading of multiple ships is a little too tedious at the moment-i really like how simple the gameplay is in such a complex game, its like they got the perfect balance, unlike ""distant worlds"" where you are scrambling to learn and keep up with what the hell you are looking at, this takes hours to really get into it as opposed to weeks in the game ""distant worlds""-its hard to keep up with the AI in the warfare side of things since they seem to not have any fog of war. (such as the moment you build a station, even though there are no ships in the area, they know, and will have it destroyed before you can even buy a fleet enough to defend it from 6 moved away)-AI does not yet use resources much. i would like to fight over those rather then blitz their planets-easier to use influence to win a war and completely oust a race than to do it by military, too easy.-its hard to tell what is the for sure reason for happiness drop on a planet. and too easy to keep your planets happy, at least for me-i would like to see some more things affect diplomacythats all i can think of for now but will add or take away as the game evolves...its an awesome game even like 70% or whatever it is finished... i cant wait to see it on full release. buy it now, buy it later, you wont be disappointed in the end.

								This game has great potential. If you were a fan of Gal Civ II or even remotely interested in space 4X games you won't be disappointed. Gal Civ series has a reputation for great AI and so far this version doesn't disappoint. Gal Civ II was a great game and this one only improves on it. Graphics are ten times better to boot. Don't be turned off by some of the potential negative reviews this game has gotten so far as they are typically based on early betas which are understandably prone to bugs.

												With the sale at the same $10-$15 GET IT NOW.  If you likes GalCiv 2 then you'll like GalCiv3.  Not much has changed other than the graphics which are massively updated, the map size is now mind bogglingly huge and the modding is fantastic.  Building on planets is far more tactical now as adjacency matters big time.  The battles however fall short of the huge ones youre used to in GalCiv2, and the AI seems dumb as hell sometimes.  Make sure you turn off conquest as a victory condition otherwise every game seems to be a rush to invade and ignore all the other techs.  Military starbases seem utterly useless as all they do is slow enemy travel unless they decide to attack it directly.  Economic starbases are the way forward with the ability to put 5 or 6 per planet for HUGE boosts in industry.Get it on sale, as I paid nearly $75 for it plus all the DLC and I dont think it's worth that price.  But overall I would recommend if you enjoyed GalCiv2.			"

												The freedom in this game is great. If you like sandbox strategies and space exploration, this is a goody for you. If you like Civilizations V or VI, this is rather familiar in a way. The galaxy, ships, and factions are all customizable. Granted you can't control the combat directly, but it does give you a break from micromanagement and makes things easier on processing the game. A lot of people who play this mention the AI being rigged, they aren't. However, the game is rather difficult to learn on your own. Ask a friend who played it successfully, watch some YouTube tutorials, and practice some in easy games.A tip for customizing a faction: Pictures for backgrounds and foregrounds should be 1920 x 1080 and you can put them in the appropriate folders in the game files. Lets you equip those. Custom emblems and leader portraits need to be 128 x 128. Make sure to save any custom pictures or pictures off of the internet as a PNG.			"

It has gone to 64 bit addressing, which allows a vast improvement in scalability. Now, even larger galaxy sizes are possible, more AI opponents can be played, more stars, more planets, more ships and ship designs, more -- well, just more everything.			"

												Unless you're playing this game in mulitplayer, this is, in my opinion, simply not worth it. You can choose to either have to AI be complete utter idiots who don't know how to play or be idiots who get huge bonuses to provide artificial challenge. Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with this, and have sometimes relished it in other games. However, the scaling makes it basically impossible to do here, and the fact that the bonuses are only ever making up for the AI being completely useless when it doesn't have bonuses make this hollow. If the AI stood up by itself this would be fine, but it doesn't. The single player AI is one the most important aspects of any strategy game, particularly large scale like this where playing with friends is not really reasonable in standard circumstances. It is inexcusably weak, and ruins and otherwise good game.			"

												[Initially Posted Review, with ""Not Recommended"" conclusion:] I kept telling myself I wasn't going to write a review until I'd finished my first game, but it's gotten ridiculous. I'm theoretically within a few turns of winning, but the damned game won't stay up even for a full turn.  I'm wasting hours restarting from save, advancing, saving in mid-turn, watching the program crash to desktop or just lock up in a deadlock or infinite loop (mouse pointer moves, but game just consumes CPU without responding to anything).  Kill with Task Manager and repeat...There are some good ideas in the game, as well as some profoundly bad ones - ONE trade deal every 20 turns? THAT'S idiotic - but the software engineering is shockingly bad for a paid, commercial product.[Edit:  I finished that game, deleted all content from my system, and re-installed, and after ~4 hours of play, I've yet to see another freeze or crash.  I suspect that my problem - and perhaps that of some other players - is that the beta and upgrade installation system didn't work quite right. I'd tried most remedies short of a full reinstall, but had invested enough time in the game where I was damned if I was going to throw it away and start over with each update. I might actually recommend this game now.]			"

								After all the features in Stardrive this games seems really simplistic and outdated.Early Access Game so ballance issues like Beam weapons > all and Production/Food > all can be ignored.... but make the game very dull as you only every build 2 structures and space combat is instantanious and one sided.Ship design tool is interesting but in practice its just cosmetic and in most cases the module selection is game breaking.eg 1 ship left docked with 30x sensors installed Covers the map and makes scouts and sensor modules/tech obsolite.There is no upside to using the ship design tool, you can make a box and put all the guns on top of each other and the ship performs as well as any other ship.

								If any one is on the fence getting this game let me help you out a bit. You dont need to play the other two to enjoy this and understand what is happening. Its turn based so every decision you make, how you spend your money, what you build, when you do things, what you research, could make or break you. This game is crazy addciting as its more like a long game of risk. Its a good sit down relax and kill some time type of  game. your not up against a clock so you can sit and plan make your decision and see what happends when you hit the turn button. The graphics are top notch. If you have or played any of the others this is far better in every way! I almost have 300hrs in the short time I have had this game already passing up how many hours I played on GalCiv2. All of those hours have only been played on one race. That just tells you how much content they put into each and every race. This is the kind of game that you will never run out of strategies to try or new ways to play. This game has far more content than any game out and could keep you busy indefinatly. Yes this game does crash ever once in a while. but honestly when it does I usually realized after 4-6 hours I need to take a break anyways haha! If you get it you will enjoy it!			"

												Fairly poor 4x game.Racial abilities have little impact because almost everything is based on %. For example, a basic factory building might be 40% production bonus and take a few turns to build, or can be bought with starting cash. The strongest racial production bonus is also of the same order (around 25% as I recall), but only for either ships or buildings. So its basically worthless. Same exact issue with both space stations and planetary modifiers to production, science etc. All are % based, and largely meaningless compared to a few low-tier cheap building.This problem is all over the place in the core mechanics. Overly simplistic to the point of hurting the simulation.It very much feels like they have missed the point that fun games arent perfectly balanced. A lot of the most famous games of this genre were famous because they had unbalanced, and fun tricks the players could learn. Not that this game has perfect balance, but it sure seems to try to keep all choices when setting up a game as boring as possible, to ensure you cant do anything fun.Oh, and lets not forget the nickel and diming they have fully embraced by cutting out content that was in the previous game, and adding it as DLC released a month after the game. Stardock used to be different in a good way. Mind you, I havnt played the games they made since galciv2, so maybe I just have rose-tinted glasses and high expectations. "

								So I have been playing this beta for a while now and at some points its been fun other points its just been downright stressful.

My space docks take 100s of turns to make ships and the same with tech but I would not mind as long as if when you chose to play on easy, the other team grabs 90% of the galaxy and you are stuck in the corner. please dumb the enemies down a little or add some kind of tutorial cause this ism insane but even through all that, I know when this game comes out it will be great so keep up the updates and I will keep playing.

												Written on 12/16/2015The latest update was the update we should have had at launch, but hey, at least they didn't pull a Brave New World on us and gave it to us for freeFirst of all, the AI has finally been improved to the point where they will try to adapt to fight you, along with building proper ships to meet whatever challenge they encounter. Along with that, they also properly build up and specialize planets, making them much more powerful than they once more.Second, we see the return of the planet wheel, but only after you construct a special building. This is a really nice touch seeing how early access to the wheel can lead to extreme abuse.Lastly, the game is properly optimized. The game runs smoothly for me on my somewhat old laptop, only long thing is the load times for loading games.TL;DR, this update really makes the game worth it.			"

Early Access Review
								     I have loved the entire game series, but this gam is definitely still in it's development stages. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A FULL GAME! This game is missing a bunch of its features, such as about half of its match customizations, the fleets are glitchy, planets are still a bit hard to manage, and the research screen's UI seems a bit off to me.     This being said, I still love it. As I already said, I have played and been entranced with GalCiv 1 and 2, Dread Lords was awesome! There are many features that are missing, but there are still enough to have a good time. The ship builder is going to be the best one out of the series when completed, no doubt about it. There are already several races to be played, as well as units. Finally, I will recommend this game to everyone who likes Turn Based Strategy games.      So I will see you on the galactic battlefield!			"

A great game for those who have the timeAfter I got tired of Civ 5 I decided to give this game a try.Honestly, at first I didn't understand how anything worked, it took me a couple of tutorials to figure out how to properly run your worlds.Overall the game is really enjoyable, especially the ship designer is a great feature.I really like designing a spacecraft and seeing it perform in battle, it's a shame that you can't take direct control over ships, that would have made this game epic.If you are looking for a fun game that's different every time you play it, this might be the game for you, just keep in mind that it'll take up a lot of your time.

												There are many improvements in Galactic Civilazations III over the previous version.  The ship designer is much improved.  The research tree has been redesigned to be more intuitive.  The game now lets you play on bigger map than ever before.  But there is one thing about the game that I personally find to be a great disappointment.  In Gal. Civ. II the crew of your ship would gain XP with every battle and would gain levels through XP.  And as they gained levels the ships and fleets would gain HP.  This concept has been dropped in Gal. Civ III.  Because of this one thing alone I have yet to make up my mind whether I prefer Gal Civ II or III.  and I am not ready to recommend the game to my friends.			"

												Gal Civ III is an excellent Space 4X game, and I'm enjoying playing it a lot, but it's still a bit 'wobbly'.  It's underlying systems are good, but it has a few too many bugs for me to be comfortable with and some of the balancing is still not quite worked out (although that's an ongoing issue with strategy games these days, which often have 'continuous development', which also means 'continuous rebalancing'.  It's improving with every patch, though, and have no doubt that it'll go from 'good 4X' to '4X classic'by the time Stardock are done with it.  I definitely recommend it to fans of 4X games, and particulary 4X in space, but also recommend being ready for a few bugs as you play it.			"

Early Access Review
								Essentially, it's Civ in space. Though its roots are closer to Master of Orion. I've played versions 1, 2 and now 3. as the game proresses, they've been advancing it, with a concept of ideology which reminds me a lot of Civ V's social policies. In GalCiv 2, you could play any race, and build your ships, and they added the Master of orion-like end-game. So far, it's still early in Gal Civ3. Nothing amazing, yet. It feels like Gal Civ2, with minor additions. But, new art, higher res graphics, really refresh this classic.Today, the game gets stuck periodically waiting on AI turns and can crash occassionally. Also, the UI doesn't inform you of game mechanics and bonuses as well as Civ V. Still, it's coming along nicely but has a ways to go until done.			"

												Its been a long time since I played this game. I burned out on it and needed time away from it. As a founder I got DLC's, added to my downloads. I dabbled in the behemonth Terran return and it was a blast to use precurser tech destroying the Dregin threat. So now it was time to play again. I am playing the Terrans first voyage into space campaign. I have read many of the recent reviews and their comments. Some I will address with my spin of the game and I will also address areas of the game I feel are strange to me.First the diversifications of the races not being apparent. The best advice I can give you is make a couple of custom races before you even pay your first game. Make your own warrior race, or trade race or fanatic race, look at the pluses and minuses. these numbers show the matrix of the race, that the AI will use to run it. these numbers are subtle but can steamroller you in the actual game if you dont know what they mean. When you meet a race in the actual game immediately go to the diplomacy screen and read up on the race and his key traits, also what he thinks of you good or bad and how untrusting or trusting it is to you.what is your races strength, the Terrans diplomacy helped me and I have not been attacked or fired a shot and my game is now in the accension phase of the game. it has been very tricky to balance out the races opinions of the Terrans, I came close to war many times. but a gift of some extra credits here and there a trade route established at a critical time can avoid war. It is expensive to build a fleet to keep up with the Dregin or Alterion race, the global economics is quite robust and it works like a real world economy, a stream turns into a brook,turns into a river. do i do research or construction, do i do it system wide or planet wide. the difference in races those +1's and -1s now come into play. you should pick your race on your play style. the AI plays with those numbers. If you as a live player play as a terran you have to play the game using your diplomatic bonuses. Ripe for the picking can go up to i believe a minus 3 agrgession modifier I had to override it with 3 point of positive diplomacy. Early in the game hitting the diplomacy screen every turn and base your strategy of this information. This screen is your chessboard not the actual galaxy map. Now your planets these are your economy engines and can spin out of control without you even knowing it until long into the game, every decision you make on each of your planets is crutial to a robust economy or a bleeding economy. the AI plays its economy very efficient, again playing the race pluses and minuses to the max. If you decide to build ships you want to look at the opposing races ships and like in real life build your strengths to his weaknesses. if he uses beams you research shields, if he has no missle defence research missles. Each race picks a favorite and in the latter game you may have fleets made up to fight different races with your ships named that way. This means you must make custom ships, the Terrans core ships are to weak in many instances, you must make and outfit custom shipsAgain like the real world accurate intellegence and planning is key to this game. If you pick up this game and decide to play the Terrans or any other race without understanding them you will get steam rolled in the age of war. Meta gamers can break this game at this time. Many people have posted how so I will not go into detail.This game is very deep, and like I said a move you did 30 turns ago can mess you up in your whole future game if you dont monitor your cause and effect factor.Now some thing I feel need to be addressed.Star Docks: they never improve they can never hold their own in a fight, you can put a hefty starbase near them but only the AI will attack that starbase first a human player will just bypass all your starbases and go for your spacedock. I would like to see a stardock actually being part of a starbase. taking on the starbases protection.Starbases: I am using tons of starbases in my game, one thing I noticed is that no matter how many modules I put on the starbase, the base hitpoints never change, just the idea of the increase of mass brought about by the modules should increase the mass, making starbases being able to have possible thousands of hitpoints.Also I think that as a starbase takes damage modules go offline, so a damaged starbase is not as effective as a fully functioing one.also just like a space dock you should be able to move a starbase slowly to reposition it after placement.Planet panel: in GC2 you could see in the planet screen if your planet had a stardock orbiting it. I miss this feature, as you scroll through your planet screens you can lose track of your planets that have a stardock built by it.Ideology tree: To me is too powerful in certain areas, and as a general note can really hurt or help you in the early game.this game is not for everybody if you are a knee jerk game player , the so called cheating AI will run you over. If you like to take on the roll of the head of your race and like me review all your adversarries on a constant basis, add and revoke trade to increase or decrease influence with a race, dive deep into your planets economys, and balace them to your needs, start or stop and arms race, figure and reconfigure your fleets based on the lastest intellence on the aggressive races, this game is for you and that is just the tip of a very deep iceburg.I am not a fanboy nor do i work for the company in any way. I have play this game since early access when it barely did anything to the deep game it has become.I welcome any debate as to my opinion of this game.			"

												I hate to to say this but I personally do not recommend this game now even after the first expansion, I am a founder and started play testing the game in 2014. Hope the Devs fix the game soon. There are too many little things (I have a list of about 40) in Gal Civ 3 that needs to be fix but never gets fix unless you mod the game yourself. I will list a few.1. No manual placement of shipyards and colony capital. Capital can get stuck right in the middle of a high class planet. At least for the shipyard I can build a shipyard with a constructor.2. Can't launch ships from whatever direction you want from the shipyard. Sometimes it auto launch in an asteroid field slowing down movement. The upcoming 1.61 patch makes it so ships won't launch in asteroids anymore. In Gal Civ 2 you can pick what direction you want to launch ships from.3. The tech tree UI is out of date from 2006 Gal Civ 2. Even Endless Space had a tech web where you can zoom in and out on one screen with all the techs. ES had the ability to queue research but not in Gal Civ 3.The original Gal Civ 3 is worth 7.25 / 10 and with all the updates and newest expansion it is worth 7.75 / 10. Sometimes it just feels something is missing when playing Gal Civ 3, some features that were in Gal Civ 2 were remove in Gal Civ 3.			"

												The game is ok, the graphics are great, and the space battles are still fun. But overall it feels like a dummed down version of GC2, less content and less nuances to really have fun with. My personal beef, even though it is really small, is how planetary invasion works now. It is not even an animation anymore, just a pop-up window. when I saw the videos of GC3 with space troopers and space tanks fighting in ruins I was hoping for a little more depth than that. Overall I was disappointed not impressed with the game, so I cannot recommend it. Buy GC2 it was a better game.			"

												I enjoy space stuff, so this game was a natural fit for me, and I expected only one problem: getting drawn into it for hours on end.Instead however I've been presented with a different one: the 'Wait bug', where the button to pass the turn to the next player gets stuck on 'wait' indefinitely, is still alive and well.Saving often, especially after a turn where a lot of commands are issued, can be used as a work around, but if that's too much of an annoyance then skip purchasing this title.

								Great game!In the tradition of the studio it may start out a little under-polished at release (not released yet though, still in beta, so I could be wrong!!!), and goes from ""great"" to ""excellent"" after the first patch or two, with massive expansions and content updates loooong after release (oftentimes for free).  Galciv 3 is a worthy successor to Galciv 2 - one of the 4x greats of all time, and the studio (Stardock) remains true to its roots as a strikingly conscientious, responsive, and otherwise terrific producer of high quality innovative titles.Definitely worth your time, especially if 4x is your thing .

												I continue to be somewhat undecided about what really to think about this game. On one hand, the ""Just-one-more(100+)turn"" is insanely addictive, but the crashes - even on the smaller maps really is annoying. Pros:Game is - overall - quite good. Lots of hours of playing and re-playabilityQuite fun in multiplayerHas that 'little' Master of Orion 2 feel to it.Lots of galaxy to explore - wanting to find that next awesome planet.Cons:Multiplayer lobby has no options to make private games (ppl join left and right).Frequent crashes during ship design, on small, bigger and huge maps.AI is bland, lacks personality, not too bright.47 € for the game is quite a lump sum of money.Lacking some options for customizing the game: - when you want to save.Needs patching.      This review could be longer, truth is I've been playing this ""damn"" game all day long.Would I recommend this game? Probably.			"

Early Access Review
								I really love this game. It has great potential to be played for many of hours. Civ 5 is my alltime favorite and this game is very similiar with city management and not letting it get too complicated. The game still lags bad on my pc and occasionaly will freeze for about 5 mins so best to wait till launch before buying. But in all it is still very fun to play untill the maps and ship counts get so large the system bogs down, then i just tinker in the ship building for awhile. ship building without a tutorial is complicated so i hope that is something they will add at launch but i enjoy crudly pasting peices togethor to make something diffrent. So in short this game is good 7 out of 10 but could be my all time favorite TBS 4X game ever once the bugs and crashes get fixed. Good job everyone working on the game and keep up the good work.  P.S. i dont totally under stand how to post this to the discussions board but a usefull tip would be to add atleast an 1/8th of an inch gap to the rows in the tech menus. them being stacked just makes it fell like your choices are all simialar and being slightly seperated would help that.

												I usually always recommand stuff, finding a reason for me to like/love a game. I'm not the complicated type.Although, I was in madlove with GCII and I really enjoy playing GCIII, I have a few reasons that I hope you will not encounter if you ever buy the game. 1.  the A.I. is too predictable, and you usually can tell when you are about to be invaded or declared war upon in let's say 5 to 10 turns beforehand. Which isn't a terribly bad thing if the reason for the invasion weren't: lol scrub u only have 5 ships while i already have 89132589581927 in turn 5 git gud. 2. The game crashes around 6 times at launch before I'm able to play. Too bad all the fun got away in the meantime. Also, after every single crashes or after exiting the game, I always have to go into Task manager and kill every process that might be related to it otherwise everything goes crazy.3. I still think opting for a military approach is the way to go. Not to say the only way... But that might be me being UNSKILLED.4. Rip espionnage, rip tech trees. I'll still play the game, and I recommand to buy it on sale. But I'm still enjoying more GC2 than this one.Edit: Mistakes were made			"

												The initial ideas in this game are great. The 4X elements seem to have a lot more depth than the Civ series. However it's a bit of a mess. After install I had to mess around and do some research on why my menu screen had no text. Apparently it's a font issue. There's a read me in the program files that tells you what to do if you have this issue, so i guess it's something that's been there for a long time and was never properly fixed. Secondly the game loves to hang. You get a hang when you hit the turn button, a hang before combat, a hang before accessing planet management. It got worse over time to the point where it was practically unplayable. I'll revisit in a few patches.TL;DR: Love the ideas and the seeming depth. Game breaking bugs.			"

												I got GC III on the summer sale and so far it was really great. There's plenty of possibilities and I discover new aspects and strategies with every game I start. Here's some of the more interesting aspects about the game:Look at me - I'm a space race:You get to choose a civilization and go develop, expand, explore and conquer. Alternatively you can create your own species, which is a load of fun: Choose strenghts and weaknesses, splash screens and your leader's avatar, the look of your ships, the tech tree and some more things. I created Space Horses. Ahahahaha, their leader is actually a horse in a space suit. Anyway.Many a way to victory:The game comes with 6 ways to win the game: You can conquer all other races, you can bring 3/4 of the galaxy under your cultural influence, you can win by negotiating alliances with all other races - and there's still a couple more ways!That said, the easiest way to win is with war. The other ways take a rather long time, so expanding through warfare is the only way that feels like you're making progress. Diplomacy:What I really like is the possibility to trade technologies with other races. What I don't like is the limited influence you have of the diplomatic doings in the galaxy: Your allies will wage war against one another and you have no means at your disposal to stop them from doing that. Also it would have been nice if your allies automatically joined your side whenever an outside race declares war on you. Then what are alliances for anyway?Pimp my fleet:The possibilities for outfitting your fleet are endless. The arms and countermeasures follow a traditional rock-paper-scissors-scheme. But there are plenty more things you can stuff in a space ship hull: warfare tools, fleet range enhancers, repare modules, exploration modules...but there's more to the fleet editor!You can select your races ship hulls from a range of sets. But when designing a ship, you can model that ship almost freely, scale and rotate parts and so give every ship type a unique look of its own. If you are patient, this is an awesome tool that adds a lot of player individuality to the colourful world of GC III.One quick word about the workshop races: You can upload your race to the steam workshop of GC III for others to download. That is really cool and I addded a lot of workshop races to my game to make games with up to 36 (!) factions more interesting. Some people delivered some really cool races. Sadly, many players felt it necessary to add bewbs content. Dudes, you have the entire internet to your disposal and is densely plastered with pictures of bewbs! There's absolutely no need to add any to a steam workshop, so please please please keep that to yourself!All in all: Try this game, it's awesome! Also, bring some time with you, GC is not a game you play for just 10 minutes.			"

												Fun game with a huge amount of potential, but it still needs a lot of work. I've encountered a few nasty game-breaking bugs (with the worst one being unable to load your saved games, though the opt-in beta patch fixes this)and a bunch of balancing issues. Gameplay wise, there are a few things that bother me: -Diplomacy is somewhat lackluster, you can't really do anything aside from making trading deals (which also include alliances and the likes) with other factions. I really hope this will become better in the near future, as it - as advertised - should also be a diplomacy-heavy game.-No espionage.-Issues with the AI. The Drengin Empire seems to disregard upgrading its logistic capabilities, and thus can only field small fleets, even though their ships are pretty powerful. (but due to the lack of logistics are pretty easy to take down) I also noticed that other factions, until they are threatened by war or wishing to start one themselves, have little to no military ships. (and thus, make them easy targets for a military-heavy faction to conquer)- The game's a little too easy unless the difficulty is cranked up immensely. (which will give the AI handicap bonuses) - Planetary invasion feels weird and shallow.However, these are pretty much my only qualms. Apart from this, the game is absolutely fantastic and a real treat, and is in my opinion, the best 4x game on the market, (only contender would be Endless Space in my opinion) especially when you consider that the game shows a lot of potential to improve and expand in the near future!Final verdict: Avid fans of the genre will definetly enjoy it, those who are more skeptical, wait a few months until they flesh out the bugs and improve it a bit.

												Just not enough of a step up from Twilight of the Arnor for me to recommend this to others. Races feel much less distinct than they did in TotA, game ruining mega-events are still a big problem when you enable the feature (unless you actually enjoy spending 4-5 hours setting up a strategy only for a single pop-up window to make it completely inviable -- though, this is much less of a problem when playing conquest based playstyles), and the planet improvement system, while fundamentally not a bad idea, is extremely tedious to set up for a large number of planets. Finding information when you need it can be extremely annoying, and things can flip around without your notice between turns, leading you to make critical strategic mistakes for no other reason than you were unaware that a statistic changed because you didn't check your diplomacy menu every turn. I really, REALLY want to like this game. I loved Galciv 2 and probably have well over a thousand hours played on it lifetime across three different computers. But this game just isn't finished. Then there's things like making us PAY to use a map editor. That's just a huge insult to the people who looked forward to this title for years. I really though more of Stardock than that, but I guess I was wrong.			"

												Galactic civilizations 3 has implemented some really great features and the game has shown to have alot of potential.  Because of this potential galactic civlizations had the potential to become one of the greatest 4x games out there and all they had to do was improve on the neglected and bad stuff of galciv 2 because galciv 2 is still a great game.The game has some really great features  but is incredibly sloppy. The galactic world map feels like a mess and The ship icons on the map show barely any information. these are things that should have been improved upon because in a 4x game with the scale galciv has information is extremely important.One of the greatest changes i have seen from galciv 2 to 3 has been the ideology system. This system allowes for you to pick between 3 ideological  idea groups wich has its own unique perks and benefits. This system effects both colonization and diplomacy and helps diversify playthroughs. However this games diplomacy system is very lackluster and very barebones. Normally u would think a benevolent ai would choose to be very friendly and act like a general good guy but no matter their ideological path or relation to you they always talk about annihilating you, wich ofcourse is stupid and unimersive.Galactic civilizations offers arguably alot more hours of content and variation to playthroughs then games like civilization. But the execution of alot of the content in the game feels sloppily implemented and buggy and the overal performance of the game is quite average. All in all the game can be very enjoyable but the performance combined with the sloppily implemented features can be a source of alot of iritation.In its current state i cant consiously give this game a positve recommendation. This is because they are trying to sell a buggy sloppy game for the full price of a regular AAA title wich is unacceptable to me. if u really want to play this game wait for it to be on sale.			"

												The approach I take when I review any 4x game is to evaluate whether I feel drawn back in to finish ""one more turn"". Unfortunately, with this game that is not the case. In pre-release videos developers lauded tools that would help players more effectively manage their empires, however this game is filled to the brim with micromanagement once you build the massive empires that the game advertises that you can build. That is, if you can build a large empire. Currently the ""large empire happiness penalty"" is extremely crippling and really hurts the ability to build the large empires that most people love building in a space game. I don't mind building a small, extremely efficient empire, but if I want to do that, I'll simply play Civ V, because right now that game does that better. People want to play a space 4x because you don't want to have the same constraints as a game like Age of Empires, Civ, or Rise of Nations. Instead, you want to build an empire that has hundreds of planets and hundreds of ships. At this point, it's best to keep playing GalCiv II until they get the game balancing figured out. While it is playable if you have a good machine, it isn't very entertaining at the moment and instead of me telling me self ""just one more turn"" I think ""ugh, another turn"". (5/10)			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game when it first released in early access and barely played it, this due to the only victory option being conquest. However, I recently picked it back up again and am having an absolute fantastic time with it. In it's current state the game is more feature-rich than either of it's predecessors, in beta! Every little thing is customizable to a ridiculous degree. I actually spent around an hour and a half building my own battlecruiser from the ground up using the game's amazing ship builder. Seriously, if you are a fan of 4x or really any strategy pick this game up.			"

												So far GCIII is GCII on steriods. It took 472 turns in an imense, spiral galaxy to win an ascension victroy in easy mode. The game froze up a couple times, I was either away from the game too long, or it's my videocard. I had no battles, so I never used that side of the game. Occassionally a starbase would not show the ships to be built, but built them just the same. World builting mechanics work fine. Tedious. My kind of game. :) .bwj...26jul15.. Still play some everyday. Been playing GC since beta GCII ! It's a solitaire for me. The first 150 turns move pretty fast, then there's a little slowdown as you give the game more to think about. I play normal mode and ally with a race. Win some, lose some. It takes awhile to play each game, Embarassing, but I've spent 12hrs straight on a game. I've been playing video games since the dawn of PC's, this is my best, all time favorite. Thanks GC team, at least one person on the planet is thouroghly enjoying your work! (ps: I also have a life!)			"

Early Access Review
								As an old player since GC1 and GC2 I had great expectations from the game I even became a founder.Unfortunatelly GC3 is just an improved GC2 better graphics but the same old story again nothing new plus some  bad concepts and design issues.Basically it's GC2 in a new packet with several limitations, limited research, limited info, bad design interface in diplomacy and research screen, terrible weird looking maps. Earth landmasses look like they are floating on a blue haze instead sea.Buidlings have a strange upgrade system, you have to build factory level 1 first even when you have researched level 4!And of course you build a single building on an entire landmass like Australia! The same old recipe.Every time you colonize a planet there is some event and you have to make a good/neutral/evil decision.Ok sometimes at random but everytime?Ships are ugly and bulky there are components you can build a ship like lego ugly.. and time consuming since design has no effect in function. AI can be stupid, persisten or annoying machine that builds starbases all over the galaxy or colonizes every planet non-stop, many inside your borders! Yes AI moves freely inside your borders! And unfortunatelly you have to do the same before AI making the game a planet hunting who gets it first instead of creating and growing a great empire.I have played this game untill 2 weeks before final release so I can say I got dissapointed and it's not worth it.Not anymore.

												I'll be fast.Pros:-lots of content-lots of factions-factions have character and are more than reskins-custom maps, races, and ships-steam workshop-No particular stratregy is OP-Game encourages building alliances instead of just dominating everyone-Multiple ways to win that do not include killing half the universe if you see fit.cons:-price-DLC price-number of DLC you need to get for this experience-Sometimes certain races are overly agressive-The AI is not so great at protecting itself. I can turn a 1v1 fight around easily with just a handful of invasion ships.-there is no way to import a totally custom model to my knowledge. Though i would suggest it.-Sometimes it bothers me how few really good planets there are on randomly generated maps.I purchased the bundle while on a 75% discount. I paid very little overall however it may be much different for you.While i can recommend this game i CANNOT recommend the price of the game with all the respective DLC's due to the extreme price that adds up. Get on bundle deal discount after the newest DLC releases.			"

												im a little angry that i spent $50 on an incomplete feeling game. stardock put a good amount of time into ship customization and it shows but the gameplay is sincerely lacking. the battle animations are drull and buggy with zero player influence. the camera controls to even watch the battle are so bugged sometimes you cant watch it at all. the ship pathing during battles leads them to start flipping around or going in some random zaney direction and makes it look like all the ship captains went simple jack. the research tree is incredibly simplistic. overall the gameplay is simplistic. i give this a 4/10. so much hype and excitement drowned in boredom.

												tldr; Ship designer is great, addictive, and fun - The only element of this game that is fun, for a 4x game incredible shallow, and uncreative. The gameplay mechanics are archaic, and other games in this genre offer a far more entertaining experience, game is over-priced. Good Studio behind the game, could improve with Future patches. I purchased this game very early in development. Why not? It is from a Studio i know, and love. In the end, it was the ship-designer that created the Impulse buy. Which stemmed from the desire to play a sandbox/creative space-game. To boot 4x games are by far my favorite genre. I love Endless Space, SotS 1/2, and SoSE, why shouldn't i love this game too? Many reasons. First off, i find myself only really enjoying the ship design. The game itself is kinda filler, and really unappealing. The races/factions are generic, and provide no real unique experience to play, you will choose races based upon who has the ship designing the elements you want, not because they offer different game-play mechanics, or atmosphere presence. It's the same, watered down game irregardless of the faction. From there, lets talk about game-play. You find yourself only really wanting to end turns to advance research to be able to unlock more items to design in the ship designer. Notice a trend? Yes, the only thing you'll find yourself caring about is the ship designer. -- Combat is terrible, and unentertaining, or interesting. The ""Cut-Scene"" battles are ackward, glitchy, and unappealing. Plenty of Space 4x games provide amazing cut-scene battles that make every exchange feel immersive, not this game. The animations are jittery, graphics basic, weaponary discharges basic, and overall the experience is painful. Sadly ship design does not really make the ship more combat effective as far as design shape, and part positioning. A ship with 4 lazers is a ship with 4 lazers. Bottomline is i couldn't bare to play this game for too long, nothing pulling me in... when it comes down to ship design other games offer designing to a greater degree, with better graphics, animation, and the design plays a role in combat effectivness, other games provide a better more indepth 4x experience. Those same games are 1/4 the price of this game, and have been in circulation for some time - Bottomline? Get one of those games, not this one.			"

												Not a review.NOTE - Brad from Stardock Dev Team has announced in a recent community post upcoming DLC""There's going to be 3 DLC released in 2015 with the first one next month which will add a map editor and a series of ""balanced"" maps.Some of the features we are excited adding in the ""relative"" near term include:a. A crafting system.b. Commanders.c. More controls to reduce late game micro management.d. New game features that make the game evolve over the course of a given game. That is, REWARD players for investing in a cabinet (think Presidential cabnet) to run parts of your empire so that you don't have to personally micro on these huge maps if you don't want.e. A lot more diplomatic features including more formalized lend/lease type features.f. A lot more diplomatic features that revolve around creating intergalactic laws (there's a reason people traispse through people's ZOC, it's not an oversight).g. A LOT LOT more with those resources and things you can do with them.h. A lot more with regards to gray market, black market and kind of quasi-war stuff (read up on the 1790s for more info).i. A lot more with invasions, espionage, funding opposition, destabilizing, inciting rebellions.j. A lot more on serious galactic events.k. More satisfying fleet battles both visually and how the player can feel more control over them (not tactical battles but giving more priorities to things).l. A lot more technology options to allow players to play the game differently (this is an offshoot of the cabinet concept and political party concepts but rather has to do with being able to recruit personnel to ""get things done"" for you on things you don't want to micro manage).That's just a few of the things off the top of my head.""The game works and is still playable aside from some bugs, low FPS, and the screen freezing on turns. Essentially...this game is really in a beta state. WORD OF ADVICE!WAIT UNTIL WINTER SALE TO PICK UP THIS GAME. MAYBE IT'LL BE MORE WORTH IT ONCE THEY ADD STEAM WORKSHOP AND PATCH TEH GAME UP!I recommend this game.With that said, I like this game and find that it has potential, but....probably best to wait a few weeks or months until the game is better patched. If they optimize the game and integrate some new features like steam workshop, espionage, etc. it will have more re-play value. Otherwise, it is like a rehash of GalCiv II as many owners point out. If you want to buy the game anyway, I suggest you watch some let's plays and dev team twitch live streams, look through the Galciv forums, and ask some owners of the game on steam what they like and dislike about it first before purchasing the game.

												I loved GalCiv2, and I was very excited for this new game (I was a junior founder, I bought in early). Now I am not so excited. I think it is the best new 4X game space game out there, but it frequently fails to live up to its predecessor, and it certainly doesn't feel like it has benefitted sufficiently from nearly a decade of advancement in gaming. This game has great potential, but after waiting a year for it to be realized, I'm beginning to lose hope. If you like space 4X, sci fi, or galciv2, you might try picking this up on sale, just to see if you like it. Don't get too excited, though.Here's a short breakdown:Pro:  Multiplayer (finally!)Con: Multiplayer doesn't really work wellCon: How long will the game keep making money and therefore being supported with limited multiplayer?Pro:  AI is what the developer prides itself onCon: The AI is not very goodCon: Worse, there are obvious exploitsCon: Someone with a knowledge of basic probability needs to go over the game mechanics... there are some weird bits*Pro:  Huge maps and the ability to play over 100 opponentsCon: Only comes with a dozen factions. The rest are crowd-sourced on Steam, and they are generally lackluster.Con: Only a slow trickle of ""offical,"" complete new factions from the developer, and they seem to actively avoid adding themCon: The first race they added in DLC is a species of super-aggressive squirrels that started in GC2 as a joke... seriouslyPro:  Fine graphicsCon: The movies use proprietary software, so it is much harder to add new onesCon: Certain things, like lights for ships and faction map colors, are limited and difficult to modCon: Clumsy interfacePro:   Lots of DLC supportCon:  The DLC is mostly weak and disappointingCon:  The first expansion was similarly weakPro:  Delightful ship designerCon: You can only design ships in-game, no independent shipyardCon: The designer is terribly organized and harder to use than the GC2 versionPro: There is customer supportCon: You can't just record a bug, you have to send them a video showing them something they could reproduce on their own computerCon: And they will close a ticket if you don't get back to them very quickly (they are not so prompt themselves)Pro:  Extensive modding supportCon: You can't upload mods to SteamCon: Some programming shortcuts make ""obvious"" mods difficult (not unique to this game, I'm sure)**Pro:  Design as many factions as you want, supports multiple custom civilizationsCon: But they are in an uneditable form outside of the game***Con: There is no interface for editing factions, you have to start a gameCon: Large numbers of factions become unmanagable in an administrative sense: how do you find the one you are looking for with no search and no rational order to the listing?Con: Odd choices in programming colors limits the customizability of ships, interfaces, etc.Con: Game still doesn't include all of the factions remaining at the end of GC2 (Drath, Korath)Pro: Some ""interesting"" new game concepts, like tourism (yawn) and mercenaries (yawn)Con: Lacks, or nerfs, many of the features of GalCIv2, including spies (coming), asteroid miners (nerfed), terror stars (maybe someday)Con: Major features that came with the basic GC2, like politics and political parties, are gone. United Planets seems to be significantly nerfed.Pro:  The developer is very good about updatesPro:  The developer often throws new content into updatesPro:  The developer is pretty cleverCon: There seem to be a lot of glitches/ ""unadvertised features"" that still haven't been resolved despite extensive documentation* e.g., Class 8 and 11 planets are more likely to occur than an either 7,9, 10, or 12, and random planets cannot be class 17!** Aquatic ability is hard-wired, adding new strategic icons...** You can't get the text back out to, say, spellcheck, the the text boxes are too small, the formatting changes unexpectedly, the typing interface is glitchy, and you can't give custom factions everything a built-in faction can (mostly for Steam compatibility)			"

Early Access Review
								Well this game seems to have a similiar problem that early versions had.  I call it the one more turn bug which makes me stay up until well into the night when i know that i should have already gone to bed.  Oh wait that appears to be a bug in my programming not the game.  So far in Beta release 0.42 i have found the game to be crash free even when playing for extended amounts of time.  I can even ALT TAB to other things and come back without a problem.They tech tree is pretty good although at times i find the modficiations to a tech confusing.  If i reasearch lower mass on a class one laser does that roll over to the class two.  Diplomacy is not in yet so you are always at war with everyone which can make things difficult.  Especially once transports are developed because all planet attacks seem to be successful. So you have to try and make sure the transports never make landfall because once they do the planet is lost.  The shipbuilder is not in this release which is frustrating as i am always at war.    For instance yesterday i was at war with a race invested in missiles whil i was focused on lasers.  Normally, I would keep my laser weapons but increase my missile defense the prebuilt ships either include a little of everything or are focused entirely offense and defense with one weapon system.That said it is in Beta.  If you enjoyed GalCiv2 you will love GalCiv3 im sure.			"

												Almost one year after its release date, I was able to grab this game with a nice discount. I am SO glad I didn't pay pay more for this.Understand, the game itself is beautiful, ther are are some nice gameplay mechanics, some other are missing (experience for ships), but overall it is a nice experience and you have fun playing the game, and you may even end up still playing at 5am because the time passes well.BUTOne year after its release and there are still so many bugs ??? Right now I haven't been able to finish even one game without seing a bug. And I'm not talking about some minor glitches, but really crashes. If I'm lucky, it will just be a crash to the desktop. If I'm unlucky, the game will mess my drivers and the whole system will hang, requiring a hard reboot.Crashes when ejecting ships, invading planets, and now the last one that made me write this review, crash in the ship designer when selecting a ship model.Most programs have crash handler, or some sort of window popping up, asking if they can report the bug, but on this game the game simply crashes, to windows, no ""crash"" window popup, and only a good firewall will warn you that the process tries to submit a bug report =_=.So yes, there are savegames usually a few turns before it happens and if I remember which elements of the UI crash, I can avoid using them. But seriously this is annoying. Restarting the game and loading a savegame and replaying missing turns. At the time of writing, I have played 14 hours, and I've probably wasted more than one hour because of those bugs.Maybe this only happens because I'm playing with somewhat high graphics preset (GTX 860M), but it's not a reason. I shouldn't be told to play with lower res graphics because high-res graphics make the game crash - that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I have avoided buying early so I could enjoy the game -- not to be hired as beta tester.I hope they make good use of those crash reports they send in the background...			"

												I bought this game on steam sale for around $15 (14. and something something). This is an extremely addicting game. I love the expansive-ness of the maps and the diverse races. You even can make your own custom race which I have. Some of the matches/games can take up to weeks to finish depending on diffculty and map size which is amazing. I love Galactic Civilizations 3 and I hope they add more into the game in the future. *Also hoping that the Galactic Civilizations series will continue*My rating from 1-10 would be 9/10. There are small things that kinda pushed the game back a little bit such as the pricy dlcs . But honesty i wouldn't worry about that as the base game has a insane amount of content and replay value already. The Dlc is like only extra sauce for the game.			"

												Wow, after a 14 month beta... the final release comes out and I can't play it. I'm getting the fairly common, ""it works once after you install the game and crashes every app launch after"" bug.  The beta's never did this! Anywho, wait for the first two major patches folks. The only way for me to play the game is by doing a full uninstall and then reinstall of the game. That takes 30 minutes each time.... ugh,.. that's now how gaming is supposed to work in 2015. Even when I do play, the game is so full of bugs (see the game forums) that I wonder if Stardock took any QA by the fan base into consideration. For the times that it does work and not bugging out on some thing or another, it's actually quite fun but I'm not wasting any more time on it until the patches start coming in. (And no, it's not my pc's specs. I have a monster of a rig that runs way more complex stuff with ease.)At some point, i'll amend this review if things turn out well.			"

												Have played a few sandbox games and have just started one of the scenarios.  Not having played a previous Gal Civ game thoroughly before, it took a few attempts to get to grips with how things work and what works best for the different races etc.  This is a positive point however as I gain a lot of enjoyment out of working things out and doing better each time.Although I have experienced a couple of bugs with the new notifications system, this hasn't affected my enjoyment of the game and I reckon I'll be playing it for a while yet.  If you like turn based strategy games (instead of realtime) then this is definitely worth playing.  I think I've played about 50hrs in total so far and have only just stratched the surface of what is possible.			"

								Spent a good bit playing this game, loved every second of it. In it's current beta state it's still a bit buggy (however I left it running overnight for 8 hours and then returned to play, so it doesn't get worse over time, just how beta-stage games are), never crashed on me. If you were a fan of Gal Civ II, then this is definitively a continuation of that game and the few new mechanics introduced already make a positive difference.I particularly enjoy the feature of choosing sponsors for shipyards, which makes them much more effective facilities that do not require extensive infrastructure or research. The graphics aren't dramatically different (which I actually like), they're just cleaner and clearer. The core gameplay mechanics haven't been altered either, which I like as well (the method through which starbases are upgraded remained the same, planets still have the grid), they really retained a lot of Gal Civ II, making the game very easy to pick up after not having played in years. Needless to say they didn't try fixing anything that wasn't broken to begin with, like many other companies do with the sequels of their most successful games.			"

												truth be told I want(ed) this game to be great.  I had really high expectations, and during the beta it showed a lot of promise.  Then when it released it seemed like things just fell apart.  The multiplayer was broken, and still is limited.  Features that existed and functioned well in beta disapeared.  SInce release it seems like a 2 steps forward 1 step back approach is being implemented on the updates.  For every 2 advances in stability or gameplay features we get an update that fundamentally changes the game.  The most recent example of this is the 1.4.2 beta patch.  It promises us more advanced AI and easier management of your empire.  And I suppose it achieves this by eliminating the player ability to micromanage their planets.  Having your planetary governing skills labotomized would make the AI appear to be harder and also simplfies the managing of your empire, but it is done so by taking away a very powerful resource held by every human player, the ability to use ones intelect and planning to stregnthen ones own position.  Now I have every hope that the developers of this game would see the angst bestowed upon the paid customers of this game and remedy this situation.  But until things are fixed and updates stop attempting to take away from the player, I cannot say I am glad that I bought this game and therefor cannot recconmend it.  I hope one day to be able to change my review to positive, but for now it just remains my hope.			"

Early Access Review
								[version 0.97 release candidate review]The game is fun. It is an upgrade in almost every way to GalCiv2. I've had the entire family playing it, even 5 and 7 year old girls building dragons, dancing robots and beautiful bugs in the ship designer (and laughing a lot). Still has room for more features and expansions, but there's already plenty to sink your teeth into.My personal list of improvements in GalCiv3:1. Planet buildings now have adjacency bonuses. The screen feels familiar to anyone who's played GalCiv while adding a new mechanic that makes it important not just what you build but where you build it.2. The ship designer. It's easy to make and animate some very pretty things (bugs, transformers etc.). Star Trek ships can already be seen on the forums and I'm sure once the game is in a final state and hooked-up to steamworks it won't be long before there'll be lots of fun total conversion mods to choose from.3. The Developers have been doing weekly twitch streams showing the latest build and talking through their grand plan for the game, balance, bugs, updates and future features. It's up to 47 videos in the youtube playlist each ~45mins long +/- 10 mins. Some laggy/framedrops/audio problems at times but still very informative.4. Resources, they're big and fun now. You can find them on planets (e.g. snuggler colonies), in place of planets (thulium), in asteroid fields (durantium), orbiting black holes (antimatter) or hiding in nebulae (elerium). Each has benefits:Planetside - they let you build special buildings with powerful effects and adjacency bonusesDiplomatically  - you can trade themStrategically - you can turn them into prototype guns/hyperdrives/etc for your favourite capital ships.5. More race options. The old 'super-abilities' from GalCiv2 have now become 2 (still quite super) abilities. So you have even more ways of mixing and matching for your perfect race. That's in addition to the % modifiers. Also you now have the ability to change your home system and tech tree for custom races (without having to fiddle with xml). 6+. Everything else:Hexes rather than squares, upgrade to 64-bit so bigger and better maps. Unique tech-trees as standard. Bigger and better cutscenes. More animated backgrounds, portraits, gizmos, doodads and thingamajigs. More epic fleet battles. Shipyards draw resources from multiple planets (less hassle). Chris Bucholz (new writer extraordinaire on the team from Cracked.com, improving whatever he touches).The Bad:1. Micromanagement on larger maps is a chore, additional features to reduce the hastle would be greatly appreciated. More information at a glance, more ways to group/sort/view planets together, mark important features (what is this planet's highest % bonus?) what is/will be my plan for this world?2. You'll have to wait for a future expansion to get admirals and xp, planet-killers and spies. Not entirely a bad thing. I'm glad some features were pushed to a future later date to make sure that everything gets the time and attention to detail that it deserves. 3. Needs a big balance pass. Lots of tiny (but significant) adjustments, and some time to play the game and work out what is needed for everything to settle into more comfortable values. Examples: 3a. The large empire approval penalties being too strong on large maps, making race abilities like patriotic (which negates the penalty) equally strong. (They were % based which broke the game when it reached 100% penalty. Flat now, but still a problem at high values)3b. Planetary projects/special buildings being a little too fiddly and confusing. Is it better to set the slider to 100% wealth or use a project to convert excess manufacturing? Is it better to build a factory or a resource refinery? Sometimes you need access to a spreadsheet to see what should be obvious, since you have to factor in build-times and stacking % bonuses from different sources.3c. Exploits like 'ancient' giving 10% research per relic, quickly reaching 10x the research rate of other races once you gain a handful of relics(+%) and ascension crystals (+raw research). 3d. Sensor ranges for ships/planets/starbases aren't balanced against each other. (Blind starbases and planets, with all-seeing cargo-scouts). But all of the above require tweaking the odd number from +2 to +3 or adding caps/diminishing returns where appropriate. Easy to fix by 1.1.Conclusion:A game with big boots to fill, and lots of room to grow. But it's already an improvement graphically and mechanically over its predecessor. I hope you try it and have fun with it. Have a look at the developers twitch streams if you're not sure or are interested in the growth of the game - the videos can also be found on youtube by searching for Stardock Games.			"

												This game has a lot of potential and I think this game will be worth the full price in the near future if the developer continues their efforts. It just feels like it was released too early...It hurts to write this review. I really looked forward to this game and had hoped the best for it, but I cannot recommend this game for the full price in its current state. The game feels like it should not have been released this early, there is a lack of polish in many of the options and features. If you look through these review you will see that many other players have said all of this better than I could say.Lack of diplomacy, spying, in-game help for many of the mechanics are frustrating. The constructor-spam situation is real and very annoying right now. I read about this from a handful of others and thought they were just being touchy, but having played a couple of games now it is a very real thing. Other players build starbases in your territory, stealing your resources and you can do nothing about this unless you want to start a war; you cannot even complain about this on the diplomacy screen! The enemy seems to keep fleets of constructors that just rush right to every resource location right from the start...I could go on, but I strongly suggest anyone that is thinking about picking up this game look at what the other reviewers have had to say and take it to heart.Now, it does look like the company is working to fix these problems, but who knows how long this will really last or where it will end up. I personally wish I would have waited for next year to buy this game and would suggest that potential buyers delay their purchase until many more patches come out and see where this game ends up.I think I am going to delay playing this game and come back to it after several patches and see the state of it then. If things have changed for the better I will update this review; infact I would love to change this review for the better....			"

								GalCiv3 is probably in my opinion the best 4x to come to market in years, not simply because its actually going to be a finished product for once but because i've never come across a more social group of dev's who literally do their very best to give you what feels like a personal experiance when it comes to dealing with any problems you come across in game, and weekly dev stream's that you can ask them questions during, and even take on board your thoughts and idea's when it comes to building a better game for the community.The Pro's- Amazing Customer Support.- It's getting better with ever new patch.- Easy to understand UI.- Easy to pick up for a first timer, or veteran of 4x Games.- Great graphics, and performance- Seriously addictive, you'll easily waste hundreds of hours of time into this once its out of beta.- They are pushing the 4x Genre to its limits with insane map sizes.The Cons- I guess for some spending alot of time on this because its addictive :-D- Lack of sleep.Yeah i dont really have any concerns or con's when it comes to GalCiv3. I had issues before and both times i had help within an hour from a dev to try and help me/them get to the route cause of the problem. The only con i can really think of is if you watch the dev streams you might be jelous of the fact paul gets to play with some cool features that are not stable enough to be released or are still in developement stages. 10/10 i paid 100 dollars to be a founder and its honestly the best money i ever spent would happily have spend double that.

												I am conflicted about it, but thinking a lot about it, the game is not good, let me get in some detail about what I've experienced on the game so far.It's one of the best turn-based strategy games out there, yes, much better than others big franchises like civilization V.But, to be honest, this doesn't mean it's a good game, why?On the last decade, new releases of this genre have gone backwards, with new versions of turn-based games of the same franchise with usually less features ( ??? ) than it's previous versions.It also has a very bad user interface, wich unfortunate is also a problem shared with most, if not all, turn-based games launched on the last decade, games like these are based on control and management of units and production, but the longer the game lasts, the worse it gets, the game has awfull 'automate' management, and if you do it manually to get a better result ( wich any serious gamer does, naturally ), the interface is extremelly limited, with just a handfull of keyboard shortcuts, and the only automation is that the queue can be set to repeatedly build a single ship ( ??? ).Note that, so far, I didn't even mention the constant crashes that the game has, specially when using the diplomacy interface, or designing your own ships.

												I was a big Galactic Civ 2 fan. But Galactic Civ 3 is just boring. I'm 5 hours into the game and bored out of my mind. There isn't any depth to this game. I find myself just wanting to win or lose after barly starting a game because it lacks something. I cant put my finger on it, but all I know is when I've played Stellaris or Hearts of Iron 4 or Civ 6 I find myself wanting to beat the game. I dont want to beat a Galactic Civ 3 game. I just get bored and stop. Stellaris holds up much better over time than this game.			"

Or just quits.  I have over 400 hrs on this game (not proud of it) over the past year or so and have seen it go from occasionally crashing every few times played to crashing all times played.  Don't buy it.			"

								This game takes space exploration to a new level! Highly recomended if you are into strategic games like Civ V or Galactic Civ II. I only wish they could have a Hybrid or simultaneous turn change, so we can move and play at the same time because waiting for the other player to finish is a little boring. It helps that I have Netflix so I can watch that whilst playing, but it takes away from the games atmosphere.All and all a great game, note it is in Beta so all the bugs and stuff will most likely be fixed.P.S. I don't understand how to mine, hopefuly it will be implemented in a more user friendly fasion.			"

												Overall this is a great game, but I really just can't accept the business decisions of Stardock. It is a shame that they do support german language in the game but only translate the first 2 DLCs into German.  All other DLCs and even the expansion pack doesn't support German language. But French and Russian? Are you guys kidding me? I wasn't aware of that crap but obviously they do it with all their games. Almost racist for me. I wrote this review in english to have get the most out of it, everyone should see this. You guys want to tell me that it's easier to translate into Russian than into German?This was the last game I bought from Stardock. I am very disappointed with that kind of business model.			"

												I wanted to like this game and certainly it's better than Beyond Earth (admittedly a much different game) but I'm surprised I'm giving it a thumbs down. Two big issues for me:(1) Way, way, way too many technologies. You wouldn't think too many is bad but it is. They all are so similar.  Honestly, the tech tree could be cut down by 2/3s. Most of the techs are forgetable as you just click next your next research goal without really thinking of what you just discovered. Many of them are just filler until you get the one that actually has a benefit. The devs should have taken the lead from Civ V. The tech tree was excellent. Every tech you discover gave you something. Another problem with having so many techs is the benefits you get when they do pop up are so minor as to be unimportant - 1+ food, 1+ research, meh. This is similar to the problem that plagued beyond earth. If I had one wish, it would be for a pared down tech tree with significant beneits gained with each discovery - in the vane of Civ V.(2) Diplomacy is so boring. It's hard to believe but Civ V's diplomacy is better. For one, making any agreement is a chore. IF you offer something for trade you can't just click a button to say what would you give me for this like in Civ V, you have to go by trail and error to finally find something they'll trade you. I just gave up. Also, most of the interactions from the AI are either them begging for money or telling you they're unhappy or happy about open borders. There is the odd taunt but you can never give it back to them as in Civ V. I was expecting much, much more with diplomacy given Gal Civ's history and it being from Stardock. I am very disappointed. There are fun parts of the game, certainly tweaking the position of your buildings to get the optimum bonuses is fun. The exploring and settling part is good too as are the ideologies. Unfortunatley, overall the game doesn't do it for me. I was surprised they didn't take more ideas from how Civ V did things to really make Gal Civ III shine. I keep coming back to CIv V because there are so many great things Firaxis did to make that game accessable, fun, and easy to play. Stardock certainly could have brought over some of the ideas. I mean there isn't even an option to have the game automatically end your turn. You always have to click the button.I really, really, wanted to love this game but I can't recommend it.Short review:(1) Tech tree is too expansive and the individual techs are forgetable. (2) Diplomacy is worse than CIv V. (3) Exploring is fun as is settling your planet as is optimizing your building position. I don't recommend it, unfortunately. The game has been uninstalled. Sorry Stardock - I'm still a fan and I hope you can fix it.			"

												Unfinished, unpolished reincarnation of Galactic Civilizations II.Pro:- updated graphics, overall much better look- slightly more user-friendly UICon:- uses 5GB+ RAM with its 64-bit architecture, yet still has the AI of Master of Orion 1- AI plays nothing but a number's game (value_PlayerMightx1.5 < value_AIMight = declareWar), no artificial intelligence whatsoever- AI uses fleets randomly, mostly sends in single ships that have no chance in combat- AI has no idea how to use the new neighboring building bonuses, all AI planets seem to be built randomly- AI cares not about pis*ing off the player by harvesting ressources in other races space, because it has no value assigned in the number's game- lots of basic GC2 functions missing (hide stock ship designs, disable surrenders, etc.)- Diplomacy has been dumbed down to a Tech Trade exchange, no options to intimidate (opponent just ignores you) or otherwise haggle- AI turns a blind eye towards enemy ship designs and goes with the same omni-stock setup everytime, aka if you are at war and use beam-weaponized ships exclusivly, the AI will still mount armor and point-defenses on the ships it sends to youSo far all my games ended with 1-2 AI's surrendering to me because I did nothing to them so far (""You have been good to us."") after caving in at the might of a third AI. This left me with sometimes 5-10 useless planets (you have to raze 60-80% of the buildings and start from scratch) and a bunch of useless stock ships that my finely tuned battlegroups laughed at. Last time it took me two hours to sort the AI mess out, before I could click TURN again.That plus the overall ridiculously stupid AI to play against makes Galactic Civilizations III nothing short of a criminal money grab that will literally take years to become spaceworthy.

												As a big fan of Galactic Civilizations 2, I came into GalCiv3 with the understanding that it was going to be very similar.  That is fine, in this case, because similar to ""good"" is likely to be ""good"".  The biggest issue with GalCiv3 is that some of the information is simply missing.  It could very well be that it is available and I don't know how to access it, but if so, even that is a problem.  I enjoy the game, and happily play it while at the same time hoping for a more complete version.			"

Breaking it down, if you love Civilization (any series) you will probably like this game, if not, I give it a 50/50.  I for one who spent over 2,500 hours in Civ must say that this game is worth it, like the Mod in Civ 4 but way cooler.  There are some glitches, but for the most part works good.  My biggest problem with this game, is that you don't get to fight your own battles, but my biggest win for the game is that you can design your own ships.

Also bot civs still play the battle animations in the fog of war.Dark Yor don't look like they're straight out of FNaF. However, the Yor actually do manufacture their population now, so that's a massive improvement to that faction.The altarians aren't considered idiots nows, so that's sad.

												Unimpressive. It's the same old as the other games in the series, a few minor tweaks (race design) but nothing to write home to mum about. For me the biggest two problems with it are in order to have even a most basic overview of what is going on you have to zoom out - when you zoom out the display becomes a 2D hexagonal grid full of stylised symbols for ships, planets etc making the whole thing look like a 1980's table top strategy board game. The graphics are nice enough up close - when you are so close you literally can't do anything worthwhile. The second problem is the ship designer - probably the games greatest asset. It is fiddly to use at best, the rotation dials are nightmarish and as far as I can tell you can't rotate the 3D model to get a good look at what it looks like from the front/top/side as it is permanently shown at a 45 degree perspective. I tried 4 basic ships and saved as templates, each saved but without any active modules (ie the entire hull configuration was there but missing the colony pod, same problem with constructor module etc). Don't get me wrong, the game is ok  - so was GCII with all its variants and this just seems to bring not much new to get excited about.=) Hours later....sudden afterthought, this thing is moddable which I haven't explored so the community may save it contentwise.

												It is a true sand-box game where the possibilities seem limitless - with the ability to design your own ships or factions, with the existence of a way-too-big tech tree which makes it so your choices actually matter, with multiple legit ways to win the game...  Each game played has been a different experience - although my personal play style seems to keep pushing me toward diplomatic efforts.  The visuals are great, though the some of face animation in cutscenes leaves something to be desired.   The sound is not bad.  But really, it is all about the game play and customizability which will allow this game to have long-lasting value.   And the AI is capable of beating you if you are not paying attention.  This makes the game challenging and fun as you react to decisions made by AI factions.  For this and tremendous customizability (and scale) of the game, I consider the game well worth the value, especially of you are the type that likes to tinker and customize your experience.It is, of course, not without its faults.  - Now that the campain is released, I find it underwhelming.  I was looking forward to a deeper story and more than a few maps.  I understand that more will be added in the future.  However, the present campaign is thin and lacks the drama that the trailers seemed to promise.  - The game still has a range of random typos, mismatches in what a few techs or improvements say and what they actually do, to go along with the rare crash (rare for me, anyway).- The cinematic battle viewer is great in concept,... except for when suddenly it choses an angle that isn't showing anything at all.  I guess a camera person fell asleep.Yes, some of these problems are annoying.  But I think what will make this game endure and makes it well worth the price is that it can be played, replayed, and played with for a long time.  With easy mod creation, it will not be long before there are many quality mods to enhance play.  Because ship parts can animate, the creative among us can create ""transforming"" ships.  The game is as much about being space emperor as it is about the game within the game (the customization of it).  People looking for a deep engrossing story will be disappointed.  But people looking who like building ships, making designs, making new races, and playing with all your created toys... (people like me) will be able to play this thing for a long long time.			"

												Its an excellent base game for the years to come. I always liked their formula and played part I and II. Part II had some more features at the end but it was also developed for many years.I have some small issues here and there but everything will be adressed in DLCs like espionage or a deeper political system.So in short, much fun much recomended much potential absolutely worth my money.

												I recommend this game, but with caveats.   It sucks up RAM; I've seen it grab 2.5 GB all by itself, and I've ran out of memory on my 6GB machine after disabling all sorts of programs to free memory up.  The diplomacy system needs work; they really need a way to issue ultimatums/threats.All in all I like the game, but it sure needs continued work by the Devs...			"

												If there ever was a space 4X game that was ""civilization in SPACEEE"", the aptly named GalCiv series is most like that as far as the world (universe) map goes at least. The the planets are spread out on the map as cities, and stars, asteroids and other bodies act as other kind of terrain. The ridiculous scales bother me more than little, but not enough to make me hate the games. I think this game is mediocre. It's not bad, but doesn't do anything that other space 4X games don't do better. Reasonably smooth, but unimpressive.Some are bothered by the fact that you can't control the tactical combats. I am not, though I would prefer bit more detailed standing orders and setting formations beforehand. Now you just set the ship role as you design the class and that's it. Ship design isn't that impressive either if you don't care that much about the cosmetic aspect of it.Nevertheless, the game was good enough to get me on ""one more turn"" state at least for a while, so it's not all that bad. If you are a big fan of turn based space 4X games, this might be worth a look. I would recommend waiting for the price to drop first, though. Stardock's a cool company too.			"

												Galactic Civilizations III is a deep and addictive 4X game, and yet I can't get myself to recommend it. Still suffering from bugs a year after its original release, it does a poor job at explaining exactly how things work and what you need to do to hope for a victory, and look very much old school compared to its competition.If you're looking for a space-based deep strategy title, launch another game of Endless Space, you'll be better off.

												Coming from other games, this has a definite learning curve.  Had to learn about specialization of planets, which the game tries to discourage you from doing.Bug wise, glitches are semi-common, but tolerable.  Be careful about destroying a planet, as the CTD bug after that is the most annoying one I've found.The campaign is not an epic of heroism and gallantry, instead a rather short and muted affair that essentially provides flavor text for a normal map.Overall, very good game.  The ship customization feature is really fun, hopefully they add more components for greater variety. More customizable than any other 4X I've ever played by a mile.I bought this hoping for another Homeworld, so slightly disappointed in only 2D battlespace, but that's my fault for not examining the screenshots.

												I love Galactic Civilizations I and II and have spent hundreds of hours on each game.  I very much looked forward to Gal Civ III.  Unfortunately, the product I bought is not finished.  Beta masquerading as a retail product.  Little thought has been given to ground combat, which is a joke.  The attacker will always steamroll over the defender even when outnumbered.  Building planetary defenses made zero difference.  Master of Orion (I'm talking about the very first MOO) had way more depth for ground combat.  Approval from the people is meaningless.  I can have planets at zero approval and just suffer a slight drop in growth/productivity.  Seriously??  At zero approval, the people should be rioting and putting my governor's head on a pitchfork.  If I had any governors.  Nope, no such feature yet.I have no doubt that Gal Civ III will be a great game.  Eventually.  After all the patches and DLCs.  Until then, I am shelving this game.			"

								Great game so far, with only a few minor sticking points.It would be nice to have the ""upgrade all ships of this class"" button back.For some reason I can't seem to be able to get past turn 392. Task manager is also telling me it's using up 98% of my CPU's processes.I'm not a fan of the sidebar. I'd like to be able to minimize it.I miss the notifications. Like when it told you that a new default unit was upgraded.Very few keyboard commands, and none for units specifically. I'm assuming the devs are leaving it for the end since that's a pretty easy thing to do and are more focused on larger stuff.No galactic wonders? I'm assuming they'll also be added in late.I'm also not a fan of the new tech tree. Segregating the techs like that just makes it a little inconvenient when trying to decide what to research next. Also would be nice to have the ability to sort them again like in GalCivII.Other than that it's pretty much GalCivII just upgraded, which in my mind is a good thing. GalCivII was already pretty much a perfect game.			"

								For everyone who has not played any Galactic Civ game before I do recommend buying GC 1 or 2 preferably 2 as it is newer to get the feel for the game. On to GC 3, as stated this is an ALPHA, if you do not like playing a game that is not complete don't, I honestly did not buy this for the Alpha, the Alpha was a bonus, I personally bought it because it gives all the DLCs and expansion packs that will ever be made, so in the long run it was cost effective.Overall the alpha is above my expectations. The game runs smooth on my laptop which is about 1.5 years old. 3rd gen i5, quad core, 6 GB ram, Intel HD 4000 graphics. So it runs extremely well on a medium tier laptop. On my tower which is about 5 years old. Pentium dual core, 6 GB ram, 512 mb graphics card, it runs just as well as on my laptop. (Note tower was running 64-bit Vista, laptop was running 64-bit Windows 7.) If you want to save a little money in the long run and get all the DLCs and expansion packs and the game for 99.99, I suggest you do it there are also a few extra goodies you get for buying the Founder's elite edition, read the full game description for details. You are NOT required to play or even touch the alpha, I have played it twice and honestly I am so good, from my long history with GC series that the AI usually doesn't last more than 20 turns, since there is nothing more to do other than wipe them out, the alpha can get quite boring, quite quickly. Again you are NOT required to play or even touch the alpha.			"

There's some promise in the starbase design but can still be better.- ships and/or leading personell should have som XP effects... not just tech level.

												I paid full price and so I am writing it based on that.  It just isn't finished.  There is virtually no help it is unclear what most of the tech does until after you do it and puzzle out what it does.  After playing for hours I have no idea how the ships are supposed to match up.  Is there a point to a lot of little ships or big ships?  Does one type of ship do better against another type?  I have no idea the point of military starbases.  Do you need to attack one?  It seems that you can just completely avoid starbases.  Then as to the other races and diplomacy.  It is the standard model of rediculousness.  Every 5 turns they ask or demand something of you.  If you give them what they want every time they will still eventually go to war against you anyway.			"

												This series has been one of my favorites for quite sometime! I Purchased GalCiv 2 years ago through Stardock's online market place. Well when I did I immediately became addicted to this torturous test of patients and prowess. I dove head first in and constantly forgot to surface for air. Hours upon hours of play through's caused me to forget my immediate time and space around me. Constantly saying ""just one more turn, one more"" finding its 2 or 3 in the morning. Fast forward a few years and I find this game on EA for steam. I jumped up and slapped myself to ensure I was not seeing things. It was true, I purchased right away [when it was >$100] and played. LOVED IT!The third has greatly and I mean GREATLY increased the shredding that is the AI in all aspects. The AI you can encounter in this game is unlike anything that I see in RTS, 4xRTS, Turn-based RTS and strategy games alike. The computer will adapt to almost every choice and move you make, for better or worse- they are watching and will react accordingly. Now this does not make the game unfair in any sense, I hate the AI's that rush build top tier stuff, this does not. A balanced and true reacting AI based on the assets and characteristics of said opponent.♦Great graphics and UI♦AI is balanced and challenging♦Replay value is through the roof♦Games can always be different and never the same outcome ♦Creating custom races adds to the above♦Custom ships♦Custom shipsIf you are a person who enjoys strategy games that require slight micro-management then this one is for you. the learning curve can be a little steep but the reward is well worth the frustration.

												The graphics and overall appearance of this newest iteration of Galactic Civilizations is wonderful to behold. But this newest version adds almost nothing to what Civ 2 had, leading me to wonder why this game was given a 3rd iteration if a creative spark was lacking.The interface is similar to galactic civ 2 in that the majority of the vital text necessary for gameplay is crammed at the bottom and left-hand edge of the screen. When one invents a wondrous new engine or social policy we are greeted with a gigantic picture of a server bot doing a repetitive hand display with the actual description of the invention a few terse sentences at the bottom of the screen as if it were an afterthought. Shouldn't the flavor text and practical statistics of a new discovery take precedent over a server bot? We have to look at this guy for hours and hours of gameplay. More summaries are needed. Granted I do not mind sifting through Excel-like spreadsheets to feel clever about discerning a new way to refine my galactic macroeconomics, but a quick rundown is often necessary just to get a better jist of a planet's well-being, especially when the player is embroiled in chaotic conflicts with one or more opponents. The entire UI text is too small and ignored throughout.On the subject of combat, I have yet to design a ship that consistently wins battles. This may be some sort of personal failing of mine, but I am having trouble figuring out what I should or should not do. Range on mass drivers seems limited, which makes no sense in the vacuum of space, and other races always seem to evolve faster than myself, as if they were optimally programmed to know exactly what to do or something. How strange! Granted additional time spent with the game will probably find me honing in on workable strategies, I have to note that playing several hundred turns into a game only to then find that my plan was flawed is depressing. A few failed attempts at various weapons and engines with  little learned on how to improve has discouraged me from wishing to replay. The relatively underdeveloped story does not allow me to enjoy the wonder of exploring a universe with any given race. Is it expensive to pay writers to add additional depth and creativity to a game? I honestly don't know, but I would be willing to forgive my military failures if I could at least love the universe a bit more.			"

								Stardock took on a daunting task when they decided to revive their classic TBS game after almost a decade. Could they add enough to the game to make it fresh without spoiling what made GalCiv2 great? Could they deliver a game that exceed the golden memories of GC2?Yes. And they did.The core of the game remains much the same. Your fledgling empire starts, isolated and alone in an unknown galaxy. Move quickly, colonize new worlds, research new technologies, raise a fleet of warships and crush your enemies into powder. Or sooth them with diplomacy. Or achieve victory by ascending to a higher plane of existence.There's a lot to this game, too much for the little blurb review Steam provides. The problems with the game stem from the weak AI and various instabilities (a particular issue in the latest builds is a brutal black screen freeze entering the battle viewer).These issues mar what is otherwise a near perfect release. Stardock promises a constant stream of fixes and updates after release. Keep in mind that the GC2 game that people revere took an untold number of updates and several expansions to achieve. Stardock's plans for this game are quite ambitious, with a 7+ year timeline of DLCs and expansions. They believe they've caught lightning in a bottle again, and they're right.			"

Stardock has been working on this game for years but apart from some debugging they have hardly done anyting to the core game, they have instead focused on making DLC to get even more money from us.

												Played many hours of GCII, but this one leaves a LOT to be desired. I know there are fanboys on here that swear this game is great and it's easy, and it's the greatest game ever made, but they are obviously cheating, or modifying the game files.For the rest of us, it comes down to the AI having a HUGE advantage over the human  player, even on easy. Resources, FoW, manufacturing, etc. You HAVE to research weapons, armor, sensors, and other military techs from the start, and you must produce ships every turn as soon as you can.On easy turn 800 or so, the power indicator shows AI having 32000 and I have 2800. This is after researching all of the available weapons and armor tech and putting out over 100 ships. There is NO way a human player can do this - without cheating. It's imp[ossible to put out 32000 points of ships.Survey and sensors are the same way - the AI can and will move faster than you, and make a bee-line for you even though it shouldn't be able to catch you, or to see you.Don't waste the time on this game, unless you want to use cheat codes or modify the game files.

												Version 1.6 ReviewI thought the second one was a clunky, glitchy mess, but this one is even worse in every aspect.  Worse UI, worse AI, worse gameplay, worse stability, less features, worse price... there's just nothing going for this game.It took me five hours to beat the tutorial because the AI was so rigged against you.  While it can easily take you half an hour to research a single technology or build a single ship, the AI starts with every technology in the game and can spam ships 10x stronger than yours, but to counter this they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and easily manipulated.  Can't win via conquest, only through cultural assimilation.And within those five hours, I crashed three times so yeah, just do yourself a favor and buy Civilization V if you like those types of games.______________________________________________________________Version 1.9 ReviewFigured I'd give the game another try since it's been ages and there's supposedly been a massive update.  Reading the changelogs, I was discouraged since instead of making the Ai easier they claimed to make it a lot harder... but then I played the game.It still takes ages to research or build anything, and the AI still have every tech in the game and spam ships every turn (despite the devs saying they actually focused on making 'em less spammy).  But the AI also seems to have slightly less of an advantage in the campaign, so you can actually complete it.Speaking of the campaign, remember GalCiv 2's massive campaign?  This one has a whopping three missions, and they give you an almost invincible warship in two of 'em.  Every other ""campaign"" is DLC-only but even that is pretty minor compared to even GalCiv 2's very first campaign.Only thing I've noticed is that the game hasn't crashed on me and seems to run a lot better, so there's at least that but yeah... overall this game is STILL a complete farce.  Just do yourself a favor and buy Civilization VI is you like those types of games.			"

												I'm sorry I have to write this. First of all, I love Galactic Civ 2. I think it was and arguably still is one of if not the best 4X TBS games, and I have 1000+ hours in it. I did buy the $99.99 elite edition so I get all of the DLC and expansions free, so I still have hope. Unfortunately, GC3 just isn't as fun. I have many problems with the game; here are a few that really annoy me.1. Economy/Hapiness- This is the one thing I really hate about GC3. In GC2 managing the economy, taxes and production capacity was one of my favorite parts of the game. It's all gone. Tax rate can not be adjusted, instead you only get the wheel to adjust where spending goes. Hapiness also sucks now. For example, I was playing on largest size map. I was suffering from large empire penalty, an awful addition, and was building two stadiums per planet to maintain hapiness. Finally, I just stopped caring. My global hapiness dropped to 7%, with most planets at 0%. Guess what happened? Absolutely nothing. Planets are supposedly more suceptible to invasion and grow slower, but not a single one leaves. In GC2, you would literally die if you did this. One time in GC2 I changed tax rate from 39% to 100% for one turn to bail our my economy, and my citizens literally killed me, taking 119 of my 120 planets, leaving my relpacement I played as with a clsss 4 and half a fleet. 2. Pacing- Somehow this is pure awful also. I am 250 turns into a game, and havent met a single other civ. I dont think exploration was changed; what changed is how long turns take. All units must have orders, and this doubles turn length. In GC2, I could get through 50 turns in 5 minutes if I wasn't at war. In GC3, I would be lucky to get 50 turns out in an hour. The era lock on technologies is also bad, making all civs make mearly identical research choices. 3. AI/War- GC2 has an amazing AI. Better than the AI from any other strategy game I have seen since or before. GC3 throws this legacy away and instead goes in the direction of CIv V's AI (Not that Civ IV had great AI, and Civ V is good enough that I have 2000+ hours on it) aand is awful. Especially in warfare, AIs are completely incompetent. GC2 Ais were on par with me most games, but GC3 AIs suck at politics completely. 4. Ideology- While I very much like the concept, many policies need to be curbed or removed. There is a neutral on tthe FIRST level that makes it so you cant declare war on whoever gets it for 50 turns(about an hour of gameplay) which I hate, especially because minor races will always take it and other majors as well righht as you are about to invade them. Many others are overpowered; for example a malevolent one gives 5 transports, which have 6b population each. At the point of the game you can get it, this literally doubles your population if you land them. There are other things that annoy me as well, but theses are the most game breaking. If the devs want to fix this game, they should:-Re-Implement GC2 economy features-Remove large empire penalty for all civs- May be why many races stay small and never meet you-Let players end turn if units need orders-Fix AI- Need to be way more agressive and expansionist-Rebalance economyAll in all, I do think that this will eventually be a really fun game. As for now, GC2 is better. If you are considering buying this, instead go for GC2. It is really modern despite it's age, even supporting 1920x1080 resolution, though the UI is dated.			"

												EDITI really should just revise this entire review, but that just begs to question where do I begin with what all is wrong with this game? Far too many words for not only the attention span of the average reader, but even more words than a Steam review can allow. So let me sum it up: Bad AI, unpredictable game bugs from minor to game breaking, plus everything mentioned below. Honestly, this game was at a: ""Don't buy until on sale"", but after putting more hours into it (and then rage quitting because of a daftly mind boggling stupid bug that made me uninstall the game in anger) I am now just saying: Avoid this game until it has plenty of patches. Don't trust this developer to deliver quality. I should have known from the beginning when they launched the early access at $99 that this game was a sham and a rip off. I'm still kicking myself - a week later - that I bought this game at $50. Terrible, terrible purchase.Original review below:I'm having a hard time getting into this game. For most 4x games, particularly the Civ series, 2 hours is way more than enough for the game to sink it's hooks in and keep me going for ""just one more turn!""It's easy to draw similarities between the Civ franchise and Galactic Civilizations III, partly because ""Civilizations"" is in it's title, but it is also a 4x game with similar rulesets as the Civ franchise, which maybe is where I am having trouble getting in to it.Civ5 made it easy to pick up and play. While it's not without it's bugs (especially at launch) some of the basic fundamentals seems refined.GCIII, on the other hand, seems to have clunky controls which is the bare-bones basics of all games. The UI often provides too much unnecessary information at times, while at other times, it doesn't seem to give you enough feedback (like when building on a planet)***EDIT***below I mention using directional keys to move the camera bugs when selected on a ship. This isn't entirely true. After checking key-mapping, it turns out the W and the S key were mapped to 2 items, resulting in the seemingly weird bug. This comes back to my complaint about the UI not providing enough information. It would have been nice if the game informed me there was another function already mapped to those keys.The camera - which I map to WASD - is picky. I can move it freely while I am NOT selected on any ship or planet, but should I select one, it locks my camera to the X axis, preventing any vertical scrolling. As for movement paths themselves - going back to the UI not providing enough feedback at times - when you tell a ship to auto move (either to your predefined location or just setting it to auto-explore) it seems like any action, big or small, while the unit is selected, will set the ship to idle and remove it's auto-path.Race customization seems almost pointless. Aesthetically, there are very limited options to chose from - unless you want still images, which I find un-immersive. It does provide some RPG-esque stats to try and specialize your race in certain areas, but I found it to be so inconsequential. You only get 5 points to distribute, and since this is not an RPG - as far as I am aware - you do not get any more stat points to distribute. While you could intentionally REMOVE points from existing areas to get more than the 5 stat points, it always feels like if you want to properly specialize your race you have to intentionally hinder your race. Honestly, It feels like it has the illusion of a deep stat system, but frankly, I think a basic ""Choose 2 specializations and choose 1 weakness"" from a small list of trees like, ""Research, Commerce, Growth, Warfare, Politics"" would have provided a more meaningful choice than the existing ""specialization tree"".Ship building is a fine example of how clunky controls can be in this game. It feels like an almost direct copy-paste job of the ship building in GCII, and it has not aged well.There is NO undo/redo option. There is NO copy-paste option. As far as I am aware, there is NO save and edit later function. When you have as many functions to control objects shape, size, appearance, and animation, the lack of the above listed utilities is a huge disappointment on Stardock. This makes repeating similar pieces for symmetry's sake tedious as hell with no copy paste. And if you use the gizmo's to control rotation, translation, and size, then it is very easy to accidentally click on a different piece than the one you are editing and wind up adjusting the wrong piece, which can result in screwing up the ship and without Ctrl-Z to undo, it can be astoundingly frustrating.The use of snap-points for pieces also seems archaic, and often, getting the piece you want to snap to the points is a headache in it of itself, but more often than not, these snap points don't seem to want to work in your favor anyways. Often it seems like objects want to snap to the most illogical placement, such as clipping inside the object it snapped to, and usually with weird rotations. I feel like a drag-and-drop system or a click-on system (without snap points) would have been more effective, but, without it, as a result, the ship-building is just a headache.I came into this game hoping to experience a Sci-Fi equivilent to Civilizations with extensive customization, but I left feeling like I was burned by a bad game with poor, clunky controls, an uninfomative UI, and shallow, frustrating customization. DON'T BUY UNTIL IT HAS SEVERAL PATCHES!!!!			"

												So far so good! Galactic Civilization II was one of the greatest strategy games of all time for me so I was a bit worried and stoked all at the same time for the new game. The good news is that fans of the past games will enjoy this 3rd game in the series and that some new players might like it aswell!There is TONS of customization in this game and the maps can be HUGE HUGE HUGE HUGE! If you like 4x strategy games or space games or stardock games from the past check this one out!  The graphics are nice, the gameplay is fun and like always in stardock games there are alot of options for customization/modding.5 hours into the game so far and my experience is 98% positive! Had one small bug but that is really the only negative I have atm! Pick up this new stardock Galactic Civilization 3 game and start taking over all the planets and kick some aliens butt! Feel like creating your own faction from scratch? You can do it in this, customize anything from spaceships design, whole factions,etc...What is here now is a wonderful base game that I hope gets a good expansion pack like Galactic Civilization 2 had. Stardock imo is the best at these 4x Strategy games, they nailed it with Galactic Civilization 1 and 2 years ago, did an awesome job on Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes and of course the wonderful Sins of A Solar Empire series that Ironclad and Stardock work on.In the end if you are wondering if this is new one can measure up to the old ones or not.... The answer is its more great GC from stardock and its very much worth checking out if you don't mind a slight learning curve and don't mind your social life getting destroyed! (This has the ""JUST ONE MORE TURN!!!"" feeling of Civilization games and good 4x strategy games of the past).Now back to my game as Spock and his faction as we try to take over the world! This really is the ultimate Space Sandbox!			"

												Over 100 hours of gameplay stretched over months I've gone back and forth on whether I could recommend this game. I decided I can definitely recommend it because it's developers continue to improve it. Initially GC3 felt barren and boring so I put it aside. Each time I come back I find myself playing it more and more as it receives updates.GC3 can be compared best to Civ V in my opinion. I love Civ 5 and have played it more than 400 hours. I can tell you Civ 5 is a complete game whereas GC3 is not. Civ 5 feels balanced and polished whereas GC3 is not. Yet I come back to GC3 because I love a space theme and there's no other Space Opera out there. Endless Space was okay, but GC3 has more to it. I'm certainly looking forward to Endless Space 2 and Stellaris (I know it's out but it needs probably a year of polishing and DLC).Pros+Depth+Races look and feel different, but I wouldn't call it night and day+Customizations in terms of appearance+Tech tree is good+Building placement is fun+Continual improvements by devsCons-Ship models don't look as good as workshop models-Some questionable balancing (building ships to move 30+ spaces, overlapping starbase bonuses on colonies)-Still needs some polish-Not enough music. Seems like only a few tracks of music.A note on building ships. Why is it many space 4X games out there feel the need to let players completely customize ships? I feel this usually leads to broken designs and the AI just can't compete against players who know what weapons and defenses to stack and so on.Anyways, it's said that next year GC3 is getting a major overhaul + expansion. Needless to say I'm looking forward to this very much.			"

								This game takes what I loved from it's predecessor and improved upon many of the things that I didn't like. The AI is constantly being improved and I have no doubts that by release it will be up to par. Not only that but Stardock has earned my trust and respect, something no other gaming company has managed. I have zero doubts about the sucess of the game or the continued development throughout it's lifetime. The biggest bonus for me was adding in multiplayer. GALCIV was a game that I would play while deployed or in a situation where I didn't have access to the internet. Now it is a game that I enjoy much more frequently, and with the company of my friends and family.			"

Early Access Review
								It's been a long journey, and now it's finally ready. If only you knew half of what this game went through in the beta. The devs really kicked butt and got a mountain of good work done in the month before release.Just as with GalCiv 2 before it, the spaceship designer is the best part about this game - like playing with a customizeable box of Legos, you can take pieces from anything in the game at all, resize them, stretch them, double them along both lines of symmetry, move the lines of symmetry to wherever you want, and animate anything. That's not to say the default designs aren't amazing -- heck, they're so good, you could go the whole game using just the default designs and never feel bad about it, but the personal touch you get from designing your own ship will make you excited to play future games, where you know exactly what techs you need to start making those ships (the designs stay with you until you delete them).Obviously, this isn't just a spaceship designer, it's a space 4x, and it is a deserving successor of the GalCiv franchise. Everything is bigger, better, and with more room for expansion. The move up to 64 bit allowed the devs to go nuts with features, and even more stuff is on the way. Best of all, GalCiv 3 is easy to mod, and mod support is better than ever. Don't like the default balance? Changing it is as easy as opening an XML and changing a few numbers. Once it gets integrated into the Steam Workshop, the floodgates will open. Make an awesome ship design and want to share it with the world? Do it.I honestly didn't think this game would be ready in time when I saw the release date. The devs done went and proved me wrong, and I couldn't be happier.			"

Early Access Review
								Just so you know. I've played all of the previous Galactic Civ series and all of the Master Orions before that. This is the succcessor to those and it shows.  While the game is still in beta, it certainly playable and new things are being finished/adjusted and added regularly. Going to 64 bit only has really allowed them to make immense glaxay settings available, so much so that you can't get all of the possible galaxy on a 1920x1080 monitor at once. :)Many things are similar or familar but with tweaks. Most obvious first change is that the game map is now hexagon based. The tech trees are per race, and there are big differences per race. As another reviewer noted, it's easier to build your colonies with automated updates, but as they now give bonuses for similar neighbooring improvements so careful  planning can be game changing. You have significant off planets things to mine or harvest- asension crystals, artifacts, resources and asteriods (although asteroid mining isn't implemented as of Beta 4). Grabbing these can also make a large difference in the game, depending on your play style. 6 or 7 different ways to triumph, including a turn limit/overall score mode, make this version potentially superior to the previous ones replayibility and variety. The beta isn't polished or complete, but is worth having. Oh, did I mention multiplayer? Haven't tried it yet, but should be interesting to see how they keep it moving. Buy this. The nice thing is that Stardock has a great history of continuing development (not just bug fixes) way past the point more rational developers would start making the next version. You can tell that this a labor of love.			"

Sadly it's so good that if I don't uninstall it I'll spend way too much time on it.I strongly recommend using the DLCs and mods from nexusmods.com that add variety to planet types, planet features and colonisation events.Like any good 4X it offers challenging choices, like prioritising techs or choosing whether to run a planet down to expand to others or to send colonists from a further planet that could use a drop in populace. Whether to get all the anomalies early or to concentrate on finding habitable planets. Whether to sacrifice growth for a while to build a factory. Whether to lurch for a tech to improve a large planet or concentrate on techs that help all your planets but less each. I could go on for hours.The best space 4X I've found so far.Recommended unreservedly.10/10One day when I have the time I'll install it (or one of its sequels) again.			"

												**Disclaimer: I love the game and recommend it highly but I have one specific area of extreme disappointment which is completely based on my opinion of a single gameplay element.**So, 200+ hours in and I have lots of great things to say about this game. I have fond memories of previous installations of this series and I was immediately rewarded with enjoyment and relatively bug-free gameplay from day one of install. I have been a pre-release backer of this game for a good while, and I almost uniformly hate pre-release games and early release iterations of the ""finished"" product. This game, however, is an exception.I spent my first half-hour post-release immediately building a custom civilization, modding in leader foreground and profile pictures and generally tinkering with the galaxy and opponent settings. I love the customizability of the game, the depth of scope is up to you, the density of worlds, number of foes, opponent preferences and play styles, the ability to define your race, its ships, styles and techs, and so much more. The game is deep and yet streamlined to really make for easy navigation and hands-off (if you prefer) gameplay through governing, templates and auto-building (using star-base requested constructors etc.)I am in the middle of a game currently and will expand on this review shortly, after the Drengin succumb to my planetary bombardment of their home world, but alas I was driven to write regarding a particular feature of the game that can be exceedingly off-putting to some players. This feature is as-intended but could (and should be) modified slightly for players who dislike it for reasons noted below.As in Gal Civ II, there is a built in surrender feature that the AI will use to effectively give-up and hand over the remnants of its civilization to either the player or a friendly AI (based on diplomacy and relations). This feature can be exciting when it works in your favor, or even when it doesn't. This feature can also add to late-game fun or end a long-slog of conquests planet-by-planet that can end a ""won"" game. Now, the problem I have with the feature is its inability to be turned off, as it can drastically alter a game you might have been enjoying, for example, a huge build-up, an initial invasion and then sudden, irrational and instant capitulation of every planet in your enemy's empire after the loss of a single border world, or even just a few ships. This is entirely my opinion but I see it too often. I see empires, thirty worlds strong, casually give their home world and all their people to another race, and just ""quit,"" based on a relative difference in power to their foe, without even fighting, trying, altering strategy (or ship weapons/defenses), going after strategic resources or using diplomatic means to isolate the foe or recruit allies. This feature is too vaguely defined, and often far too quickly enacted. Would humanity just capitulate outright to an alien species or would we fight, even to a bitter last stand? Now, there are times where it makes sense, but races surrender sometimes to enemies, often ones they are already at war with, to spite the stronger aggressor. This can quickly unbalance games, throw off strategy and realism and steal your fun if you haven't even begun to fight and they are immediately giving up.This is a personal nit-pick for me, and I don't want it to discourage people from buying the game, as it's the only thing at all I have had any issues with, the game is polished and otherwise excellent. I only want people to be aware that you can very quickly see your long-time allies causally surrender without losing a planet to their most random neighbor, or a race across the entire galaxy at the opening of a conflict. You might also unfortunately inherit a cash-drained empire, whose ships and worlds sink you into instant debt. You cannot refuse the surrender, you cannot oppose it. My one hope is that this feature will be able to be toggled on and off at some point, as I would love to fight my foes to the end, or see the weaker of two forces try other tactics to tip the scales. Change their force consistency to target enemy weaknesses (ex.: exploiting the enemy’s lack of shields, or countering their missiles with point-defenses), maybe target star-base mined resources, recruit allies diplomatically, ask for embargos, petition the United Planets for a peace-keeping force/funds or sanctions or simply fight on until they cannot resist any longer. Too often I get the Thalan empire randomly surrendering their whole populace and territory, despite my having nearly no contact with them, simply because they lost a single world to rampaging Yor forces. I've had Altarians surrender with twenty planets and a huge military (larger than my own in fact), simply because they fought a few turns with the Krynn who were only slightly more powerful.My only gripe, my only wish would be to see the surrender mechanic changed to be toggle-able.Beyond that, throw your money at this game, it's worth it. I have another three or four hundred hours to go before I even consider another game, and with the frequent patches, updates and interesting tweaks, I may find myself dragged in even longer. Please support the game, do purchase it, and do have long late nights of losing sleep to the one-more-turn nature of this amazing game. And thank you, if you've read this far. I'll expand on specifics and features in a tl;dr format soon.			"

								I do not really do reviews, but this great game deserves to be praised.If you like 4X games, especially MOO2, then this is for you.I have over 400 hours of play on the Beta, and it keeps getting better and better, the latest update has improved the AI and the challange on the harder settings has certainly been beefed up.Fantastic replayability, custom races, custom galaxy, victory conditions, tech developement rates, etc etcGreat game, great value for money, and great fun!

												More of an upgrade to GalCiv II than a sequal. With Workshop integration you have more races to choose from, though the game only supports a max of 100, and I've found that the more you have, the more likely there is going to be a conflict causing a CTD.The game itself is as fun as II, except for the constant CTDs for whatever reasons. I very much feel like I'm back in the EU2 era of Paradox games.Fun, but can't be recommended at this time.			"

												If you loved GalCivII  you'll like the improvements. Many of the best elements from the earlier franchise made it into the modern version. Biggest complaint is the dialogue, both poorly written and filled with spelling errors - at the premium price (even waiting for $20 off) there is no excuse. In GalCiv II the options presented when founding a colony were written in a way that aided gameplay, but in GalCiv III I keep wishing they'd end their paragraphs a sentence earlier.Other than this bother, it is a fun and improved version worthy of its namesake.

								Being in a beta develpoment stage, I would say that the game has great potential. Although I cannot say it would be better than its predecessors as I have not played them (yet). All my concerns and gripes are all pointed at the fact that it is still a  game in beta. Graphical anamolies such as seeing glowing orbs (these are not stars, smartasses) of various colors and sizes flicker across the screen when moving, strategic resources being disgiused as Dead Worlds (I assume that its a placeholder) and varying amounts of lag/stutter when zooming in and out between the strategic view and getting in close enough for models to be visible. Other than this, I found it pretty enjoyable for what it is currently and I am eagerly waiting for the full release.			"

												This game is everything I could want in a Space 4X.  I like the political mechanics and combat especially.  They're fun and simple and fast.  The adjacency bonuses for developing worlds is a nice little strategic addition to the game that makes colonizing fun.  Ship customization takes a little while to get used to, but having that option is nice.  It can really speed up expansion and development of star bases.Great work, Stardock! Peace,-Troy			"

												GalCiv3 has everything you want in a space-based 4X game.  Much of it is customizable: the size of the galaxy, density and frequency of stars, planets and so forth.  You can create your own customizable race, reminiscent of Master of Orion 2, though not quite the same level of detail.  The best part, I find, is designing your own ships.  There are plenty of premade ships that will appear in the list as you gain the technology to field them.  But you also have the choice of constructing a ship out of parts, adding in the equipment you desire, and building those.And it has the same glaring bug that all good 4X games have (Civ, Endless Space, Warlock...), it's around turn 300 or so that you find it's 3am in the morning and you should go to bed.But... one more turn.

												Galactic Civiliations 3 is a sequal to the popular Galactic Civilizations 2 and builds upon the various features of the previous game. This game allows you to game as 8 different races (in the base game) or a 9th race if you what to create your own races within the game. This is a feature I love and as a result have grown to love the game. Galactic Civilizations also allows you to create your own starships from strach using a unqiue editor found no where else. This is another great feature. Mulitplayer was introduced in this game and I loved it to bits. Hopefully it comes back in future installments of the series.However despite all the good things stated above the pacing of the game feels a bit forced when on it's defults which is how I first played the game. That pacing can be changed, but to someone who did know how to do that made the game a challenge, prepapes too hard for the new comer I was to the game. The A.I in the game however doesn't feel as fluid as in the previous game and can make some horriable judgements and can go to war for aparent reason oother than poking them, which for me can drag away from the main experience.Despite all of it's flaws I'd definetly recomend this game to others who enjoy the genre of game this falls under and hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

												GalCiv III is another solid entry in the series from Stardock. It is your typical 4x space game, with somewhat dry lore, with the addition of a racial morality system, complete with perks. The early gameplay is actually quite peaceful and focuses on expansion and diplomacy. It is not until the mid-game is reached that the technology for invading planets with billions of soldiers is unlocked. As with the previous entries, there are a multitude of win conditons: diplomatic, cultural, ascension to a higher plane of being, research, military, etc. The combat is automated and is based on a sort of rock-paper-scissors model, which allows the AI to be a competent oppent. Overall, solid AI provides a decent challenge. If you like creating and building neat spaceships, fear not, for this game features an extensive ship creator, allowing huge freedom in designing the look and loadout of your craft.			"

												By far the largest, most immersive, and complex strategy game available.  Beautiful graphics up to 4K resolution and possibly higher.  The size of the largest maps put to shame every predecessor.  I mean, these things actually resemble small galaxies in scope.  I think the one I'm playing on has over a thousand solar systems, and I'm not quite sure if I picked the largest size available.  You might infer from the previous information that, despite streamlining and concerted efforts to fight excessive micromanagement that was rampant in the previous game (and, really, any game of this type), playing on the larger maps will still require lots of time per turn, excellent memory, and a sharp eye for enemy actions.  I've probably put.....20 hours or more into my current match, and I would consider it to still be in the early-mid-game stage.  The ship designer is back, retaining all of its former glory and with even more features.  The funky variable-hardpoint system of the previous game has been reevaluated, so that parts artificially labeled as 'small', 'medium', etc. generally have the same number of spots now, cleaning things up a bit.  The tech tree feels a bit less expansive than before, but still outclasses most competing games.Anyways, back to playing GC3 - and back to enjoying brilliant explosions, highly detailed planets and planetesimals, and of course some damn good gameplay.Edit: Oh, I forgot to mention - the AI that shamed Deep Blue is back to put you in your place again, though some others playing have mentioned that it might not be quite as cunning anymore.

												It might be the game I will be playing a lot in a couple of years. It's not there yet.  You might want to read the reviews on the expansion to understand the current state of the game, bellow is my impression some months after release. [Review from the game's 3rd major update]The game is far from what it should have been. I've backed the game in the alpha stage, but after reading into what they were planning to do, have avoided playing it too much prior to its release as, I didn't wanted to spoil my experience after that point. Now, in perspective, I should have waited even more for the game to be completed... but here we are. As with the previous Gal Civ, I've spent most of my time playing this game in the designer mode. In this new iteration, the designer is even better, if you can believe it. If you like Sci-Fi, you'll really like designing your own space faring armada. And with the changes they've made, ships will look more smooth and you'll have more options in terms of angles and shapes. With mods, this can only get better in time. If the developer adds more artefacts, it would really be awesome.However, this great feature isn't, yet, backed up by a balanced and immersive game. There are tons of little misgivings that ruin immersion and I won't go into details to avoid spoilers. Game balance is a big issue though. For me the experience started on the wrong foot, the map didn't spawned the resources required once I've changed the defaults of a new game. Think how it feels finding this out 50h into a savegame. Once you learn how to workaround all these issues and spend several hours to epxand, you'll run into the AI issues. In my case, the AI was passive in many playthroughs. I was the only player on the map with fighting capable ships for 1/3 of the duration of the playthrough in some of my games. I've tried changing my playstyle to see if anything changes. Nope. The AI does an aggressive job at some of the Xs out of the 4x. Exploration and expansion are performed gregariously by the AI, they don't know how to exterminate once they reach another player's borders, human or AI. Also, it's not clear to me how does the AI have the resources to spawn as many ships as it does (it might have been fixed with the latest patches, but it's really hard to playtest this, players don't have enough time for it and it should be counted as a negative for the developers for letting this slip by to begin with). Improvements from the previous Gal Civ 2, like the hex pattern and adjancency bonuses, are nice and all, but they add too little to the gameplay to compensate. They're great ideas, but it's not enough and considering that the game feels poorly balanced, they don't really compensate for the shortcomings. Other nitpicks. The UI looks nice, but it's not well thought through. Elements that are required are barely visible, while non-functional elements take most of the screen (in the designer or shipyard for example). Diplomacy is rather childish and the text options are repetitive. Game length is too high considering what it has to offer. Customisation exists, but you'll be more likely to run into gamedesign limitations and functional issues if you attempt such a thing (for me it's a plus that a developer even attempts such a level of customisation, even if they fail, because it's a dying art in the game industry and I would hate losing it - still, people should know what they get into). In conclusion: I will try to complete a game from time to time, but I'll be returning to GC3 because of the designer, unless it improves considerably.			"

												I would very cautiously recommend this game to others, but only if you know what you're getting into. The learning curve on this game is incredibly steep. I have 53+ hours in, and I think I might be starting to grasp some of the basics of the game. I'm really interested in the ship design aspect, but find that it's incredibly difficult to get enough tech options to make ship building worthwhile and not get crushed by the AI, or run completely out of money, etc. Still, I would definitely play multiplayer games, and I suspect that, with enough practice, this could be an extremely fun game.Right now, though, it's mostly just an extremely frustrating game.

												it is just missing something.Galactic Civilisations presents itself as, well Civilisation in space. It feels a lot like Endless Space. I descended into chaos quickly, having lost all sense of direction, of where my ships are, who my current victim should be. Or where I was sending wich of my seemingly countless ships and Constructors, some of wich, I later realized, weren't even ones I built, but wich were automaticly built by the system as part of Space-Station upgrades, and were now clustering my view.War and battle are really a LOT like Endless Space, you can either build some generic ships, or create your own versions, wich are generally stronger and/or cheaper. But you have absolutley no controll over the battle. None.Whatsoever.You can watch.kinda.because camera-movement is, lets say impared, you can zoom in on the fight, and wonder what the h**l your captains are thinking, or you can not, because you simply cannot find them and are basically lost until you either win, or lose. if you choose not to view the battle (it really doesn't make a difference) you are back to Cilvisation in Space, not bad, but not excatly terrific either.Recommendation: Buy if it is on sale for a few bucks, but honestly, Stardock has done so much better.

												I really hesitated on this one as I no longer trust the developer. I loved GCiv II but the final expansion was never completed, almost all AI persnalities were broken (2 worked), the tech tree was broken etc. Most people never realized this simply because they didn't get very in depth into it. Hardcore fans did though, and ended up having to overhaul/fix the entire game, tech etc. through modding. Unfortunately, the AI was still severely lacking in differences/depth since only 2 were useable and the community was unable to fix that.That said I loved the previous one, and wanted this one bad but didn't get it until now (on sale 73% off with all DLC). It's pretty much everything the second was, but with active development. I see a lot of reviews saying it's not as good, but I have a realistic memory of the previous and this is an upgrade. Plus with active development for the period it's had basic things like tech trees work and were not abanoned entirely. This is better than Galciv II.The big negative for me is the game crashes, a lot. I'm on a gaming rig i7 etc. etc. and usually ignore the ""I have a new computer and this game crashes a lot"" type of reviews as generally anyone that says ""new"" rather than their specs doesn't really know better. I never really have issues when people make such comments. This time it's different, there are a lot of crashes. Hopefully that gets fixed, but for now as I don't play multiplayer it just means I'll have to make sure autosave is set frequently. It doesn't destroy the game, just makes it a little frustrating for me anyways. With frequent saves and an SSD it shouldn't be a huge issue, but should definitely be addressed.TL;DRThoughts-Developer has a history of not completing what they start, this made me wary of even purchasing the game I really wanted. Rather than wary, I am now a little worried with the crashes.-This dev has a very poor history with their AI. I haven't gottten far enough in to judge it yet.-Haven't tried Stellaris, initial looks are that it's an incomplete game, so I can't compare it. Very limited in genre competition though.Pros-Upgraded Galactic Civ II in active development, which in itself is a great game. 100% worth getting but only when the entire bundle is heavily on sale.-Much more content than the new MOO.-Much more of a playable game state than Endless Space 2.Cons-Frequent crashes (not so bad with SSD and frequent saves if you stick with single player).-Every update is DLC, crashes really need to be addressed though. The history of the company really makes me uncomfortable on this one. The DLC total is very steep, who knows how far they'll go with it.-If you do get it and want to stop being forced to build ships, there's a hard to notice little checkbox at the bottom of shipyards saying ""Don't notify me when queue is empty."" (Interface is very unintuitive in general)Overall I reccomend it due to the lack of competition in genre, and because at heart it is a good game. The price is way too steep on anything less than a 70% off bundle though.			"

												This is a fantastic take on the 4X genre. As Sid Meier would say, the game is full of interesting decisions. which is a subtlety that a lot of 4X games seem to miss: if a decision isn't interesting, it's just busywork. Planetary management is well done and a notch above what you'd find in a typical Civilization-style game. Instead of building all the buildings, you instead place them on a hex grid map of the planet. Even here there are interesting decisions to be made, as the limited room requires both determining what buildings to construction as well as where to build them. In GC3, buildings provide Adjacency Bonuses, and these are important to take into consideration when building out your planet's infrastructure. For example, a Solar power generator provides adjacency bonuses to factories. Do you try to squeeze that solar plant in to create a powerful production world, even though it might mean not having room for another farm or planetary defenses?While many techs are largely shared between the various races, each race also has their own unique techs. For instance the Krynn, a personal favorite of mine, has tech lines and buildings related to Influence and Morale (to those familiar with Civ4/5, think culture and happiness, respectively). Other races like the Drengin are much more military focused in their techs.Unique techs aren't the only thing separating the races, however. Each race comes with it's own set of statistical bonuses and maluses, but they also have a couple Traits. These traits might provide free colony upgrades on colonization, drone ships to patrol planets and starbases, and various other benefits. One of the races is mechanoid in nature, which means that population must be constructed, not grown. Taken together with the unique techs, each race is left with a distinct feel and looks to provide a lot of replayability. If none of the races appeal to you, the game comes with a custom race editor built into the game where you can set up your own.The combat in the game is not fought out in manually controlled tactical battles like Sword of the Stars, instead you watch as your fleet arrays against the opposing forces and engages in battle. This is where you can glean important information in terms of what kind of ships your enemy is fielding. You can get this information while watching the battle unfold, but the game also provides a detailed battle overview at the end so you can see what weaknesses you might have that your opponent is exploiting, or where you can press your advantage. This means that ship design is important, but if you're the type who doesn't want to bother with designing your own units, the game comes with a plethora of built-in ships. Just be aware that the AI can and will make use of any devious designs you create!Speaking of AI, I'm only 20+ hours into the game so far so by no means an expert, but the AI thus far has given me a hefty challenge without relying on cheats and resource bonuses (those are available too, but at higher difficulties. If you play against Gifted, the AI fights to the best of it's ability and it's more than a match for me thus far!). This is a welcome relief for me, as shoddy AI has sabotaged many promising strategy games in my catalog.An additional avenue of customization is done in game, and that is the Ideology system. Events happen throughout the game such as when colonizing planets as well as random events that will occur. You will be presented with three choices, each related to one of the three Ideologies: Benevolent, Pragmatic, and Malevolent. Selecting a choice related to a particular Ideology will grant you points in that category, which you can use to unlock various bonuses and perks from their respective trees (each Ideology has 4 different bonus lines). You're not locked into one Ideology, but unlocking new perks does get progressively more expensive as you open them up, so choose wisely. Each decision also typically comes with it's own bonuses and penalties, so it's not always an easy decision on which to go with. For example you might be wanting to focus on Pragmatic ideology, but when colonizing a world that you plan to make your research center might have a -20% research penalty associated with it. Do you take the Pragmatic approach despite the penalty, or do you opt for one of the other two? One again, it's an example of frequently making interesting decisions throughout the game.I'll wrap it up here, but in conclusion I think this game is a no-brainer for fans of the 4X genre. It's smart, elegant, the AI can put up a fight, and I feel the game is well polished for a 1.0 release. The additional of Multiplayer support in GalCiv3 might only be of interest to the minority (one that I am part of), but for those who like to play a game with friends or have a quick match against others online, it's a fantastic feature that is often missing in many strategy games.Go buy the game!

Early Access Review
								Only have 4 hours of play thus far.  I like where this is going and I am looking forward to follow-on updates. Not sure if I am doing something wrong, but the screen is not centering on the battles in progress, so it is sometimes a puzzle to know where to send reinforcements. I like to have the tech tree open when I choose a new tech, so it is annoying to have to click down to it each time a new tech needs to be reseacrhed. I do like the notifications that I am getting like shipyard idle, colony idle, etc.  It would be nice to have (or be made aware of) a keyboard shortcut for some actions. Keep up the good work.			"

												Purchased this game thinking it would weigh up against Sins of a Solar Empire, which is very good. This game is the following: Very bugged. Crashes constantly. DLC is lame. Flat civilization3-like layout. Conclusion: Play Stellaris instead for more advanced diplomacy experiences and dynamics as well as less bugs.			"

												Good game, really goes for your hours played record. Will feel familiar to anyone whos played either of the previous 2. New players may find the game a little difficult to get into at the start as the game doesnt really tell you alot & the tech tree is flippin huge!!!!! its worth sticking with & the designing of your own ships is still one of the best features in a game (you really can spend hours on this without trying, more games should do this)I do think the single player game difficulty levels need to be tweeked a bit, the level between normal & challenging feels a little too wide - normal often being way too easy & challenging maybe a little too so with certain setupsStill one of the better space strategy series out there "

												Multiplayer turns are not asychronous - what I mean by this, is everybody has to be in the game at the same time to take a turn.  Which means multiplayer isn't fun/realistic.  Sure it's fine when you're  playing before turn  250, but when turns take 10-20 minutes.  Asychronous multiplayer is a must for a game like this. You'll probably end up playing single player anyways.  Which means you should buy DIstant Worlds Universe.  It's the best 4x out there right now.   Really it comes down to the AI.  THE AI in Distant Worlds Universe is unmatchable.  "

												After passing 60 games I figured it's about time I write some reviews about them as well, so here we go.A few days back I bought this game as it seemed quite interesting based on the trailer and pictures. Truth be told it still is. I love getting together a nice fleet, build a bunch of ARC 170 fighters from Star Wars (I found it on Steam Workshop) and I simply love massive fights with them!However this is also pretty much all I like about this game...When I started I had no idea about designing ships and I just built the ones made by default and found myself having a quite weak fleet being massacrated over and over again. Not until I finally started to design my own ships and focus more upon economical and military research (and a lot on reducing size of everything, creating more space in the ships and get the logistics up) did I get any progress at all. I mean I seriously spent about 20 hours stuck in the first mission trying to figure out how I would counter all these continuous attacks coming from all sides! Don't get me wrong though, I got addicted to this challenge, but I feel that the default ships made by the AI should have more balanced in defenses (and not only go for either shield or armor).After I finally won the first mission after 28 hours (I've never spent more than maybe 2-3 hours on the same mission in a game before <_<) I started playing the 2nd mission. This one came down as a real bummer because first of all I couldn't use the ships and planets from my past mission, secondly my designs were all gone and thirdly a large part of the research I had done was reset! This made the game feel unnatural and I felt I had been sent to a paralell universe or was playing a new faction or something. In my opinion a game should always continue where one left off and not ignore the players work and achievements. It just makes all the work and effort seem wasted...Now despite this I would say that it is somewhat fun, but I think I will stop playing the campaign since I can't stand all my work being reset every time I make some progress in the story...I overall I would say this game gets a 5,5/10. I don't want to give it a 6 as I am quite divided about recommending it, but at the same time I feel it barely passes the requirements for being recommended, mainly due to the challenge that took me 28 hours to solve.

												It is a superb 4X game with an amazing depth. Top points for the excellent designer, the strategymap, the starbases. However diplomacy is rather mediocre and feels more like accounting. Also it is a REAL SHAME that there are only 3 missions in the campaign mode. The first two missions are rather boring, the last one is very good. But really...3 missions? So very good quality but very poor quantity for the money.			"

												Still has a ways to go. At the start, gameplay is fantastic: Smooth, reasonably fast, and interactions are as expected. As you progress into larger maps though, the game becomes increasingly slower, and is prone to crashes left and right, typically during the next turn/save-game cycle, but not consistently (so do not disable the feature with the hopes of resolving the crash issue). On my LT, I also get random BSOD's as the game gets on in turns (this is the only game/application to have this issue on my LT, and it is not the hardware or drivers).It is very disappointing to have a new title that actively advertises their new massive universe and features, yet still releases the title with such glaring stability issues.A for intent, but a C on delivery, and a D for follow through.DT - W7P, 2x E5540 @2.53GHz, 48GB DDR3 ECC RAM, Samsung 840 PRO, GTX 760 @ 2560x1080LT - W7P, i7 3630QM, 32GB DDR3, Samsung 840 PRO, GTX670M @ 1920x1080			"

												Well. I've been getting to know GC III over the last week or so and I have to say its underwhelming. It is quite playable and good fun, but there have been so many poor choices made with the interface and optimisation that larger games are a trial.  Little things like having groups of ships appear anywhere as groups in an easily selectable format, rather than every ship being in a single track which doesn't indicate if the ship is part of a particular group or on the other side of the galaxy. The interface for extracting ships from starbases from planets could also be much better. If each fleet or ship had flag that was visible on the map that you could click on to see what it was composed of, that would be awesome. Same with planets and starbases. This game is also a system hog, slightly crash prone, and end of turn is also quite slow as every single AL action is played out before the turn will progress. I will check back in 6 months to see what has changed, but at the moment, its finish and functionality is about comparable to Rome 2 on launch day. Fun and playable, but VERY clunky.			"

Therefore I can only recommend it for avid fans of the series but not in general.UPDATE April 2016:===============Not enough has changed since release. The game is still not nearly as good as Galactic Civilization II with its addons is. Wasted my money here on 2  Elite Founder Editions.			"

Early Access Review
								Excellent game by a team the truly listens to and respects their fans. Check the forums and all you will see are ""thank you's"" from the team for bug reports and suggestions; NO excuses or lip service. The Beta ran better then many so called completed games I have purchased. I write this review on the last day of Beta. Excellent game that rewards and leans towards strategic gameplay; it is lite on combat and a ton of fun for any armchair galactic emperors. An excellent tutorial will get you started and map sizes allow for games that can take anywhere from a few hours to days. Fully customizable gameplay, and ships. I am not too much on the ship thing but changing the gameplay to suit my mood works great here. For anyone who enjoys this type of game it's a ""must buy"". It is second only to Civ 5 for me in 4X but different enough to be worth owning both. I have played all three versions of GC and enjoyed each one which has always been better then the last. Stardock has in the past always supported their fans for years after release with upgrades and DLC making any investment in their games a good one.			"

												Galactic Civilizations 3 feels like its in beta, because it haves so many game changing glitches. They introduced some new mechanics, removed others and held others from Galactic Civilizations 2. Here is some problems I found that makes the gameplay loses its immersion:- A.I. in war with each other just stand next to each other making some attacks 50 by 50 turns.I had Drengin and Marauders fighting each other in my territory for over 100 turns and each one of them had 4 fleets staring at each other but they just don't attacked each other.- Alliances doesn't matter anymore. That's right! One of the funniest things in GalCiv 2 doesn't work anymore. If you are allied with someone and other faction declares war with you, too bad, your allies don't care at all. In GalCiv 2 when someone declares war at one of your allies you have only 2 options: Declare war on the attacker or break alliance.- Battle view is broken, if you choose to watch a battle of your fleet, you watch it with 1 result then it justs do a quick battle after and with a completely different result and that counts, the previous one don't.- The A.I. declares a war or ends a war randomly. The events dont have any connection at all when its between A.I and A.I.- The United Planets... God its annoying. They propose the same thing over and over and over again. With 20 united planets meetings in my playthrough 11 of them was to propose the same festival (10% morale bonus all races), 6 to elect the chair race (and my race was not mentioned ever), 1 to end all wars, and 2 to other random events. Here is some new mechanics in GalCiv 3:- You now have a territory, not just that old influence territory, now other races haves to negotiate an Open Borders treat with you to legally stay in your territory. And if you refuse? They just stay anyway and you receive a spam message in your notifications inbox EVERY SINGLE TURN, and you don't have a way to disable it. And if you enter another race territory without permission they starts to dislike you.- Your planets now have a ""standby"" mode. You can choose to increase economic, research or influence by 5%. If you don't know this the game just don't let you pass the turn, you have to google it to learn and continue your playthrough.- Now when you have an Idle colony, ship, shipyard or just finished a research, your ""pass turn"" button turno into idlecolony, ship etc. The weird part is that you have to set the ship to explore, survey or guard to ignore it.Here is some improvements from GalCiv 2:- Graphics.- Sounds.- The grid(map). It's the most beautiful grid I've ever seen in a turn based game, and you can rotate, zoom, move however you like. Awesome!- Instead of building ships in a planet now you have to build shipyards that stands in space. You have the option to unanchor it and move it 1 square each turn but the farthest from the sponsors planet the slowest you build. And you can have more than one planet sponsoring each shipyard, which is very nice.- Custom races: You can now choose more details of your custom race, it helps when you decide to play against them. You can even change the images of the race.- The ideology tree and ideology points are much better now. There are powerful ideology skills to choose from.I don't recommend the game. I bought it with 50% discount and I regret it. Just buy Galactic Civilizations 2 Complete instead, you will have much more fun. Maybe I will play this game next year to see if some glitches have been patched.Edit: Added my opinion on ideology.			"

												After hours of this game I still have not had enough! New graphics give the game a more modern feel and extra features like the galactic resources add more depth to what was already one of the most diverse turn based games I have played. For players who are hesitant about a turn based game verses a real time game, I personally like the turn based as well because it allows me time to sit and think about big moves and tactics without worrying about falling behind in the game. With many more updates promised by the developers, I am sure I will be playing for a while.Pros: -Almost unlimited variety of unit types, you can make custom units. -Create custom enemies/allies as well! -Even has (a few) single player missions on top of the variety in the randomly generated games! -One of the best strategy games I have played, if not the bestCons: -Late game can be very micromanagement intensive, even with all the helpers (maybe i just haven't figured everything out yet still?) -Big games can take a very long time and yet you want to finish them in one sitting (not recommended). -Interface can be a little overwhelming the first time, this game takes a few goes to get the hang of			"

								The king of the 4x strategies is back! With updated graphics, polished mechanics and unchanged addictiveness. If you like building a galactic empire, fight epic space ship battles, or just 4x games is general, then GC3 is the right choice. Just watch out for a race of space faring murderous squirrels.			"

								I played Master of Orion for hours and hours.  I played MOO2 for even longer.  The only thing this doesnt have is the tactical combat.  I find myself not missing it as much as I thought I would.  I played Age of Wonder III for a bit and found myself bypassing a lot of the tactical battles.  Its got a good story and fun races to play plus you can make your own.  I have played a lot of 4x space games since MOO2 and this is the only one I think about outside of when I am playing it.  Having a blast with this game and Stardock is starting to get a nice polish on it.			"

												Great Game!  But it needs A LOT of polish.  Among other things, there are many bugs.  Also, even with the DLC, there is a lack of game mechanics compared to GC2;  astroid mining, more interesting game events (not recycled/similar events with different names), etc.  That said, this is going to be amazing when it's ""finished.""  For now,  it's a work in progress like most games are these days.  Now, all this said, if you're looking for the best 4x, Sci-fi / Space Opera, turn based, strategy game, this is it!  It just isn't in its final form.  Lastly, I do not recommend that you purchase this game at full price considering its current state.  I would wait for a sale and then buy it with ALL the DLC.  No offense Stardock, maybe I'm just a little bitter that I bought this game a year ago and it was so buggy and in such a shamful state that I couldn't stand to play it until many patches and DLC fixed some of the issues.

												It's an alright game, however it still has a few issues.  First the larger maps will slow to a crawl when you get further into them, eventually becoming unplayable.  The game itself feels like a downgrade in almost every way to GalCiv 2 and it lacks some of the things that made that game great.  The ""difficulty"" aspect is non-existent, the devs basically just gave the AI such massive advantages even on normal difficulty that the player is always behind (though still easy to win because the AI is awful.)  Finally it charges five extra dollars for a bunch of things that should've already been in the game.  Those are only the major issues, there are a bunch of minor negative things about this game as well.  Overall it just feels boring, I can't get involved too deeply into it despite spending a ton of time on GalCiv 2 and multiple other space-based 4x.I recommend no if only because it's not worth $50+$20 dollar for the DLC.

												To be honest I have never been a hardcore 4X gamer and my only real experience to 4X was way back in the day with Birth of the Federation (good times) and then more recently Civilization V. So as more of a casual coming into Galactic Civilization 3 I didn't know what to expect due to the numerous comments on the learning curve and crashes/bugs.I will have to say that the game isn't too hard to pick up honestly. I've played far more difficult games as far as entry level is concerned (Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis 4). The tutorial campaign could use a little more polish to teach you some of the more unexplained nuances, which sadly there is a lot of. For example, it doesn't explain very well ship roles. It also doesn't explain the more intricate part of starbases and just how important they actually are. But really I was off and racing experimenting with a few practice games and I also picked up a few tips outside of the game online. However that doesn't mean I have become by all means excellent. I feel like I am picking up new techniques and research build orders everytime I play. In addition to that the difficulty does seem really challenging even on normal. I am very calculated and careful in my play yet the AI always seem to end up leaps and bounds ahead and this is usually due to the fact that faction power is calculated largely off of ships you have on the map at any one stage.The game runs very smoothly for the most part. I have a decent gaming rig with and SSD, 16Gb Ram and a GTX960 and the graphics are nice and smooth, however I feel it does need a little optimization. For example when scrolling the map especially on large and above maps with the anti-aliasing tunred up and draw grid map enabled there are little pauses here and there. So bare in mind it is good but not perfect. Lowering the AA down to 4 or 2 especially for large maps and above is pretty useful to iron out the tiny half second lag you get on large and above maps. However having said all that it's a treat looking over the bright star and nebula filled galaxies in the game. Turns in later games and on larger maps are pretty quick too so far (now about 18 hours into it). Granted I haven't started a super huge map loaded with races just yet but I aim to do that in the near future. The honey moon period is starting to wear off the game but so far it's still okay, honestly this game can keep me glued to the computer for hours. I don't even realise sometimes how much time has passed. If a game can do that to you, then it's clearly a good game right? The game has a great ship creator (love the 3D printing support by the way - regardless of me not having a 3D printer).The depth of the game really comes from the way you pick your research and how you manage your resources and planets and diplomacy and a little more annoyingly starbase management too. It is a fun game and I could honestly if it weren't for kids and work sit there for hours and let the days and months dwindle away until I have completed a huge map and emerge from my cave soiled and hairy.Anyways give the game a go, the developers are great and are working closely with the Community to better develop the game. I have however become skeptical of the price of the DLC vs actual content. This does feel al little over the top to pay $5 for ""events"". The game is no doubt fun but I see many online starting to call out Stardock on their DLC content. Give it a go you may just become addicted like I have!UPDATED: 17/03 - To reflect my current thoughts after giving the game a more decent amount of time.			"

Early Access Review
								Brilliant, brilliant game. Like GalCiv2 - one of the best strategy games ever made - but (far) better-looking, more intuitive and all-round better designed. Have put nearly 60 hours into this baby and that's only Early Access. Stardock promise to support this game for the next 5 years at least, so God knows how much better it's going to get than it already is. 64-bit and multi-core means you can have up to *128* AI players. The largest galaxies are HUGE. It could take you weeks or months (?) to play out a game of that scale with so many opponents. The AI is smart, too, and it's only gonna get smarter.Each game is different if you play with a random galaxy and random opponents in sandbox mode - the potential is almost limitless. This, my friends, is 4x strategy on the grandest scale it gets.There are so many ways to win: military conquest, ascension, alliance victory, technological victory, turn times, influence/cultural victory. The replay value is massive.The game looks and feels great. It sounds good, too. They've got the atmosphere just right. The tech tree is massive and you can build special weapons that can only be made by mining special resources.Design your own ships - these can really make a difference in-game and they look great. Do Star Trek, Star Wars...the possibilites are endless and you are only limited by your imagination. Many players say this feature is one of the best in the game!Diplomacy is intelligent and that will only improve, too. Then there is multiplayer - build empires and tear down those of your friends!What great replay value this game has.It's only going to get better and Stardock has a track record of supporting and constantly improving their products. The Beta currently still has a few glitches but the devs are working hard to fix them.I think this will be one of the games of the year. My simple recommendation is BUY THIS GAME - I promise you will be glad you did!			"

												Reminds me of playing Galctic Civilizations II.  I really enjoy the new editions for this one, especially the faster loading times for the maps.  The only drawback that I have noticed is that most of the time, if I try to reload or start a new game, I just get a black screen.  This really makes it hard to play...  I have to use Alt-F4 to shut it down, and restart it...  If that would be fixed, then it would be perfect.  Until that serious issue is resolved, I cannot currently recommend the game, it is too broken to play.			"

								Excellent game by a team the truly listens to and respects their fans. Check the forums and all you will see are ""thank you's"" from the team for bug reports and suggestions; NO excuses or lip service. The Beta ran better then many so called completed games I have purchased. I write this review on the last day of Beta. Excellent game that rewards and leans towards strategic gameplay; it is lite on combat and a ton of fun for any armchair galactic emperors. An excellent tutorial will get you started and map sizes allow for games that can take anywhere from a few hours to days. Fully customizable gameplay, and ships. I am not too much on the ship thing but changing the gameplay to suit my mood works great here. For anyone who enjoys this type of game it's a ""must buy"". It is second only to Civ 5 for me in 4X but different enough to be worth owning both. I have played all three versions of GC and enjoyed each one which has always been better then the last. Stardock has in the past always supported their fans for years after release with upgrades and DLC making any investment in their games a good one.			"

								I waited until late in the Beta to start playing the game, primarily because I didn't want to get bored of the game before the polished product was available to play.   I have been a long time fan of the series and have been waiting for this game with some trepedation.   Much of the time when you get to the third installment of a game, it begins to get stale.I will say I have really been enjoying the game as it hit the 6.0 beta cycle and it's final polished product is starting to come to light.  I would say if you are planning on buying the game, but were waiting until it was out of beta:  Stop, go ahead and buy it.   It's ready for you.			"

												Galactic Civilizations 3 feels like its in beta, because it haves so many game changing glitches. They introduced some new mechanics, removed others and held others from Galactic Civilizations 2. Here is some problems I found that makes the gameplay loses its immersion:- A.I. in war with each other just stand next to each other making some attacks 50 by 50 turns.I had Drengin and Marauders fighting each other in my territory for over 100 turns and each one of them had 4 fleets staring at each other but they just don't attacked each other.- Alliances doesn't matter anymore. That's right! One of the funniest things in GalCiv 2 doesn't work anymore. If you are allied with someone and other faction declares war with you, too bad, your allies don't care at all. In GalCiv 2 when someone declares war at one of your allies you have only 2 options: Declare war on the attacker or break alliance.- Battle view is broken, if you choose to watch a battle of your fleet, you watch it with 1 result then it justs do a quick battle after and with a completely different result and that counts, the previous one don't.- The A.I. declares a war or ends a war randomly. The events dont have any connection at all when its between A.I and A.I.- The United Planets... God its annoying. They propose the same thing over and over and over again. With 20 united planets meetings in my playthrough 11 of them was to propose the same festival (10% morale bonus all races), 6 to elect the chair race (and my race was not mentioned ever), 1 to end all wars, and 2 to other random events. Here is some new mechanics in GalCiv 3:- You now have a territory, not just that old influence territory, now other races haves to negotiate an Open Borders treat with you to legally stay in your territory. And if you refuse? They just stay anyway and you receive a spam message in your notifications inbox EVERY SINGLE TURN, and you don't have a way to disable it. And if you enter another race territory without permission they starts to dislike you.- Your planets now have a ""standby"" mode. You can choose to increase economic, research or influence by 5%. If you don't know this the game just don't let you pass the turn, you have to google it to learn and continue your playthrough.- Now when you have an Idle colony, ship, shipyard or just finished a research, your ""pass turn"" button turno into idlecolony, ship etc. The weird part is that you have to set the ship to explore, survey or guard to ignore it.Here is some improvements from GalCiv 2:- Graphics.- Sounds.- The grid(map). It's the most beautiful grid I've ever seen in a turn based game, and you can rotate, zoom, move however you like. Awesome!- Instead of building ships in a planet now you have to build shipyards that stands in space. You have the option to unanchor it and move it 1 square each turn but the farthest from the sponsors planet the slowest you build. And you can have more than one planet sponsoring each shipyard, which is very nice.- Custom races: You can now choose more details of your custom race, it helps when you decide to play against them. You can even change the images of the race.- The ideology tree and ideology points are much better now. There are powerful ideology skills to choose from.I don't recommend the game. I bought it with 50% discount and I regret it. Just buy Galactic Civilizations 2 Complete instead, you will have much more fun. Maybe I will play this game next year to see if some glitches have been patched.Edit: Added my opinion on ideology.			"

												I bought this game after playing a bunch of Civilization 5 and also Galactic Civilizations 2.  I just played through the tutorial and so far it has a lot of similiarities to Galactic Civilizations 2.  I like the changes the developers made overall.  I think it's a very fun and solid game which has a ton of potential.  One of the reasons why I decided to pull the trigger with this is having observed the consistent update releases over the last 6 months or so.  Also, the developers frequently respond in the forums and seem to genuinely care about the users.  It feels good to be supporting a team like that and watching the game grow and give feedback.Yes, there are some bugs and some items that should be improved over time, however from what I can tell this is standard for the 4X genre.  Overall I didn't encounter any serious bugs and I enjoyed my 5 hour play session a lot.  I think to come on here and give a ""negative"" review is a little bit harsh, especially if people were expecting every piece of functionality from Galactic Civilizations 2 to be included from the beginning.I think this is a great option if you're into the 4X genre.  The developers have stated that it will be developed over the next 10 years and if it's this good after only 6 months I can't imagine how great it's going to be after a few years.  It's a very deep game, much more complex than Civ 5 but I think that's a good thing.  I would recommend buying it and trying it out.  I did wait for the Christmas sale and I got it 50% off so that made it a no-brainer for me.			"

												Very Slow if played right. The regular game is fun but with lots of weird aspects. For example I noticed early that you can run a fairly substial deficit most of the game. I ignored cash lost hundreds per turn, for about 100 turns I was alwase 10 turns from going broke but I just found enough to keep me going. Setting up a good starbase network around your planets takes forever and gives you such a huge economic advantage, but slows your game to a crawl. I easily spent half my game setting up starbases. The campain is super easy and its more of a tutorial than anything else, just fly towards the end and win.			"

												If you liked games like Civilization, Masters of Orion, and Sins of a Solar Empire, this just may be a game you would find very entertaining. Overall, there are many things that I really enjoy, losing track of time since the game is turn based.The one thing that I would forewarn, if you don't like doing a lot of strategic thinking (even setting the AI to easy can sometimes result in one race wanting to wipe you out when there are still colonizable planets) then this might not be for you. Combat is about who has the better ships, which you can design, but not control in the active fight. Still, even those are realistic because the larger ships generate more threat, making them the main target you would want to destroy (though sometimes you would rather fight a war of attrition).The  tech tree is very thourough, and with there being different ""ages,"" you must meet a research requirement to be able to get into the more advanced tech. I like this because you can't just focus on one tech tree and ignore the others until you have an awesome amount of research capacity.And lastly, the random maps are very well generated. You can choose the size of the sector and the how often stars, planets, and other space terrain/obstacles are present. Sometimes it can lead to the sector being overcrowded (more often if you use a small or tiny map) but on the large maps it makes it so you have to search a little and really feel as though you are making an empire that spans the stars.

												I really, really like this game. From being able to build your own  faction, to the sheer obserdity of the insane map size, there's a lot here to love. 4X strategy at its finest, build an empire and see what you can do to grow and spread your will across the galaxy size of your choice. The campaign offers a decent story, I'm admittedly easy when it comes to story, but even so, fun can still be had. So, if you're looking for a massive time sink, GalCiv3 is good for you.On a negative note though, the farther into the game you go, and on the bigger sizes the more likely it is for it to just crash on you.

I was able to take the whole galaxy with the first set of weapons.  It seemes that the Hyper expantionist model wins every time. Every thing else is ok.

												To me this game is vast, requires a steep learning curve, and needs dedication before its beauty is seen. While I would consider my progress in this game in its infancy, I certainly like the playstyle. I haven't bought any of the DLC as I feel like I would get lost with all the extras when I don't know how to handle the current ones I own.As far as gameplay goes, my laptop is starting to struggle with my 5 team, huge clustered, slow progress map on turn 500. I haven't seen any crashes or instability except for when zooming in and out of my map to look around.One frustrating thing I have with the game is that the when you highlight a ship for movement and then move your cursor around the map, the ship is no longer highlighted for orders and it becomes an idle ship. Then when you tab to access that ship again, it refocuses on the same ship removing you from your position which creates the same scenario. The fact that the ship cannot stay highlighted infuriates me especially when I'm trying to get away from the Drengins.On a positive note, the complex mechanics of the game keep the mind intrigued. Just when you think you had the fastest ships in the galaxy there will be a slow down causing you to rethink your long term attack strategy. This is exactly what I was asking for in a space management game such as this. While you do not control the performance of your units directly, knowing your chances and the risks associated with attacking the enemy fleet can keep the game exciting enough for the tacticians of the world.I do find it lacking that special something, however. Maybe it's because I've only played 20ish hours of it (although it feels like I've spent more), but I haven't gotten hooked like I did with Star Wars Empire at War. Where is my giant class battleship that counts as 30 logistic points? Maybe that's something that I have to create in order to find.The ship designer is cool, but I don't feel like many players, including I, know how to use it. It's just... there. If I had better instructions on how to use the tool that would be nice.Otherwise I enjoy the game, and it's been fun to see how it has grown from Beta to the current release I'm playing now.On a scale of golf cart to Lamborghini I give it a Mustang, one of those games that look sweet and sound sick, but just don't have enough juice to get you oogling over.

												Galactic Civilizations 3. Is a direct evolution of Galactic Civilizations 2 ( hereout Galactic Civilizations title will be shortened to GalCiv). While not revolutionary, and only offering some great new graphics and a few new features, it does run like a charm in comparison to its predecessor. The on screen battle videos are much better entertainment. I find myself cheering for my ships as they duke it out.For those of you new to galciv games. These are a turn based strategic 4x set in a space galaxy, either via campaign or sandbox. Galciv games are highly modable. The mods are often hosted on nexusgames.com. In galciv 2 i played both star wars vs star trek mod (self explanatory) and the Babylon 5 mod (also self explanatory). These offer a great measure of replayability in comparison to other 4x strategies. You have civilzation building elements like in most of 4x. These take place on a planet to planet basis. So yes, a lot of colonizing. In this iteration of Galciv, in fact, you can chose to do an insane amount of colonizing. Playing a single game that spans over 100 hours of gameplay. No two games are alike either, as you can choose who your openents are. Did i mention multiplayer? Yes they've got that also. One flaw is that unlike some other 4x games there is no hotjoining. So you have to make some friends to play multiplayer. Yet don't let that discourage you, single player is fun. You have other elements such as starbase building that work quite different than most 4x. Starbases can be economic boosters, military boosters, influence boosters or relic harvesters. Which bring me to relics. Relics are a feature from Galciv 2 ( haven't played 1). They provide bonuses to your civilization such as better research, production, influence. Now what is this influence stuff? It works much like culture off of the Sid Meier's Civlisation games. With one major exception. No great people. Influence expands your territory and can even flip enemy planets. There is also an influence victory option in sandbox. One last thing I'd like to mention is customizability. Galciv 3 is custumizable with its randomly generated sandbox maps, and custom race creation. Due to this I hardly ever play the same map or the same race twice. It also has difficulty levels for all gaming levels. From complete noob to the ultimate 4x player. Things I do not recommend for Galciv 3 are, buying the dlc without checking the reviews carefully. The dlc may or may not be worth the price for you. It's your choice but don't regret it.In summary if you like 4x you will like Galciv 3. You may not love it but you will have fun. Isn't that what games are for. I give Galciv 3 8/10			"

												Really wanted to like this game but overall I am feeling very underwhelmed. The ""epicness"" of a vast space empire seems lost in the endless pressing of the ""end turn"" button. I could not quite get my finger on it for a while, but I think the combat and lack of control over it is what makes this boring/frustrating for me. I am also very annoyed by seemingly random combat results (my survey ship unexpectedly survives an attack by five pirates, but my powerful fleet gets destroyed by a weak ennemy with no defences).

I have been playing it in early access and its been fun seeing it get better and better. Its about to go gold and the latest build is very polished. There may be more complex games out there but for me none of them are as plain fun  as GC3. I will be dumping many hours into it.			"

												Hey kids.I played Galactic Civilzations II quiet a bit.It was pretty good, very good really.This game is...interesting. Its very close in play to GCII, but with much updated graphics.The good is that its pretty, and seems to run very well.The bad is that not much has changed, and it lacks a lot of stuff GCII had, which makes me think stardock plans to sell parts of the game to us piecemeal. Which is unfortunate. But the skinny is, for me, that the game is fun. Only had it a few days and already logged a bunch of hours. Will probably log a lot more.So do I reccomend it? Yes, with the note that you will likely end up paying more to play the whole game through DLC			"

												Was a good game, the last patch blew it.  Planet management has been completely downgraded, sort of reminds me of the blunder that was MOO 3 from MOO 2.  I had months invested in a game, it has been rendered not worth continuing because many planets had been temporarily set up a certain way.  With the update I can no longer return to modify the settings (near as I can tell) and not really that motivated to even try.  Honeslty will be heading back to Blizzard games given this turn of events.  Or maybe WOrld of Whatever games.  Cheers!  All you irate people, just let your consumer power do the talking, even if you already paid for it, if you stop playing maybe you can ssave some of your friends from the agravation.			"

								If you liked Galactic Civilizations and/or Galactic Civilizations II, you'll love Galactic Civilizations III.  The story continues with the evil Drengin to be defeated and Earth saved, and if you didn't care about the story, it's still got the outstanding sandbox mode with incredible replay value.  It's also got multiplayer, although that's not particularly of interest to me, I know it is for others.I've been having great fun designing my own custom races to play, and I expect that quite a number will be available as mods very soon after release.

												Game is fun and addictive (keeps me up playing entirely too long!), but seems to be rather buggy and not very well optimized for smooth performance - i.e.:  loads VERY slowly, and has fits of momentary lock-ups during game play - normally after the A.I. has moved and I'm starting a new turn.Other than that, it's fun.  Doubt I'll play much after finishing my first play through though, as the whole ""just one more turn"" simply consumes too much of my life, resulting in a lack of sleep!			"

												The game respects the basic rules of astro-physics ( planet sizes, star classes, group of stars together and between empty space ). The technology tree enables many very different start focuses. Default games are replayable because of total diffent galaxy map shapes and race starting positions. Different races require different strategy.			"

												Worth it over GalCiv II? That depends on what kind of player you are. Look at my video for the details.


YouTube™ Video: Galactic Civilizations 2 vs. 3 comparison 

			Views: 20,427		

			How do Galciv 2 and 3 differ from each other? And what are the similarities? Here I try to give a good overview on those things, in order for you to decide which one you might like best.		

In its own right, GalCiv III is a great addition to the 4x genre. The races play very different from each other, the customization is amazing, and the graphics are nice. The battle viewer is in a sad state at the moment, but I never used to watch those anyway, so for me it's not a big negative. The game is a bit more shallow than GalCiv 2, but at the same time it's also much easier to get in to because of better tutorials and a nicer interface.Pro's:- Lots of customization- Nice visuals- adjacency bonus makes colonization more interesting- amazing ship designerCon's:- Battle viewer is really, really bad- A bit more shallow than GCII regarding politics			"

The last few beta's have really been pleasure to play and I can't wait to see the finished product.  Nor can I wait to see what the community creates with Steam integration.A must have for 4X fans.

												I don't think the base game is bad necessarily, although it doesn't exactly tell you what you can do to succeed...even in the tutorial...There's a severe lack of help, but sometimes that's not really a bad thing. I think it hurts in this particular case, just because I want to be able to succeed without having to click every object I see just to make sure I continue to build an economy, but hey, maybe that was designed to be tricky. Maybe that's all part of the challenge in the game.The biggest problem I have with this is when I look and see 10 DLCs released already and read that the creators plan to work to add more DLCs and expansions for the next 7 years I get a little bit disheartened in the state of the gaming industry. To me this makes a game like this not recommended. Video games, to me, should be released at least somewhat completely... I understand some expansion packs if the content isn't required for the base game. If I only want to buy it because I've explored enough of the base content and feel I could use a little extra challenge, or aspect to keep me playing, I think I'm okay with expansions... but this is getting insane. This game was tailored to have extra content thrown at us periodically. I don't even really want to say it's not a complete game, I haven't really played enough to judge that to be honest... I just instantly get a sense that I don't want to continue playing just to be coerced in the middle of a game to pay for extra content. Certain races are shown that are only accessible through DLC content, when you try to use them it tries to convince you to pay for DLC content. For this...I can't recommend the game. It just doesn't work as a gaming model for me personally.			"

												Let me get this out of the way, compared to GalCiv2, this game is very barebones. Keep in mind though that GalCiv2 was the same way and given time, GalCiv3 will be a much better experience to an already fun game.This 4X game offers many hours of gameplay and replyability with the help of the modding community. The faction/race creator is, by far, the best in the franchise, being able to upload your creation via steam workshop for others to enjoy in their games. Same can be said for the ship designer, I'm personally better at creating races/factions and their backgrounds than designing ships though, but thats what the community is for. Is it worth the price? In the current state, I wouldn't pay full price, BUT and I mean BUT, the developers are continuing on patching and adding features into the game. I have no doubt that it will be a much more in-depth game than GalCiv2 is in its current state down the road, making it well worth it. They recently rolled out a free Diplomacy patch and then released the Snathi dlc and percursor worlds dlc for dirt cheap. With that said, whether its now or later, your gonna end up getting the game, so just get it already. *January 1st, 2016* The game is actually on sale now, so you should go grab it.Pros:Modding communityIncredible Faction/Race creationFirst ever multiplayer in the franchisePlenty of options for setting up your galaxyGood replayabilityShip Designer vastly improved...and it was already good before.Developer involvement with community, continuing updatesJust...one...more....turn syndrome.Cons:Not much campaign for those who enjoy it (more possible in the future)Barebones in comparison to GalCiv2 content-wise (ex: no espionage)AI needs some tweakingWith all said and done, yes, I do recommend this game. I played it for a short bit when it came out and just recently gave it another shot. I do see many improvements and the devs making an attempt to expand their product, so I have no problem backing them up. As about the price earlier, get it if its on sale, but would I pay $50 currently in this state? No, maybe $35-$40, but given time with patches, updates, and expansions, it will be worth $50 and possibly more. So if you have it on hand, go for it, but if you can wait, that works too.

So when I opened Steam and saw a news post about the Galactic Civ III Beta I did not hesitate.  And I don't regret it.  It has everything I love about Dread Lords, but enhanced and improved.  My only complaint is that it's still a Beta and not everything is unlocked yet (A complete Ship Editor I'm looking at you!) and it seems every patch adds a new problem.  But as I said it's a Beta, so those issues should clear up once the full game comes out. 10/10 would be conquered by the Drengin again.			"

I've been a fan of 4x games since I played Reach for the Stars back on my C-64 in the early 80s, and this game has recaptured some of the magic for me from those days. I love the visuals, which are quite nice for a 4x game, and the mechanics are spot on. I like the fact that they didn't try to tack on tactical combat into this grand strategy game. And that's what it is: grand strategy. There are few gaming experiences that are better than starting a game on a huge map with multiple enemies (and potential friends) that you know will last for days. Good times.			"

No, maybe $35-$40, but given time with patches, updates, and expansions, it will be worth $50 and possibly more. So if you have it on hand, go for it, but if you can wait, that works too. At the end of the day, its already a good game. 7/10			"

Early Access Review
								I acquired a copy of Galactic Civ II Dread Lords several years ago and it has remained one of my favorite civ building stategy games ever since.  So when I opened Steam and saw a news post about the Galactic Civ III Beta I did not hesitate.  And I don't regret it.  It has everything I love about Dread Lords, but enhanced and improved.  My only complaint is that it's still a Beta and not everything is unlocked yet (A complete Ship Editor I'm looking at you!) and it seems every patch adds a new problem.  But as I said it's a Beta, so those issues should clear up once the full game comes out. 10/10 would be conquered by the Drengin again.			"

								This game is highly recommended for fans of turn based games.  Devs are up to 5.3 beta and it is a  vast improvement over the earlier betas.  The game is really coming together.  I love the ship designer, you can build and design your ships and each role they will play in your fleet.   This is a deep game with too many feature to list.  I absolutely love the carriers.			"

								If you like GalCiv II, this is a no-brainer. New, improved and expanded.The game looks great, has tons of features like creating your own faction, design your own ships (the possibilities are endless), all kinds of parameters to generate a map of epic proportions, a very impressive battle viewer, planet economy, research, ideologies etc. etc. All you could wish for in a 4X turn-based strategy game....and it's not even finished yet!....and there is more to come after the 1.0 release (patches and expansions)!

												****ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM SEP 2015****So here is  review from someone who has passionately played the gal civ series for a while. TLDR; I'd recommend if you are a serious fan of 4x space games or a gal civ fan, but not for most people (yet)So what are the positives?++The game has far finer control for making custom races+The ship creator is much more detailed+++The mechanic of ships having roles is actually pretty interesting (if a bit weird to figure out at first)+++The addition of space resources to harvest for powerful buildings and ship weaponry and fleet boosting modules is pretty awesome and can really change the way the game plays out++The wide number of tech trees makes custom races feel more unique, and each race feels more unique for the tech trees+Space combat is pretty interesting both due to a large number of support modules and ship roles.+The new space ports (which i hated at first) have grown on me. Now you can build big vessels by focusing five worlds together, which means that those massive vessels late game won't take 150 turns to build.+More support buildings make it easier to specialize worlds and create more powerful empires earlier on.+++The new morality system is much more rewarding than the old system, as it grants you bonuses in every alignment based on how many points you spend in each area. It really makes your empire feel like the sum of its choices instead of just paying money to change alignment.Now for the negatives---Planetary invasions are as dull as dishwater. There are no battle scenes, rather you just look at the planet to find out your odds. This needs MASSIVE support to fix.---Still no customization of invasion forces. I would love to see it set up so you could choose how you want your invasion forces to look (even something simple like 30% infantry, 25% Heavy vehicles, 15% anti air, 30% air support would be a nice improvement in my opinion).---Diplomacy is god awful in this game. No matter how close you are to a race, if they are stronger than you, they will attack you. It doesn't matter how many fleets you destroy with your super vessel, as long as their combined stats are higher than yours, then they don't care. I built, for example, a ship with over 400 stats in every offensive and defensive role, and could wipe out entire enemy fleets with every turn using that ship. I was destroying them as quickly as they could spam them, however, so the AI never let me sue for peace. Pretty broken mechanic imo.--I wish you had the option that no player can build anything in another's ZOC. It really ticks me off that the AI keeps building starbases in my territory, then I have to either bribe them to give it to me, go to war with them, or accept that I can't have those resources, which really sucks. --The campaign seems like a boring tutorial more than the in-depth fun storylines they used to be.So overall do I recommend this game? Yes, I do. If you are a fan of stardock, gal civ, or are a huge fan of space 4x games. But unless you fall into one of those categories, I would recommend you try out Gal Civ 2 first, and wait for more support on this game. The good news is they plan on supporting Gal Civ 3 for a long time, so I am sure these issues will be addressed.****UPDATE FEB 2016****Now I left the original review up there for a reason. I want to show the known issues of the time versus the new ones. So it has been several months, and I have to say I am borderline upset at how little progress has been made with core components of the game that I would think would be high priority. But first, some new complaints altogether:---They removed the better ability to control a planet's output. When I wrote my original review, they had a system where there was essentially a production wheel, almost like a color wheel in MS paint, and you could choose exactly where to put production. So maybe planet A was 26% production, 32% research, and 42% economy, while planet B could be 48% production, 48% research, 4% economy. They have since REMOVED that feature, and gone back to civ 2's mechanic of choosing where to focus, but with no fine control. This deserves a special mention since they actually removed a fantastic upgrade, all in the name of ""simplifying"" the game. There is, to my knowledge, no way to re-enable it.--- You can not adjust the freaking sound sliders mid game without restarting the game. Seriously? It may have been there before, but I never noticed it until now. How can a game made by a reputable company have this kind of issue?Now, the other reasons I am upset with stardock:5+ months later, military invasions are still just ""look at the odds and decide if you want  to attack or not"". This is a massive DOWNGRADE from the previous entry in the series, and the fact that they have still not addressed it shows a lack of any interest to fix it anytime soon, despite how lack-luster it is. Diplomacy is still identical. Any race you encounter will attack you if you are considered weaker than you, regardless of who they are. This means that relatively peaceful races in the game, including the religious ones, will just outright attack you for being weaker.This just seems so wrong. Other than that, there is no change from Gal Civ 2, so there is not much else to say, outside of it is disappointing.The AI will still build bases in your territory, with not even a toggleable option to change their ability to do it. See my above review to get the general idea.The AIs also still just build into massive debt. They just keep producing units, and go quickly bankrupt. Imagine if america suddenly multiplied their military budget by a 1000 fold, and you get the idea of what they do. But of course, these are usually weaker units, and your ships can ususally take them out by the fleet later on. This means that you get stuck in wars that go no-where, as they just spam to keep their numbers up, while you destroy as quickly as you can, making little progress. Since you can only dent their fleets temporarily, you will find it hard getting peace treaties if they get too large, just because tanking their military rating will be so hard.And of course, we have to talk about the DLC. They have all these issues, but they keep releasing more DLC. in the five months between my original review and the current one, they released two new DLCs, but so many big issues that I have outlined multiple times (both in this review and in comments made to the devs in discussion boards) seem to go unnoticed/ unresolved. I did not expect this from Stardock, and I am thoroughly disgusted by it. So overall, I am changing my review to no, not recommended, unless you are a massive stardock fan, and the issues above do not bother you. The game seems to be making no real progress, unless you want to buy DLC, and that seems to be their focus. The military is bland when it comes to ground forces, and the diplomacy is down-right attrocious. I was willing to overlook those issues in my old review because I had seen the game making positive gains, and I did make sure to note that there was still a lot of work to be done. But now that the game seems to have stalled on progress for DLCs and other cash grabs, I can not recommend this game. If they start making good changes and fix the bigger issues I have mentioned, then I will revisit my review and will give them credit. Until then, however, you have lost a customer here Stardock. Sorry.			"

Early Access Review
								Galactic Civilizations III, is the obvious 3rd installment of the series. I never played GalCiv 1, however I logged hundreds of hours in GalCiv2, especially with the mods it accumulated throughout the years. GalCiv3 is very close to being released in May 2015 so I feel it’s at a point it deserves a proper review. I’ve been playing this early access since day 1 and really haven’t started to enjoy it until recently.  Although it was extremely fun to be a part of the development with StarDock within the Twitch Live streams, and the forums, this game really wasn’t fun to play throughout its development cycle until recently. Galciv3 feels a lot like a GalCiv 2.5 HD version, besides going 64bit (which I praise) it really doesn’t try to do anything new or innovative like its predecessor did for a 4X game. I feel StarDock is really trying to just play it safe with the (if it isn’t broken don’t fix it) approach. There’s still several things that bug me, and these are just the major Issues I have with the game:First off the ship designer is something we’d expect since GalCiv2 had a simple and yet enjoyable designer. However this one is a lot more complicated. I usually start trying to design a familiar ship model from Star Wars or Star Trek and it always ends up being something completely different due to the complexity and limitations of working with 3d models. I really wanted to try to build an X-wing or a star destroyer but get frustrated. That said some might not see this as an issue and makes ships look unique. However after spending about 30mins trying to build a ship that meets my requirements and only having a couple turns in the game, I end up just using the stock ships and play the game never returning to the builder.The other thing that disappoints me is the planet view. This really has not changed from GalCiv2, it’s almost a direct clone of its predecessor, besides an animated spinning planet on the edge of the screen which looks nice, but serves no purpose and doesn’t change based on events. The Planet view is flat and the building aspect is just a 2d tile of buildings (think SimCity 1). I voiced my concern on the forums and in the live dev streams about this dated look and really hoped it was just a stand in until it was polished, but it hasn’t really changed since it’s alpha stage. I was really looking forward to a modern equivalent with an Isometric 3d point of view where you can spin the map and see many animations and vehicles and people moving and be dynamic based on the happiness/war/events of the galaxy and you culture, sadly this never evolved from GalCiv2. Also when you click on a planet to research an upgrade which doesn’t require a building it moves the selected tile to the next one leaving it blank, making this experience feel broken and confusing.The last negative issue I have encountered is the ship technology upgrade management. Once you build a stock or custom ship and add new technology which you unlocked from researching it and send it out into space, you’ll have a difficult time upgrading it with newer tech especially in mid and end game when you have dozens of ships all over the map. There’s no real easy way to see which ships have the latest technology that you recently unlocked, and it could get very tedious with having a MK 2, 8, 14, 23, 32 version of the same ship with each having just one tech module updated. I will close with the positives. You can tell the game was designed with passion and love which most games lack these days, the amount of detail from the graphics, cut scenes, gameplay, and features makes this game stand out from the typical cash grabber games like EA produces.  This aspect weighs very heavy on my review more so than any of the negatives I mentioned above.  I’ve yet to really feel full immersion in this game like I did in GalCiv2 but I’m hoping it’s because the game isn’t completed yet.Should you buy this game? If you played previous GalCiv’s yes I’d recommend it. If you never played either but understand what a 4X strategy game is I recommend it as well. This is a turn based game which somewhat mimics a board game, it’s not real time so some users might be disappointed. You can’t control ships in the battle viewer or the invade screens because it’s simply not that type of game, which is fine.+polished UI, entire game is made with passion+64bit utilizes your PC’s maximum potential giving you very large maps and fleets+Graphics and lighting look great and very modern+Balance and AI is good not great-Ship designer can get aggravating -Planet view hasn’t been changed since GalCiv2-Upgrading ships in space is hard to manage resulting in a lot of versions of the same ship As of right now 4/23/2015 I’ll give the game a 7.8/10			"

								I don't generally write reviews, but I thought that Galactic Civilizations III deserved one.While the game is a considerable amount of fun, there are certain downsides to it. For instance, the ideology system is vary poorly balanced. To have every planet and station within your sphere of influence automatically switch over to your side, is very heavily over-powered. It took me no longer than twenty minutes on my last run through to control almost 100% of the map. And throughout the whole time, I did not so much as even build an additional scout ship (beyond what you start off with of course). Secondly, there are bugs. But this is early access after all. So if you're willing to buy, than you need to take that into consideration. In my case, I have an issue with the diplomacy menu where the music decides to cut out and menu refuses to move. Lastly, the AI still seems to have an edge over the player. For whatever reason the AI colonizes every planet within reach in a rather insane amount of time. No matter how much I would spend on production I could not get my population to expand fast enough to start a reasonable colony.Now I should mention the positives. First and foremost, the graphics are remarkable. At full settings the game is beautiful. The video game score is also top notch. Ship customization is also a great tool to tailor the game more to your liking. And with the developers working actively on Galactic Civilzations, it is my hope that the negatives I mention get fixed. Nonetheless, I will still play the series as I am a rather huge Gal Civ fan. So I recommend this game to anyone whose willing to overlook the minor inconveniences, and just have some sort of fun.			"

								Galactic Civilizations II was a game I simply had to buy... it wasn't available in my country, so I bought it online in US (I live in Poland), and had it shipped (back in those days digital downloads were not very popular yet). From the first moment I opened the beautiful, silver box - I was in love. Then at some point I downloaded an amazing Mod that had Star Trek and Star Wars factions, and the game became even more stunning. For the first time since Master of Orion - I found my galactic home.I was very eager to start playing GalCiv 3. I've tried many space 4x games, and some of them were fun, but THE game that I was waiting for was Galactic Civilizations 3.We are less then a month from the release, and this is already a jewel. The devs listened to the community, put lots of work and love into the game, and I believe we have what we were waiting for.This game gives us great customization options on so many steps. Creating a custom race lets us work with even color schemes for the starships. And the starships are the greatest strength and customization opportunity GalCiv 3 offers. As you can see in the community creations the possibilities are endless.I already love the game, but feel that there is a lot more that I can, and should explore. Until now I can absolutely recommend it. As I will play and learn more - I will update my humble review :).EDIT:I created my own factions from Star Trek... Klingons keep attacking me all the time... which is fun... Cardassians also seem keen on waging war... but Earth still prevails, and strengthens the Alliance with the Ferengi.I love this game! :)			"

												Filled with the same kind of niggling game design problems as its prequels.The visual design is highly polished, but it feels like they never had anyone who understands game design sit down and play through the nearly-finished game for the first time. All of my problems with it are extremely minor and can be overcome, but the list is very long -- here's a sample:Anomalies provide an odd incentive to change to your most expensive technology and improvement at the beginning of each turn.Tooltips about improvements provide inadequate or straight up misleading information, the buy tooltip shows your treasury if you have enough to buy something, but not if you don't.A guarded anomaly gives you an option not to attack if your ship has weapons, but there is no indication that this option will not be available if you do not have weapons until you try it.Improvement layout is incredibly important, but all the planets in the campaign have terrible layouts.I still can't figure out the logic for cancelling starbase improvements -- at one point it cancelled everything _except_ the one I had selected.Running out of cash auto-sets your government to max economic. This often brings in less money than the setting it was on before you ran out of cash and essentially results in a game over as you have no ability to pick the government setting that would bring your cash back to the positive -- I suppose this is a decent metaphor for austerity though.These and things like them make the fun option and the optimal option often quite different and take away from the enjoyment of the game.This doesn't make Galactic Civilisations III worse than its predecessors (on the whole, it has improved a little in this regard), but given the huge budget and fanfare I had much higher expectattions.

												I have mostly favorable thoughts about Galactic Civilizations III. I like the customizable ships and races. The in-game events that shape the theology of your race make each game feel different.I find the interaction with other races confusing. The interface screen only shows an avatar of the race. I sometimes can't tell which race I'm talking to. The screen doesn't show the name of the race or any current or past agreements we've had together. Usually after loading a game that I played a few days ago I have no idea what is going on when I start the game.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but after playing for a while, I would join the chorus of others who are not as satisfied. Here are my main gripes:1. AI is really bad, even on the highest difficulties. If you resign the game every few turns, just to check what are the top techs the AI was working on, EVERY RACE is focusing on weapons. It's ridiculous. Why wouldn't they invest in techs that would improve their research? I guess the cybernetic race occasionally focuses on techs that increase the population, but that's about it. You can gain a huge technological edge and crush them in the mid to late game.2. They get upset at you pretty soon, so good luck trying to win a diplomacy victory.3. They ignore culture and focus on mining and economy starbases4. Diplomacy is too simplistic5. No tactical combat6. Too much micromanagement - of planets, of starbase building. Here is an example of something annoying: they added a way for your starbase to request a constructor. But when you send a constructor to it, the ""requested constructors"" count stays the same. With huge galaxies, it's a nightmare7. Some starting capabilities are too powerful - for example the one that removes the large empire penalty8. Accumulation of the ideology, or whatever the name of it was, points is too slowUnless they fix all those issues, stick to Master of Orion.			"

												I've enjoyed this series for quite some time.  I have some minor grievances, like trying to find the last planet to finish off an enemy.  It's really had to find your enemy on huge maps.  I wish there was a quick key, or some kind of way to find where they would be located (if you have that part of the map open with no fog of war, of course).  So far so good.  If you enjoy space turn-based strategy games, you'll love this game.			"

There’s still several things that bug me, and these are just the major Issues I have with the game:First off the ship designer is something we’d expect since GalCiv2 had a simple and yet enjoyable designer. However this one is a lot more complicated. I usually start trying to design a familiar ship model from Star Wars or Star Trek and it always ends up being something completely different due to the complexity and limitations of working with 3d models. I really wanted to try to build an X-wing or a star destroyer but get frustrated. That said some might not see this as an issue and makes ships look unique. However after spending about 30mins trying to build a ship that meets my requirements and only having a couple turns in the game, I end up just using the stock ships and play the game never returning to the builder.The other thing that disappoints me is the planet view. This really has not changed from GalCiv2, it’s almost a direct clone of its predecessor, besides an animated spinning planet on the edge of the screen which looks nice, but serves no purpose and doesn’t change based on events. The Planet view is flat and the building aspect is just a 2d tile of buildings (think SimCity 1). I voiced my concern on the forums and in the live dev streams about this dated look and really hoped it was just a stand in until it was polished, but it hasn’t really changed since it’s alpha stage. I was really looking forward to a modern equivalent with an Isometric 3d point of view where you can spin the map and see many animations and vehicles and people moving and be dynamic based on the happiness/war/events of the galaxy and you culture, sadly this never evolved from GalCiv2. Also when you click on a planet to research an upgrade which doesn’t require a building it moves the selected tile to the next one leaving it blank, making this experience feel broken and confusing.The last negative issue I have encountered is the ship technology upgrade management. Once you build a stock or custom ship and add new technology which you unlocked from researching it and send it out into space, you’ll have a difficult time upgrading it with newer tech especially in mid and end game when you have dozens of ships all over the map. There’s no real easy way to see which ships have the latest technology that you recently unlocked, and it could get very tedious with having a MK 2, 8, 14, 23, 32 version of the same ship with each having just one tech module updated. I will close with the positives. You can tell the game was designed with passion and love which most games lack these days, the amount of detail from the graphics, cut scenes, gameplay, and features makes this game stand out from the typical cash grabber games like EA produces.  This aspect weighs very heavy on my review more so than any of the negatives I mentioned above.  I’ve yet to really feel full immersion in this game like I did in GalCiv2 but I’m hoping it’s because the game isn’t completed yet.Should you buy this game? If you played previous GalCiv’s yes I’d recommend it. If you never played either but understand what a 4X strategy game is I recommend it as well. This is a turn based game which somewhat mimics a board game, it’s not real time so some users might be disappointed. You can’t control ships in the battle viewer or the invade screens because it’s simply not that type of game, which is fine.+polished UI, entire game is made with passion+64bit utilizes your PC’s maximum potential giving you very large maps and fleets+Graphics and lighting look great and very modern+Balance and AI is good not great-Ship designer can get aggravating -Planet view hasn’t been changed since GalCiv2-Upgrading ships in space is hard to manage resulting in a lot of versions of the same ship As of right now 4/23/2015 I’ll give the game a 7.8/10			"

												Filled with the same kind of niggling game design problems as its prequels.The visual design is highly polished, but it feels like they never had anyone who understands game design sit down and play through the nearly-finished game for the first time. All of my problems with it are extremely minor and can be overcome, but the list is very long -- here's a sample:Anomalies provide an odd incentive to change to your most expensive technology and improvement at the beginning of each turn.Tooltips about improvements provide inadequate or straight up misleading information, the buy tooltip shows your treasury if you have enough to buy something, but not if you don't.A guarded anomaly gives you an option not to attack if your ship has weapons, but there is no indication that this option will not be available if you do not have weapons until you try it.Improvement layout is incredibly important, but all the planets in the campaign have terrible layouts.I still can't figure out the logic for cancelling starbase improvements -- at one point it cancelled everything _except_ the one I had selected.Running out of cash auto-sets your government to max economic. This often brings in less money than the setting it was on before you ran out of cash and essentially results in a game over as you have no ability to pick the government setting that would bring your cash back to the positive -- I suppose this is a decent metaphor for austerity though.These and things like them make the fun option and the optimal option often quite different and take away from the enjoyment of the game.This doesn't make Galactic Civilisations III worse than its predecessors (on the whole, it has improved a little in this regard), but given the huge budget and fanfare I had much higher expectattions.

												So, I am not sure why my last review isn't on Steam now... did I say something wrong? EDIT (300+ Hours of Play):WOW!  You know a game has you in its grips when you start scheduling your life around your game time!I have now been completely sucked into GC3.  I knew this game was pretty solid when I first started playing it, but now that I've had some serious time to play it and actually figure out what I'm doing (mostly), I just have to say that this is what a 4x game should be.  A game that makes me say ""Just one more turn!""   Just one more custom race tweak.  Just one more try at a new build strategy. (etc.) I have not been this addicted to a game since probably World of Warcraft (even though they are in two completely different genres), and I really have to give credit to Stardock for doing a great job at making a game that is infuriatingly addictive,has literally has kept me up until dawn the next day, bloodshot eyes and a sore mouse-hand.  I think that Stardock has found a happy balance between being so simple of a game as to be boring vs. being so deep that you need a 100 page manual just to understand the game.  It's really easy to get into GC3, but once you play through a few games (400+ turns) on insane szed maps, you really get a feel for how this all works, and the game design is brilliant.  The sheer number of potential win strategies on display is staggering.  There is no ""best"" tech tree utilization.  Every decision has pros and cons and there is both short term and long term strategies that need to be mapped out.  Between the map design, your race (custom or not) along with planet management and tech research, there are potentially billions of ways to attack this game.Personally, I play my games with ""Conquest"" or ""Alliance"" as the win strategies just so some race doesn't outbuild me and ascend to a different dimension while I'm stilll building capital ships to wipe them out.  The planetary map mini-game is really the stroke of genius to me.  SO much of your empire's success hinges on good planet management, and good planet management means paying attention to every detail, coming up with a solid build stretegy, having the right tech trees unlocked and then being able to switch gears on the fly.  What you build, where you build it and when you build it can mean the difference between rolling over your enemies like a steam roller, or getting your butt kicked before round 200.  The interplay between your research within the tech trees, your planet management and shipyard management are really where this game happens.  (I haven't even begun to use the custom ship editor!!!).  The planet mangement aspect of the game is very simple to get into, but this part of the game gets more and more complex as time goes on.  I haven't even begun to be an expert in this game even with 300+ hours under my belt.  I see MUCH replay ahead!One last note:  The game has only crashed once on me in 300+ hours.  THANK YOU STARDOCK!------ORIGINAL REVIEW:Anyway, I just wanted to provide an update to my previous review of GC3, and raise my score for this game from an 8.8 out of 10 to a solid 9.5 out of 10.  (The .5 left over is really just bug fixes, but I have found the game incredibly stable at this point).GC3 is a game modder's DREAM!  I just started poking around the various game directories last night, and you really can customize the crap out this game.  Not only can you load in your own icons and photographs and backgrounds and videos for the races, but you can also use the ship designer todesign your own star fleets AND you can replace most of the game UI graphics AND they have included the ability to create ""total conversion"" mods for the game, right out of the box.  So, even beyond an already flexible game (no modding required), the replayability of GC3 is great!  Add to that the ability to tweak this game into the next century and that adds another whole dimension to it.Next, I confirmed with some fans that Stardock has committed to 2 expansion packs and several bug fix patches along the way.  This is a big deal to me because if you have seen the end result of GC2, you will realize that this released game is just the START of a development cycle that continues well after the game is released.  Bugs will be fixed, new features will be added etc.So, I'm not just happy about this game as is (and I am already addicted to it!) I am very much looking to the future as well.IF you are a fan of 4x games, I think this is defintely a must have!  I've been looking for a while for a decent way to burn time, and GC3 definitely fits the bill for me. Hopefully my other review will go up at some point... I don't want to have to write all that again!  =(			"

								Love the game so far! I recommend the game - it brings back happy memories of MOO and I have missed that.  I have played three games so far and they all seem to eventually lock up and the game just shuts down.  It can't be played from this point onward no matter what.  It can be reloaded but shortly after loading it back up it shuts off again.  Restarting with a new game gives me hours of playing again but it still shuts down at a point.  Possibly this is because the number of ships or planets has reached a point that the game can't handle?  I don't know.  Also, the columns in the 'Colonies' tab, the icons for 'Research, Income and Manufacturing' do not appear to be above the correct columns.			"

								A very enjoyable addition to the series, my favorite so far! I will say that at present, games with medium maps or larger get buggy midway through and tend to crash, best off playing smaller games. However, one thing that needs to be tweaked is culture... When you consider all the tech you have to develop to invade your neighbors, it makes little sense to go through all that work when you can just build three or four cultural centers clustered together and be quite confident that you'll be culture flipping planets left and right once the game hits the midway point! Honestly, I spend half the game giving leaders back their planets in small map games, whereas the game tends to crash in larger ones. - That one criticism aside, it is wonderful how far you can lose yourself in the tech tree, and finding the home planets of your competitors and setting up starbases to increase your range for profitable trade routes can be an adventure in and of itself! - Definitely recommend, but it is a work in progress still!

												OK so at the time of writing this short review GC3 has left early access and I believe is still in BETA, so I will just list a few things that need to be worked on just so whoever is reading this will know what they are getting.Campaign:I was surprised to see a campaign since leaving early access. Most 4X games I've played have not had proper story campaigns, so I was happy to see one here. However, there are 2 issues I have with the campaign (other than being very short. Maybe every major race will get one each???). First off is the tech tree. In the first mission I advanced my kinetic weapons to near maximum however in the second mission I had to do it all again. Same can be said for nearly all techs. Now I'm not sure if they went to base levels again but that was practically the case. Personally I feel there should be some kind of system that carries tech into the next missions, even if it means limiting the max tech level per mission. Secondly is the diplomacy. Simply put it is non-existant. Sure you can trade, declare war and ask for peace but thats it. I researched diplomacy to a high level and nothing changed. I could not form an alliance with the Thalians in mission  2, so I had to go to war with them because we were neighbours and my culture was taking them over. They ended up being angry at me and sending threats, then eventually declared war on me. Naturally they did so without fleets at my borders so I just overran them immediately. Maybe AI is an isue too!!!!Open End Free Play:Obviously the diplomacy has a problem here too, but at the moment if you play using the largest 3 galaxies then your game will more than likely crash as all the races get more numerous ships. I was in a game 700+ turns in over about 10 days when all of a sudden when I click on ""turn"", it froze. To say i was pi**ed was an understatement. It happened twice. The second being just over 400 turns in. But all in all that's my biggest issue with free play.So in my opinion if the diplomacy and crashes are fixed this would be a great game. The tech tree is pretty minor since I will only play the campaign once since its not that interesting.			"

												Overall its a pretty good game. I like the customization options it gives as far as creating your own ships. This is the 1st time i've played any of the games in the series so I didnt know what to expect. There were a few disappointments such as not being able to control your ships during battle. Instead you can watch your ships do as they please. I guess thats better than just getting a battle report though since it allows you to see where you went wrong & it allows you to see strengths and weaknesses such as if the enemy has mostly missle ships in their fleet you can counter it easier later. It can be very time consuming as well considering it gives you a lot of micro management options for every colony. It can give you advantages & allows you to specialize planets. Creating your own race is pretty cool too. All in all the freedom the game gives you to do as you'd like is great. Its not too good at explaining certain things during gameplay so you may need to do a bit of internet research/you tubing to figure out how some of the features work, but if you like turn based games that allow you to build empires & you're ok with only being able to watch cinematic battles instead of being able to take charge yourself, than I'd recommend giving this game a try.

												The game is a classic; I'm a fan of I and II.  I do agree that this game is disappointingly the same as the last two.  I do agree that I expected to see bigger changes.  Another problem for me is that the game is a huge resource hog.  My system exceeds their recommended specs and I have to play it on low and with the sound off and it still gets bogged down to a standstill in certain screens after many turns (people with much faster and newer systems apparently don't have an issue with this).  On the plus side it's still a great game and since it's been ten years I'm ready to replay it.  I see no reason not to recommend it, whether you've loved the old ones or are just getting in.  But hopefully they'll address the system hogging issue.			"

It feels bland somehow, though I note it's a better version of Galciv 2 more or less.I think the bar for a good game has moved, and it's still not Moo2.I waited for the DLC to go on sale, thinking that might fix it.  Still not liking it. It's one of the few games I pre-order at full price, that's how sure I was I would like it.Ah well.			"

Early Access Review
								Best game I've played so far. Love it, then again I bought a founder pack, mainly because I think that this game will rival many of the others that are coming out or will come out. I like the GC series because of the massive ammount of customization that is allowed, and the infinite possibilities that you can have in a game, with amazing replay value, it seems that only one in several hundred games may be similar, the AI is ever learning with development, and it learns from each encounter with you that is has, You have missles it has beam weapons? It will place anti missle defences on its ships, you start using other weapons it will make fleets of ships strong in each weapon and defence. Its a always changing universe. Though I'm still waiting for a custom race or something similar :P			"

												I have always loved playing Galactic Civilization since the 1st one.  The 2nd one was very good once the upgrades happened and I think the same thing will happen with this game once those upgrades are places.  I feel the game is just a little incomplete compared to the game play of GC2.  The minor races don't have no importance in the game other then giving you a decent planet to conquer once you have expoited them of tech and money.   I don't like the way the enemy will give up even tho it might still have 20+ planets left and give them to a random enemy.  I like to play on the biggest maps possible to make a long fun game.  The maps are big but I was actually hoping for bigger..lol.  I think some of the deplomacy needs some work.   The ship battles are nice but could have done a little tweaking in my option.  Once there face to face the just bounce around each other instead of doing flyby or making it just a little more realistic.  The explosion are awsome and a nice touch.  Sound effect could also use a litle bump.  I should have waited for most of the expansion to come out for this game before buying it but i'm such a fan that I can wait.			"

												While certainly not perfect, it has truly destroyed time that I was trying to kill. ""Just....one...more....turn"" certainly has been an all too common saying that I told my girl before she left. All well, at least I still have a galaxy and a customizable fleet. The ship customization is what sets this game apart from other 4X games. Its a nice balance between Sins of a Solar Empire and Civilization. The UI can be clunky at times, the AI stiff and a little too predictable, and combat leaves a little more to be desired (especially late game for myself) but this game has certainly kept me up with that mantra of ""Just one more turn."" Overall, I would rate this 7.5/10 conquered foes.			"

												Here is my insane review of Galactic Civilizations 3.Pros: Turn-Based game.Beautiful GraphicsEasy to understandA.I has definitely been improved in comparison with previous game.(Gal.civ2)Ability to customize almost anythingAbility to customize and create your own unique looking ships.Easy to understand Tech treeYou can customize your game to specific sci-fy series (BORG vs. Federation)Interesting Political system.Tactical combat if you are tired of quick combat mode.Maps offer plenty of customizable options and space background looks phenomenal.Perfect for steam workshop.HAS MULTIPLAYER.Cons: Is a re-skin of Galactic Civilizations 2Long games can be dull and boring at times.A.I Needs to play a better role in the political system.Campaign could of been better.You have 0 control of Tactical combat.You don't quite feel the presence of the U.P (council).It doesn't really feel fresh enough, too similar to previous game, if you burned Gal.civ2 this game can easily get you bored.Games feel like a rush to big bad capital ships.Planet colonization/building system is ok, could of been way more interesting and less repetitive. (specially in long games)Here is my Insane Review for more details:

												GalCiv III is a 4X Space Strategy game made by Stardock.The three main places where you will be active on the map are Planets, Shipyards and Space Stations.The Galaxy is your playground and out there you can find disseminated things like:Stars, Blackholes and PlanetsAnomalies that can be researchedAsteroids tha can be minedResources that can allow special shipsSpace Junk, Artifacts and Ship graveyards to lootAncient artifacts you can research for bonuses to your civThere are also Galactic (or Faction) Events that can randomly happen.As for the Grand Strategy part you will have several things to do to for your civilization's ""master plan"":Handle DiplomacyTrade with Major/Minor civsDiscover a vast research treeGovern (optional) your worlds from a dashboardDevelop your Ideology (gives perks)You will also be part of a Galactic Council which takes galaxy-wide decisions you can vote on (or propose if you have the power) that affect every civilization for many turns.In this game you can also design (Steam workshop supported) you very own ship models up to the tiniest detail and everything you research can affect the loadout of your ships with modules, components and weapons. Another great part I really like are the Space Stations which you can deeply customize by building many different types of modules and affect your civilization in that part of the galaxy.One more thing, the AI has been recently revamped and is very good: IMO this is very important in a 4X strategy game otherwise all the other stuff they put in (see other 4X games) will be useless!

												I'm very unhappy with this game purchase. Currently I'm on build 1.03. The ideas are good, but as a software developer myself I do not expect to see basic programming errors that lead to such things as repeated items in lists, planets that are not mine becoming idle and opening for me to queue production, running out of funds when I have always been cash-flow positive etc. These are not obvious initially, but as you play for several hours they become a regular occurrence. Sometimes I just ""loose"" a fleet that took a while to build. These bugs play on my mind and lead me to think that I am wasting my time.			"

												Honestly wish I could refund this even after picking it up on sale. It is not clear at all what you need to do to succeed at playing this game (you can't see what AI are doing on their planets, but they outproduce you in every category with no real explanation as to why), but even if it were, it is so excrutiatingly slow that it doesn't really seem worth figuring out anyway. Four hours in you have (maybe) 8-10 ships that can travel 2-3 spaces? The pace here is so slow that it's just tough to stay engaged, even for people that like 4X games.			"

												POST RELEASE REVIEWI have had a most pleasurable privilege and experience of being part of testing this game since Alpha 2 update. I can honestly say this the best game in the GC series. Over the past year it has been an honor to work with the developers looking for bugs and help make this game the best it can be. For the past year no other game captured my interest as much as Galactic Civilizations III has, I have enjoyed testing, breaking and playing the game and will continue to do so. I was a big Fan of GC2 and GC3 has not disappointed me at all. Now here we are on release day just two hours from official release and I find myself sitting here like a kid under a Christmas tree waiting for Santa to come down the chimney with my presents.Stardock is a company like no other. They delivered a fantastic 4x strategy game just like they promised they would. They listened to everyone and gave us everything they could with so much more to be added later. I got this game last year as a Father's Day gift and it's truly been the gift that keeps on giving. Game of the year 2015Thank you Brad. Paul and the entire GC3 team. WONDERFUL GAME!!!!!			"

												Game is filled with bugs, to the point it's unplayable. All sorts of different issues that causes the game to crash to desktop, none of which in my experience are performance related either. Try to join MP and it crashes, try to perform certain actions within the game and it'll crash. With no real response from Stardock support.Aside from the bugs it's not a deep game for a 4x, right now anyway. You'll see a lot of the same dialogue and events within your first game alone. AI behaves oddly as well, for example civilizations that are far weaker than you will demand that you make weekly payments to them. The ship designer is very nice though and well done, basically a game within a game.			"

												It's a pretty standard 4x space game. If you've played one before you know what to expect, bbut where his game really shines is in it's ability to customise your own ships and space stations. While other games let you do this as well, you were severely limited in what you could do and many times your tweaks were either merely cosmetic or only affected the stats of a pre existing model. In this game you can build it from the ground up and every bit of equipment has it's own model. It's like building in Kerbal Space with offensive weaponry.			"

Early Access Review
								Some of you may recognize me and my name from my work on ""Elemental: War of Magic"". If you do, then you'll know that I know what I'm talking about when it comes to Stardock games.Galactic Civilizations III is the successor to the wildly popular Galactic Civilizations II. If you are familiar with Gal Civ II then you should largely know what to expect this time around. There is a multitude of options and settings, performance tweaks and graphical settings. Everything you can think of from Gal Civ II is here and improved upon. Some of the options from the expansions of Gal Civ II are missing, but, if you know Stardock and how they do things then you know those options are coming in future expansions and DLC.Being the first installment (base game) there are things that can be improved upon, again though if you know Stardock then you know these things are coming down the road. I wouldn't say they left things out on purpose, but more so because they know they have to have content for future expansions. Have no fear that some of those options you may notice that are missing from Gal Civ II WILL eventually be in Gal Civ III as well. If you'd like proof of this look at the base game (no expansions) of Gal Civ II, then look at Gal Civ II Ultimate Edition and everything that was added in between. This is a pattern with Stardock and they will follow the same pattern here.The Gal Civ series has been my favorite Space 4X strategy series since Masters of Orion 1&2. The only thing lacking in Gal Civ in my opinion is directly controllable battles, though you do still have many options when it comes to battles. What roles you design for your ships and how well you design them plays a huge part in battles, and the battles are epic and beautiful. Ground battles and invasions are a bit ""bare bones"" at the moment, but I can promise you this will be expanded upon with further updates and expansions as well.Moddability in Gal Civ III is Off The Charts!!! This time around basically the entire game is opened up for modding, even more so than Gal Civ II, and you don't need to be a master programmer to do it. New mods and content are being worked on as I type this and the future of Gal Civ III is as bright as the brightest star in the universe. There's nothing here not to like.If you've ever been a fan of 4X strategy games or Space strategy games then the only thing you need to be asking yourself right now is ""Why haven't I bought this yet?!?!"". Don't miss out on this epic gem of a game. If you only buy 1 strategy 4X this year there's no question in what you should be doing right now. Buy it, you won't be disappointed...........Why are you still reading this? You should be playing right now!!!			"

												34 hours in the first week and a half. No regrets. Pros Extremely detailed - You can easily get lost in the immense detail of the game. For instance, the level of detail and complexity in ship design is amazing. Research options seem endless. The size of the map can range anywhere from just a handful of sectors to thousands of sectors in area.Beautiful - The graphics are very nice. Everything is very polished and nice to look at.Endless possibilities - This kinda goes hand-in-hand with the detail, but there are just so many choices you can make. You can create your own alien races, able to customize how they construct their civilization and interact with others. You can not only design aesthetics for your own ships, but combine modules in endless combinations to give your ship any number of strengths. I'm sure that I've only begun to scratch the surface of the possibilities in this game.Like Civilization, but way, way better - And it's in space!Super powerful uber death machines - When you start manufacturing the huge-size ships with the fully upgrades weapons, you can take on an entire fleet with one ship. Not to say that this is easy to get to. It takes quite a while to get to that point in research and manufacturing capability, but it's extremely rewarding when you do. Cons A bit buggy - I got it on release day. It has crashed inexplicably quite a few times while playing. Thankfully, the autosave is very reliable, and I only ended up losing a few turns each time. It seems that they've fixed this somewhat, but not completely.Very, very time consuming - Not necessarily a con, but it might be for some people. Do NOT get this game if you just want a quick play-through. This game takes a lot of time to get into, learn, and actually play, especially when you start moving into the larger maps.I never played the previous games in this franchise, but I love this one. Overall, I'd say it's a very good buy if you're someone who's willing to put a lot of time into a turn-based strategy game. It's like Civ on steroids, in space, with giant lasers.			"

												I LOVE Galatic Civ 2. Yet this is only superior graphically.  I appreciate that the company tried, No matter what I do removing all forms of korx in campaign normal I cant progress. I alternated back a ridiculous amount of terms by conquering the last planet they declare war. This brings loss of objective. I have done it 4 times thats 4X I am wanting to actually do something in story mode. Good thing I got this on sale.

												A great addition to the ultimate 4x space collection. If you are returning to GC3 from a previous title, then the game will feel very familiar, the systems, mechanics and gameplay are all very much alike to previous versions, this game is about iteration not innovation, building upon an already successful and enjoyable experience from previous titles, with all new graphics and a wonderfully detail ship designer and the always welcome custom race options you will quickly find yourself at home in GC3. For newcomers there is no better time to jump into Galactic Civilizations than now, with fresh new graphics and a user friendly tutorial, it has never been easier to take your first step into this wonderful universe.

												So i have to say when I first bought this game i will be honest that i felt a little let down but, with its interactive team and constant updates I can proudly say this game has become a lot of fun. I suggest doing the tutorial as there are things you need to learn and playing with the tech tree a lot. The camera for the space fights can get some fine tuning but overall they are enjoyable to watch. Combat itself is a huge numbers game with range, defense, and attack all playing a factor in your fight to dominate. Choices on your races ideals and influence will greatly determine how you interact with the ai diplomatically. Fight everyone or try to be the peaceful race or even something in between its up to you.			"

												Galactic Civilizations 3 is the latest in a series of space 4X games by Stardock. With this game really what you see is what you get- it really is a highly evolved space based version of civilisation. If you like Civilisation chances are you will love this. That being said there are both positive and negative aspects to this title which sets it apart from its brother. During this review I plan to outline those elements to help you make up your mind on this product. Full Disclosure, I have been a very long term fan of Stardock and their business practises- I backed the game at the $100 “all dlc included” level and in doing so you could say I have a vested interest in seeing this game succeed. That said, I still feel like I should be able to help you make up your mind. 	I have been following Galciv3 since it was first announced and released into early access. One of the first things someone may ask is; how much has changed since this game entered early access? Well the game has seen an entire UI, graphical and gameplay overhaul since the initial alpha stages. Generally the patches came out once ever few months and overhauled the entire game each time. I expect this to be a similar pace to what we will see when development of DLC , Expansions and Patches begins. Stardock is very transparent with their community and often lets users see content long before release during dev streams. To get a good idea of just how much has changed, try watching one of their oldest streams before watching one of their newer ones... it is night and day. 	Things are changing sure, but how is the gameplay? Well, upon starting a new game players’ have the option of customising everything similar to Civilisation. They may tweak the universe to be as hostile or peaceful as they want, crowded or sparse. Players can even design their own civilisation by choosing traits, style and AI personality. Upon starting players are given a scout ship (exploration), a colony ship (settler) and a survey ship (dedicated goodie hut finder). From here the player strives towards one of multiple goals. All the usual suspects are there in the form of Conquest, Time, Research and Diplomacy- but the game also offers alternative victory options such as influence and ascension. The maps can be any size from small 5 min blastoffs to full multi day megamatches. However if you plan on playing on the highest map size (insane) you will really need a beefy PC. Often the slightly smaller sizes of Gigantic, Immese or Excessive are much more “playable”, but they have made recent strives which have allowed me to play Insane til victory comfortably. 	So just how IS performance anyway? The first thing you need to know about GalCiv3 is that it REQUIRES a 64bit OS to play- if you do not have one you really should be barking up another tree. The game seems to use a large chunk of ram and I can imagine Ram speed being a much higher requirement then in most games. Unlike Civilisation games, GalCiv3 boasts pretty impressive multi-core management. Each AI player runs on a single core/thread until all your cores are doing something. After that deal out starts again. Turn speeds will eventually become an issue, but the release version seems much better than it was even a few days ago.  	The game is not flawless in its current state. There are bugs and the occasional tooltip error but Stardock says that they plan on supporting GalCiv3 for many years. Currently the plan is to release a series of DLC and Expansion packs slowly over the next few years along with free and sizable patches. How well they actually go with this is yet to be determined but they were generally pretty good with that during the past two GalCiv games. My biggest issue with the game at this time is more the perceived loss of character in the random events. The pictures for these events are not yet as diverse and interesting as they seemed in previous games and I often found myself selecting choices based on stats and ideological desires instead of picking what I would actually do. Another thing which personally irks me is the lack of “Wonders”. Generally there are only a small number of ‘one per galaxy’ buildings which are placed at late places in the tech tree. While in a game of Civilisation the question is “is it worth aiming for this wonder which everyone else could be aiming for”, in Galciv3 it is more like ‘oh, I must be the first person to get this tech. better build the wonder. No need to rush though, likely they have specialised in a different tech tree.’	In a first for the series Multiplayer is also included- though it is normally always best to play with someone you actually know as games could last a long time. Unfortunately the “Play by Email” option which was once common for games such as this is not possible. Multiplayer has not tarnished the familiar features though, nor has it taken centre stage. The signature Ship Designer feature is still very much in play, as is a scripted story based campaign. You can still watch your space battles in a pretty impressive (but hands off) way and you still have a (disappointingly simple) invasion screen. There are no Planet Busters currently (eg Terror Star) but they are planned for a later Expansion pack (much like in previous titles). Overall the gameplay is fluid and polished- playing the game feels much better than playing GalCiv2 did. 	Overall I would easily recommend this game, especially if you like the promise of future DLC and Expansion packs. The game is a complete, polished and next generation 4X game which presses all the right buttons for me. Galciv3 is like the Cities Skylines to the CitiesXL or Sim City... A game which is much better optimised at doing what it needs to do, capturing the essence of what people love about the genre without killing your computer. With that in mind I say bravo Stardock- and please bring on the expansions, DLC and Steam Workshop (which will be added in version 1.1).			"

												EDIT (1.7 Beta): The biggest gripe I had with this game was the constructor spam late game. With 1.7 this has been mostly resolved, to a point where I will actually play larger maps with more resources and planets. The recent expansion was average, but what makes this game shine is the constant flow of free patches it gets, like 1.7 which completely overhauled the starbase construction mechanics. I thought this game was great on launch, and  it has just been getting better. I am sure once all patches and expansions are done, this will be the gold standard of space 4x without any question.Original Early Access Review:I just love this game. Its got the soul of Gal Civ 2 ontop of modern technology such as real 64 bit support, hex's, pretty flashes, HD textures and a whole lot of future promise. Based on Stardocks track record, this game will get a few expansions and lots of dlc. So it will just keep getting better and better.Currently with Beta 6, RAM usage is fantastic at 2.5GB for me. Turn time is quick. The previous crashing bugs have mostly been resolved. It feels complete, just needs the campaign coming May 14.Just buy it!			"

												Probably the best sci-fi turn-based strategy game I have ever played.  I played GalCiv II before 3 was made and really enjoyed it, but it was getting on in years and it showed a little.  When I then heard that GalCiv III was in the works, I pre-purchased it here on Steam, and even tried out the Beta a bit.  It wasn't nearly complete at the time, so I put it down for a while.  Then I played a very similar game called Endless Space, and it reminded me of GalCiv, but was also missing a lot…and I do mean A LOT (don't play it, it'll only disapoint you).  So I came back to GalCiv III, thinking that it must certainly be finished by now, and I was not disapointed at all.  It is a simply wonderful game if you like extensively deep turn-based strategy and civilization-simulator games.  It has excellent customization ability, allowing you to truly create a civilization all your own, and design/build ships that are truly unique.  The campaign is also quite intriguing, and will captivate you if you take the time to thoroughly read the dialogues and experience the story.After playing again for a little while, I then went and bought all the DLC without thinking twice about it.  As I said before…not at all disapointed.  Some of the best money I've ever spent on a game.			"

												This is a good game the UI is easy to navigate, the AI is fairly smart and the game has a short but interesting campaign.Gameplay wise, alliances need a bit of work.That said the game does have some issues, on the larger maps if you don't have a powerful rig then you're in for lots of waiting as the game will lag a fair bit, to avoid this id say large maps a perfect for scale and fram rates. The only bug i've come across is that sometimes it will crash during ai turns so your next turn will never start, no worries though the game autosaves at the start of each turn.			"

								I have been a fan of the Gal Civ series for awhile now.  I also jumped on the early access founder program for Gal Civ 3 the day it opened up.  It has been fun to watch the game grow and become something that I think is very special.  If you are a fan of any of the Gal Civ games or like TBS space games then I cannot recommend Gal Civ 3 highly enough!The latest beta build that went out a couple of days ago is very solid and lots of fun!

Early Access Review
								Having a ball with this game.If you like strategy games like the Civilization series, then you will like this game. There's a lot of customization available. It has quite a lot of depth to if you want, or you can customize settings to suit your own taste. I'm sure this will suit a wide range of strategy nuts.There's a built in ship kit bashing to make heaps of variations to your ships and also a built in faction creation option where you can make custom faction -  races or use .xml to append in even more variation to the game. This is going to be real plus for this game once modders have had a chance to make some cool factions to share. The developers have obviously put a lot of effort into making this possible and we've already seen some cool user created faction - races. And as time goes by I 'm sure we will see a fantastic game with lots variation to it.			"

												I had originally reviewed this game as recommended. I liked the soundtrack, the gameplay, and the look.  The most recent patch has ""overhauled"" (Read: dumbed down) economic management to the point that the game is just not worth playing at all. Managing the research, production, and wealth of my empire and striking a balance between the three was what I really liked-the war isn't bad or a chore by any means but it's really just not where I found the meat of the gameplay to be. Now that governing my planetary budget is forcibly automated there's nothing to DO. Even the vaunted (and very fun, I might add) player-created starships have gotten hit by this change-now that you can no longer put 100% of a planet's outcome into military production all the player-made ships are too expensive to produce in any kind of reasonable timeframe. TL;DR:the meat of the gameplay was almost entirely removed in a patch, game is boring now.			"

												Thre are definitly parts of this game I enjoy emensly but there are others that make this a struggle to play, particullarly the longer the game goes on. My biggest complaint is the level of micormanagement that is NECCESSARY in order to play this game. There are several things in the games that *should* releive the level of micromanagement, but they don't work how you would like. There is a global production governence that allows you to drive your indistry, but having one item for your entire empire makes things difficult. if you are primarily working on research, newer planets suffer when they could be building up their infrastructure, and provide fulfilling help to the empire, but instead being on the global governence they will contribute a pitence of research and almost never build up their infristructure. prior to 1.4 each planet could have its own governence but this became a nightmare of micromanagement when you had a large number of planets. they created an interesing  ""in-between"" that allows you to divirert things but in my opinion it is not enough to help balence things where they were before.The game has the ability to rely on the provided ai to assist with some of the micomanagement, however the AI is horible. It builds things almost at random, and the ship designs are just as worse. Last complaint is the space stations. it takes roughly 35 constor modules to fully build up a space station. the AI will only create constructors with only one construcotor modules, but with some work ones with 10+ modules can be created but it requires you to specifically send them roughout the univers instead of using the ""oh so conviennt"" request constructor button, which only uses the base constuctor. So instead of creating 2 ships for a fully build base it requires the 35. These are my biggest complaints. Overall though I enjoy the game as it is nice and relaxing. I just hate the 10 minutes I spend every turn directing my ships and orginizing my planets. If they can fix these things I will change my review but overall I give it an (7/10).			"

												((updated December 2015))I really enjoy playing this game, there's a lot in there that's a lot of fun to play with... The research, the production, the ship designing and creating your own factions... There's a LOT in this game that's a lot of fun.The problem is though, there's a lot of issues as well. Everytime I try to set up a multiplayer game, me and my brother end up having to set up games over and over usually around 3 - 4 times because one of us will be randomly disconnected before the start of the game.Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. We love playing with mods, and for a game like this, having mods gives an endless supply of changes and tweaks that can make the game more fun, the only problem is.... They can't be used multiplayer.It's disheartening when new 'content' is released for 5 dollars that seems to only break the game further, where many comments point out that yeah, it's fine that new stuff is released, but when the system is already buggy, these new systems add only more bugs and problems.Please just fix the game first, get multiplayer running smoothly, get mod support for multiplayer, right now if you look online, you barely see any games being hosted and those that do (I've been in a few and just asked about it) are from people who already know eachother... Noone is hosting games to find random players because the system is so unbelievably bad for setting something like that up.If you join a room, you know nothing about the game, about the selected win conditions, about the planet and universe settings, you just have to jump in blind... Who wants to jump in blind in the hopes of getting into a good game... The amount of times I've hosted a game and a random player joined only to leave when they found out what the game speed was set on, or the galaxy map, or any other part.It needs a better interface for multiplayer, more information that is given to joining players so they know (maybe even beforehand) what they are joining, instead of just hoping for a good game somehow.The game is fun, a lot of fun even, but the systems, the interface all make sure that multiplayer is a gruelling experience you only want to step into if you have people you know very well to play with.I plan on playing this game a lot more, especially multiplayer, but untill mod support is given, I cannot buy any expansion and add more content when the content that is there sometimes barely works as is.((Update))So, a couple of months have passed and though the UI has had some fixes and improvements, the game itself is still riddled with issues, multiplayer games still crash and Epic events are still not available for multiplayer games.I still keep on trying, because the game has a lot of potential, but it seems to be bogged down by technical issues that aren't being adressed.

												A very decent 4X game. Played for hours with a friend of mine, still trying to get things perfectly right. One thing at the moment (Mai 2016) is a bit frustrating: Despite the AI literally losing money they still spew out ships and manage to overtech you. It's just not nice when even an ""easy"" opponent makes -40bc each turn and throws stacks of ships at me. On the other hand: You don't have to give AI money, they don't seem to need it anyways :D			"

Posted: October 21, 2015
												I regret buying this game. Why?(Firstly, not one image in the videos is from actual game footage. Do not be deceived. This game relies on marketing to sell it. If you knew what I knew, you would not buy this game as it is broken in terms of functioning code and game design).Ok, some points about my game experience:(you can check every point in the game and they are all factual events. My opinion is not fact but it reflects my observence of these facts in the game)1 - Crashes every 15-30 minutes on insane mode due to memory leaks. I know it's memory leaks because there are arrays being created but not deleted or reused. Too much data is being accumulated somewhere and it results in the game becoming increasingly slower and slower and finally crashing and instantly going to desktop and closes the game. You will have a new appreciation for saving your progress between autosaves when you have long periods of time per turn before the next auto-save. Especially if you just spent 20 minutes cleaning out obsolete units to try and help the game become faster.----------2 - The space battles look ok at first but after a while you'll notice that it looks like all the spaceships are controlled by drunk drivers who love nothing better than to fly around like a dead goldfish in a whirlpool. This happens as they get closer and the maker seems to have a bad sense of what looks acceptable.----------3 - Sound often crashes. To overcome this flaw in coding: the music must be turned off and then back on - don't ask me why but it fixes the sound error. Sometimes the game will become unresponsive but not crash and return to windows. When you can no longer interact with anything, just save your current game in a new slot and re-load your game.----------4 - Computer AI cheats. I have it's bases totally surrounded and it magically creates armies and bases out of nothing in the middle of nowhere. Then the AI will tell me it surrenders and yet I still have to kill it anyway. Don't know if this is a bug or the game designer has a twisted idea of the word 'surrender'. Seriously, cheating is a last ditch effort for programmers who cannot make adaptive AI.----------5 - the game should be fun but I found it more tedious than my previous job doing data entry of government records OR data entry for Toyota.Why would I say this? There are few shortcuts to do anything in the game. You cannot mass delete, mass rally to a location, or even mass select other than stacking and making a fleet. There are no checkboxes or CTRL+Select to make selective deletion possible. You have to do many things individually and honestly this game felt more like a horrible job except that I'm the one paying to do it.... The hotkeys mentioned online do not work in most cases. ""Y"" works for yes, the working hotkeys are visible in tooltips but the online suggestions mostly do not work.----------6 - Just when you thought you were moving a slider to look at ships in a list, the tooltip blocks most of the list so you cannot even see what you are looking at.----------7 - the icons on the minimap are single pixels. Yes, you heard correctly, single pixels!!! Get ready for purple dot units on a purple background for it's team color. THe minimap is so bad I wanted to vomit, eat my vomit, poop it out, eat it again and vomit it again. It will provide hours of frustration as you squint to see wtf you are looking at. Also ship icons in groupings are impossible to recognize because they are just reduced scale images of large pictures. This results in ""WTF is that?"" moments and you have to then open up another menu to see what is what.And I'm using a 24"" screen 1900x1200 and the minimap is still terrible. Same color for ships on same color for your area of control....so bad....high school art class FTW...----------8 - The production and rally points are so messy that you'll find half your army hidden in buildings that you never intended them to be in.----------9 - I make games for a living and so that's partly why I'm so critical. However the game does have it's promising moments but most likely you'll be forcing yourself to play because you paid 40~70 dollars depending on what country you live in. I paid 70 :(----------10 - The game just isn't fun at all - that's my final opinion after I completed an 'insane size map' that took me 20 hours+ (probably another 2 hours if I include the lost time due to crashes). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion:----------Strategy:The only strategy really is to look at what weapons your enemy's ships have, what armor they have, and then choose the best rock, paper, scissor effect to win fights. The technology you choose should support how you want to play. Influence to steal bases, Friendly to win an alliance win, military to win fights and research to help you get an edge in whatever style you choose. Research alone will not win the game unless you choose that goal.----------Creativity:If you want to be creative in this game, you'll be very sad. The game has little opportunity for creativity and any startrek / starwars fetishes you have will be crushed when you see the ships floating like dead goldfish in a whirlpool. Yes, you can make spaceships with existing parts however the spaceships update so much and the game is so repetitive AND the battle scenes are so horrible that your art will be spat on by the current game design.----------Reward System:The main rule is that the inefficient player will lose to the AI. So your first few games will be hard but once you have those ""ah~~~I see "" moments where you realise how to beat the AI, you'll finish it easily but it will just take lots of time.Lack of patience is punished in this game.----------User Interface:Patience is also punished because this game makes you a full time data entry person thanks to a useless user interface (UI) which only caters for short games where the structure and unit count is smaller. When you have like 400 of these, the game's UI fails and just shows a blank screen beyond about 200 units in the list. Really helpful when the spaceship you want is at the bottom of the list and the filters don't move it to the top.----------Price and Music:Sorry to be critical but that's the way I am. I paid $70 for the game and I expected a $70 game but this seems more like a fancy prototype / alpha game. I wouldn't call it a beta because it was so buggy I really imagine the programmer to be inexperienced and not an eye for detail or design principles. Art is average but I'm very critical. Oh, and Music is AWFUL...thank goodness for 3rd party music players. Really, really depressing music with no passion in it.----------Closing Thoughts:Once again, sorry for being so critical but I earned that right when I paid $70 for a game that would have been fair if it was sold for $20~25Now when I read the following quote:""You must be running 64-bit Windows 7 or later to play Galactic Civilizations III. This requirement allows us to create the largest, most advanced, strategy game possible.""- I believe this translates into:""You need 64-bit because my coding is so bad that a 32 bit OS will fail very quickly because I can't clean arrays or debug my game. In other words, I'll break through my lack of coding skill by using your 64 OS to extend the life of my memory leaks.""----------Lesson Learned:I learned what kind of game design is less effective. This in turn helped me become a better game programmer. I'd avoid this game like the plague until the price comes down. Too late for me, can't be bothered reversing the transaction and having my Steam account limited until they work out why I reversed the bank transaction.			"

												This has to be one of the best games.  One of the things I do love about GC3 is the ability to both build structures on my planets and make ships.  So the game goes far faster than previous versions.  The Tech tree in 2 is a little better to me.  However, the majority of the techs are the same as 2.  The Graphics are better, but to be honest this type of game not that big of an issue.  The sound again is almost the same as 2.  The reason I would say buy it is the fun of the type of game.  So many games become out dated and never updated well or changed to much.  GC hasn't really changed to heavily.  They keep what works.  I do miss the ability to adjust taxes, but the overall game is great.  Who doesn't love making up ships to go kill your neighbors.			"

												If your a fan of 4x games, you'll like this one.  The AI is a little predictable though.  The races that focus on military might tend to be overpowered, wiping out those that prefer trade, influence, or diplomacy before they can build to become powerful in their own right.  All in all I like it, and its a big improvement over GC2.  I wish they had added some of the dlc to the main game.  It doesn't seem fair to have to pay more for what should have been basic parts of the game, or atleast part of the expansion.			"

Bigger maps = bettersuggested improvements - (1) Bring back miners on astroids as a way to increase planet production (2) Rebalance cost of producing ships - at game start the colony ship costs 58 to 62 turns ,  quickly it becomes 300 to 500 turns which kills the game - possible solution - allow players to build older models of ship designs  the old M-1 Colony would be cheeper but slower and less range which is fine. (3)  The special perks (items) that a few of the planets have - tool tips need to better describe their effect if any (4) On the ""manage planet"" screen and the Manage starbase"" screen - let the small map that normally appears in the upper right that shows the whole known galaxy and the individual planet/starbase location on it appear -  location may mean different selections for actions - and on turns where I start 2 planets or 2 starbases it is difficult to know which is which (5) Let the operator (game player) give names to rally points - the computer generated names are not helpful  (6)  Some of the color selections are difficult to see  -  insufficient contrast  -  example the yellow box in the galaxy screen that is usually in the upper right of the screen.  Yellow is a goos contrasting color but the pixel width of the lines in that screen renders it invisible (7) In the tactical battles - give the player options of say (a) all ships shoot at enemy ship closest to them or (b) all ships shoot at most dangerious ship in weapons range or (c) ?? (8) Create a on line game instruction book - that at lease gives the basics.Thanks for making a good game - and hope you are able to continue its evolution.			"

												Everything is ok  excape the section where you update, or biuld a new space craft. That part of the game does not working correctly. I have designed  ships in the designs area, and tryed to save them, All it does is one of two things,one is not save the design, or save the design, but will not let you build it. The auto designs build into the program, when, you go to the next larger ship, works fine usless you want to change or upgrade systems on it. Then then it does the same thing  as I stated in line. I have all the Gc series.                                                                                      Minor Duvall			"

												I very much enjoy this game. The only slight issues I have had are with multiplayer. My brother and I have a lot of fun playing this together. The only issues we have had is that sometimes when trying to join the game together the game locks up or has difficulties. Also we would both like to see the bigger universe sizes in multiplayer, I think this might be in beta.  More races would be fun, but then again we have also had a great time creating our own races. The only other thing that seems odd is that star base structures do not seem to be effected by influence. I have already recommened this game to  several friends. I think it is very worth the price for both the single and multiplayer activty.			"

												This has to be one of the best games.  One of the things I do love about GC3 is the ability to both build structures on my planets and make ships.  So the game goes far faster than previous versions.  The Tech tree in 2 is a little better to me.  However, the majority of the techs are the same as 2.  The Graphics are better, but to be honest this type of game not that big of an issue.  The sound again is almost the same as 2.  The reason I would say buy it is the fun of the type of game.  So many games become out dated and never updated well or changed to much.  GC hasn't really changed to heavily.  They keep what works.  I do miss the ability to adjust taxes, but the overall game is great.  Who doesn't love making up ships to go kill your neighbors.			"

I enjoy playing it allot and I can't wait to see what else new comes out. I hope the battle seens get a make over, because at the moment its boring to look at and I skip over them. it would be nice to see if a star base that are made for deffence only (without miners or influence) can protect planets from being invaded inside their range. I look forward to see what new things come out soon. Keep up the good work!			"

												A welcome addition to the Galactic Civilizations franchise.  I find this game to be a great balance between 4x and fun.  Not overly micromanagy (yup I made that up) but still lots of control.  Plus lets face it... the ship designer is where you will spend a lot of your time because who doesn't like awesome looking ships.  The workshop is already full of amazing designs.  Omnibus appears to love the ship designer more than the game and man does it show in his designs.Nothing will be a new MOO II.  This game doesn't need to be because it is GalCivIII.  Explore, conquer, design.			"

												In all I find GalCiv to be a very enjoyable game from which you can sink many hours into. I found out thehard way as I played this when I was meant to study Hey Intergaltic politics count as political studies dont they? The AI is good it doesnt do what other gmes of this genre do which is be predictable. I also like how thye got the balance and difficulty very well. I for one hate it when im playing a game like this and I feel to powerful on GalCiv ive been behind most of the time. One main issue is the drop of performance on the massive massive map size when ending your turn. Overall I love this game.			"

												I've enjoyed playing but was a little disappointed it is not deeper in terms of strategy and solar systems. Planetary invasion is over simple and it's hard not to succeed in a ground invasion. Various aliens are not really very unique. Planetary defenses aren't worth putting effort into as invasions suceed anyway. Orbital spacecraft are a race attribute ""Paranoid"" rather than technology and deliberately building planetary defenses. You can learn to put fighters on carriers but for some reason this doesn't translate into planet based fighters. Still very fun. But it could be great with a little effort. I have noticed it's alot more challenging if you disable technology trading.			"

Just not fantastic enough to overcome the micromanagement hell.			"

												This is amazing. If you are a fan of GC2, man oh man, you should own this. A lot of people would say that this game doesn't innovate enough, and there may be some value to their opinion. This is basically the same game, putting in a new and interesting campaign, polished up with nice graphics, with extra layers put in. Adjacency bonuses are one of the few new things in the game, a simple addition, but the fact that it makes you think about the layout of each of your planets, tickles something in me. It is a big step up from OG GC2 though, maintaining most of the innovations from the completed effort of both expansion packs. So if you go into it expecting a groundbreaking new game, you will be disappointed. But if you are a fan of the game, and can appreciate a completely rebuilt engine, polishing up what you loved for 2015. This is the game for you. *Sidenote* I invested 100$ in the elite founders pack. I know something like this is always a risk, but I am willing to bet on the company that bought us dark avatar, and twilight of the arnor. So that's it. I hope that you are enjoying the game like I am.			"

												A really nice 4X Strategy for once,  a rarity these days, great interface and ship designer, competent AI, economyon the simplistic side though. Great fun, but beware,  a very big ""1 more turn"" time sink.			"

												Nice update for the series, Pro1. Streamlined version of GalCiv 2 2. Enhanced ship designer - and automatic ship designs if you can't be bothered ! 3. If you liked the old game you will like the new mechanicns too ... Con1. Graphics are very similar with the old one , I wanted the galaxy to look different slicker more polished, (like elite dangerous universe) The planets the stars and the background needed to look much nicer than what they look now. ART was neglected big time, the graphic design the user experience design, the 3d graphics are not good. zooming in and out is not working well, the background images of the univerese are not looking good.   2. Music theme is also very similar with the old one. which is a good thing to have some recognisible tunes but bad if it sounds exactly the same. ART was neglected a bit again. I played 60 hours already (one game )and it seems that i will play at least one more so the game is good fun. But i was expecting a bit more oomph from the graphic front ... especially the starmap and UI problems			"

												The game has a steep learning curve, especially on bigger maps. I have had no major issues running the game on an older machine. I am new to the GC series but it shares many similarities with games like civilization. My one major complaint is that many of the techs and what they do are not explained very well. There is no encyclopedia function and the tutorial was not very helpful for anything but the most basics. If you like ""grand strategy"" sim type games this is for you, but be prepared to take time to learn the game even if your a veteran of games like civilization.			"

												A great addition to the series.  With the ability to not simply use the mainstream factions, but actually completely make your own and the ships to go with them, this is what I've been looking for in a space-based 4X game.  And this doesn't even include the cinematic battles. While they don't have the tactical challenge of Empire at War's space combat, it is still quite a sight to see (or not see) your creations do combat with villains from all the way back to the original game.  Add to that a workshop full of ship designs and factions that other people are sharing and it can really capture just how big space is.  So get the game, play it and try to prove just how great the creatures of your imagination are.			"

												Yeah I like the game and it's worth getting if you like this sort of genre. There are a few problems I've found personally: for a start it's sometimes dificult to see which planets are mine, making them stand out more on the map would fix it. Secondly an enemy can win, which just happened to me, and I have no idea how. It's also possible to buy ships from an ally in exchange for technology, then use their own ships to invade them. :) You can also bankrupt an enemy, as I did, by buying loads of ships from allies then gift them to an enemy, the upkeep then destroys their econimy XD. Personally I focus on food, growth and science, I also focus on one thing at a time normally... the mechanics are more or less fine, it's really just the interface which I dislike because like I said finding things like my ships, planets and star bases can be tricky.

												If you were a fan of Galactic Civlizations II, you will love Galactic Civilizations III.It seems to have everything the other game had, with all the annoying bits taken out. Starbase management no longer feels like a chore and the alien creator is much better, allowing you to create your own races of aliens and give guidelines for their personalities.The strong RPG element of the game is still there, with a very complex system of diplomacy. The computer opponents don't simply try to defeat you and each other; they can be assigned general personalities. The many paths to victory also allows the player much flexibility in style.Also, I give credit to Stardock for always abiding by strong standards and providing beautiful finished products. The battle simulator is extremely fun to watch, especially with large fleets. Play is intuitive, but complex.In short, I found it to be a beautiful, fun product that no fan of the genre will want to be without. "

Great game overall I would like some automation system where I can set an AI to construct buildings I want and govern them automaticaly. This becomes a real pain this a** if you are playing in a huge map with lots of planets. Still a great game.			"

												GC3 is a solid step forward in 4X gaming. As of late summer 2015, the game has a few rough edges which could use polishing (sub-optimal path plotting while moving units and stale UI panel components are probably the biggest 2 for me right now). However, Stardock has released updates recently addressing other flaws, indicating this not EA style abandonmed-ware. Most importantly:  the fundamentals foundation of GC3 appears stout. At the risk of sounding like a fan-boy, my assessment is this is currently the premier turn based strategy game on the market. This game supports the requisite feature set and strategic warfare dynamics I expect out from this genre, which the forefunner competitor's latest generation of titles should have but do not.Kudos to Stardock for finding a working formula, sticking with it, and judiciously knowing how far to go with incremental evolution.

												Galactic Civilizations 3 is certainly a good game in its current stage; however, I don't feel like it's currently worth its hefty price tag. If you're someone who strives to stay ahead in Technology, expect an uneventful start. I didn't get pulled into a war until ~400 turns in, which means I was just improving buildings for about two hours straight. Going to war early doesn't feel worth it since it costs so many credits to upgrade your ships to the latest version. AIs seem to have a static personality for now, which means every game they'll act exactly the same way (Krynn always seem to hate me no matter what). Unlike Civilization, where you can own a single city and still manage to win on even the hardest difficulty, expanion is a must here. But, to combat this, colonizing new planets does NOT affect your overall happiness as it does in Civ. The combat system is just beautiful. Cinematic views of battles are amazing, and feel very rewarding if you're on the winning side. Likewise, the cinematics throughout the game feel polished and rewarding; whether it's colonizing your first planet or building your first starbase, the game makes it feel like an actual accomplishment. If you have money to blow, get this game. If not, wait for a sale. Though the game is lacking a bit right now, as most 4X games do when they're new, I trust that it will continue to expand, and eventually justify its price tag.			"

Maybe even Gal Civ4, but they have to impreove this game or they will lose a lot of supporters.Please rfix the AI.  The computer has to have a better colony build system.  When I take over a colony it is a mess.  I am not a programmer but is it really that hard to tell the computer to build farms next to each other?This about the only real comlaint I have.  I think this game is a great multi-player game.  It would take forever, but it would be a lot of fun.  What is not fun is PVE.  The AI is just so bad.Please fix.			"

												Nice game if you like space strategy. It requires however, 64bit windows and capable machine. The game is enjoyable but needs good training to start. This is provided in the tutorial section once the game is installed. Patience will be needed, especially at the begining. After that, you will notice that your skills are improving and things are making more sense.The game however, had an issue with save/load function. This problem can be solved by checking the integrity of files and download what will be needed to fix corrupted files. Not a problem if you know how to do it. Please google it to know more (easy task). Another disadvantage is the price. Understandable, as the game just been launched recently. However, you can get another type of game for a cheaper price tag. All in all, I recommend it to certain type of players, who like strategy, willing to spend time learning how to play and finally accepting to pay the price tag. If you are one of those players, then go for it. You won't regret it.			"

												Great Game like all of the same franchise.Those who appreciated gc I and II will surely appreciate this one too. On the other hand there is not much evolution from gc II and the game almost looks like a replica of it with no substantyial add-on. The 3D map is nice to see but maybe too much heavy for not top-rated hardware, and there is not much video settings as well to overcome this issue, resulting in very clumsy map navigation. The campaign its really disappointing: only 3 (small) maps, too short and too easy. Kinematics clips rather poor too. As in previous version the best feature still remains the ship designer,  which on the other hand makes me wish for some more interactive 3D battles which is entirely missing. Diplomacy is somehwat improved. Commerce may be too basic.			"

New graphics, better gameplay, more streamlined. While the game still has a few issues that need to be addressed, I highly recommend it for anyone that enjoys 4x games. Hopefully when the few issues get resolved, this game can be the GREAT game that it is capable of.			"

												1) The UI in this games needs work. Look at GC2 you could organize Fleets, Planets, Starbases much better than this game.  This game is larger than GC2 which means it is currently an organizual (sp?) nightmare.  I perfer to play on the largest maps with a large number of factions. I usally have no desire to play on the smaller maps.2) The AI is not very good in this game GC2 seems to have a better AI (I still play it from time to time.) 3) I play a lot of MP and SP and the MP needs to be able to play on the largest map sizes and be able to select Pirates as we can in the SP game. In fact we should be able to have all the same options in MP as we do in SP.  My friends and I love to play MP on the largest map possible and we really want to play on Immense size maps.4) The Ship editor is great but it would be nice if we can attach ship designs to certain factions where only that faction gets them as default. For Example, I would like to attach Sar Trek Federation ships to the faction, The Federation. So that when they are played either by a player or AI they use only those ships. 5) The game does have a lot of potential and there are some cool stuff in it however some of the things above need to be addressed. Escpecially the AI.  6) Now I know this won't happen but what would really make this game awsome is putting in an OPTION for tactical space battles. It is a shame (and this can be said for all the GC titles) that you have this awsome ship designer yet we cannot control these ships in battle.  Now I would perfer full control but any control would be better than just watching a movie.  "

												A graphically updated version of GCiv II, with an AI that is a bit more complex.  If you were a fan before,  you will enjoy this game.  If you have never played in this sandbox, the micro-management may seem daunting, but this is the perfect empire building game that will give you a sense of accomplishment after 30 minutes, yet keep you playing for hours.  The tech tree is a little less intuitive than before, but new additions to it make this change more interesting than troublesome.  Space Battles are all about blending the right gear to best your opponent.  while land battles have been extremely streamlined, making this part of the game flow much quicker.			"

												I very much enjoy this game. The only slight issues I have had are with multiplayer. My brother and I have a lot of fun playing this together. The only issues we have had is that sometimes when trying to join the game together the game locks up or has difficulties. Also we would both like to see the bigger universe sizes in multiplayer, I think this might be in beta.  More races would be fun, but then again we have also had a great time creating our own races. The only other thing that seems odd is that star base structures do not seem to be effected by influence. I have already recommened this game to  several friends. I think it is very worth the price for both the single and multiplayer activty.			"

												This has to be one of the best games.  One of the things I do love about GC3 is the ability to both build structures on my planets and make ships.  So the game goes far faster than previous versions.  The Tech tree in 2 is a little better to me.  However, the majority of the techs are the same as 2.  The Graphics are better, but to be honest this type of game not that big of an issue.  The sound again is almost the same as 2.  The reason I would say buy it is the fun of the type of game.  So many games become out dated and never updated well or changed to much.  GC hasn't really changed to heavily.  They keep what works.  I do miss the ability to adjust taxes, but the overall game is great.  Who doesn't love making up ships to go kill your neighbors.			"

I hope the battle seens get a make over, because at the moment its boring to look at and I skip over them. it would be nice to see if a star base that are made for deffence only (without miners or influence) can protect planets from being invaded inside their range.

												Great 4X game, very diversified tech tree requiring careful weighing of what you need and when. I've explored this game quite a bit and still I see myself getting back to this game in the future. Diplomacy and tech trading is important too, it's not just something you can ignore, so that's nice. Combat is simplified but the different weapon types and tech choices you have to make keep the tension on early on. Overall, I'd recommend this game without hesitation, and I should add that you don't need a total beast of a computer to play on pretty huge maps, the game remains stable and running smoothly. The one thing that could be improved is with (micro)managing planets. It works perfectly when you have 10 planets at the start of a game, but it gets annoying once you start conquering neighbours and terraforming your planets, and it's just a total pain when you're going for a conquest victory with 100+ planets. Maybe a macromanager for planets, beyond production / science / money levels, with a build order that could be customized and applied?			"

I wish that ship to ship combat was more strategic instead of watching the program act out the battle.

												Decent game but needs some balancing. Starrbases are horribly underpowered and weak with pitiful range. You can play games with the AI to keep them from destroying certain assest where a Human player would just ignore. There needs to be tactics settings when your ships goto battle, at least some interaction rather than just watching random outcomes. The tech tree is confusing at 1st, there needs to be a little more explination on the benifits and detriments to a particular choice, otherwise you have to figure it out by trial and error and the games can be long and you find out you made a poor choice 5 plus hours into a game. You cant have mutilpe parties picking the same race on a multiplayer skirmish, why ? You can't change you ship color or Icon or Profile picture. The game has great potential, Im supprised the simple issues I spoke about havent been addressed.			"

Maybe even Gal Civ4, but they have to impreove this game or they will lose a lot of supporters.Please rfix the AI.  The computer has to have a better colony build system.  When I take over a colony it is a mess.  I am not a programmer but is it really that hard to tell the computer to build farms next to each other?This about the only real comlaint I have.  I think this game is a great multi-player game.  It would take forever, but it would be a lot of fun.  What is not fun is PVE.  The AI is just so bad.Please fix.			"

												GalCiv 3 is a turn-based strategy game where you start off with three ships and a single planet and go on to explore and strive to prosper in a galaxy as immense and interesting as you choose to make it. It plays similar to Sid Meier's Civilization, but with so many controllable variables that you literally can set the features to only include what you enjoy and turn off whatever annoys you. Unless you just don't like turned based 4x games at all, it's pretty much impossible not to love this one.If you are a fan of the series, you will enjoy GC3 for the same reasons as its predecessors. It's very much the same game with a few new wrinkles and augmentations that fit comfortably into the formula and leave the core look and feel intact. In fact my one complaint about GalCiv 3 is that I was expecting, and hoping for, a more dramatic improvement in the production values. Apparently, most of the new features that made 64 bit processing a requirement for this game have to do with things like unbelievably large maps and not so much with making the experience seem more realistic and immersive in the course of normal play. It must be said that you get absolutely gorgeous detail (and excellent sound effects) when you zoom in tight on a ship, or a world, or even a star or junk planet. But you can't actually PLAY up close like that, and at the zoom level you'll have to use for everything but combat, GC3 still looks and feels like a 2D board game with 1990s graphics, with ships, planets, and resources reduced to crude icons and the overlay destroying the sense of being in outer space. That's heartbreaking when the components look so 3D, realistic, and beautiful close up.Speaking of combat -- as in previous GalCivs and even more so in this edition, the space battle graphics and sound are near motion picture quality, and in that sense aesthetically satisfying. I was disappointed however to find no improvement at all from GalCiv 2 in terms of the visual perspective you are provided from which to see this eye candy. If you choose the ""Cinematic"" setting, you'll see slick, wonderful pans, cuts, and strafing views similar to watching a movie, but as often as not they don't show the action you're interested in -- for instance, you might get a shot that revolves around the starbase you're attacking without showing any of your ships. The Top Down view is better from a tactical perspective, but it's not particularly immersive and if like me you design your spacecraft to look best in profile, as they are shown in every sci-fi movie, TV show, book cover, and derivative art form, watching them from straight overhead is unsatisfying. You'd think the ""Free"" view would provide whatever perspective you want to see, and it can -- but it's so cumbersome to adjust that by the time you line up the ship(s) you want to focus on at the angle that's most pleasing to look at, the fight is over. It should also be pointed out, if you don't already know, that GalCiv battles are spectate-only -- you design and deploy your ships with meticilous control, but during an actual battle you have no input whatsoever -- none. It would be nice to have some options such as focusing fire on a particular enemy ship or turning one of your damaged shields away from the line of fire, or even an option to attempt retreat if a fight is going badly. This is not as frustrating as it probably sounds, and probably some future GC rendition will experiment with limited battle control. For now though, it's completely hands-off.But these observations are offered for clarity only and in no way diminish my enthusiastic endorsement of this game. The GalCiv games are true classics -- a joy to play for any strategy gamer, and particularly if you're into the space setting. And, happily, GC3 doesn't do anything to screw that up. It's the best installment yet in terms of customization, and you can easily make it into a Star Trek game, or Star Wars, or Farscape, or Firefly, or any other Sci-Fi mythos you're into. Custom ships are fun and easy to create with the huge assortment of parts and the best design tools of any game ever, and putting Captain Picard or Han Solo at the helm in place of the game's stock characters is just a download away. I would like to see the series evolve into state of the art presentation at some point -- but in the mean time, I'll keep on playing GalCiv as one of my everpresent sandbox games just because it is so damned fun. It's got that 4x ""just one more turn"" appeal in spades, and its replayability is essentially without limit. If you're considering this game at all -- get it. You won't be sorry. :)			"

												This is a good game. In order to make this a helpful review I'll review different points below.Good stuff:------------- The game has interesting races to choose from and in addition has excellent functions for you to make your very own custom race including; racial traits, different leader/race pictures, starting system planetary setup and so on.- Excellent automation options. You can set rally points and many other parameters for ALL shipyards, and so on, via a very simple and fast menu, no hassle at all to manage a sprawling empire.- Very good ship customization. This isn't something I use as I lack the patience for it, but if you like to decide how your ships should look then you can spend a LOT of time in the ship builder!- Nice cutscenes and pictures when you colonize and gain resources. I'd like more of them though since they set the tone and atmosphere in the game. - Not all planets are equal. Some planets will have more/less building space than others. You CAN develope them so they can house more imprevements, but only to a degree. I like this, this makes planets different and you would do well to protect your more precious planets. - Space battles. I actually like that you have no direct control over battles. I'm the leader of the nation, not the admiral in the fleet. - Bad stuff: (Some of this stuff is more about my own personal preferance rather than objectively negative things)------------- The game could have used more immersion than it currently has. Perhaps more specific and different UI:s or so. - For me personally the mid game turns much into a click fest where I just press ""next turn"". I suspect that this has to do with me playing too passively and too peacefully. - I'm also not a fan of how planets are developed. Buildings of the same type give proxomity bonii to buildings of the same type. This is a true and tried mechanic but, without being able to give an example of a  ""better"" system, I would have liked a different logistics systems. - Space battles. This is my first GC game so I have no idea how battles were modelled before. But battles look a little silly. Ships bump into each other and circle/wobble around each other in a drunken fashion making the ships look like little rubber toys rather than advanced warships engaging in deadly space battles.			"

												If you are looking for a thoughtful game that can be played, saved, loaded another time, played, and put away for a while then this is a great choice.  The game is still being polished but most of the basic required game elements are in place to allow you to take this with you on the go, to play during a lunch break, or enjoy a lengthy hospital stay and not worry about falling asleep and waking up dead.  Again, not a flashy, frenzied, shoot ‘em up, but a thinking person’s game where early decisions and sacrifices can yield huge dividends in later game play.			"

												This game like many other 4x games is very addictive. Its great fun and you always want to do just one more turn. The ship designer is very good and you can create just about any ship you have seen in sci-fi movies as well as design your own look. You can create and design your own race and decide what bonuses or penalties your race should have from a number of options.There are a few things that annoy me though. Diplomacy could use a bit more work. The AI has no respect for your borders. You can't destroy their ships inside your borders without declaring war. You can't warn the AI to stay out of your borders or demand that the AI remove a star base inside your borders the AI can however request that you remove yours inside their borders.While I really like the control you have and how much you can micro manage your empire this becomes a chore when you have say 25 or more planets. I would like to be able to make a template for the planets window where I set core buildings for an industrial planet, core buildings for a science planet, core buildings for economy planets and core buildings for a bread basket.

												Ok i put into a ton of hours into the game even more the the origianl civilizations which is a great game as well. but besides that point of the review. what do i think of the game. well considering i put almost 200 hpurs into the game that can tell you everything about it.This game is a great space 4x strategy game. now what are thing that i like about the game.1. your can create a custom race. I loved the customization for the game you could practilly spend hours withot even playing the game and still have a ton of fun. make what you want. I created my own rce in the game and it's awsome. and the ship designer along with factions and the workshop incorporated in the game. that can bring some more replayablility due to custom faction and make thing like x wings from star wars, or the enterprise from star trek.2. the gameplay is solid. you have 8 races to play with their own uniqe traits and this can effect how you play and adds more time to replay value for the game. if your a fan of space/si-fi game this will be your dream game. running you very own empire the way you want and conquer the galaxy. A side note, I'd like to thank Angry Joe for streaming this game months ago, if it wasnt for that i would not be playing this game. the game is rich in content and feel just like an RPG, but in SPACE!Now what are some thing that disappointed me or didn't like1. No local Multiplayer but it does have online multiplayer so there that2. There were some issues (for me at least) that the game crashed somtime while loading the designer screen where you design ship i had that happen about 2 times so it does crash and have bugs3. the A.I. is a bit of a pushover if your playing on lower difficultys. and with that (and i can't comfirm that this happens on higher difficultys above normal) it lead to exploiting some things with the A.I. like wearing down opposing fleets that im at war with useing shipyards. So i would recommand you play on higher difficultys that is above normal. though it doesn't work all the tim but it can happen with smaller fleet sizes and having a tone of preduction to produce shipyards about every turn at will.4. the cainpain was surpisingly short there are three campain maps though it does make up for it in time with objectives and bigger maps. at least it's not 4 hours. at least i think it is.Now i would recommand this game but only if you like sitting at your compter for hours and have a beast machine and play for hours. if you have a low end pc it might not be the greatest thing to buy but once you get a better pc then get this game.

												Hi all just got done playing GCV 3 .. So i just wanna add my oppinion. first off yea typical 4x strategy on par with endless space yet feels as though you can take the upper hand early un unlike endless space which leaves you lagging all through the game right until you unlock the high tier stuff when you finally start to make a difference in gal ciiv 3 you can do this pretty early on which is goodthe down side is all races share the same technology and that for me makes the game dull and boring and removes the potential for replayability as other races.. it would be nice for once to have a game like this where each race is unique and has unique bonuses and their own technology and have it represented visualy in the game too.i love the customisation and again would be better with each races own personal tech and research. all in all a good 4x strat and works great at its core as a strategy game.   so yea defo worth buying.. thew final down side is having to pay again for DLC... im not a big fan of paying twice three times let alone four times for the same product ..   if you buy a game that should include all updates with it.. not to be resold to us later on !!! it seems like we have paid for half a game.  so yea not impressed with that aspect.  and certainly will not be paying for DLC which should be included in the game. i concider this to be theft. and will not be a victim of it.

												Awesome Franchise... One of my absolute favorite games by far. Bought it pre-beta the second it found out about it! Does not dissapoint. could use some tweaks and upgrades here and there, but nothing signifigant. overall I'd give it a 9.5/10.Easily the best space sim on the market. Lots of depth and customization ability, Plus great fan community! I reccomend this to anyone and everyone who loves simulators and space! ENJOY!			"

												Not without it's flaws, GalCiv3 is a an excellent 4X game that provides the depth and interest expected in such a title.  Stardock isn't done getting things right but it's definitely a playable, solid game that brings depth, choice, and fun to the genre.  It was worth it at full price but if you can get it at a discount, you are ahead of the power curve with this game.			"

												Yeah I like the game and it's worth getting if you like this sort of genre. There are a few problems I've found personally: for a start it's sometimes dificult to see which planets are mine, making them stand out more on the map would fix it. Secondly an enemy can win, which just happened to me, and I have no idea how. It's also possible to buy ships from an ally in exchange for technology, then use their own ships to invade them. :) You can also bankrupt an enemy, as I did, by buying loads of ships from allies then gift them to an enemy, the upkeep then destroys their econimy XD. Personally I focus on food, growth and science, I also focus on one thing at a time normally... the mechanics are more or less fine, it's really just the interface which I dislike because like I said finding things like my ships, planets and star bases can be tricky.

												Review as of v1.4:I am a big fan of Galciv 2 and this game hits that Galciv feeling. I have no hesitation in recommending this game to 4x players. The game is really good, no question.The devs have made a lot of progress since release; and 1.4 is a big improvement for the ai - for me most notably is that the ai won't spam starbases everywhere anymore.My fav things:- tech tree is so much better than galciv2- nebulae and other stellar background (like black holes)- strategic resources- ship designer - it is insanely good- building on planets is beautiful, smooth and satisfying (especially the adjacency mechanic - making this nicely strategic)Issues:- still buggy in places (but have never had a full on crash). Two bugs for me are that the ai spams messages which are clearly not relevant; and some information doesn't refresh straight away creating some genuine confusion as to what is happening.- feature light-ish (this is only a comment in relation to galciv 2, it still has a great many features). I'm sure expansions will correct this and go beyond galciv 2; as it stands in no way is galciv 3 an incomplete game.- small payable dlc ... why are these things not in base game kinda thingSummary:Gameplay is unquestionably fun, the world is immersive, the sound design is great and the ai is a challenge. This is a good 4x game and I look forward to further patches, development and of course the three planned expansions.Go buy.EDIT: forgot to say how awesome the multiplayer is, smooth and crisp. The game is also 64 bit which is a massive step up from galciv 2 creating what I can only describe as a brilliant play experience with no lag experienced yet.			"

												The game has a steep learning curve, especially on bigger maps. I have had no major issues running the game on an older machine. I am new to the GC series but it shares many similarities with games like civilization. My one major complaint is that many of the techs and what they do are not explained very well. There is no encyclopedia function and the tutorial was not very helpful for anything but the most basics. If you like ""grand strategy"" sim type games this is for you, but be prepared to take time to learn the game even if your a veteran of games like civilization.			"

												Ok, there are some negative reviews, and their issues are not wrong. On large maps the game rapidly becomes clunky and very time consuming. Micro-management of every little issue can bog turns down a bit if you are a bit of a perfectionist. I play games to have fun however. So I just build whatever I need to keep my empire going and tweak it as I go along. That means I don't get bogged down. I would probably be thrashed in a multiplayer by an optimiser. However my turns take 5 minutes as opposed to their half hour turns and I am having more fun. ^_^A nice big, heavily detailed turn based sci-fi strategy game with excellent race customisation, good ship construction, nicely sized tech trees and the possibility for galaxy maps that feel like they are an actual galaxy. The game does not lag too badly even on the largest maps. The automated battles run pretty well and look fantastic!I like this game quite a bit and would recommend it. The $50 price tag is a little too high and yes, it crashes sometimes (in particular when generating a new map it will sometime CTD). The UI does take a lot of clicking back and forward when fiddling with production and taxation settings. However if you are patient it is worth it. :)Check it out. :D			"

								Watching this one move through development is my prime example of how Early Access should happen. Solid concept, great (in every sense of the word) developers, implementation of complex features and ideas, all of which have really, really come together with Beta 6. Riddle me impressed.The game's fun and offers a decent step up from GalCiv2, maintaining many of the features that make the series familiar but with many very welcome revamps of several mechanics (resources are a big one) which breathe fresh air into this galactic-scale empire-building 4x series. The well-thought-out mechanics sheer hard work put into the game have turned it from a humorous shell of a demo into a truly polished product.Be warned, this game, as its predecessors and a few of its contemporaries, suffers badly from ""one more turn"" syndrome. Please finish your homework, children, and watch the time or you'll easily find yourself playing until sunrise.			"

Early Access Review
								I was introduced into the Galactic Civilizations franchise with number 2 quite a few years ago and I was astonished at how such a great title had slipped past my love of strategy games for so long. I had played it almost too death but then its expansions Dark Avatar and Twilight of the Arnor brought new life and experiences too an already vibrant universe and I once again plunged into the expansive galactic scene in great enjoyment.With the announcement of the third title you can make a good guess how exited I was too re-enter this universe and couldn't wait too lose myself in it again.I may not have too many hours currently on record but believe me that will most likely change quickly and so far I'll say the game does not disappoint. It's presentation and graphics are beautiful but as any good video games player knows, good graphics does not always define a good game. The expansive ship designer has made a gallant return and has been adjusted for easier access for new players and greater creativity for more experienced players. Of course the feature that  Gal Civ has been well praised for is it's shear capacity to let the player create the empire he wishes too with no restrictions whether it be an empire founded and risen by war,trade,culture,diplomacy and others ways.There are a few technical bugs which are caused by either the game and/or the rig your playing on but that's too be expected and I'm sure will be addressed accordingly. However with an interesting single player story and a sandbox mode were absolutely anything can happen, strategy players with minds set on conquering the heavens in anyway they desire will not be let down with Galactic Civilizations III.

												A turn-based strategy game on a galactic scale. The short of it is, Galactic Civilizations 2 with a more simple and smooth feeling tech tree (or tech trees as the case is) which keeps the same capacity for user-created vessels and races.Pros:-Galactic Scale turn based strategy-Customization to a reasonable extent without any need for modding-Variable degrees of AI difficulty-Honestly the graphics are quite lovely zoomed in, even if you'll usually have to zoom out to see things overall.Cons:-Game can feel 'slow', even for a turn-based strategy-Tech trees can still be tedious to work through-Random planet generation often likes to place tiles and upgrades in nonsensical places (Even homeworlds are random)-Units turn pretty insane pretty rapidly once you hit a certain tech level, and often those units will utterly annihalate things like starbases that may have taken 50+ turns to build up in the blink of an eye.

												Why did you remove the planet production wheel?Why is it not even an option anymore?Why did you think it was a good idea to change such a large gameplay element when it's not in alpha (or even beta for that matter) anymore?With it's removal you've just promoted improvement spam, made the game needlessly long and made it a requirement that planets manufacture and research constantly, otherwise it's wasting raw production.And yes I know that currently I am talking about an update that is in beta (not that it matters, major gameplay changes shouldn't be done in beta), but the developers have been talking about removing the wheel for a while. With the next mandatory update the planet production wheel will be gone.This game has been ruined.Edit:The main game has been updated, the planet production wheel has been officially removed.Edit [5/11/15]:Despite the dev being arsey about it, the wheel is back:1.

												Galactic Civilizations III is a beautiful and well made 4x space empire managment game.  Having played MOO1, MOO2, Gal Civs 1,2 and now number 3, this is by far the most engaging and challenging game yet.________________________________________________________________Pros:   Very nice graphics all around.  Planets now show city lights on the dark side and the background is just beautiful.  Ships also really pop out.  Huge fleet battles looks really good!  The Ship Designer is top notch as always.  Plenty of options to make almost anything you can imagin.  A lot of nice fixes to diplomacy. Every race no longer DoW for no reason... except the Drengin but that's    expected.  The absolute huge size of the galaxy makes for some epic empire vs empire wars.  I only play on Insane size!  Civilization customization is well done and there are so many options to make the civilization of your dreams.  Steam Workshop support.  Makes up for the lack of starting civs by using the faction mods and can add some awesome looking ships to your game.  Lots of great work done by the community.  Continuing the story/campiegn from previous Gal Civs.  (That opening cutscene is just AWESOME!)____________________________________________________________Cons:    (As of this review) No planetary invasion cutscenes or otherwise some neat way of seeing your troops conquer the planet.  It all happens in the background instantly and is very anti-climatic.  This is something that was in previous Gal Civs but not in this one and it is a little bit of a let down.  I hold out hope that Stardock will add it in either by patch or DLC.  Needs some better management/organization options for fleets.  Whenever you add a ship to a fleet it changes the fleets name to some random number with your factions name.  For me the naming of fleets is important so I can at a glance of the list tell where certain fleets are without cycling though all of them. This can get annoying when upgrading ships you will need to change the fleet name each time you add the ship back into fleet.  When I have 50+ Fleets of various sizes and purposes running around, trying to remember which ones I named what can get frustrating.   Though civilizations will not DoW as much I still have the unbelieveable occurence of some civs (Drengin mostly) DoW even if they are not even remotly in range of my empire to fight/invade.  So it is a war in name only.  The AI bu now should be able to take into account the distance of it's empire to the one it wants to DoW.  When you make another Civ know you want to destroy them they tend to prepare for you and this kind of removes the possablility of being attacked by suprise (ex: Peral Harbor style)   AI Behavior in general:  The AI can behave in some strange ways and seems to lack proper skills to manage their own planets.  I tend to find their planets near rebellion or under developed.  I then find it strange to see with such poor managment how they can afford fleets of such epic size.  In fact I would say AI behavior is the biggest flaw in this game._________________________________________________________Conclusion:  Depsite the cons, which are in my opinion really kinda minor when it comes to the rest of this game,  Galactic Civilizations III is one of the very top 4x strategy games on the market at this very moment.  Very engaging and beautiful, I tip my hat to you Stardock... well done.  I look forward to see what else you bring to this game and series. "

												I've been playing Galactic Civilizations from the start of the series.  Fans of the earlier titles are likely to enjoy this iteration.  Most of the core ideas are well-implemented, and the look of the game is appropriately updated.  Particular highlights include a more diverse body of random events (even before obtaining the Mega Events DLC), an ideological system, race-specific tech trees, and an incredibly nuanced ship designer.  Of course, there is robust support for custom-designed content, which should proliferate as the playerbase grows.For people unfamiliar with the series, Galactic Civilizations is about competitive empire-building.  In the standard game, a player begins with a spacefaring race still limited to its homeworld.  Simultaneously managing exploration, settlement, economic development, technological growth, and security concerns; the aim is to colonize distant worlds and thrive.  Victory conditions often include peaceful options like diplomacy or even transcending physical existence itself, though violent conquest is also on the list.  Managing large happy colonies provides the resources to attempt the loftiest goals.Having played many games in this 4X genre, I feel Galactic Civilizations III strikes a nice balance between accessibility and complexity.  It is possible to control every detail right down to the placement of decorative fins on warships, but delegating to the AI to focus on high-level questions and strategic command is also a viable approach.  I don't yet have enough experience to have a strong opinion about the AI, but I find the normal difficulty setting suitable for learning the ropes.  Ideology is a particular treat, giving significant consequence to the morality of crucial choices.  For players willing to put in the time a serious strategy game demands, Galactic Civilizations III should provide many hours of pleasant satisfaction.			"

												I do recommend the game for those that played 1 and 2 or any of the Civilzation style games and liked them.  I did find some of the extreme times on research a bit tedious and I did find the income remains a bit too slow to develop.  I don't want to spend forever on the larger galaxies and that IS what it ends up feeling like when you make the research trees and income take that long while making the game start out at ridiculous sublight technology levels.  Too slow to develop and way too economically pinched to remain fun for any but the most devoted.  If you choose to cater to the extremists in this regard you will lose too many of the casuals.  I love this genre and I loved so much about this game other than the slow research trees and restrictively slow economic growth.  That being said my son, brother and best friend all played it once and I think the reiterated quote was ""It's no Masters of Orion""  although they did admit to my defense of the wonderful new ideas, expansive ship design and beautiful graphics.  You lost every one of them with one or both of my stated issues.  Myself, I like it albeit with the caveat of those issues.			"

The ship designer is massive and at first was so in depth as to be off-putting, but after you've played a game or two and are comfortable with the rest of the game, taking the time to custom build your own ships can be very satisfying.My main problem with the game is that several of the tooltips need to be improved.  In particular, some of the tech's are a bit misleading if you don't read them very carefully.			"

												I really enjoy playing this game. I have been looking for a good 4X game and am glad I found this one. After playing for about a week, I realized how all other games have fallen short. I really like how the game gives me the option to be as detailed as possible when managing my planets or if I do not want to micro-manage, the option is there to let the AI handle it. I can see myself playing this game for hours. Bravo!			"

												A nice successor to the others. My only complaint is I wish the AI was a bit better so it didnt have to compensate by just giving them a metric ♥♥♥♥-ton of ships. If you want to win by any means other than conquest you have to have enough ships to pull off the conquest - and then do somethign else.			"

												If your a fan of 4x games, you'll like this one.  The AI is a little predictable though.  The races that focus on military might tend to be overpowered, wiping out those that prefer trade, influence, or diplomacy before they can build to become powerful in their own right.  All in all I like it, and its a big improvement over GC2.  I wish they had added some of the dlc to the main game.  It doesn't seem fair to have to pay more for what should have been basic parts of the game, or atleast part of the expansion.			"

												Played 4 games on immense galaxy - total play time approx 80 hours.   Game is an improvement over Gal Civ IIThe research tree is better in that it is not laid out from the start - but you discover it.  Bigger maps = bettersuggested improvements - (1) Bring back miners on astroids as a way to increase planet production (2) Rebalance cost of producing ships - at game start the colony ship costs 58 to 62 turns ,  quickly it becomes 300 to 500 turns which kills the game - possible solution - allow players to build older models of ship designs  the old M-1 Colony would be cheeper but slower and less range which is fine. (3)  The special perks (items) that a few of the planets have - tool tips need to better describe their effect if any (4) On the ""manage planet"" screen and the Manage starbase"" screen - let the small map that normally appears in the upper right that shows the whole known galaxy and the individual planet/starbase location on it appear -  location may mean different selections for actions - and on turns where I start 2 planets or 2 starbases it is difficult to know which is which (5) Let the operator (game player) give names to rally points - the computer generated names are not helpful  (6)  Some of the color selections are difficult to see  -  insufficient contrast  -  example the yellow box in the galaxy screen that is usually in the upper right of the screen.  Yellow is a goos contrasting color but the pixel width of the lines in that screen renders it invisible (7) In the tactical battles - give the player options of say (a) all ships shoot at enemy ship closest to them or (b) all ships shoot at most dangerious ship in weapons range or (c) ?? (8) Create a on line game instruction book - that at lease gives the basics.Thanks for making a good game - and hope you are able to continue its evolution.			"

												Everything is ok  excape the section where you update, or biuld a new space craft. That part of the game does not working correctly. I have designed  ships in the designs area, and tryed to save them, All it does is one of two things,one is not save the design, or save the design, but will not let you build it. The auto designs build into the program, when, you go to the next larger ship, works fine usless you want to change or upgrade systems on it. Then then it does the same thing  as I stated in line.

												A solid space strategy game. It has the exploration, expansion, economy, diplomacy and tech with multiple elements to a successful game. It also has a vein of humour I've appreciated.I've had the odd irritation where something doesn't work properly (seems to often be related to having a ship with unused moves at a planet/station), but not enough to break the game. Designing your own race and ships is a big plus for me. I've won games because I tweaked ship designs to exploit my own available resources and negate my opponent's strengths. Recommend.			"

												I've enjoyed playing but was a little disappointed it is not deeper in terms of strategy and solar systems. Planetary invasion is over simple and it's hard not to succeed in a ground invasion. Various aliens are not really very unique. Planetary defenses aren't worth putting effort into as invasions suceed anyway. Orbital spacecraft are a race attribute ""Paranoid"" rather than technology and deliberately building planetary defenses. You can learn to put fighters on carriers but for some reason this doesn't translate into planet based fighters. Still very fun. But it could be great with a little effort. I have noticed it's alot more challenging if you disable technology trading.			"

												Galactic Civilizations III is a wonderful 4x space strategy game. If you like these types of game you will not be disappointed.  I have played these 4x space strategy games since masters of orion. New elementes were added which truely improved upon this genre. Such differing tile bonus dependent on the planet, special resources which are needed for specific upgrades to your ships, the spaceship creator is amazing, and the list of improvement from the old title continue. The epic maps that one can play now with excessive and insane is incredable. Warning dependent on your machine it may not be playable for theese huge galaxies.The weakest part of the game is the ai which has been improved upon since release which it needed. Diplomacy is a bit weak too however as you figure out the game you will be able to make peace with stronger military powers which some complain is impossible to do. I will tell you now it is not. Even if they are at war with you it is not very difficult to make peace if you have a lot of cash on hand. The learning curve of this type of game might be to great for someone who has never played a 4x space sandbox before but if you plug away you will find a path that works for you for Victory!			"

I admit I haven't learned every nuance of the game as I am not one to read the book before I play.  It has been so fun to learn that I've done nothing else but play this game since I bought it about a week ago.  If you enjoyed playing Civ V this game is for you, it does not disappoint.Learning how to stack item bonuses on planets was probably the most difficult thing to learn.  Once you get passed that learning curve this game becomes much more enjoyable.			"

												A great addition to the series.  With the ability to not simply use the mainstream factions, but actually completely make your own and the ships to go with them, this is what I've been looking for in a space-based 4X game.  And this doesn't even include the cinematic battles. While they don't have the tactical challenge of Empire at War's space combat, it is still quite a sight to see (or not see) your creations do combat with villains from all the way back to the original game.  Add to that a workshop full of ship designs and factions that other people are sharing and it can really capture just how big space is.  So get the game, play it and try to prove just how great the creatures of your imagination are.			"

												It's a pretty boring dissappointment which pains me to say as I've enjoyed the franchise over the years.The Good: Ship design - none betterTidy empire managementNostalgia/familiaritySteam workshopThe Bad:Graphics - it already looks oldCombat - it's uninspired and lifelessThe Campaign -  is a disgrace at 3 simple maps with next to no story, lore or caring.  DLC -  Death By a Thousand Cuts.  Stardock seems to think that they can run a beta for 2 years and charge for it.  Putting things in, taking things out and charging money for poor DLC that other companies throw around as junky freebies.  I don't care about the money, it's the content itself that's embarrassing.The Meh:Diplomacy/Trade UI - Ultra basic diplo and unsophisitcated trade UIPlanetary Building View - It looks old and is designed poorly.  Last I played you had to individually delete each unwanted ememy building seperately on newly captured planets instead of having a ""delete all"" option.  It doesn't sound like a big deal until you start rolling over multiple planets a turn and have to listen to the annoying buzzer sound it makes when deleting hundreds of buildings throughout a game.Tedious gameplaySadly it smacks of mobile game effort and is too boring to recommend.  Wait for Endless Space 2 or Stellaris or simply buy this on sale when it's all bundled.  What a dissappointment.			"

Overall, the game mechanics, the content, the tech-tree, ships, etc. on offer is plenty and varied.  However, the game, for me is too much of a reskin of GC II, which is not to say that is a bad thing, but it would seem the developers did not aim to improve upon the old game with the new.My biggest gripe with GC III is the mundane, haphazard, and back-seated approach to combat.  There is virtually (if any at all) player interaction during combat.  The player assembles a fleet of ships, sends them against an enemy fleet and simply watches the combat unfold.  Of course, the player upgrades one's ships and develops military techology as a way to enhance the fighitng capacity and abilities, but in no way can one direct anything during combat in real time or in turn based.  This is a lost opportunity.  The devs could have really gone out and made combat interactive, and improved the old game systems with new mechanics in the new game.A general criticism, completely shrouded in my own subjective leanings, is that the game is not immersive at all.  The music, the environment, the galaxy, the races, and so on just feels bland.  I do not get any sense that the galaxy is a living and breathing arena filled with races, wars, trade, and diplomacy.  Of course, all of these things do happen, but there is no real sense of signicance from these interactions that gives me a sense of immersion.I would personally not recommend this game to those players wishing for a more interactive combat system.  However, the game overall offers enough content, graphical fidelity, and overall competence for me to give it a very, very lukewarm recommendation.   "

												An excellent successor to Galactic Civilizations II.  My only issue so far has been that the game will slow down to a crawl on very large maps after 500 or so turns, often taking 10 minutes or more for the AI to finish a single turn.  UPDATE: slowdown is no longer a huge issue.  It turns out that the bottleneck was my hard drive, so switching to a solid state drive sped up the game significantly.  Still no idea why there's so much disk I/O between turns, though.			"

												Very interesting and well fleshed out. One of the better 4x' I have played.  The only major flaws i have experienced so far is that the campaign is so short as to be nothign but a glorified tutorial, and that the AI is not good enough at detecting threats, particularly cultural ones, but these are minor problems. I have only played three full games (excluding the campaign), so not sure about the replayability, but I am not bored yet, so I'm sure you'll get quite a few good gaming hours out of this.A solid 9/10 i think.Edit: Due to stability/save corruption issues, I'll have to withdraw my recomendation and change my score to 6/10. Disapointing that the dev's made such a good game, yet clearly didn't invest enough time into testing and stability.			"

												A graphically updated version of GCiv II, with an AI that is a bit more complex.  If you were a fan before,  you will enjoy this game.  If you have never played in this sandbox, the micro-management may seem daunting, but this is the perfect empire building game that will give you a sense of accomplishment after 30 minutes, yet keep you playing for hours.  The tech tree is a little less intuitive than before, but new additions to it make this change more interesting than troublesome.  Space Battles are all about blending the right gear to best your opponent.  while land battles have been extremely streamlined, making this part of the game flow much quicker.			"

												Ok i put into a ton of hours into the game even more the the origianl civilizations which is a great game as well. but besides that point of the review. what do i think of the game. well considering i put almost 200 hpurs into the game that can tell you everything about it.This game is a great space 4x strategy game. now what are thing that i like about the game.1. your can create a custom race. I loved the customization for the game you could practilly spend hours withot even playing the game and still have a ton of fun. make what you want. I created my own rce in the game and it's awsome. and the ship designer along with factions and the workshop incorporated in the game. that can bring some more replayablility due to custom faction and make thing like x wings from star wars, or the enterprise from star trek.2. the gameplay is solid. you have 8 races to play with their own uniqe traits and this can effect how you play and adds more time to replay value for the game. if your a fan of space/si-fi game this will be your dream game. running you very own empire the way you want and conquer the galaxy. A side note, I'd like to thank Angry Joe for streaming this game months ago, if it wasnt for that i would not be playing this game. the game is rich in content and feel just like an RPG, but in SPACE!Now what are some thing that disappointed me or didn't like1. No local Multiplayer but it does have online multiplayer so there that2. There were some issues (for me at least) that the game crashed somtime while loading the designer screen where you design ship i had that happen about 2 times so it does crash and have bugs3. the A.I. is a bit of a pushover if your playing on lower difficultys. and with that (and i can't comfirm that this happens on higher difficultys above normal) it lead to exploiting some things with the A.I. like wearing down opposing fleets that im at war with useing shipyards. So i would recommand you play on higher difficultys that is above normal. though it doesn't work all the tim but it can happen with smaller fleet sizes and having a tone of preduction to produce shipyards about every turn at will.4. the cainpain was surpisingly short there are three campain maps though it does make up for it in time with objectives and bigger maps. at least it's not 4 hours. at least i think it is.Now i would recommand this game but only if you like sitting at your compter for hours and have a beast machine and play for hours. if you have a low end pc it might not be the greatest thing to buy but once you get a better pc then get this game.

Posted: October 5, 2015
												((updated December 2015))I really enjoy playing this game, there's a lot in there that's a lot of fun to play with... The research, the production, the ship designing and creating your own factions... There's a LOT in this game that's a lot of fun.The problem is though, there's a lot of issues as well. Everytime I try to set up a multiplayer game, me and my brother end up having to set up games over and over usually around 3 - 4 times because one of us will be randomly disconnected before the start of the game.Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. We love playing with mods, and for a game like this, having mods gives an endless supply of changes and tweaks that can make the game more fun, the only problem is.... They can't be used multiplayer.It's disheartening when new 'content' is released for 5 dollars that seems to only break the game further, where many comments point out that yeah, it's fine that new stuff is released, but when the system is already buggy, these new systems add only more bugs and problems.Please just fix the game first, get multiplayer running smoothly, get mod support for multiplayer, right now if you look online, you barely see any games being hosted and those that do (I've been in a few and just asked about it) are from people who already know eachother... Noone is hosting games to find random players because the system is so unbelievably bad for setting something like that up.If you join a room, you know nothing about the game, about the selected win conditions, about the planet and universe settings, you just have to jump in blind... Who wants to jump in blind in the hopes of getting into a good game... The amount of times I've hosted a game and a random player joined only to leave when they found out what the game speed was set on, or the galaxy map, or any other part.It needs a better interface for multiplayer, more information that is given to joining players so they know (maybe even beforehand) what they are joining, instead of just hoping for a good game somehow.The game is fun, a lot of fun even, but the systems, the interface all make sure that multiplayer is a gruelling experience you only want to step into if you have people you know very well to play with.I plan on playing this game a lot more, especially multiplayer, but untill mod support is given, I cannot buy any expansion and add more content when the content that is there sometimes barely works as is.((Update))So, a couple of months have passed and though the UI has had some fixes and improvements, the game itself is still riddled with issues, multiplayer games still crash and Epic events are still not available for multiplayer games.I still keep on trying, because the game has a lot of potential, but it seems to be bogged down by technical issues that aren't being adressed.

												This is a good game the UI is easy to navigate, the AI is fairly smart and the game has a short but interesting campaign.Gameplay wise, alliances need a bit of work.That said the game does have some issues, on the larger maps if you don't have a powerful rig then you're in for lots of waiting as the game will lag a fair bit, to avoid this id say large maps a perfect for scale and fram rates. The only bug i've come across is that sometimes it will crash during ai turns so your next turn will never start, no worries though the game autosaves at the start of each turn.			"

It also has a vein of humour I've appreciated.I've had the odd irritation where something doesn't work properly (seems to often be related to having a ship with unused moves at a planet/station), but not enough to break the game. Designing your own race and ships is a big plus for me. I've won games because I tweaked ship designs to exploit my own available resources and negate my opponent's strengths. Recommend.			"

												After playing this game since release i am going to have to also go with the minority(but we know what we are talking about) on this and say do not buy until they add more content that the company is not going to charge u for  This game is just not worth the price unless half off.  Three scenarios for a game??  Come on Stardock use your brain.  I know i was expecting different campaigns for the different races or at least the major ones so to only have three campaigns for this game is a complete joke and then they will probably try to charge for them which makes it even less worth it.  There are however some pro's to this came, the ships, technology tree's, different races, planet control are all Pro's, however the major con far outweighs the pro.  Stardock if you are going to make a game then you make it in its entirety and not relase it until its ready whcih means actual campaigns.  Additionally, one of the campaigns cannot be completed at this time if you choose a certain ideology path of getting another hidden planet because it tends to spawn on a game point you need to bring down the Precursor and the dev's comment was this was unforeseen and will be fixed later.  Not a very good response.  The initital earth campain only has THREE full campaigns if you want anything else beyond that you have to pay which makes this a total scam.After further play time, my review is the same.  which is DNB (do not buy).  Stardock has failed to complete the original campaign and isntead after you pay full price for the original(still unfinished game) they are now creating downloadable contect which you have to pay for if you want to finish the game and this includes the original terran campaign.  All they are doing is trying to draw out more money from players after they paid full price for the original game.  If you get this game at 75% then its worth it because you will be spending the rest of that money on the DLC content they release over time to get more money.  What a scam.			"

												This game is well.....frustrating, and not much fun to play.It's a pity becasue the game does have a few nice things: the ship designing aspect is probably the most fun bit of it. Most of my hours playing the game have been spent designing ships, what a shame that the rest of the game doesn't have that same level of involvement!The game is let down by very poor game mechanics, ill-concieved ideas, and it lacks so many things that it ought to have: the combat is laughable, the AI is utterly stupid, it lacks any depth and immersion. In a nutshell: this game has lots of potential, but is a mess. Sadly, the developers are just not not intersted in developing it into something good nor listen to what many people are saying about its many faults; instead they desperately try to make the disfunctional aspects of it work, which just ends up making it even more nonsense. The so-called updates and patches just don't fix the endemic problems with it. Save your money for something else, this game isnt even worth it in a sale.			"

												7/10 - The game still has problems, but its fun to play either way. Pros:- Fan of the previous games will enjoy the visual update and update from the older version. - Love the new ideology aspect and constant moral choices which need to be made and the upgrades given with them. I love being evil and taking the benefits over peoples lives and the greater good etc. - Prototype ships & parts that are tied with space mining. This gives a huge improvement to starbases and trade resources. This gives so many ways to play the game. (You may have better research, but it means nothing when my ships all have extremely powerful prototype weapons thanks to my mining empire) LOVE IT!- Anomolies can now have varying levels of defence which is great. This aspect still needs work, but it is still good fun to rush some precusor anomolies for advantages. - Bazaar in the Merc add on. Love the unique ship types and the bonuses, great addition. Cons:- Anomoly defences are far too predicatble. Laser weapons and all with the same attack on each. Extremely predictable which is no fun. Would be great to run into an anomoly which had 36 missle dmg and 36 armor, that would crush my survey ship which normally only has shields (since they always have laser weapons). - I feel like the tech tree could use alot of work. Nothing feels unique and it is more going through the motions. - Still need to add ""auto"" options. There is alot of tedius micro-management, if I am at war, I really dont want to control hundreds of fleets to attack each turn. The larger the empire, the more tedius micromanagement is needed. - There are many features and unique things which appeared in Galactic Civ 2 which have not been added to the new games. I hope they will look to add these in the future. Overall, it is a very fun game. I have yet to finish a game though. I always make my empire so large that it becomes irritating to manage so many ships turn after turn (which is why I need the auto features).  BUT I have enjoyed every moment of playing, which is a good sign.			"

												I liked GalCiv 1&2. GalCiv 1 is what got me into space 4X in the first place. But since then, I have played better 4X games that either (like Distant Worlds or Space Empires).That said, Galactic Civilisations 3 is inferior to GalCiv 1 and/or 2.I thought I just sucked at the game, but I looked it up and it turned out to be an actual problem: You cannot play as a pacifist without bending game rules on how it calculates military strength (protip: It counts the attack score of your ships and ONLY that. So you can have a smaller invincible fleet and inmpenetrable defences, and be considered ""weak"").The AI is stupidly aggressive. As one person put it aptly ""they behave more like 5yolds when you touched thier sandcastle than world leaders"".Not to say the AI is good at waging war. It's utter♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ It barely ever attacks after declaring war, it doesn't comprehend invasions. But it WILL declare war, often a few turns after you meet it. The main reason for that is a silly number of negative multipliers: It doesn't like your idealology. You are weak. You are ripe for conqest. (Yes, those are two separate negative multipliers that mean the same thing). Alternatively they ""Are concerned by your military buildup"". You rejected their request for a handout. They will hate you for sharing a border. Etc, Etc.Basically, the AI doesn't just stay neutral. It will hate you whether you have a strong military or not. They will hate you for every time you reject their begging, which comes often. They will absolutely hate you when they send a ship into YOUR territory to colonize a planet which first makes you share a border and then culture-flip. The only thing you can do to alleviate that is to shower them with gifts.Another major issue is how barebones it is. Your economy is controlled with a triangle slider between Research, Money and Manufacturing. Then there's a slider between colony manufacturing (social) and ship building (military). That's it. You have no more control. There's no espionage either.All in all, none of the problems make the game unplayable. Sure, you can play. You'll win. But only if you play the game in a very specific way. And for a 4X game, that's a crime.Considering that you can get Space Empires IV Deluxe for £5.99, this game is not a good buy even on a sale. I got it for £10 and I'm not satisfied with the result.

												Super awesome game that has so many levels. I feel like I could play this for months and continue to learn new things about the game play. Have a million different ways to win. With an ever change game it forces you to adapt and not fall it to that this is how you win build that you just do over and over.			"

I wish though that the gameplay was third dimensional like space instead of two dimensional like the other civilization games that are out there. Also if you switch to watch the battles I wish I had control over the ships fighting instead of the computer, and planetary invasions the same thing I wish for some control over the battles. For right now though I recommend the game it isn't bad just need some tweeking.			"

Early Access Review
								Prior to Beta 6 (pre May 2015) I was yelling inside my head with nerd rage ""Gah! So Alpha! why you not know what Alpha is! No way you'll make May 22nd release date, unpossible!"" but now I think they were playing sneaky beaks, because all of those features missing from prior releases (literally labelled as ""coming soon"")  magically appeared in the Beta 6 buikd,  and suddenly all the crashing stopped, GUI options worked and i could select gigantic maps without the galaxy builder exploding.  You beautiful skallywags, I should have had more faith!   Absolutely love it @ B6.1, can't wait to see campaign. Aside from that, this is essentially GalCiv2, but like Civilizations 3 to Civilizations 5, it's a pretty decent jump in quality and the tech tree... just get out....  The tech tree is a recursive hydra that will send you blind before you discover all of it's secrets.  I haven't clicked ""insane"" sized maps yet, but gigantic is pretty damned gigantic for a TBS hex map. I weep for the A*.Worth more than your coin, this is worth your life!			"

												I highly recommend this game.  While it has an excellent diplomacy component it entirely lacks espionage.  The deep and well thought out history allows the campaign to play out well and brings the player into the universe.  That being said the custom race attempts to create to feel of a real race rather than just a bunch of stats.			"

												Another good game in the tradition of Gal Civ. It had been several years since I had played, and the learning curve to get back to turn based strategy games was steep. Being able to set the AI lower helped a lot. The tutorial was some help, but not a lot. As with the Gal Civ series, you develop a strategy to get ahead, and stick with it. After a few tries, you can settle in on your own particular method. Conditions for victory are actually a bit less than it looks. You will always need some military capability, and if you do anything other than technology victory, you'll need a lot. Very enjoyable game, and well worth your time.			"

												Large scale space strategy game, lots of potential, all the right pieces are present, but badly let down by a few big bugbear factors.  Regular CTD, economy is completely borked, so you need to constantly hunt down 'space gold' to keep your economy afloat.The AI is very weak and needs to cheat like crazy, it ignores ZOC and the FOW.  Contains lots of senseless little issues like massive amount of micro-management, upgrading a ship is more expensive than buy/building it from scratch, or starting with a survey ship you can not actual rebuild until the end game.  You have no control of ships in space battles, half your ships just wandering around the battle map not doing anything until killed.			"

												I have been playing strategy games since SSI's green screen games on Apple IIe's.  I have played lots, and one stand out as a great besides the Civ line was Master of Orion 2.  I had never played a Galactic Civ. game until III, but after reading about it  thought I would give it a try.  The game delivers on many levels just as discribed, but it has a few things that make it so I no longer have any interest in firing it back up.A. The scope and scale of the wide open expanse and lack of any sort of control  for  avenue of approch  makes this  a serious cludge once a game with  > a small map gets going, it eventully becomes a logistical nightmare.  MOO 2 had this right with the space lane avenues of approch allowing you to build strong points. Which brings me to the next point.B. Space stations beyond their spicifc role are next to worthless, especially when it comes to investing in defenses.What a waste of resources this is except for the very beginng of the game. Even when maxed out they are , what, on par with a large or very large hull for capability? Not only that but enemy fleets can choose to move right past them and go for a planet no mater what is built on the station. But should they decide they didn't want it around most likely 2 or 3 ships in a mid to later stage of the game could take it out no matter what you invested in it.  So I ask what's the point in spending anything on them beyond base role and  role enhancements, maybe scanners.  Worthless...  These things should be death stars, they are friggen space stations! They should also be strong points for  areas of control that actually participate beyond the bonuses of what the Military ones do.C. The border except as a reflection of influence is a joke, the other civs love to come park at your assets and sit and stare at them like their at a drive in movie.  This always seems an eventual prelude to going to war sooner or later. But I have to ask what good is a border?  They should have taken a few notes from Civ 5 here where borders are borders until war is decalred. Or at least have some sort of real negative impact for violating a border with no decleration of war.   There are a few other things like persistent AI interection for really stupid trade proposals and threats but the first two for me are the show stoppers. At least in Civ 5 you have good logisitcal and geographic control even on large maps.Enough said, I am waiting for MOO4 to be relased. "

I struggle to build 3 ships in the time the ai has pumped out 40. Which leads to a cycle where the all the AI will declare war on you for being to weak and then proceed to destroy your fleet and shipyards all the while refusing to make peace becasue your to weak. Oh and in order to settle any war that you have with them you have to give them a large sum of money, even if you took several planets away from them.  Oh and that tiny fleet will cost you a lot of gold to maintain, but the Ai fleets cost nothing, which will also be much more advanced then your fleet cause the Ai doesn't need to worry about research speed..

												Likes & Dislikes:The designers went to great lengths to make game as all encompassing as possible with lots of features to control and manage.  Love that about this game.  However, the AI is a dirty little cheater and gets unfair advantages such as more resources and quicker build times of vessels etc etc.  Wish the AI had half a brain and was able to come at me with challenging strategy rather than being able to amass vast fleets by cheating.  Brillant ship design allows for really flexiable options based on your technology and can be successful on any path of the tech tree.			"

												Interesting 4x game that goes far to honor the legacy, however, it needs a little bit of balancing. For example, defensive play is impossible as starbases are completely useless as a defensive mechanism. They don't intercept enemy forces nor are they able to stand up to a single ship in mid to late games. Enemies are too content to just violate your borders, position themselves at all critical points and then in 1 swoop take out your entire infrastructure if you do not have fleets nearby. This either forces you to constantly pay too much attention to diplomacy or risk loosing in few turns and detracts a bit from enjoyment. Online community seems small as well, whihc is not surpeising as this game may take days to finish on medium sized map.The positive is the community creations. I've enjoyed playing with many player created ships and even seeing AI using them. Would rate this as 6.5 out of 10. Not the best, but not bad either game. Would not recommend getting it for a full price, but if you like 4x, try it out once on discount. However, 2016 seems to be on a horrizon with at least several better and deeper 4x games like Stellaris and Endless Space 2. So if you are counting your pennies, would suggest to hold off.			"

GalCiv2 is a monster of a game and after its ten years or so of consecutive development it was something many 4X fans consider to be one of the few true successors to the MoO2 name. GalCiv3 will succeed even farther where its predecessor could not. Mod support, 64bit technology integration, a brand new engine -- and the evil Snathi empire.			"

Contains lots of senseless little issues like massive amount of micro-management, upgrading a ship is more expensive than buy/building it from scratch, or starting with a survey ship you can not actual rebuild until the end game.  You have no control of ships in space battles, half your ships just wandering around the battle map not doing anything until killed.			"

The flexabilty to create and or modifiy races and ships is my favorite part. i am a old Civ player that start with Civ II and I still a lot of Civ V. This is a more satisfing game for space that the Civ  BE.			"

												Great game and I especially like the shipbuilder. Although I think this game would be sooo much better with more fleshed out planetside actions such as an interactive ground battles and units and detailed structures. I mean what other game offers this? Imagine instead of pushing a button and seeing some numbers actually being able to command the ground battle yourself! Or actually choosing the layout and possibly even the design of the ground structures...As it is now though its still highly recommended and will get you ""wasting"" many hours of your life!			"

												Updated this to reflect a year later.Still can't say this game is fun, enjoyable or even good.  The main problem is the terrible ai and it's lack of restrictions.  Money?  Not a problem. Ship production?  Not a problem.  Range?  not a problem. Research speed? not a problem. Fog of war?  Not a problem.  I have seen the AI chasing my ships from well outside it's sight.  I struggle to build 3 ships in the time the ai has pumped out 40. Which leads to a cycle where the all the AI will declare war on you for being to weak and then proceed to destroy your fleet and shipyards all the while refusing to make peace becasue your to weak. Oh and in order to settle any war that you have with them you have to give them a large sum of money, even if you took several planets away from them.  Oh and that tiny fleet will cost you a lot of gold to maintain, but the Ai fleets cost nothing, which will also be much more advanced then your fleet cause the Ai doesn't need to worry about research speed.. All of this was on Normal.			"

												Likes & Dislikes:The designers went to great lengths to make game as all encompassing as possible with lots of features to control and manage.  Love that about this game.  However, the AI is a dirty little cheater and gets unfair advantages such as more resources and quicker build times of vessels etc etc.  Wish the AI had half a brain and was able to come at me with challenging strategy rather than being able to amass vast fleets by cheating.  Brillant ship design allows for really flexiable options based on your technology and can be successful on any path of the tech tree.			"

												As with all the Galactic Civ games, the Evil benefits are ridiculously overpowered. Obviously, the games developers seem to have an unusually fond love for the bad guys in their strategy games. LOLThis game is, clearly much better than the horribly messy Twilight Amour Expansion pack for Galactic Civ II. And, it does a lot to make divergent Technology Trees functional with strategy games.However, it does not bring back any of the tortures of figuring out when or when not to switch research into Extreme Colonisation that Galactic Civilisation II Dark Avatar expansion pack did.As with any strategy game, it is only a mathematical run through! So, don't expect it to hold any significance, other than a engaging workout to keep those binary based brain cells in good and healthy working order.

Agressive races zerg quickly with volume of low tech. If you can survive that, then they are easily defeated. Micromanagement is onerous. Maybe an 'auto-build' feature would help. Overall positive.

												A game of galactic empire where--playing on default settings--I was unable to find a single exoplanet to colonize.  (Looks like the game generated approximately 2 habitable exoplanets to split among 4 players.  None of them were in my half of the map.)You can choose an ideology to guide your civilization, grant you special perks, and change how other civs react to you...but you select one based on how you choose to resolve events when colonizing planets.  Since I had no planets to colonize, I was apparently locked out of that entire branch of the game.So far (14.4 hours played), I've had the game crash about 8 times.  The game autosaves, but doesn't seem to do so at the interval I specified in the game options.Tooltips lie to me constantly.  The ship designer said I would unlock the next sensor tier at 10 sensor power; it actually unlocked at 8.  It said my ship design had 3 movement; it actually had 4.  The distance display (which I only figured out how to use by reading the wiki) told me it would take 3 turns to reach a particular point in space; it actually took 2.  The production queue told me the building would be finished in 2 turns; it actually took 1.  Colony morale showed a ""coercion"" penalty in its calculations that wasn't reflected in the total, and did you know that 9 / 8.8 = 88%?  Several techs that reduced the cost of various things failed to mention what things they reduced the cost of, leading to hilarious tips like ""-5% manufacturing cost, and also -5% manufacturing cost.""Terminology is poorly-chosen and inconsistently-used.  There's a split between ""military"" vs ""civilian"" manufacturing, but they really mean units vs buildings; colony ships and trade ships are ""military"" but buildings are ""civilian"" for manufacturing purposes even when they have the ""military"" subcategory.  Ship components are divided into 5 groups: engines, weapons, defenses, modules, and support--when a tech gives a bonus to ""support modules"", what do you think it applies to?  (Answer:  some, but not all, of the modules, and also some, but not all, of the support.)  Some effects stack with each other, and some replace earlier effects, and there's nothing to indicate which is which.The UI is generically painful.  The tech tree is too zoomed-in to be useful, tooltips on the galactic map randomly fail to update when you move the mouse to a new gridspace, the building queue is way too tiny for all the building upgrades that get automatically added to it (and re-added every turn if you manually delete them), the borders of black holes are hard to guess, some galactic objects look very similar to each other, you can't see the name of the player who owns a ship even when you select it (only their crest)...I'm not sure the designers understand the basic strategy of their own game.  If you add a bunch of items to any given production queue, it works on them one at a time, in order--working on them in parallel would be idiotic, right?  But then they encourage you to do exactly that with your military and civilian production!  You can force the game to do one at a time, but it's complicated--the UI was clearly not designed for it.  And then you can research a technology that unlocks the ability to--wait for it--force an individual planet to devote 100% of its production to military (something you could already do anyway if you worked at it).I was going to give the game one more chance tonight, but it crashed while trying to load my saved game.  Maybe I'll replay Endless Space instead.			"

												While some the game systems are quite engaging, the abysmal ui and endless multiplayer bugs are heartbreaking.The developer also seems intent on releasing DLCs over fixing bugs. The Mercenaries DLC in particular had at least two major annoying bugs that somehow sneaked past all the QA and, for instance, made you demolish buildings for the Yor race if you were to build any more population. It was a UI validation bug, not a game system change.The UI, though, is just really bad. Really, really bad.All in all, it is a mixed bag with more disappointment than happiness.It is a pity.			"

												Still being updated occassionally at the moment, but these are tweaks rather than serious changes to gameplay, which is already excellent.The AI can be very challenging at times, which is a nice change from many strategy games (you can also play Multiplayer). Theoretically, the game can support hundreds of factions on a single (huge) map!There is genuine immersion, and the game asks serious questions of you at times: deciding whether to prioritise research or ship construction can be a serious concern, and you'll find yourself falling behind with the other even as you gain an advantage with one. Even if you had comfortably decided that research is key, you still have to decide whether economic or military would better serve you - and all the while the AI will be hatching schemes of its own.Furthermore regarding military research, this game is unique (to me at least) in how it can propagate arms races between factions. There are three basic weapon types: lasers, kinetic and missile (and their defences). If you focus on missiles for example, you may be able to ruin anyone lacking missile defences but would suffer miserably if your opponent has anti-missile defences aplenty. You could even build up a balanced military, but this would take time, rescources and leave you with few obvious strengths.Diplomacy is failrly intelligent, and gives a wide veriaty of options regarding tech and rescource trades, alliances, pacts, threats etc. lastly, the modding community is incredible - there are modded races and ships for almost everything, from the Tardis to Star Trek to Battlestar Galactica to Warhammer 40K!I utterly love this game, and if you enjoy 4X style games (or turn-based strategy generally) you can't afford to give this a miss.

												Awesome game but has some serious flaws.I think everything about this game is done well except two things and they are as follows.The game is complex, which is good, but the developers assumed you would know how everything works and spent no effort in explaining any game principles. The game needs a feature like Sid Meyer's Civilizations ""Civilpedia"" to help a a new player get a grasp of the game concepts.The interface of the game is horrible, it is awkward and not intuitive at all.  It's hard to explain but everything seems so clumbsy.You will need to spend 4+ hours just messing around with the game to learn the concepts. Once you've got the hang of it though, it is a truly great game with lots of potential.If you like games like Civilization, Dealock and Total War, then you will love this game.Edit:The game is also VERY Crash Happy. I get about 15 minutes of gameplay per crash			"

												This game is great! And also terrible to learn. I needed a big number of games to learn how to go ahead. I tried to limit the problem playing with humans only. Map Small. One opponent, Beginner level. This is a must. You will lose even against a beginner opponent at first. But this is the way to learn. After a good number of games, I started to win. I specialized on Technological and Diplomatic victories. Mainly because I let to research and build warships later so I could use the effort instead to develop my planets and the other sides of research. So mainly I research top and bottom of the four main research options, the social/research and diplomatic/money options.I start each planet with a factory, a farm, a research building. Every planet. Then I go developing them as I need. On a small map, I have one planet for manufacture, another for research and a third for money. I try to use to the most the advantages that each planet have. In the end, each planet will have three food buildings (when going into the three top difficult levels I need more of them). With the game advancing, I will stop building extra manufacture and money (then more ahead also research) buildings besides the three initial on each planet, and focuses the planets on Influence/Benevolence/Tourism. On bigger maps I tend to not specialize planets on only one area (but it depending on how it goes), instead I try to more or less balance each planet on all three areas (since the stations will push them on all three areas), only specializing the ones with clear advantages for some area. On the very big maps like Insane its necessary to divide your planets in clusters around Shipyards, since the distances are too big to keep sending ships from one side to the other. Actually, its always a good idea to keep just the closer planets sponsoring the Shipyards.I choose only Benevolent options, and on Benevolent Ideology screen, get first the research advantage, then the one that gives a colony ship, then more research. From there it depends on the situation, but the second tier, the one that gives Moral advantages, is important, since developing it will prevent the necessity of too much moral (happiness) buildings on the planets and save the space for other buildings. And Research. And the one getting more planets, etc. At some point I get the Missionary (third tier) building so I can improve my Influence, and all new planet, and old ones with space, will get the Missionary building (usually close to the 'castle' icon, having side by side with a Consulate, Embassy and the... forgot the name, the one for Tourism, all together). (Earth is always focused on Research, and I build the Research Capital there, plus the Essence building if there is space, to boost research to maximum.)Another fundamental aspect are the space stations. I make a point of making early Economic stations, in a way so every planet is under the influence of one of them. Or two (that tends to be difficult to do on the first half of the game, but the result is amazing). And develop the Research, Manufacture, Money and Moral options on the station as soon as available. This will boost immensely the planets.  Also, mining space stations are important, of course. And depending on the situation, you can build some Cultural ones to push frontiers and take planets using culture (they flip to your side if the culture pressure is high enough). I usually dont colonize the low end planets (level 5 or 6), making sure they are on my area. Opponents will colonize them and soon they will flip and become mine. Really cheap (:Dealing with the opponents: some will want to be your friends, others not. But if your diplomatic level is high enough, you will have all being friendly, and making Alliance with all of them will mean Victory. So if you see an opponent going to red fast, develop Diplomacy quicker. After winning consistently on level Beginner, I made some games on Huge or Immense maps, just to get the feel. It becames really difficult to keep track of all planets and stations, and the increased number of opponents, but its really fun!Then I moved to the next difficulty level, Small map... and won at first! Same on big maps. Same again on Normal level... same on next level... Only on the last but two level I started to have problems. Winning depended on which races I got (I leave them on random). If I had to develop the militar side it hurt my research advance, so I wasnt #1 on research all the time anymore (check your position on Diplomacy screen only, its more realistic), had to build more food buildings on the planets, had to deal with smarter opponents searching the map faster than me, getting the really good planets first... so there is where I am now!Now I want to try approaches using Pragmatic and Malevolent postures. And mixing them. And start trying the other races to see what happens. One thing that bothers me on the game is how fragile the stations are. They are too expensive to be so fragile! Well, of course this was planned to be so, but  I'm tempted to change this on the .ini files!! (:Anyway, I have already 170 hours on GC3 and surely will keep playing it for many more to come!			"

												I would narrowly approve of this deeply flawedgame, it is nothing groundbreaking or amazing.  Many have criticised it for not being what they were hoping it to be -- whatever that may be.  We all have our own ideas there, so best just give a verdict on what we get, not what we don't get.  What we get is ""another"" turn-based space game, where you have a number of things to sort out or initiate before each turn is over.  Most of my responses here are positives: good graphics, good layout, good loghistics.  The downside is that there is so much to do once the game gets more complex it can be a little confusing and you have to keep your eye on so many things at once.  There's no point over-complicating a game if this is seen as a negatgive feature. Some features, like ""sentry"" which is supposed to warn you of enemy ships in the sensor area, palpably don't work. There is a handy little window that tells you if a ship is idle, if a shipyard needs instructions, or anything else that you missed during your turn. The tuorial, whilst partly interactive, does also partly just rely on showing example screens, rather than steering you through various gameplay moves.  When there's so much to be taken in at one time, a tutorial sticks better in your head of you can perform the actiuon several times over, experimentally, until you are happy with it-- before moving on to the next topic.  So for that, a poor tutorial.  However once the basics have been grasped, the rest comes with exponential quickness, and saving frequently between turns will allow change-of-mind if you miss something important or make a silly mistake, or get a colony wiped out because you just ""weren't looking everywhere at once""..For some odd reason, despite showing the cloud symbol, this game does not appear to keep game saves on  the steam server for use on any computer i choose to play it on.  Thusly...good points, bad points, bugs and disappointments.  But it passes time.			"

												I picked up this and Stellaris.  I like both, but I enjoy this more.  Well, for one thing I got a few DLCs so I could enjoy the awesome mods available for it, which provides a lot of depth and interest.  I also love the diplomacy options and the indepth tech trees, everything.  I find this a very fun game, best out there atm. I do prefer Stellaris open movement, without the turn-based style, but in every other way Gal Civ 3 is a superior and more enjoyable game.			"

To describe it as frustrating is an understatement. I would not recommend buying it until the developers actually do something about this bug.			"

												I'm big fan of Civilization like games. I already spent years playing them.Galactiv civilazations III is outstanding. The tactics are really deep and giving you many options. Unfortunately, I can't advise you to buy this game now. For two reasoms.First, AI. AI in this game is either stupid or very smart, nothing between.Second. Before latest patch released on the end of 2015, there was possibility to govern every planet in means of production, research and so. Kinda crucial feature of civ like games. I don't know why, but this feature was removed by the patch. Now, you can govern your whole empire at once or leave planet governance to AI. I consider this game unplayable now. Do not buy it unless they fix this feature.			"

I have a total of 50 factions including my own running on the insane map. After more than 10 hours in I'm surprised there is no lag or hang-ups whatsoever. There's A LOT going on in this game and nothing is a chore nor boring. With every turn I still get the sense I haven't seen it all.			"

								Buy GalCiv3. The game is fairly polished now, and I cannot overstate how much promise it has.Each empire has a unique tech tree, the moral development choices are robust and interesting, and with ""specialization"" techs, your empire's progression choices feel more important and interesting, rather than just a checklist of things you need to do.The replayability is fairly strong. Even if you don't have the strongest rig, you can enjoy the Excessive and Insane galaxy sizes. (I'm on an i7 equiv. processor with 16GB ram with an R9 290 graphics card, and Insane runs so well for me that I can tab out, play a youtube video in HD, tab back in, and still play the game.) There are some nice trait options for creating custom empires, and the resource system adds a fair amount of depth. Additionally, the devs do read player feedback and have made design changes based on that feedback before when it is compelling, well-written, and supported by the playerbase.There is now a robust modding system, and with the first major patch there will be Steam Workshop integration, which means that in addition to a very good vanilla experience you'll also be able to Go Where No One Has Gone Before, defend the Twelve Colonies or find Earth, or even use the Force (once someone gets around to those rather inevitable mods).I've already found a few custom playable race mods that are fairly impressive. The Kuja are one of them I highly recommend, so long as he updates the mod for release, which I suspect the author will do.On top of all that, Stardock is offering a once only, never-to-be-repeated FREE DLC of custom ship parts for anyone who has bought the game prior to May 17. Do so, or you'll never get a shot at that DLC again.			"

												well, what can I say... the basic idea and premise of this game is great, the execution not so much.its a good 4x game, no doubt, but after playing one or two playthrough you are basically done.research is mostly broken - your ships will be outdated before they are even done building.the tech tree has a few ""must haves"" (logistics etc) so you will basically research the same in every game.there is only a tiny selection of maps that offer little variety so you will mostly be playing on the same map (of course you can buy more maps in their rip off of a DLC).The biggest issue this game has is the AI. Its is quite simply dumb as bread and will pose no challenge whatsoever. There are countless ways to exploit the AI through the broken trade system (for example feed them with useless tech, sell them resources noone needs cause they already have 10 of them etc).Due to how combat works (you form fleets and if your fleets log count is largr than the enemies you win 99%) the AI is completeley incapable of attacking or defending in any strategic manner. the AI will build huge amounts of tiny ships, leave them in small fleets and watch them get shot into pieces by your larger fleets. THat means to counter an enemy with say 100 ships all you need is a fleet ot 10 larger ships.so make this short: nice game in theory, poor execution, abysmal AI which breaks the game and destroys replayability.

The custom designer for your own ship models could use some better tool aids and be more user friendly.

Posted: June 22, 2015
												I know i've only played for 22 hrs, but i've played enough to notice some very fundamental things about this game. First time playing a Galactic Civ game and was dissapointed. I usualy love strategy games of all types, and especially anything space based or science fiction, but this game was a dissapointment. I'm not saying it's a terrible game, but it's definitely not better than a 6/10- and definitely not worth 60$, but with the price drop now to 38$- possibly, but I wouldn't expect much. Here are my main reasons why not and why to get the game:Why not: 1. AI is suuuuuuuuper easy. I played through the campaign on normal(keep in mind this is my first time playing a Galactic Civ game), and winning basically came down to 2 things. Build factories and shipyards, build fleets, and build money factories, then repeat 1000 times. This makes the game highly repetitive, unless you go out of your way to make it harder on youself- which is ridiculous. This also kind of nullifies 90% of the rest of the content in the game that is entirely unnecessary to learn to win. Research for example; all I did was research weapon technology, hull stuff, and logistics(fancy word for how many units you can stack in a tile), and I was able to win almost all engagements. There are dozens of ship classes which STAY WITH THE SHIP FOREVER which tells the ship in battle what to target and where to go. Assault ships for example, will rush right in and target another class.(I managed to win the Campaign without learning what any of the classes do). You can either build preset ships with classes, or build your own ships and assign it a class. All of this is completely unnessary to learn in order to win. This is just one of many examples of features in game which make things unnessarily complicated. 2. Game is highly repetitive. I kind of mentioned this above, but there's a lot more features in game which are a grind.I'll highlight my petpeeves; Galactic events/Planet Events/Player Event choices/Building stuff on planets/ Micromanaging planetary production, wealth, and research(I didn't even bother doing it, and only build production and money factories every single time). Also, the choices you make in game are a joke. You either have Benevolent, Pragmatic, or Malevolent, which means 90% of the time you're either: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and love everything(even non-sentient robots), use things strictly to your advantage, or are a psycopath. There is no reasonable, rational person choice, and there are hardly ever win-win decisions. The EXACT same dillemas will often appear in the same game over and over again as well.3. The campaign is 3 missions long. I kid you not, and the story is just as short the missions. It's as follows: SPOILERS(not that it's interesting or surprising anyways) Earth needs to be saved. Rebuild Civilization, Build Fleets, Take back Earth. I was expecting conflicts with other races, other than the one you're fighting, but there wasn't. You have the option to declare war or ignore other races, and I ignored them, and it didn't matter at all. 4. The story was bad. Yes. It had NO MAIN CHARACTERS too. It was as follows(spoilers); Earth taken by Drengin, you fight Drengin and take area around Earth back with ships. The whole game I was annihilating the Drengin and tried to negotiate ANYTHING, and they wouldn't even SPEAK TO ME. 5. Micromanaging is a headache. It would take a while to go into detail with this point, suffice it to say there are a lot of terribly inificient features and designs which make doing simple things a hassle. From managing production of planets to using the galaxy map, this is not user friendly and takes a while to learn, and once you do it's still very annoying and inificient. 6. After playing for 22 hrs I still havent figured out fully how to watch the ship battles the way I want to. Every time I try to go into the free mode and move my mouse a TINY TINY bit, my view is instantly jerked a mile away from the battle, and I'm luck if I can get back with the non-sensical sidways inverted 10000 sensitivity controls.Why to buy:1. THOSE CINAMATIC GRAPHICS LOOK GREAT!!!!!!2. The pictures in the galactic events/planet events/ diplomacy look fantastic. Only wish the rest of the game was up to that level of work.			"

												If you dont want to read my rant just read this. Would i like my money back?  YEAAI does not follow guidelines. customized race with the disliked trait ends up getting chosen as UP host most of the time.UP (united planets) do not add any great advantage disadvantage to ""galactic policies"" and are seldom passed.diplomacy is so useless that i no longer waste reserch on a universal translator.Tech tree is so long it requires a Very long game to fully explore.Game falls flat rather quickly as most of your early game nothing really important happens.Ideologies are quite useless as the choices ussually add  + or -  % to a planet or nothing at all so the first ideology you pick ends up being the one you should always choose regardless as  the ideology trait is more worthwhile. if it affects diplomatic relations, i really cant tell. Map editor which is a dlc you must pay for creates maps that, even tough you put random player or AI on a bunch of planets, you always end up starting on the same planet with the same neighbors.With a game that still feels ""early access"" the developers are already selling dlc gives me low hopes that they will ever bring this game to its full potential, maybe wait for galatic civilizations 4.

Ship designs and the battle view screen are much better, as well as the animations for the various leaders. There's lots more detail in every aspect. And the choices which force you to focus in one aspect or another for each tech branch, means that everyone will have their advantages and disadvantges, forcing the player to think more strategiclly. So does the use of new strategic resoures. The downside, is that I like the planet govern screen better in GC II, as well as the report given on enemy factions. However the bottom line is that I will never play GC II again, I'm now addicted to Galactic Civilizations III!			"

												Please, don't be fooled by my playtime, I have played alot in offline mode to test the game. I ENDED UP REFUNDING IT.TL:DR AT BOTTOM! I RECOMMEND THE GAME!I purchased this game, which I'd had my eye on for a while, as the GALCIVII servers have been dead for goodness knows how long, on sale for £10.19, which is a reasonable price. The game is an awesome game, I absolutely loved it, but so much has changed from GALCIVII, and I know most people will disagree, but I just can't play it. There is so much MORE to this game, adding depth and story, and even actually getting attatched to your races is in this gem, however whilst so much has been added, so much has been removed, and that is what ruined it for me. It now has hex-tiles, which it didn't before, which I loved, the freedom of movement in GALCIVII is what made the game. I know that it is a 4X strategy game, and alot of people wanted the hexes, but it lost alot in that.  It has also been ""dumbed down"" making the game alot easier, as there are less nuances and quirks that made the game so unique. Whilst there is alot of depth, I still don't personally like the game, and PLANETARY INVASION HAS BEEN KILLED.TL:DR: Dont't buy if you loved GALCIVII, and are ""convinced that it is perfection in a game"" (My friend's words), buy if you thought it was too difficult, and needed a bit more depth to the story etc.			"

												Short list; complex game – like 3D Chess on exponential steroids. Needs more complete manual or a better more complete tutorial. Spent 12 hours gathering up game info on web and still lost in space. Talking characters might be a plus. Good game if one has loads of time to spend in space and has time for a large learning curve for a new player. Been at it for four days still trying to figure out all the complex parts of the game. Game designers often fail to recognize the obvious which is the purchasing player does not know what they know about the game. An in depth GOOD tutorial would fix what is missing form an otherwise good game.			"

												Classic, all time great.... if it worked, shame.Lots of bugs and glitches to an otherwise brillient game. Just to had a pic to a created race can be very time consuming and difficult to do. Battle scenes are just animated movie scenes but its more about designing a race. I loved this game but it needs to be improved. Trade doesnt seem to work.			"

Early Access Review
								Reviewing onOS: Win 10 64-bitCPU: AMD FX-8350 4.0 GHzRAM: 32 GBGFX: 2 MSI R9 270X Gaming cards with CrossFire enabled MB: MSI 990FXA GAMINGThe game runs smoothly. No hic-ups, lag, crashes, artifacts or anything else to report. The visuals are stunning and the AI's tactics and balancing are believable.I'm one of those players that like playing on maxed-out settings. Meaning, I want the highest number of enemies on the map and I want the largest map possible. I TRY to break the game just to have something to complain about. I've been foiled this time. I have a total of 50 factions including my own running on the insane map. After more than 10 hours in I'm surprised there is no lag or hang-ups whatsoever. There's A LOT going on in this game and nothing is a chore nor boring. With every turn I still get the sense I haven't seen it all.			"

Well, for one thing I got a few DLCs so I could enjoy the awesome mods available for it, which provides a lot of depth and interest.  I also love the diplomacy options and the indepth tech trees, everything.  I find this a very fun game, best out there atm. I do prefer Stellaris open movement, without the turn-based style, but in every other way Gal Civ 3 is a superior and more enjoyable game.			"

												Classic 4X space strategyBasically, Galactic Civilizations II got a facelift, a few new features, and a modified tech tree. Perfect. Don't mess with the best. The Galactic Civilization franchise has a monopoly on great space 4X strategy. If you are new to Galactic Civilizations, this game is like Civilization meets Starcraft, but perhaps more accessible than both. The fact that every technology you research allows you to continuosly create custom starships that are incrementally better and better, and every new tech allows either a new planetary upgrade, better economy, or some other meaningful change, keeps you thinking ""one more turn"".5-out-of-5			"

												Overall, Galactic Civilizations III is very fun and engrossing.  There is a very steep learning curve for those of us who have never played a previous incarnation of the franchise.  Looking at the tech tree for the first time or ten can be a bit overwhelming.  After playing through a game to learn the basics (set the AI to beginner on an insane size map and you can learn the basics without becoming too angry), the game becomes simple enough to be enjoyable.  One final tip: don't play a multiplayer game as your first game like I did.  The turns end up taking forever and many of the games I have played since involve hundreds of turns!			"

Posted: August 22, 2015
												TL;DR - This game has potential but at this time the gameplay is too monotonous.What is this game? Galactic Civilizations III is the third game in the Galactic Civilizations series of 4x games. You explore a randomly generated galaxy (with lots of options to customize it), colonize planets, build improvements on those planets, research new tech, build fleets of ships and exterminate other civilizations (or win through more peaceful means such as diplomatic victory, cultural victory, Ascension victory and so on). It is played over a series of turns and games can last from a few hundred turns to thousands, depending on the size of the galaxy, number of opponents and your chosen path to victory.Pros:- Beautiful map and music;- Ability to create whatever ship you want and download community-created ship hulls, and then customize then with different components;- Fun on smaller maps before it gets too tedious;- Plopping down different improvements and customizing planets is pretty fun at first;- The backstory behind each race is fairly interesting and the default races feel sufficiently different during gameplay;- The option to create your own custom race and even import your own portrait is rather nice;- The flavour text in different events and decisions points if well written and fun to read, until you realize that you're pretty much getting the same events and text regardless of which race you play.Cons:- the UI is not intuitive and often involves a lot of clicking. The developers should've looked at Endless Space's UI and learned from it;- although you can customize your ships and create your own hulls all you want, in practice the choices are between a weapon, a better version of that weapon, and an even better version of that weapon. Although a lot of custumization is possible, in practice you're better off sticking to default designs or tweaking them only a little.- The AI is frankly terrible even at higher levels of difficulty. It is predictable and poses no challenge. It cheats aggressively at higher difficulties but still can't think strategically;- The designers included an option to watch your ships duke it out with the enemy, but gave you zero control over that battle - absolutely stupid decision! You'll be skipping the battle view 100% of the time;- The game is STILL glitchy. It crashes to desktop, freezes during loading screens and during gameplay;- The game becomes very tedious and monotonous once you colonize enough planets. The options to let each planet auto-run itself are laughable to say the least. Micromanaging star base upgrades also becomes tedious, as is the requirement to keep shutting down and restarting star docks - I don't see why star docks couldn't just sit idle without requiring my individual attention. Although different races may start out feeling different in the early game, but the end they pretty much all feel the same, which leads me to...- You have wonderful options to create your own races (even add your own portrait race!) but you can easily create laughably overpowered races - I guess for some it's a pro, but for me it's a con - needs to be balanced better;- Diplomacy options are quite rich, too bad that trying to play diplomatic give-and-take with AI feels too random. Sometimes the AI will make ludicrous demands, other times it just rolls over, yet other times it rejects much more reasonable demands out of hand. If there's some kind of algorithm it follows when making diplomatic decisions I haven't figured it out yet.- Finally, some victory paths are much easier and/or fun than others. Many victory types are just a matter of clicking ""End Turn"" a couple of hundred times until your culture or diplomatic influence or whatnot reaches a certain threshold. Utterly boring.The other thing I want to mention (and this is much more subjective than even my above impressions) is that the DLC and patch support for this game are frankly awful. The DLCs are not worth getting unless you have completely played this game out (and trust me - it doesn't take very long to figure out how to win each and every game) and even then I would stay away from them. The patches haven't done much to improve the game stability or balance or fix issues with AI as far as I can see.Conclusion: stay away from this game until it gets some major TLC from the developers and more content. Don't even think of buying it unless it's deeply discounted.			"

												Score: 5/10EDIT: after writing this review i thought to myself ""what. i can't let this game win over me"", so i will be investigating more on how to play and win, i found a somehow desent tutorial and will update this review in the future, but for now i still stand by my first review :) (read below).i had high hopes for this game, i was really looking forward to a CIV like experience, everything is supposedly there, planets, city building elements, research tree, special resources, artifacts etc. ... but sadly enough, i was really bored with the game, the experience was slow and tedious, at the end i found my self hammering the ""next turn"" button just to get a new research or ship, i never got that special exiting feeling you get with ex. CIV.admittedly im new to the 4x-space genre, even thou i had viewed a lot of tutorial videos beforehand, i found it very difficult to figure out what strategies to use, which research to start out with, buildings, ships etc. it felt like information for special invited only, i don't mind spending time learning to play a game, but for this one it just all seems a bit too overwhelming, tedious and slow, too often i found myself in a guessing game without any advice or help to take the right decisions or at least understanding my decisions. despite other negative reviews on steam, i did not experience any technical issues, i feel that the battle system if fine as it is, no need for an added RTS level, and generally i find the game visually pleasing.i am really torn between two camps on this one, i really wanted this to be a great game but regrettably, for now i have to give it a thumb down, i was really looking forward to play this game, i may give it another try but i doubt it. :(			"

												This game is amazingly fantastic in all dimensions of space! its brilliant, innovative and really broadens the boundries of 4x strategy games, on all levels this game tops lots of others i've played. but a hint if you're thinking about buying this game, you'll need a fairly powerful computer to run it, the game has a tendency to lag your computer, i found this out after playing for about 5 minutes, BAM! the lag hit me, i really think this game could be a lot better if the devs went over and fine-combed the optimisation of this game, after closing the game the lag also continues for 5-10 minutes after closing, so if you've got a powerful enough platform, by all means buy this game! but bear in mind, it is no-where near as optimised as it could be.

												I got the game on Steam sale with all DLCs for less than what I paid for galciv2 and all DLC. Stop whining about how the DLC should have been part of the base game. This is how the industry works now.In galciv2, half the game happened through DLC, too. You sell the game when it is a viable product, so you can recoup your cost making it. And then you add what the players want and make some more money when selling it as DLC. Games cost too much to ""sell them when they are ready"". You'll go bankrupt as a studio if you try.galciv2 was a great game, and this one is even better. The AI feels less fickle to me this time around.Building through the tech tree is great fun, and even watching the epic space battles is less boring than I thought. I have yet to use the ship designer, so no idea how awseome it is. But even without it the game is at least a 9/10 for me.I love how the tech trees have personality for the different races, and how the other races attempt to guilt trip you into giving them free stuff.Building colonies has become even more interesting than with galciv2 because now there are adjacency bonuses, and the star base bonuses are so strong that my current strategy is to build planets for maximized manufacturing and then build a space port and crank out constructors to build star bases around the planet. Only when that is done do I tear down all the manufacturing infrastructure on the planet and switch to research. And I'm still not sure I found the right strategy. That's how beautifully complex it is!			"

Not enough premade races to fill in the third largest galaxy, much less the largest.-Spying and more Diplomacy options. Hopefully a bit more in depth than in GalCiv2.-""Stargates"". Largest map size is absurdly huge. I might be missing something, but I'd love to be able to build a horribly expensive space station that will allow me to move my fleet around the galaxy a little faster.			"

												Likes: The graphics are excellent. The addition of new resources is a big improvement. The battles are pretty awesome to watch. There is plenty to do and plenty to learn.Dislikes: I have yet to figure out how to rotate a ship when in Designer. It took a lot of gameplay to figure out that the range of a mining starbase is five. Often the edge scroller does not work on the bottom of the screen. When I finish a game, I want to be able to see which faction won and how. Some of the interactions with the other factions are extremely vague.  I sometimes cannot tell if I am being nice or insulting. Can carriers be loaded with smaller ships? If so, how and how many? Too many times I try to figure something out and can find no rules or whatever to answer my questions. EXTREMELY frustrating!			"

I have found that single player on the easy settings it's very easy to just crank up Influence and win that way without firing a shot, however not always and sometimes you can get zerged early on. I liked the choices by the AI for your ships when the game was released, after the patches the AI acts kinda stupid with armor/weapon allotment and I'm forced to go to the 'designer' to even things out, which is annoying. Also, some of the ships for the Drengin don't match (you click three different Huge ship hull types and the same exact picture comes up, which is a bug). Have had some issues with the AI hanging up while taking it's turn forcing me to force save and reload, hopefully fixed with future patches. The freigters are so slow you will need to redesign them yourself, again a lot of fiddly stuff in the micro when your should be more worried about the macro.			"

												great ship customization, trade systems is good, create your own race is good but could be a little better. when you get attacked you cant retreat before the battle which is kinda annoying. meaning coms wont attack unless they will most likely win. other then that great game			"

												I would have loved this game, if it were not released in an Alpha code.  DO NOT BUY THIS POS.  Look at my account records.  155+ hours played, and I have yet to complete a game.  Not. One. Single. Game.  This is not due to my acumen, but rather a failure point that ALWAYS happens.BSOD's and random freezes to the max.  Maybe check it out if you like the no win scenario.  I hope Stardock hires a Kirk to hack their Kobayashi Maru.0 out of 10.			"

												On par with the likes of the Civilization series as far as turn based games go. Race custumization is great and gives people the opportunity to play how they want. Ship designer is very well done and I can easily spends hours at a time just creating ships. Once I have completed my new ships I then remember that I never stopped playing the game I was in before because the ship customization is practically a game in its own right.			"

												A wonderful strategy game. Where it gets caught up, is that there is no general feeling of space. In other words, it's all 2 dimensional. In that sense, we never have a full understanding of where we are in space, relative to other races. This needs to be rendered in 3D. There really is no explanation for why it hasn't been done yet. Planets, ships, stars, all are reduced to an array of dots. Each planet seems no different from any other. You might settle a level 26 planet and it looks the same as a level 12. There needs to be better differentiation between planets.Likewise, you may encounter an alien race,  but you're not snapped t0 the action and therefore have no sense from where the alien came from. But it remains true to its origin. I just think Masters of Orion did it all better.			"

												I am trying to decide whether to recommend this game or not. It is a bit of a step up from GCII with improved graphics, but it is unstable, crashes far too often (and other games do not) and the combat animation is like something from 1989. More than that the AI interactions are trite, largely predictable and boring after a while. The tech tree is decent but it is entirely possible to get to the end of it and just run out of things to research. Frequently combat seems to be decided without logic as larger and more powerful fleets are destroyed by weaker or smaller ones. How does that work? And here is a big pet peeve: I made a custom race and the system used it to play against me. Same name. Same icon, everything. I can't tell who owns planets based on icons. Again...a silly mistake in the game design. So, back to the start I will give it a luke warm recommendation mainly as it is still fun to play, but I sure hope there are proper bug fixes coming soon and in the interim I am awaiting a better, new, RTS...eagerly.

												Admittedly I am semi new to the 4x genre Ive played endless space before this and total war shogun 2 if thats considered a 4x im not sure. All I can saw is wow, I am enjoying this game to the fullest. The amount of customization alone really makes it fell like your in a univerese you have created. You can upload pictures for factions alien races etc. I found that to be awesome. It really isnt that much of a learning curve if you have played a 4x before. the cg's and interactive cut scenes and choices really make the universe feel alive. The amount of  rpg elements also adds to this experince. The tech tree is nice not to complicated and diplomacy and trade work well. I have just begun my adventure but I can tell you I will be playing this game for months. I would also like to mention there are a ton of mods to really get the best out of this game. I've seen pretty much any space ship in any movie, tv show,  or game in the mod list! If your on the fence like I originally was I think you will be pleasently surprised if you give it a shot.			"

												Okay, first of all, this is a fairly good game.  However, there are balancing issues, and ai exploits.  One of such is you build a shipyard, and the one with the most manufacturing, the AI will go for, so you just keep switching back and forth between them.  Secondly, this game quits on you from time to time which can be incredibly frustrating, but I've noticed that hasn't happened in quite a while.  Also, with the ship building parts selector, I can't figure out how to turn the model and it seems they took out this feature, which is annoying because I can't see if my ship models look cool all around.  There are many tweaks however to the overall system that are much better in this than Galactic Civ 2 and its expansions, I was however hoping that all of the previous game ship building parts would be included in this one, which they are not.  I like that you can still trade ships in the steam workshop though, and I've made some cool looking ones.  As for the campaign I am disappointed with the minimalist three mission campaign, but I like that your tech stays with you when you move onto the next mission.  However, because of the way the tech tree is it makes it incredibly difficult if you are a non militaristic race against a Militaristic race, because of how slow the tech advances and this needs slight tweaks to make it more fair.  I'm sick of being the Humans and getting absolutely decimated by the stupid Krynn that automatically get huge hulls by the 100th turn.  THe graphics are very good though, and the ship battles are fun to watch, but it would be a bit cooler if it were more like homeworld style battles where you could out manuver your enemies and such.  I give this game a 6.5 out of ten, and it is worth playing.			"

												While I have only played 17 hours, I feel as though I get the main premice of the game.  I have not yet played the campaign.To be honest, this game is underwhelming if you're expecting a full-fledged 4X Turn-Based Strategy.  Civ V would be a much better choice, although I am slightly bias towards it, seeing as I have quite a few hours logged in it.  Pros:+Mechanics are good+Awesome visuals, especially space battles+Great Writing+In-Depth tech+Character development and story is unique+SHIP DESIGNER Cons:-Somewhat difficult to learn, I watched an hour of youtube before I got the main idea-I found at least 3 typos, kind of shows how they are a little careless.-There's about 6 races, compared to the 25-ish civ v + expanisions have-$40.00 for what feels incomplete-Scenarios grow very similar-Actions get repetetive, especially during warThere are other things, but as of right now I cautiously recommend this game when it's on sale.   There are certainly many other, more developed strategy games that feel more complete and are worth a more expensive price tag, but this game is definitely something I would reccommend picking up while on sale.

And finally the customization options are very close to limitless.The real question is what is worng with this game. Only thing I see so far worng is that it has some instablitiy issues when trying to load up a multi-player game with 3 players and 16 NPC factions. Other then that it's very very very good.			"

												Please, don't be fooled by my playtime, I have played alot in offline mode to test the game. I ENDED UP REFUNDING IT.TL:DR AT BOTTOM! I RECOMMEND THE GAME!I purchased this game, which I'd had my eye on for a while, as the GALCIVII servers have been dead for goodness knows how long, on sale for £10.19, which is a reasonable price. The game is an awesome game, I absolutely loved it, but so much has changed from GALCIVII, and I know most people will disagree, but I just can't play it. There is so much MORE to this game, adding depth and story, and even actually getting attatched to your races is in this gem, however whilst so much has been added, so much has been removed, and that is what ruined it for me. It now has hex-tiles, which it didn't before, which I loved, the freedom of movement in GALCIVII is what made the game. I know that it is a 4X strategy game, and alot of people wanted the hexes, but it lost alot in that.  It has also been ""dumbed down"" making the game alot easier, as there are less nuances and quirks that made the game so unique. Whilst there is alot of depth, I still don't personally like the game, and PLANETARY INVASION HAS BEEN KILLED.TL:DR: Dont't buy if you loved GALCIVII, and are ""convinced that it is perfection in a game"" (My friend's words), buy if you thought it was too difficult, and needed a bit more depth to the story etc.			"

												Short list; complex game – like 3D Chess on exponential steroids. Needs more complete manual or a better more complete tutorial. Spent 12 hours gathering up game info on web and still lost in space. Talking characters might be a plus. Good game if one has loads of time to spend in space and has time for a large learning curve for a new player. Been at it for four days still trying to figure out all the complex parts of the game. Game designers often fail to recognize the obvious which is the purchasing player does not know what they know about the game. An in depth GOOD tutorial would fix what is missing form an otherwise good game.			"

Plus this is hands down the best ship creator in any of the gal civ games and the addition of steam workshop contant is fantastic for adding new factions, ships and maps to keep the experience fresh.

Early Access Review
								Currently in early access, it provides several levels of depth that the previous Gal Civ games were lacking.The affect of planetary sectors on the ones next to them magnifies planetary strengths if you specialize, without overly penalizing generalization.  The graphics are, in true Stardock fashion, excellent and I enjoy the differentiated feel of each race.  Ship design appears to be coming back, and allows for some funky looking masses of space junk if you'd like.  I do wish there was more interaction with this feature in combat, however.Gonna give Gal Civ III an A for effort, expect a great continuation of a good story, and some fun single player.  I will only be really dissappointed if they don't fix the auto exploration issues that plagued Gal Civ 1 and 2.			"

												I'm a blunt guy of few words so I won't beat around the bush. I have played countless hours on the first two editions as well as all the other great 4x games such as Civ and Master of Magic. Most of the key elements are there that made Galciv 2 such an amazing game are there. The development of the worlds, the race specific tech trees, and the ship designing, all greatly improved with new graphics. The addition of the new map sizes is nice also.However, it lacks polish. Regardless of whether the race is humanoid or not, I am tired of being greeted the exact same way by every race every time. And the phrase ""It is good to see you walking upright "" is just lame. It would have been nice to see something like ""Live long and prosper"". Also, why leave references to different types of Governments in the ""completed release"" edition? I predict a release of a ""major update"" to provide ""further features"" somewhere in the next six months. I was also very dissapointed to have to pay for a DLC just to get a bare bones map editor. Couldn't it have included a tech or building editor?My disappointment is not in the game. I know when Stardock finishes releasing their updates for features that were already present in the first two editions it will be just as amazing. I am disappointed in Stardock for this marketing strategy to get more money out of loyal fans. The game is good enough that I would have paid more money to receive a completed game at release. Stardock is a group of amazing programmers. I didn't think that they were dishonest or greedy though. Don't follow in the steps of Sid Meier, guys. While Civ is an amazing game, I don't respect the man for shaking down his customers. "

												I would recomend this game, that said, I do not think it is BETA ready. It has crashed on me after three hours. I believe space battles are what sets it off. A lot of features still locked, which is to be expected. This appears like it will be an evolution from GC2, while keeping many of the elements that we loved from that game. The art style is less cartoon like, which is welcome. I would have liked more visual eye candy in the map however. Black holes are gorgeous, wish there would have been more visual elements on par with those.EDITED 3/172015I still heartily recomend this game. I do take issue with the need to constructor spam and lack of ship routing governors. I have put in many hours with this game and the game crashes and bugs are essentially non existent. Still very much a Beta, with the opponent AI not yet where one would expect a Stardock game to be, but getting ever closer to the goal!Edited 3/18/17The final result is Stardock has given strategy lovers a single player experience that exceeds the previous installment. You can build your civilization in any number of ways and the galaxy customization provides enormous variety in how a game will play out. There seem to be some odd AI idiosyncracies when they go against my favorite civ to play, the Iconian Refuge. Instead of going for the kill and taking out my primary fleet, opposing fleets will target respawning defenders on my colonies. Other than that, can't get caught napping because the AI has generally sound tactics and you can lose your hard built empire in the wink of an eye.I have yet to really get into the multiplayer, which is what I was looking forward to most. A future editing of this review will need to cover that.			"

												I loved Gal Civ II and spent way more time creating races than I am willing to admit, and here-in lies the charm of Gal Civ III: the customisation. The game is a robust 4X space game but the real beauty comes from the fact that you can upload your own art to be the face of your race, or other peoples that you have got off the internet, so easily. Modding the game is as easy as dropping a jpeg into a folder! And the customisation of the ships, although a little fiddly sometimes, is really really varied, and gives you even more power to customise your race. You want a race of floating shafts in space led by your leader Bagpuss the Mighty? This game has you covered. The combat is still pretty simple (think civilization style), you watch but don't have much control. The building on planets is very similar still to older games such as Master of Orion, and works well enough. The map you do most the playing on is great, and works well up close, and automatically changes things to easy to see tactical icons when you zoom out further. The tech tree is varied enough to keep things interesting, and knowing the previous Gal Civ games this will get even more love down the line. The diplomacy is good (not great though), sometimes the aliens do make crazy decisions and go to war over the drop of a hat with a more powerful race, but it keeps things interesting. The sheer size of the galaxy is crazy when playing on the larger map settings and makes for a long game with a lot of scope.If you'd like to check out my series on YouTube you'll get to see the more silly side of the customisation and the sheer scope of this game: Galactic Civilizations : The Nochin Chronicles - Series 1  "

												It's a good sign when you like a game after only a few hours of gameplay. That's the case for me with this game, Galactic Civilizations III (or GalCiv3 to its fans). As of the time of writing, I've only beaten the tutorial and am playing a rather easy game, and I'm already convinced it's great. To start with, the graphics are beautifully rendered, from the planets you can colonize and exploit, to the starships you control, to the faces of the various beings you'll either befriend or crush beneath your feet. Speaking of starships and aliens, this game has built-in tools for creating these. So if you want to fly the USS Enterprise, or meet the Klingon Empire, this game allows you do so! These tools are also easy to learn; I've already built a custom ship and come up with a custom race despite having zero experience with this game aside from a few Youtube videos.The gameplay is simplistic in a good way, meaning that fans of space 4X strategy games will be able to play it as well as those who are only dipping their toes into the genre. It keeps to the same gameplay choices as you'd expect from Master of Orion or Endless Space, but has some new quirks. For example, there is an Ideology system where every colonization of a new planet presents a decision for you, shaping your abilities and attitude towards your neighbors. This is a very intruging concept, one which is probably present in only a few 4X games and even in those games is probably not as complex as in GalCiv3. (If anyone knows of any games with a similar system, let me know).GalCiv3 has a very fleshed-out backstory and lore dealing with its inerstellar history and how the alien races interact, unlike other 4X games where you're only presented with a simple history. Just as a small example, a key part of the lore is humanity's invention of the hyperdrive, which was the first FTL-drive system of the galaxy that was shared with the other major races, thus beginning the game. Even though I prefer to tell my own story with these games, it is still nice to have at least some sort of background on who you are and who your neighbors are.There's also a campaign mode for those who want to see more of the backstory of this game which I have yet to explore, however I think combining a 4X sandbox mode with a campaign mode is a very neat concept.One complaint I have is that starship battles are controlled by the computer, meaning that you can't issue commands to your ships and you'll end up losing valuable fleet assets in a ball of fire and space debris.The optional and newly-released Mercenaries expansion DLC adds two races from earlier titles as well as an ability to hire Mercenaries. These Mercenaries are unique captains who are like the Heroes of Endless Space or Master of Orion II in that they provide buffs to your planets and/or fleets.In the end, this extraordinary game is perfect for fans of space 4X games such as the earlier GalCiv titles, Master of Orion, Ascendancy, or Endless Space. One word of warning, though: make sure you have a good, up-to-date 64-bit computer with plenty of memory if you intend to check out this game.			"

												Although this game can be a tad complex for new players after you take a while to learn the ins and outs of constructing buildings and ship design which are a tad complex this game really is a gem.In an age where decent turn based strategy games seem to becoming rare with the demise of Total War and Civ this holds the banner of TBS high.If you give it a chance prepair to lose hours of your life building a galactic empire, trading with other races and kicking the s@*% out of anyone who dares defy you.Not just one of the best space based TBS games this is one of the best TBS games of all time full stop.8.5/10 If you love strategy you will love this.

The visuals are stunning and the AI's tactics and balancing are believable.I'm one of those players that like playing on maxed-out settings. Meaning, I want the highest number of enemies on the map and I want the largest map possible. I TRY to break the game just to have something to complain about. I've been foiled this time. I have a total of 50 factions including my own running on the insane map. After more than 10 hours in I'm surprised there is no lag or hang-ups whatsoever. There's A LOT going on in this game and nothing is a chore nor boring. With every turn I still get the sense I haven't seen it all.			"

												Fun 4x Space game. There is nothing drastically different about GC 3 compared to GC 2 that is a must have but it's the same good old fun.  No manual combat with the ships is one feature I still love.  The races feel more alive and have more personality then in the previous games. As with most 4X games they still seem to last too long for my liking.  I am not sure what a good fix would be but 10+ hours for 1 game is to long for me.  Overall great game and I recommend it!			"

												4x with more. You don't just eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. You don't even have to exploit or exterminate if thats not your path. Play the game as a mega conglomerate and make a fortune selling goods to the galaxy. Devote yourself to research and transcend beyond reality. Maybe you want to devote yourself to creating and maintaining a United Planrtery Council. Forge alliances and rule the galaxy however you see fit. Spread your cultural and religious beliefs and watch as the masses come to you. Explore the galaxy finding anything from scrap to unexplainable anomolies. Mine new types of resources allowing your civilization to build prototype ships and planetary improvements. Build epic starbases to investigate precursor relics.The number of ways to play this game rivals any other strategy game. The depth of detail and options is impressive. I could spell out pages about all the features in this game, but you would do better to explore them yourself. What kind of ruler will you be?			"

												Cannot recommend this game at current state. It is lackluster in features and content, and all the content that makes it special are coming in DLC. Although comparing this to old Gal Civ 2 is in some ways unfair, to customer it doesn't matter. Gal civ 3 is reinventing the wheel, and yet gal civ 2 is the same in almost every way if not better. Only thing that Gal Civ 3 has going for it is multiplayer which didn't exist in the previous one. It is a good improvement, but if you don't use it, the game is inferior and stripped of content to make room for DLCs.So I would recommend getting Gal Civ 2 or some other 4X space strategy game, that is fleshed out and prim of content, and wait on this one. Maybe if and when the ""ultimate edition"" comes out in distant future at discounted price this will be worth it. But currently not worth it even at half price when you can just get Gal Civ 2 for few bucks when on sale.Campaign, tech tree and ship designer is almost the same. Only few minor improvements from previous one. Campaign is still pretty tame just like in previous one and poorly executed. There is also ideology, but it is rather shallow and not all that interesting.Could talk more about this, but I'm just here to give me general thought. Which is to wait on this one.			"

												I played this game for days and even though it is really cool looking you spend most of your time zoomed out to see what is going on, therefore seeing mostly simplified symbols.The endless researching seemed to take forever to advance my tech so this grew boring quickly.Interesting as it is to build your planets up hex by hex the coin flip takeovers of planets really ruins the strategy battle feeling of the game.  You would think with the cool hex planets it would be more than a toss of a coin to take one of these important resources in the game.Like alot of the newer games since about 2007 or so developers seem to care more about pretty then depth or entertainment.  If you like oooo so pretty ""drooolinnggg"" you might like.Part 2 april 17, 2017 V.2 was working ok played three days and went on steam.  DO NOT subscribe to anything while playing a game, three days playing now lost will not reload!!!!  V.2 a little better 6 outa 10.  Started new game after a year in anticipation of Crusaders.  Not happy at all now was kinda having fun.  Don't change graphic settings either after saving this seems to cause problems also, just so you know.			"

												Decided to play some Gal Civ after dinner. Forced myself to go to bed at 5 AM. This game is highly addictive, deep 4x strategy with brilliant writing and good sense of humour. However, i wouldnt say that it has high replayability. When i first started it i thought ""ah , finally i found a game that i can keep playing for months"" ,but after winning 1 game, i didnt feel the urge to start another. Maybe its just me, and it definetely doesnt make this game unworthy. Pros : Every good thing u can think of in 4x strategy = its probably here , so i wont bother to mention them.Cons : -There are few game mechanics that make every game look kinda the same at the start. Like creating dual constructors, trading with minor races, etc.- Cheating AI. This is the biggest minus for me. I witnessed the situation when i invaded the planet of an AI , and because it was deep in his teritory - i decided to just destroy every structure on it , so when he gets it back - he wont benefit from it. AI took the colony back. I invaded it again in about 4-5 turns. And whatddaya know - colony was fully furnished again and there EVEN WERE UNIQUE RESOURCES , that randomly spawn and cant be build (i destroyed them previously too). Drenging Empire is the biggest cheater of them all, if Drengin is in the game - he will be the most powerful race 10 times out of 10. Even if you conquer like 90% of his space - he will still be rushing HUGE capital ships on every turn, even tho there is just NO WAY he could have money for it.Overall , its a very good and fun 4x strategy that i highly recommend , plus developers seem to be constantly reviewing it and patching , so i think and hope it will only become better.

The AI difficulty seems on par with most 4x games, and the ship builder is a major plus.

												I've played this game largely within two different times. At first when it first came out to about 8 months and the second was just a few days ago. This game used to be great. It isn't anymore. The devs have overbalanced the AI when in single player to the point where you can never catch up. Even when I focus on military research to make my race a war machine, there were two other AI races with twice the research and three times the military power in only the span of an hour. Now, I'm not a game developer but how do you play a game with this much of a disadvantage even when the AI is on normal? The answer..? You don't. I couldnt enjoy this game at all because of this overbalancing. The AI is unbeatable. And I've played tons of 4x strategy games in my years. Never came across bogus balancing. Somewhere in the span of an hour, the AI gets free research, income and planets to make up this much of a disadvantage. The AI does not progress the same as you, where you start out with just a single planet and some starter ships. In a skirmish, where everyone is supposed to start out brand new with almost nothing.I couldnt even get a refund for this garbage because the time it took to notice this kind of overbalancing was over the 2 hour game time refund policy for steam. This is just terrible for gc3 and steam. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!			"

												Having Loved the first two, I was very excited to jump into GalCiv3.  Put it on the easy level like I usually do to just learn what I need to do.  I was playing nice with my neigbours and bang 3 of them declared war and destroyed me.  The game itself plays like you expect this series to play, and I don't mind a tough game, but my god, I started over a couple of times and still  had trouble getting started.  Seemed even at the easy level the AI was jumping ahead way to quick.  Ship Design, which is a important part of the game seemed to be much harder than before, then I took my newly designed ships into battle and they did nothing.  I got blasted into oblivion.  Heck I was ahead, so my ships should have done somehing but they seem to move around and do nothing.  I think in terms of play this game would have benefited from a tactical battles.  While I expect a learning curve to be difficult, but at the easiest level one should not find overly aggresive AI who go to war with a drop of a hat.  Can I recommend this, It would be tough not to just go back to GalCiv2 which was a great game.  Sorry maybe they will tone it down with a few patches.I truly want to like this game, but it came off my machine, it is really  unplayable.  4/10			"

												I would recomend this game, that said, I do not think it is BETA ready. It has crashed on me after three hours. I believe space battles are what sets it off. A lot of features still locked, which is to be expected. This appears like it will be an evolution from GC2, while keeping many of the elements that we loved from that game. The art style is less cartoon like, which is welcome. I would have liked more visual eye candy in the map however. Black holes are gorgeous, wish there would have been more visual elements on par with those.EDITED 3/172015I still heartily recomend this game. I do take issue with the need to constructor spam and lack of ship routing governors. I have put in many hours with this game and the game crashes and bugs are essentially non existent. Still very much a Beta, with the opponent AI not yet where one would expect a Stardock game to be, but getting ever closer to the goal!Edited 3/18/17The final result is Stardock has given strategy lovers a single player experience that exceeds the previous installment. You can build your civilization in any number of ways and the galaxy customization provides enormous variety in how a game will play out. There seem to be some odd AI idiosyncracies when they go against my favorite civ to play, the Iconian Refuge. Instead of going for the kill and taking out my primary fleet, opposing fleets will target respawning defenders on my colonies. Other than that, can't get caught napping because the AI has generally sound tactics and you can lose your hard built empire in the wink of an eye.I have yet to really get into the multiplayer, which is what I was looking forward to most. A future editing of this review will need to cover that.			"

								Currently in early access, it provides several levels of depth that the previous Gal Civ games were lacking.The affect of planetary sectors on the ones next to them magnifies planetary strengths if you specialize, without overly penalizing generalization.  The graphics are, in true Stardock fashion, excellent and I enjoy the differentiated feel of each race.  Ship design appears to be coming back, and allows for some funky looking masses of space junk if you'd like.  I do wish there was more interaction with this feature in combat, however.Gonna give Gal Civ III an A for effort, expect a great continuation of a good story, and some fun single player.  I will only be really dissappointed if they don't fix the auto exploration issues that plagued Gal Civ 1 and 2.			"

												4x with more. You don't just eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. You don't even have to exploit or exterminate if thats not your path. Play the game as a mega conglomerate and make a fortune selling goods to the galaxy. Devote yourself to research and transcend beyond reality. Maybe you want to devote yourself to creating and maintaining a United Planrtery Council. Forge alliances and rule the galaxy however you see fit. Spread your cultural and religious beliefs and watch as the masses come to you. Explore the galaxy finding anything from scrap to unexplainable anomolies. Mine new types of resources allowing your civilization to build prototype ships and planetary improvements. Build epic starbases to investigate precursor relics.The number of ways to play this game rivals any other strategy game. The depth of detail and options is impressive. I could spell out pages about all the features in this game, but you would do better to explore them yourself. What kind of ruler will you be?			"

												Decided to play some Gal Civ after dinner. Forced myself to go to bed at 5 AM. This game is highly addictive, deep 4x strategy with brilliant writing and good sense of humour. However, i wouldnt say that it has high replayability. When i first started it i thought ""ah , finally i found a game that i can keep playing for months"" ,but after winning 1 game, i didnt feel the urge to start another. Maybe its just me, and it definetely doesnt make this game unworthy. Pros : Every good thing u can think of in 4x strategy = its probably here , so i wont bother to mention them.Cons : -There are few game mechanics that make every game look kinda the same at the start. Like creating dual constructors, trading with minor races, etc.- Cheating AI. This is the biggest minus for me. I witnessed the situation when i invaded the planet of an AI , and because it was deep in his teritory - i decided to just destroy every structure on it , so when he gets it back - he wont benefit from it. AI took the colony back. I invaded it again in about 4-5 turns. And whatddaya know - colony was fully furnished again and there EVEN WERE UNIQUE RESOURCES , that randomly spawn and cant be build (i destroyed them previously too). Drenging Empire is the biggest cheater of them all, if Drengin is in the game - he will be the most powerful race 10 times out of 10. Even if you conquer like 90% of his space - he will still be rushing HUGE capital ships on every turn, even tho there is just NO WAY he could have money for it.Overall , its a very good and fun 4x strategy that i highly recommend , plus developers seem to be constantly reviewing it and patching , so i think and hope it will only become better.

												Fun 4x Space game. There is nothing drastically different about GC 3 compared to GC 2 that is a must have but it's the same good old fun.  No manual combat with the ships is one feature I still love.  The races feel more alive and have more personality then in the previous games. As with most 4X games they still seem to last too long for my liking.  I am not sure what a good fix would be but 10+ hours for 1 game is to long for me.  Overall great game and I recommend it!			"

												This game is probably most comparable to the Sid Meier's Civilizations series - and it does, in my opinion, compare well. While it is definitely more focused on war and battle, you still have plenty opportunities to achieve peaceful victory in this roundbased strategy. One of the strengths of this game is the powerful Ship Designer, where you can not only equip your vessels how you like it most, but also adapt to your enemy's ship styles. The research tree is definitely more complex than it is in Sid's Civ, although it mostly serves as a means to increase numbers in some way.While I love to play Civ from time to time, my favourite choice is and will always be GalCiv3.

												The gameplay is an excellent upgrade on Galactic Civilisations 2 and its expansions, however the lack of campaign (3 missions total) when advertised as a campaign oriented game was very disappointing, also the mechanics of planetary invasion are more basic than that of previous games. There isn't even a screen to watch your troops slogging it out. I expected a visual and complex system for planetray invasions, and there is none. If you're looking for a full blow story and plenty of objectives to complete, you won't find it here.			"

												I like this game, I played II to shreds, and I'm a big fan of the genre. However. As I advance, all I seem to do is upgrade starbases. The planetary stuff I can leave to a governor, but upgrading starbases is just an annoying, turn consuming effort that at the moment is just doing my head in. Sure, I can request construction ships with no effort, but then I still have to click them and upgrade them and do the whole thing over and over and over and over again. My science is running like crazy atm, so before any construction ship reached a starbase, I will have invented one or two new technologies. Would it really be that hard to fork the governor mechanic to the starbases? So I can focus on enjoying the game?So I rate this game at about 6.0 out of 10. It' s still a beauty and a marvel of game design. So yeah I'll recoommend it, but I do hope they find a way to make endgame less tedious.			"

												So this game is fully release today, I have been playing the Beta and for the last week or so since the recent changes I have decided this is the best 4x game I have ever played.   That is pretty high praise considering I have been playing this game on early access.  Stardock have done a great job balancing this game.   I have played 55 hours on this game in early access and I feel like I am only starting to scratch the surface of my gaming time.  I haven't enjoyed a turn based strategy this much since the super buggy Star trek BOTF (and I enjoy this much more).  Things I love about this game:Build your own ships.Customize and create your own race (including photo's etc).Massive maps.Great game pacing, doesn't become stale even after 100's of turns.Galactic events and humour. I love the way the devs have been posting up regular development videos and have really been inclusive with fans, I also like that they are planning adding workshop support.  This game is excellent now, I can imagine in a year after mods and expansions it will be amazing. Things I would like to see. Intelligence system, perhaps linked to galactic events, I.e letting you interfere with the progress of major and minor races.  More fleshed out diplomacy.  If you are in my friends list and planning on buying this, please do,  I have not played MP yet and want a friend to play against.

												When I first saw this new sci-fi 4x game, I was excited for it. However, after playing for 46 hours, I realized that I was quite finished with it. By far, the biggest problem is that you cannot in any way play out the battles. The only battles offered are cinematic views of your ships floating around, auto-fighting the enemy. This disappointing feature is compounded by the fact that a huge draw for this game – almost unlimited ship customization – is rendered pointless by your inability to actually use the ships you’ve created.Some other problems are that the affinities unlock far too slowly to have much impact, the tech trees are all almost exactly the same despite promises of radical differences, and there is no feeling of depth, theme or personality to the game. A much, much better alternative is Endless Space, although this game too suffers from a lack of playable battles. In Endless Space, at least, you can issue fleet-wide orders and change them during the auto-fought battle, which might have a significant effect on the result of the combat.  "

												I had fun doing the first Campaigns to learn the game but when I started my first real game i noticed the flaws behind the beautiful graphics.  If you are into doing a playthruth with many planets to colonize and want every tech to mean something by lowering production values and research value then this is not the game for you. The modifiers are put on planet level instead of changing the overall cost of production and science so it becomes very unbalanced and counterintuitive to how it is in other similar games where they get this right. From my point of view it is programmer taking an easy way out to not have to design the research and production modifiers as they should have been. Since this is a dealbreaker for me I can not recommend this game.If you get it for 10 Euro then it is worth something for the start campaign. From my point of view not worth 49.99 Euros "

I gave it a good try and I'm deleting it from my hard drive as we speak for the following reasons:1. It's an INCOMPLETE re-skinned GalCiv II. It has some new minor tweaks (shipyard for example) but it's mostly just an updated and prettier GalCiv II with some major features missing (espionage, elections, etc)2. Its claims are unfounded. Largest space game? Try Distant Worlds instead. Unique races? There are one or two tweaks in the technology tree or buildings and that's all there is. It's not like Sword of the Stars with completely different feel for different races. 3. Rather uninspired tech tree. To be fair GalCiv II was the same but advancement in tech tree is nothing more than going from Weapon X to Weapon X + 1. There was nothing in the technology tree that changes the mechanics of the game. In Master of Orion (1!) we go through the same iteration of Weapon X, X+1, X+2 but then at some point we get the fancy schmancy Black Hole Generator. I played the game 20 years ago and I still remember the god damn Black Hole Generator! What can we say about this game 20 years from now? ""Ya - Remember that beam+20?? That was cool!!""?4. Completely unbalanced and boring ground invasion. In my experience a single transport was able to conquer the Drengin homeworld. The ground invasion tech tree? Nope - didn't need that. 5. To be fair there were moments when I had fun with this game. Reminded me of late 90's or early 2000's strategy game. Seeing it's 2016...that unfortunately counts against this game. 6. The straw that breaks the camel's back - the greed for further DLCs and expansions as opposed to fixing the base game. I got this game 6 months after release. I accepted it still had flaws and was hoping there'd be further improvements down the road. Then I saw the news that there's an expansion coming out already. On top of the 3 DLCs already out.			"

												I got this game back when Galactic Civ first came out. Basic play was enjoyable then as it is now. Ives peen about 40 hours in this version of the game. – That is the Good!The BAD!The mechanics of play are pretty much the same as they were in the mid-90s. This means the game is pretty primitive by today’s standards. They have mostly just dug out the old game and added 21st century graphics. Graphics are nice for the first few hours but you spend most of your play at that old 20th century graphics levelTactical combat is nothing more than a 70’s style arcade rendition of a coin-video console with combat odds resolution. PRIMITIVE!Many of the games concepts are poorly developed (wormholes), diplomacy, tech tree, planetary development etc – none of which have progressed much past the mid-90’sIn short the reduced price of $25 is pushing it. The game needs a lot of work- far more than is likely. "

												Captures ZERO of the magic of GalCiv II: Twilight of the Arnor.  Horribly imbalanced, even a year after release game has bugs that freeze it up.  Smaller maps work fine as far as speed goes, but try playing on the larger map sizes with multiple opponents and it won't be long before you're watching your computer slog through turns that take forever.  I'm on an Intel Core i5 with 16GB of Ram, a Western Digital Raptor drive and a Radeon 7870 2GB card fwiw.  Not top of the line, but certainly no slouch.But the biggest problem is the cheating from the AI, it crosses the border into absolutely ridiculous.  Playing on ""Normal"" setting and you will find that whomever is opposite your Ideology will ALWAYS somehow be massive in size compared to you.  You will be out-teched, out-colonized, out-militarized, etc. constantly.  I don't mind a challenge, I actually appreciate it, but this game cheats to provide you that challenge, which cheapens the experience and turns it into outright frustration.  I've turned off tech-trading and even when I'm colonizing like a mofo out the gate somehow the most powerful race will magically always share a border with you.  Even races that are outside your range declare war on you, all in an artificial effort to provide a ""challenge"".  This game needs serious balancing that will probably take another year, hopefully the modding community will take care of it.  GalCiv II Twilight of the Arnor was a blast, I'm hoping that magic isn't lost and this game can be saved.  But for now I cannot recommend a purchase.  I'm only glad I bought it cheap on a Steam Sale and didn't fall for that $100 Founders b.s. Stardock was cramming down everyones throats.			"

Early Access Review
								Keep in mind it's a beta. No-where near a finished game, but it's enough to get you salivating. I installed it, played very little, poked around and... well, drooled a little. For fans of Galciv2, you'll enjoy seeing where this new game is headed. The folks who keep complaining that they bought a beta but it wasn't a finished game seem to have incredibly bizzare expectations. This beta gives you a feel for the basics of the game, how it handles and what it looks like. If you preorder a game, you usually don't even get a hands-on sneak peak at the gameplay. So people, stop complaining that the beta isn't the finished project. Obviously it's not, that's why it's in the beta stage. Beta doesn't imply that it's 'feature-complete'... it implies that it's in beta, as in.. not a finished product. So for those people who complained about not getting a finished product... stop whining. You knew what you were buying when you preodered. You'll get the full game when it's released, but until then... stop expecting something that a beta isn't.			"

												Great part 3 of the franchise, so if you liked the first 2, you'll like this.  GalCiv is kind of like Sid Meier's Civlization in space, but done right.  Unlike Sins of a Solar Empire, the military is run more at the strategic level rather than the ship level, so if you like micro-managing your ships, you would like Sins better.But if you like 4x on a massive scale with a space theme, GalCiv3 is the game for you.

												This Game will Only Get Better.##Like##*Ability to craft a huge empire. *Don't often get stuck next to another NPC early on - you usually have time to craft your specialty.*Simple-stupid interface.*Slightly cheeky writing. Sarcastic & refreshing, b*tchez.  *Game settings similar to Civ V.   You should generally be able to play  the style of game you enjoy.*In GC3, building & unit specialization won't define your whole game or identity.*Expansive tech tree##Needs Work##*The AI. On the hardest settings it really is challenging; but not because it's smart. Afaik, it cheats.*More random mystery. Space is the great unknown! There is a lack of random / low repeat / unique items and events. To be sure, there are some. But there should be more. I'd like to see elements you might encounter once in every 5 games. *The battle viewer needs to be be improved. It represents your ships armaments and defenses very well - it's even *fun* to watch when you have two huge fleets with robust specialties going at each other.  But it could be *more* fun. I'd like the battle viewer to be more visceral.  Screams, escape pods, flashing red lights.  On a technical level the battle viewer represents the facts well, but it's got NO EMOTION. And ships derpy-derp  crash into themselves like 1980's bumper cars.As it stands, I enjoy the game a lot. I do recommend it - & very much look forward to the expanded development.  "

												I bought this game because I loved GalCiv 2.  For some reason this sequel doesnt have the same balance or polish that the previous GalCiv had.  I have mostly been playing the single player campaign so far but there are two big issues for me.  The  biggest issue for me is that planetary defence fleets are so overpowered that conquering an enemies last planet takes forever.  You can smash all of their fleets and outposts but you can't take their last planet until you fully reasearch logistics since you won't be able to field a large enough fleet to invade.  This was a pointless waste of time for me.  Also the ship designer/AI is horrible.  In the campaign tutorial missions you build a ship with upgraded ranged missile attacks however it is small and weak.  Rather than sit behind your front line combat units the game decides the best AI for this unit is one that charges straight at the enemy and dies.  All up I found this game more pain than it was worth.  If you are a fan of space 4x games give this a miss or get GalCiv 2 instead.			"

												I would recommend this game to fans of the Galactic Civilizations franchise and 4x strategy games with some minor caveats.First, this is a solid game, with similar gameplay to other GC titles. Most things work well, with a few bugs, but as the closed/purchase beta was fairly long, they fixed most major issues.Still some problems in there, but these will probably be worked out in a not very long while.My reservations about this title are a few:1. Stardock seems to be going down the same DLC path as other game companies, and I do not see this as a good thing. Up to now, they have done a fairly good job of not nickel and diming people to death. They have been putting out some reasonably weak expansions for their other titles, so I am not terribly hopeful on this front.2. The gameplay is extremely similar to GC2 w/expansions. There is not a whole lot new in there, that I have seen at least. It is very much evolutionary in design, and in places, not very much of that even. GC3 is certainly not revolutionary in design. New graphics, cleaner look and play, much better under the hood, but not a fundamentally different game than GC2.3. For a game so similar to GC2, the full price of ~ $50 is a bit high. I myself bought in during beta, and paid far less. Had I paid full price for this title, I might have been less satisfied with it.So, it is a good game for fans of 4x strategy, and the GC franchise, but even with a few things that need work, the game is worth buying, especially if you can get it on sale.

Early Access Review
								Even in BETA with limited features, this game is truly reminiscient of Galactic Civ I and II.  I love the detail oriented turn-based gameplay and the ability to design my own ships based on tech that I have researched.  A standout game for sure.			"

												THis is my first galactic civ game.  I had heard good things about the previous games. The ship creater is fun but Sadly Im a little sorry I bought this. It is far to easy. Even on the haredest difficulty I never felt worried about lossing nor did I feel like completing a game. Once I knew I would win I would just start a new one. The AI seems passive?  It will only attack plants if there is no defending fleet (i found that as long as there were 4 ships defending a plant/station even if they were all tiny the enemy would virtually ignore them). I can make a fleet of 14 ships (4 carries 4 large 4 med 2 transport)but the enemy seems to focus on making fleets of 4-6 that simply get obliterated without my fleet suffering a single loss. It is just a little lack luster all around.			"

												A decent update to Galactic Civilizations 2, but could have been more. Wait for a few more patches for Stardock to bring in some of the more recent features to the 4X genre and it would be a lot better.GalCiv 3 is basically a prettier GalCiv 2 with some new stuff added in and some old stuff taken out. The mainstay races (Terran, Drengin, Iconian) are still here, and some are out (Arceans). The system for building planets is improved, with adjacency bonuses on planet improvements further encouraging specialization. The shipbuilding process is for the most part better, since ships are now built in a shipyard (basically a non-improvable starbase that builds ships) that is fed by production from up to 5 worlds. The combat system and the tech tree are more or less the same from GalCiv 2. Minor races are out (at least for now). The diplomatic system is still as good as GalCiv 2. The map now uses hexes instead of squares. And the ship designer is still as good as it was.If GalCiv 3 is to be judged on its own, I'd say it was a competent sequel. Some of the changes I like (planet improvements, shipyards), some I dont (lack of minor races). The game doesn't crash and its enjoyable to play.The problem is that Endless Space and Distant Worlds: Universe exist. These games have added features to the 4X genre that I just can't imagine being left out anymore. Though Endless Space stole A LOT of ideas from GalCiv 2, it added several good ones of its own (adding player input during starship combat, planet and ship leaders that gain XP and have skill trees). Distant Worlds: Universe is the master of selective automation. You can choose to control only the aspects of your empire you want to control, and the AI will competently take care of the rest (at least most of the time). There are also race-specific branches in the tech tree, which really do change how to select techs when you play those races.GalCiv 3 could have benefited a lot by taking some of these features.  Selecting strategies during combat would make it worth watching the space battles, and ship leaders make your fleets more than just a collection of ships. Automation becomes almost essential in the late stages on even a moderate sized map. No, I don't want to manually select the upgrades for all of my 30 starbases. Yes I would like to be able to say ""Build me 10 battleships, 5 carriers and 10 escorts in the fastest possible time and move them here"" instead of manually selecting the shipyards and setting up their build queue. I would like to be able to say, ""Here, take control of these boring garrison fleets and patrol the homefront while I take the Kickass Fleet of Awesomeness to pound the Drengin to dust.""GalCiv 3 is still a good game and I would recommend it, but it could be so much better with the addition of several features from more recent 4X games.

												This is a review from somebody who owns GalCiv I + II but never got into them. Why I don't know. Installed GallCiv2: UE severeal times, played for a little while and got bored to hell. So I was quite sceotic with all the GalCiv 3 beta pizzazz.BUTIt is sooooo good. I don't know what they did, but it suddenly clicked with me. Everybody says galCiv 3 is to similar to GalCiv 2, this I don't know, but they did something with GalCiv 3 which utterlay fascinates me. The thing I am looking for in a Space game is SPACE. The vastness, the endless possibilities. Never was I more frustrated when I realized that ""Endless Space"" was very restricted in terms of Space. Enter GalCiv 3 you can create maps which are so big, that the UI (and mybe your computer) can't handle all the planets and star on the map. You can play with 100s of Factions if you want to, the ship creator doesn't let you outfit your own schips, no, you can create them from predefined 3D parts and then put your weopans, sensor, whatnot on it. I instantly created ships from Battlestar Galactica, modded my ""race"" so that I have Commander Adama as my leader with all the logos. How awesome is this?Gameplay wise it creats all sorts of interesting decisions. How do I outfit this planet? Oh I got attacked, in which why should I construct ships, that my retaliation is successful? Do I need special rescources? Where do I find them? Is this region stable? Should I station a fleet there? Which planets do I take first from the enemy? Where is the best place for my new shipyard. It goes on and on.PLUS Stardock has itself committed to support this game for years to come and I have no doubt that they will do it.It is my most played game since Steam records your playtime.Nuff said.

												Updated 05/09/2015, please see edit below regarding almost criminal DLC practicesIt's with a heavy heart I would advise to leave this game well alone.I bought it as early access and even the most basic problems haven't been fixed, by the official 1.03 or the 1.10 opt-in patches.Stardock is incredibly evasive about common problems, such as screen resolution defaulting to (1 x -1) for most people/larger screen, UI being broken and out-of-place (making it unplayable), mouse-over text being little to non-existent and other such nonsense that shouldn't be in the final release.Extremely long list of in-game bugs, faults, unbalances, etc., exist. Just take a look at what they need to fix from 1.03 to 1.10, and most of us who have tried 1.10 still encounter many problems.They've truly taken the money and left a few guys to try and wrap it up. They don't care, I've seen reports of the sending people .ini files as fixes for the resolution problem but it boots it in windowed mode and the UI is till off by inches!I loved GC II, I wish they had taken the time to actually create something wonderful, then meet deadlines and push out this farce,Edit - September 5th 2015 - I would like to add that problems still abound. The release of the Mega Events DLC has cemented my view even further - they are charging people for content that was standard in previous titles. They have not created, developed or even changed the ideas or mechanics. They purposefully didn't include it in the release in order to charge for it. Even a developer has said that aspects of the game are 'soulless', like planet management. And they plan to change many core mechanics - in future updates and DLC. Completely avoid Stardock, it's beyond comprehension how such a good publisher falls to charging extra to actually make the game viable and enjoyable.			"

Its a little bit big. If you like massive space sims like the masters of orion serries this will scratch that itch. Oh piece of advice. Before you start building ships, check out the designer. Depending on what you need the basic ship designs might have you paying for things you don't need like extended life support when you only need to colonize another planet in your own solar system.

It's not even possible to set missile ship to keep maximum firing distance for example.- Manufacturing prices balance is ridiculous, like one basic piece of shield can cost 9x times the whole hull it is built on.

												At first impression this game is quite underwhelming and seems to be nothing more than a re-skin of Gal Civ II but as is often the case, first impressions can be very wrong. After you get your rear end handed to you in the first few games and once you start to ""get"" what is going on this game really comes together and shows its abundant depth and fun. It may lack  that level of super polish and marketing bells and whistles that some other recent 4x games have, what it doesn't lack however is pure unadulterated PC space strategy goodness. This game has so many systems all working together at once it can become exceedingly complex but never seems to bog down and become a chore. Decidedly old school in its interface and gameplay (a good thing) but with a nice snappy modern engine backing it all up, the game can handle a huge universe with tons going on without seemingly batting an eye. Gal Civ III is the first 4x to truly bring out that ""just one more turn"" feeling for me since CIV IV. With a bit more fine tuning and some Steam workshop addition of races, mods etc (Star Fleet Command universe I am waiting for you) this game will undoubtedly stand as a space strategy classic. Pros:+ Massive levels of customization, from races and ships to game settings you can play this game how you want.+ Huge maps that could setup some truly lengthy and involved games, or small skirmishes if you so prefer+ Has Multiplayer (but is bare bones and has issues)+""Feels"" comfortable for anyone who's played Gal Civ II or M.O.O. before, yet adds new systems and depth.+ Turns are very fast. even in late game with tons of units and things going on. Huge plus+ Steam workshop support coming soon in patch 1.1 (not currently implemented in 1.01) + AI does a respectable job of making you feel like you are playing real humans (or aliens)+ Good writing, even amusing at timesCons:- Default races are a bit bland. - Battle viewer is somewhat simplified- No planetary invasion animation or battle viewer- $50 price tag- Multiplayer is crash prone at this time.

Kind of a mix of Civ5 and Sots2, or just a spacey type Civ if you're not familiar with Sots2. over 50 hours of gameplay in at this point and I'm still learning new things about the mechanics, very in depth system. Factions are well-balanced and you can create your own fully customized factions as well, as well as being able to create your own ships in every aspect. Several different tech trees and victory conditions. Bottom line, if you love 4x games and sci-fi settings, this game will work for you on several levels.

												Fans of previous galactic civilization games will find this game familiar.  The game has a smoother and more refined look than its predecessors, but its control is similar.  Start as a single planet, explore, colonize new planets, meet new races doing the same.  Victory conditions include conquest/diplomacy/influence/science/ascendancy.  The game has predesigned ships, but you can completely design your own (graphic as well as parts).  Thousands of mods available.  Galaxies are customizable in terms of size (tiny with dozens of stars to insane with ? thousands), variable amounts of races (2 to 100)/black holes/stars/good&bad planets/anomalies/pirates.   Your own race can be one of the stock races or completely customizable.  Also comes with a campaign mode, and other games can be played single player or multiplayer.  Highly recommended!			"

												If you liked GalCiv II, you will probably like this, though frankly, it's not that much better. Personally, even at more than double the price (even with both on sale), Stellaris is a better buy (not to mention Endless Space goes on sale all the time as well). That really pains me as a lifelong GalCiv player, but it's the sad truth. That said, if you're more into GalCiv's style than Paradox Grand Strategy, this is still GalCiv, and it'll definitely scratch that itch. I really wish Steam had a ""meh"" option. I really can't give a yes or no on this one, but since it is still GalCiv, it'll get a tenuous yes.			"

Posted: January 9, 2016
												Before you read my review, I'll just give my summary...It's a less-than mediocre strategy game for its time, and your best call is to wait for this game to plumit in price (to around $10) than paying anything more and investing any time in to it.Nothing spectacualr to report here.  I have played the previous games in this franchise, as well as their expansions.  While great games for their time, this just seems like a polished version of its most recent predecessor, with little addition of innovation or complexity (much like Civ:BE).   More so, the last incarnation of this game goes back to like 2008!  I really don't feel this game offers anything new, except for a massive upgrade in graphics and a campaign.  They still haven't caught up to Master Of Orion in the fact that you can choose to tactically conduct space battles, and they have even eliminated the animation aspect of planetary assaults/defenses.Let's start with the tutorial.  It's basically a medium map skirmish that refuses to offer insight in to the finer points of the game (it doesn't explain the mechanics behind all of the myriad ways to govern a planet or manage an empire towards one's goals).  So, you're basically left to figure that crap out for yourself.  In short, if you haven't played GC2 and figured out how that game works, you're pretty much boned because the mechanics appear identical.The campaign leaves way too much to be desired.  While I give props to Stardock for finally creating a campaign for their space strategy games, it is horrid when judged by any other metric.  It's only 3 scenarios long (I was hoping that each block of the campaign would have multiple scenarios), to begin.  Next, the first and third scenarios can be easily beaten if you just rush ahead with your uber-special capital ship.  This leads to being stagnated (technologically and/or economically) and viciously beaten by your opponent(s) if you don't just blindly rush ahead.  This takes any part of strategic planning out of the game.  Indeed, in the first campaign scenario, if you don't rush hard and relentlessly you're going to get overwhelmed by an A.I. that can see every action on the map and has a military production capabillity so diabolical that it would give Satan himself a raging boner.  As for the second campaign scenario, no matter how hard you rush, you're going to come across fortified planets.  It's basically a bunch of ships defending a planet that has stats so huge that you have to create a dozen (literally) orbiting war fleets to destroy, and that will take lots of time.  Alternatively, you can keep using turns to research better weapons/armor, but that will take even more time depending on your playing style (I've always prefered a tech-industry combo).  In any case, it's just sloppy game design.  The developers artificially force you to spend hours of real-time building armadas and researching specific techs just to conquer the last two planets on the map.Next on the list of how this game is stagnant of any innovation, the tech trees are exactly the same (completely linear).  So, when researching better ballistic armor, there's no benefit to pursuing that particular course other than getter better armor.  This forces you in a rock-papper-scissors gameplay.  While not bad in and of itself, the game forces you to go certain routes unless you want to be pummeled by a specific opponent with specialist tech designs.  I mean, really, is it so much to ask of modern strategy games that they look at synergy bonuses for tech?  For all the HD space this game takes up, almost none of it has gone in to expanding the scope of the strategy genre.  In closing, this game is just not worth it at the current time.  While it has the capability to be modded through the steam community (which is awesome!), it just reflects on the attitude of the designers: ""Buy this shiny, pretty thing and let the gamers add content to it!""  Don't spend a dime on this!  You're better off spending money on alcohol and pizza. "

												Overall, cannot reccomend. The game is at best only a marginal improvement over Gal Civ II. As of this writing in ver 1.4 I find the game will still crash and exit for no real noticeable reason on a well configured gaming system with 16 gigs of RAM (game is RAM hungry, which is probably good and allows large map play).Not often enough to make me mad like in teh early days of Endless Space, but still too often. The actual in ship combat is as primitive as it ever was, with no strategy involved. The actual fight screen is clunky and primitive. The Campaign is super short and not all that entertaining. The game does exceptionally little to advance the story line of the universe and there are LESS races to play as, even with the Snathi expansion DLC.4X games are something I love and while we all yearn for a real MOO II sucessor... well. In comparison to Endless Space, I don't find the game as featured or nearly as replayable. I probably had 365 real man days played in Gal Civ II and enjoyed it, but Gal Civ III is basically pretty much the same with less races. I think they blew the coding time on the multiplayer aspect and on getting the engine straightened out for potential sales to other developers. Oh - the planet management is practically useless, to win you have to micromanage, that's all there is to it.Overall, I'm a little annoyed that it seems less instead of more in comaprison to the previous release. Overall after putting in 200 ish hours of game play, I'm bored with it. Considering I hope for a lot more replayability from a 4x I'd have to say I'm unimpressed.			"

												Good 4x game.  It seems some of the deeper items from the earlier games are no longer included (mining, detailed veiwing of colonies/ships/starbases).  Overall I enjoy the game.  I still fire up GalCiv2 from time to time but this is definitely a modernized version that looks great.  Lots of updates in already and DLC (not my favorite).  I look forward to an Ultimate addition and I think it will hit all my points.			"

												Okay to start off: I played Gal Civ II - so I'm mostly going to  write the review as a migrating Gal Civ II player.What Gal Civ II had going for it was a great AI, but that seems to be gone in this game. The AI is definetly competitive in the sense that it's able to colonize the galaxy and expand pretty well, but it's not very dangerous necessarily - at least not in  the early to mid game. The AI - even the aggressive races will sometimes not attack - maybe because of their life support tech being poor? Or them forgoing  research of the exploration tech. Their reasons aren't clear to me. Sometimes it seems that the AI's are pretty slow at developing a military too and they get pretty cocky once they do develop a small military.An unwelcome addition is the addition of pirates. To be perfectly honest - in a game where the militaristic side is slow to develop - I don't think they're very necessary and they serve little purpose that I can see other than like in Civ being a nuisance and destroying your unescorted colony ships.The tech trees have also been more streamlined to follow the universally same structure between all the races. This makes the tech trees certainly less interesting and nothing like they were in the previous game but on  the other hand you don't need to make drastic changes to how you play races anymore and it's easier to get into the game from the beginning. They also set up a tech requirement that you need to research X amount of techs in your tech tree before you're allowed to advance to the next era. This is certainly nice as troop transports aren't availible until the second era: ""The Age of War"". This also means that civs can no longer shoot for distant techs spec strategies, like choosing a massive galaxy and just researching tech ascension. However there are only 3 Eras in the game so it's not a lot of gating going on here.Edit: Another thing I failed to mention is that I don't like the user interface at all, but I don't think it's so bad that it makes the game unplayable.However all these changes are sort of making Cal Civ III lose it's identity. How is this title supposed to compete as a space 4X game when it has very little that makes it unique? This makes the  game also very hard to recommend or not to recommend. But ultimately I feel that the game is enjoyable enough to say: Yeah! It's good enough.			"

												This is a great game to play, although there are still bugs to be fixed in the game. Bugs like when watching a battle you can see the eney station iring but not you own ships firing.The ship builder desigm feature is good but can be better as some of the red buttons you can see cannot b usedor sellected to place an item. Also I find that ihave not found the ability to build Huge ships even after researching all that is researchable. Doom ray turrets is the best gun I can Have, I wonder what ever happend to Phasers? and high energy Phasers.There is a problem with some planets not allowing soil the second planet upgrade so you lose two researched and placable squares on those planets.Also noticed that some races are able to create Large ships with massive fire power in one turn when they have only one or two planets left nd discover that those plnets have only one or no manufacturing capabilties.I have not figured out how an enemy can have much higher defense, resistance, and military values hen they have no defense structurs on their planet. Still I have created many different races and played them and won in easy and normal play. Next game will be in a harder mode.The major problem with Gal 3 is that It is addicticting. The other races tend to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off and I just have to stick around for a few more turns to wipe out the ships that attacked and UNARMED constructor.This game does need a better color scheme so individual parts can be colored to be specific to the new races that I have created.Congratulatios on a job well done!

												Can't recommend this game due to the following reasons.- Weird diplomacy -  it only depends on military power. You need to spam ships otherwise you become ""ripe for conquest"" and even the most peaceful races far away from your borders will declare war on you no matter what.- Poor and cheating ai.- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat - ships just smash into each other, thats it. It's not even possible to set missile ship to keep maximum firing distance for example.- Manufacturing prices balance is ridiculous, like one basic piece of shield can cost 9x times the whole hull it is built on. What the heck?And this game use tremendous amount of RAM, 6 GB at recommended is a joke.			"

												Really good game, definitely enjoying it. Kind of a mix of Civ5 and Sots2, or just a spacey type Civ if you're not familiar with Sots2. over 50 hours of gameplay in at this point and I'm still learning new things about the mechanics, very in depth system. Factions are well-balanced and you can create your own fully customized factions as well, as well as being able to create your own ships in every aspect. Several different tech trees and victory conditions. Bottom line, if you love 4x games and sci-fi settings, this game will work for you on several levels. Micro managers that love running every little detail will also love it.			"

												Not bad - still somewhat unsatisfying. I'm looking for the dev that will give the Witcher/Dragon Age/Mass Effect treatment to this genre. The campaign is meaningless - no story, no real characters, just 4k till the other guy drops. What's done is done fairly well, with the exception of the ship designer. That may come as a surprise to many, but consider that the design tool is complex, tedious to use - and most problematically - totally irrelevant to winning or losing the game. The best games understand that, to engage players in game activities that aren't strictly necessary to win, there needs to be some reward in terms of the gameplay itelf to motivate the extra work. Here there is none. Grade: B-			"

												After peaking in to the beta from time to time and then taking a brief look at the campaign, I decided to get a real feel for the game by creating a random map labeled ""Insane"" in size and populating it with all of the major races and several of the minor races, too. A bit over 50 hours of Normal gameplay later, my Terrans won a technological victory by completing the Ascension gate. Why does this matter to you? It was INSANE! (Said so when I set up the game.) And it was a helluva tutorial.The game is a solid evolution from its predecessors rather than a revolution. I experienced no obvious bugs. All in all, with its insanely sized maps and very friendly UI and empire-management tools, Galactic Civilizations III seems to set the new standard for 4X space empire-building games. There are certainly opportunities to be had by deepening portions of the game through expansions, which Stardock no doubt will do. But the game is fun enough as-is that I encourage you to jump into the experience now if you like the genre. At least, that's my opinion from playing my introductory, 50-hour tutorial game.			"

												In my opinion this game is definately not ready for release as a finished game. It has far too many issues to just accept that it has teething troubles. I accept that the developers are continuously dealing with problems as they are raised but to me it should not have been released as anything other than a beta with all the outstanding issues.The actual concept is great and if the developers do eventually ever deliver a product which matches the rhetoric, I believe it will be a great game however as it currently stands, it is impossible for me to recommend it.Only the extremely patient should even consider buying this game. You will have to be patient waiting for the developers to deliver the things that were said to be features that made this game special, such as smarter AI rather than just bonused AI. Some bonuses, such as AI seeing entire map (ie.where best to colonize, harvest resources and all movements of competitors) are ridiculous!Unfortunately you will also have to be patient in regard to not having adequate sorting or filtering tools. What this means in practise is that if you play on a large map, when it gets to late game stage, when you have several hundred colonies, shipyards and ships, it can easily take over an hour to complete one turn because you have to scroll thru so many ships to find the ones you want to build.An inadequate guide is also frustrating. Try using the guide to find out which are the buildings you can only build one of!The quickest way to find out is by trial and error!To summarise I would advise anyone considering the game to view the forums and wait until they see that most of the issues are dealt with before they make the purchase.

												The TL:DR version is: It's pretty meh.The slightly more detailed review is that Gal Civ 3 is a space 4x that ticks all the boring and mundane boxes that a space 4x can tick.It's not innovative. Its races aren't asymetrical and interesting. It's essentially a prettier version of Gal Civ 2.While I can't find anything bad to say about it apart from the fact that space combat is still just as unimpressive as before, I also can't find anything that really wows me to praise about it besides the pretty ships you can make in the ship editor.You plonk down buildings on your colony surface in a hex grid and can obtain small bonuses for placing certain buildings next to each other, or on certain tiles with special properties. This is supposed to make colony development really exciting and intricate, but it's not a system that exactly requires a super brain to figure out or use.Exploration is supposed to be much improved in this version but it honestly is just as boring as ever. I had a game where I surveyed 6 anomalies in a stretch and all I got was various small sums of money (10, 40, 25, 60, 8, 14 credits).Diplomacy is also very uninspiring. It's the standard fare diplomatic options that so many 4xs have done in the past. The United Planets (the Galactic UN) offers some interesting resolutions that you can vote on, but these are  not impressive or frequent enough to make the game's diplomacy anything special.The space 4x RTS Star Ruler 2 has way more interesting things to see and do and discover than Gal Civ 3 (I mean exploration in that game can net you a planet killer dreadnaught). That's kind of sad when you consider the studio behind this game.The Gal Civ series is one of the most overrated 4x series I can think of. And this is from a person that really does enjoy other titles from Stardock and enjoys space 4x games in general. The most I can say is that if you liked Gal Civ 2, you'll likely like this game as well. And if so...then buy and enjoy.			"

Early Access Review
								Galactic Civ III a game with potential.First of all there is a lot of "" its is not a beta this is an alfa"" comments in the community. Most of these ""opinions"" ( we can't call them a ""review"" because the resons these people give is ""because i played alot of betas in the past"". That may be so but that is something nobaody can verify) saying this; "" It is not a beta it's an alfa blah blah blah because i say so"". Nobody is talking about gameplay, graphics etc ( no that is not true 99.999999998% isn't talking about graphics, gameplay etc)I'm not going to educate you how it needs to be so if you are harping on about the alfa or beta BS go somewhere else.Now about Galactic civ III: graphics looks good even at the lowest setting. The developers did spruce up the interfaces and modernaised them but not soo much that you get the feeling you are playing a completely different game.Gameplay; So far I haven't encountered ANY bugs or lags or things of that nature. The only ""bad thing"" is that when a planet has been upgraded and fully built up you have to search a bit how you need to continue ( for me that is the fun part.. but if you are really stuck on this you can look it up on goolge or on the forum here in steam). Conclusion: Galactic civ III does have excellent potential and the developers did a good job so far. If the developers ignore the posts about ""this isnt a beta this is an alpha because blah blah blah"" and focus in on the  people that write about gameplay and what they possibly want to see changed or what they find cumbersome etc the game will be great when it's finished.Let me also thank the developers for this early access. that way we both can have some feedback on the workings of the game. I didn't want a Rome 2 debacle happen again. I did buy Rome 2 because it was so hyped up (and it was a 3 tiered thingy where you got extra games when you pre ordered it). On the release date  there were bugs, crashes and a whole bunch of other problems (even with the activation key) On top of that Rome 2 didn't deliver  what they said, though after 25 gigs of patches and updates it is getting there.

												I spent £30 on it on its release date. I personally dont think the game is worth half that. I refunded it during the summer sales and bought 8 games which I must say are much better than this. Negative Points:- When I played the game, no private multiplayer so I was playing with 2 of my friends and then randoms. - No instructions on how to use custom races when playing multiplayer.- Poor tutorial so never knew how to play it.- Maps in games can be too small or too big, in this game the maps were too big.- When you think you have found a planet that you can colonize and then relise your coloniser ship cant go that far out.- Turns take to long as the turn system is (in my opinion) set out wrong and players should all make their turns at the same time, not seperately.Good Points:- The game had good potential if they make the right decisions.- If you spent the time recearching the game it might be more enjoyable			"

I bought the game, and installed it, started it up. Got into the game on looked around the options menu a bit and twisted a knob here and there, then i restarted the game as it wanted. and the it started crashing. So i searched the interwebs, for a solution, which i found. So i deleted everything GC3 on my computer as it suggested. This and a new install of the game, got me into the game again, and this time i started the tutorial, and it was great, loved it. Then the dang sleepy eyes kicked in, and off to bed i went.Then i woke up this morning, and wanted to play again, but dangit it started crashing again. Therefor until that is fixed i am unfortunatly gonna give it a thumbs down.			"

												I've always enjoyed and appreciated the Galactic Civilizations series. While Stardock's 4x series was not the most sophisticated implementation, it was always well done. The AI in particular has remained stellar. In fact it was the only AI in a 4x game that I knew of that without cheating, could beat a skilled player. Galactic Civilizations III feels like a remake and has been a real let-down. I beat my first game on normal difficulty, not knowing the rules. The AI is nearly passive. The campain can hardly be called such. The game feels like a rushed job, not much fun, and has derailed Stardock's track record of stellar AI.			"

												I found the Lack of tactical control irritating. As the Ai for my ships are rather dumb in battles, like I lose all ships and do almost no damage because they spread fire accross the whole enemy fleet. instead of concentrating fire.  The graphics are prettier in 3 but enjoyed playing Galactic Civilizations two more.  At least 2 had some tactical control			"

												7/10 ... wait for 3 years before all the expansions come out, as at the moment its a bare shell of a ""game"" to avoid disappointing anyone. A lot of aspects have been either removed, damped down or half implemented. In essence, at the moment it's more of a nice graphical upgrade of Galactic Civilizations II (9.5/10) with promise of greater things to come due to the new engine. P.S. Star Dock, please, get rid of this stupid rule of 5 spaces per star base - it makes strategic planning really stupid and mechanical.I'll review this game again after more patches come out or maybe DLCs.

												I was a big fan of Gal Civ 2, but this one can be frustrating. The AI is such that you basically will have to follow a walkthrough or guide and slavishly follow a pre-defined strategy to have any chance against it. In short, the balance isn't where it should be, particularly if you're coming to this from Civ 5. Otherwise, fun game, with lots of potential.* Edit * I was finally able to win this game, albeit after getting some helpful tips. In particular, you need to ""specialize"" planets (research, wealth, or manufacturing) instead of the generalist approach I was taking. It's also essential to customize your ships.All of my previous negatives were forgotten when I was finally able to bring the pain to my assorted enemies. Woohoo!			"

												Improvements:- most important new feature is the hexagon field as in Civ5- the graphic has been adjusted in time, completely revised - the ship models look really nice - the battles with large fleets are spectacular- the ship's designer works even better than in Gal Civ2 - the game is stable and relatively bug free- the AI makes a better impression- the menu navigation is comfortable - strategic resourcesNegatives comparing to GalCiv2- lack of fractions: Arceans, Drath Legion, Torian Confederation, Korx Consortium missing - espionage and sabotage missing- changing forms of government and rebellionsThe game makes fun and I enjoy playing it. Especially graphically better than Gal Civ 2 , but missing main races, espionage, bad or good goverment feedback			"

												Minimum Specs are bare minimun and you will be LOCKED out of some options. The game devs do not tell you this ahead of time.Be warned before you buy that if you have the minimum specs for this game you will NOT be able to play map sizes greater than Tiny (I'm sitting at 3.4 out of 3.5GB available). This was something they did back in the beta just this strictly and loosened it after complaints. I believe I got all the way to Large or Huge before the change but I could never go higher so the restrictions have always been there. I was happy and enjoyed the game with those maps. I don't need the absolutely massive Gigantic and Insane sizes.  Nearly one hundred hours played in the game and at least 7 months later they changed their minds again. So, I am now unable to play map sizes that I previously had access to. With no real warning.Now, I enjoyed my time with it (especially if you just want to play more GalCiv) but it never satisfied that one more turn urge like GalCiv2. Some people have their issues and I am not up to date on the most recent changes of 2.0. I just wanted to warn people about this and I just don't have the heart to give it a shot right now with that restriction in place. Maybe it'll change but for now I can't.			"

												If you've played any GalCiv games, you are pretty much going to feel at home here. There are some minor changes here and there, but ultimately this is still the game you know and love. There seems to be some hiccups in multiplayer(peer to peer crashes), and occasionally the game is unstable and crashes with no warning. This is rare however, and I don't think it ruins the game. Overall, I would say give it a go. It's not a perfect game, but every update has been making it better, and it's a lot of fun.			"

												The interface is clunky with many truly annoying dialogs and buttons to do things which could have been achieved with a right click. But that is minor. The recommended settings are for 6GB RAM and an i5 cpu. What crap that is. Dial down the settings and you just might get it to not exhibit stuttering. I'm using an 8GB i7 quad and even with small display and no extra graphics features it chugs and stutters. I did turn off a lot of those useless windows 10 'features' which improved the user experience to barely playable, but even with minimal services, the game is not a pleasure to play.In the 1.4 hours of playing I found little but tedium and a lack of connect with my worlds or ships. Couple this with an engine that clunks. Nah. Forget it. The UI is really terrible. And its a 5.7 GB downlaod but who really cares about that hey?I truly wanted GalCiv III to work for me as I did play the previous versions which seemed to be more fun and certainly didn't stutter on whatever shitbox I played on 10 years ago. And the options hint at it being really awesome...But honestly it chugs and is a horrible experience, which is why I cannot recommend it.Anyway, I think the issues with GalCiv are endemic in all 4X's I have played recently, in fact since Moo2, all have many, if not all, of these defects:1) Poorly Implemented and inefficient so end game chug inevitable2) Half-baked with few core features and DLC to flesh it out3) Mindless micromanagement4) Uninteresting maps and features5) Moronic AI which doesn't scale and the engine cheats on their behalf 6) Trivial victory conditions7) Bug-ridden crapEven Moo2 had issues, but I liked the Ship Design and Combat and also shipping all my colonists into the sun and replacing them with android scientists for what I called the 'Android Takeover'. This is after you have herded all the other races in the game onto size 3 worthless rocks to be watched over by a single scout.A 4x engine which let players sculpt their own maps interactively, scale their empire from simple dirt farmers to intergalactic horse traders whilst allowing them to define their own winning conditions and an AI that is wickedly smart and learns from each game the player plays. And doesn't require a supercomputer, is not encumbered with 'Early release, let's patch it with DLC' syndrome and has adequate Fun Factor Index from start to finish without requiring a Doctorate in Philosphy (Gaming) to play.Well I can dream can't I?

I've put in about 36 hours as of this review and I plan on putting in quite a bit more. The sheer scale of the maps and vast tech tree are just a couple of reasons I'll keep coming back to this game. The series brought back memories of the hours I dumped into MOO 2 as a kid. They've done a great job with this one, and it's well worth the money.			"

												I'm a huge fan of the civilization franchise and have been playing it for years.  CIV5 remains the best!  GCiv3 is a disapointment.  The game launches and leaves you on your own to figure out the mechanics.  There are no manuals or in-game help files.  The technology tree is overbloated and again leaves you guessing what they mean.  After a few days, you will realize that just about the only strategy is to rush early on empty planets and that pretty much locks the game.  I have uninstalled the game on day 4 and wished I could get a refund :(This game is not worth the high price - you are clearly paying for the name and nothing else.			"

They did have an amazing mechanic I wish was in other space sims a very flushed out and intricate customization of individual ships in your fleet from color, shape, cockpit, engines, guns (mostly aesthetic from what I could tell but still very cool). fun to make your TIE Fighters and X-Wings.

												A great 4X game all in all - Although you may want to hold off a bit if you're coming from it's predecessor, Galactic Civilizations 2. It is still a bit barebones in some areas like Diplomacy/Espionage but they seem committed to adding all of those features down the road as free content patches while expanding on existing mechanics through DLC and Expansions.Is it fun?Yes, definitely.Is it pretty?As pretty as you can expect a 4X to be - And then some.Replayability?Oh yes - You can create your own races with unique traits and give them personalities so the AI will play them as you intended. The game also features a very robust Ship Designer tool, which lets you design your own ships from scratch. The sheer size of the larger maptypes means you can create games that will potentially last you for weeks - Not unlike that of Distant Worlds with up to (and potentially beyond) a hundred or more unique races provided your hardware is up to the task.Campaign - In a 4X?I'm not entirely sold on this concept - While it works in some games better than others, it is definitely more of a lore introduction / tutorial campaign than a full on campaign as you would expect from a series like Heroes: Might and Magic, or Age of Empires. It's short but serves as a great springboard into the meat and potatoes of the game - Sandbox games.On a final note - The developers are very active with the community, taking lots of feedback and suggestions from forum posts and livestream comments. These are definitely people who care about the genre and the game - It's not just about the bottom line.			"

												When it works without crashing, it's a great game.  Very similar to GalCiv 2 but with more bells and whistles, so fans of the previous games won't be disappointed.  Unfortunately, the early versions seem to be having problems with random crashes which don't appear to be avoidable when you reload an auto-save file.  The crash might not always happen at the exact same time, but you seem to get to a point where having one becomes close to unavoidable.  The fact that it doesn't always happen at the same time is disconcerting because it could mean it will take a while for the devs to pin down the exact cause.Very good game, but I'd recommend waiting until a few patches have been released (the first one didn't fix this).

The diplomacy options are very limited. The design system looks amazing but there is no info on how to use it.  The reporting is really good. The tutorial really poor.

Any issues this game had in the past are all resolved.   This game runs smoother than 99% of all the other games out there.  If you have an issue, look no further than the mirror.  Enough said.			"

												I bought this game the day it came out, it was expensive, lacking content and buggy. I still enjoyed it, I liked creating my own ships and building an empire.Anyhow, I figured I would let it sit a few months for those post-release patches to come along and things up. However, before anything like that really happened the first DLC was released. Then some more. Then some more!! What?! I paid so much for this game the day it came out, and now you want me to pay more already? It's either that or play an incomplete game, right?Well, screw you. I'll continue to play Gal Civ III, but NOT on Steam. And with ALLL the DLC. ;) .for free.Super greedy devs.			"

												Best spaced-based strategy game now gets even bigger and better in the 4X 64-bit world of today. I played GC2 quite alot, but am even more impressed witht the size and scope Stardock has made for its 3rd installment of the series. Layers of details and posibilities, genormous maps and customization of ships as vast as spce! So glad to see this title as it evolved from Beta to now and eager for all the add-ons and ehanceements to come, it already has proven itself all over again! Worthy of the name 'best strategy title' FOREVER!			"

												love the game but there are some things that need to be changed like the level of the people or ai your versing well to be honest the whole game needs to change really because what you find valuable as a human is not going to be valuable to some alien race i think a lot of you game makers watched far too much tv or some thing. Honestly find out about space water is everywhere out there it is a planet killer nitrogen is a key to life, i mean there is so much data you could have used but oh well i can dream i suppose where someone puts out an intelligent game based on facts not someone elses imagination.

												The game has lost many aspects from Galactic Civilization II,  by trying to do more complicated 3D ship design.. That's useless other than looks but now is required to work with....   It made an awful experience the ship building forced in custom races is terrible addition even though they are superfictical you can not easily upgrade or change designs.  Your basically designing ships in 3D mode constantly after every tech upgrade.  All I want to do is upgrade for example adjust a gun or engine I am struggling with a very bad 3D editor to make a ship which previously would of been almost autoconstructed for me.  Now I am having to deal with this 3d model which isn't even fun, there is no way for me to skip designing 3d ship model and simply pick ship upgrades automatically or simply upgrade, I have to go around a 3d ship model adding items.  To top off the rest of the game it's same as Galactic Civilization II but a lot more tech trees that basically seem to do nothing much, but if you want to know difference I was so fustrated by this versions changes I decided to try to warn others not to purchases this even though I love the previous editions.  I am old I am played the first galactica and civilization first edition.   If your thinking about this game buy the 2nd edition,  it's a much better game.     I loved 2nd one replayed many times with many different galaxies but this latest one I quit first game in mid-game after 4 hrs.  I will probably never played it again.  The tech trees are ridiculously long, your defensive tatics seem unimposing, aliens are all agressive nontrade war races.   I won't be buying the next edition of this game again until I see a youtube video of ship building basically reworked and some real inivative things. Showing me I can skip what I call boring and annoying part of the game or autoupgrade my ships easly saving my ship designs.			"

												Essentially ""Civilization"" in space, but with more features. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys turn based strategy.Pros:Takes many existing features from the Civilization series and improves upon them, then inserts into a space scify setting. No longer shall your units ""bump"" into each other only to have numbers subtracted from their health. The ability customize your fleet both in aesthetics and equipment is fantastic. This allows you to come up with a unique strategy or preference on how you wish to do battle. Although you can not control the ships during combat, being able to set the AI beforehand (during ship construction) adds a dynamic which makes observing your handiwork during the battle all the more rewarding (or dissapointing).The planetary construction is fun and very strategic as well. In order to achieve a maximum result buildings must be placed in certain locations as each building provides a bonus to buildings on surrounding tiles. This, coupled with natural reources on the planet (which also provide bonus to surrounding tiles) makes designing your planet a fun experience rather than a chore.The game is acually quite beautiful. The maps are not just static ""space"" there are nebulae and other such obstruction which add both a tactical and aesthetic value. Additionally, the actual space battles are quite fun to watch, with missiles, lasers and railgun fire I never get tired of viewing them.  Cons:I wish planetary defense buildings had more of an effect. While invading a planet the attackers seem to have a huge upper hand. The tutorial does not give a lot of information which I think is essential. After probably about 30 hours of gameplay I still can not figure out how the base production or research value of my planet is derived. Hovering over them gives no information other than what modifiers are effecting the base value. I should not have to go searching around the internet in order to determine how such an important value is determined. It is possible a missed something back in the tutorial but it is not overty apparent in game how this value is set.Game still has some glitches. Although these usually do not interfere with the gameplay, it can be annoying. Most of them seem to be in the UI, but I have had a couple crashes to desktop. I am not sure yet if that is from the game or from my RAM issue (see below).More ""base"" model ships to pick from would be great. When designing a ship there are only about 5 for each size category and some of them look very similar.Notes:This game requires more RAM than I had expected. I am currrently using 4gb of RAM on windows 8 and I have constant problems with freezing especially the longer the game goes on. Also important to note you CAN NOT play on the largest size maps without at least 6gb of RAM. It simply will not let you start the game. I highly recommend at least 8gb of RAM to take full advantage of the game.Overall great game with lots of replayability! Also I have not tried mutiplayer yet so am unable to comment. "

												A very fun and addicting game with enough functions to make planetary specialization be important but not carved in stone.  Just because a planet is research-primary does not mean you can't shave off an extra turn on that all-so-important colony ship by concentrating the local populace on manufacturing.  Very well done!  The ship designer utility is not a vanity tool.  There are vanity points in it, but in harder difficulties you need to design ships to defeat the enemy(s) you are fighting against.  Drengin like rockets.  Prepare your ships under contruction to deal with that and your enemy will be hard pressed to resist your ""influence"".The only gripes I have are:1. The galaxy is weirdly unrealistic.  Although, if it was realistic, antimatter would be even harder to find:/2. That mini-map...  Its functional, but very small colored dots showing my planets/fleets don't show up too well when showing my zone of control.  A slight bother, but not too bad.			"

												This is what I've been looking for in a space 4X game.  I find that in most, the emphasis is placed on the military, with other aspects put in as afterthoughts.  There is a balance in aspects that give it an air or realism.  The ship designer is easy to use  and allows one to create truley unique and beautiful craft.  The designers put their hearts into this game and it shows.			"

												First time playing it and I enjoy it other than the pace. In reality its like CIV5 in space with more. The ship battles are okay, but you're just spectating the battle and have no interaction which is okay.The custom ships are cool as you can make your own with your own models and same with civs with your own back grounds and portraits and so forth or just use stock. Limited to MASS on ships and limited to ship sizes of tiny, small, medium, large, and cargo at least that Ive seen.Ive played the same INSANE size galaxy now for 4 hours, got in 4 battles lost 3, won 1. Now it starts to get laggy later on and upon quitting the program I noticed it was using 8.6gb (out of 12gb TOTAL) of RAM for its self. My guess is either its UNITY 5 which explains that or a custom engine that is eating RAM like no other but supports 64bit and is a 64bit application so thats nice.Its an alright 4x game, but dont expect things to go fast unless you set the galaxy size smaller and the speed of research/building on fast.B+, Id recommend if you're into CIV5 or the like.

												So this is my first GalCiv game and I have to say I'm impressed with how it works, it reminds me very much like the early sid meier civ games with some of the decision making you have to make during initial planetary colonization and random events.I'm still early days as I'm not nearly half way through my first campaign but some how have 5 hours logged, and I'm loving every second, it feels like a breath of fresh air compared to the civ games.The only cons I can think of I will list below, other than that I can honestly review this as a 9/10 gameCons:When governing a planets production and trying to min max, the planets turn timers for production outputs and so forth aren't refreshed and yo have to exit and reclick the planet for the turn timers to update.At some point the strategic resources took up a place in the UI that overlaps the diplomacy button, I can no longer trade or talk to other civs with that UI in the way. (EDIT: This has been fixed, the game warned me about my screen resolution so I edited it from the desktop and this problem is fixed.)			"

Performance on very large maps with multiple AI is terrible after playing for quite a while.          Close and load again and it will be better.          Some bug and glitches          There are a few really annoying one.          1) Game tends to wait permanently at enemy turn when it gets into late game.          2) Hitting something and clicking eject on another fleet results in a visual bug.               Your ships get cloned and if you try to hit with it, nothing happens and it also leads to 1).

												This is a very good game, I highly recommed it, however here are a few things to consider first.  1) You need to purchase all the DLC's and make sure you are starting with the 1.5 patch.  2) Then make a visit to YouTube and watch some video's on specific game play.  These have been very helpful for me, it has explained a lot of the game to me, the manual is wofefully inadequate for the depth of this game.  3) Prepare to do at least 3 restarts of the game maybe about 30-40 turns each this is again for you to get the feel of it and try things out that weren't explained well in the manual 4) And finally just give it a chance to ""sink in"" because once it does ""sink in"" you will enjoy it a great deal.The graphics are sweet and the maps are very interesting (especially with the Precursor DLC)   So in conclusion get the game just be prepared to put some time into it before the game ""reveals"" itself to you.

												Basically Civ 5 in space! When they say insane galaxy size, they mean insane. Spent the last two weeks playing through a game where i was filled with a manifest destiny impulse to have one big unified empire spread to each of the six corners of the mini map. Sadly playing against max ai, they not only got in the way, they treated me like space North Korea and eventually like space Iraq...maybe should be more diplomatic next time...Oh and spent at least 20 of those hours in the ship designer fine tuning each of my designs with the little lego man in my head screaming ""SPASHAP! SPASHAP! SPASHAP!!!""Pros: -Massive galaxies and uber AI can turn this into a pretty epic space 4x adventure. -Customize the look of your faction and space ships and stations using modular parts from every race to your own tastes.Cons:-AI can be a bit too uber and overrun your territory.-Late game can get really laggy with so many planets discovered and ships on the board.

												its kinda like civ: BE minus the price tag and blatant copy paste from civ 5 (but in space this time), from your humble start you have total control, wanna play nice use flower power to subdue your foes, or will you become space hitler and create your perfect galactic master race, its totally up to you.many unique features-ship designer-hours of fun to create whatever you desire and theres generally no limits to what you can create (no EA fun limits here)-no censor- most aaa games will now censor everything you do but you can name almost everything whatever you want.-mod haven--ships can have what looks like a giant weiner on them that 'shoots'--isnt designed by aaa companies--as of current excellent developer feedback-cons.combat is a bit weak and slightly boring can be confusing sometimesnot designed for lower spec PC (this game uses more resources than BF4 on OCD lvl) N.B my pc runs this with 3,9 gig (yes its old)slightly unbalanced on some aspects (especially morale in large empires)micromanagement nightmare^^^turns become very long very quicklymicromanagement nightmare^I do NOT recommend this game for those with OCD or those who believe in perfection			"

												So this is my first GalCiv game and I have to say I'm impressed with how it works, it reminds me very much like the early sid meier civ games with some of the decision making you have to make during initial planetary colonization and random events.I'm still early days as I'm not nearly half way through my first campaign but some how have 5 hours logged, and I'm loving every second, it feels like a breath of fresh air compared to the civ games.The only cons I can think of I will list below, other than that I can honestly review this as a 9/10 gameCons:When governing a planets production and trying to min max, the planets turn timers for production outputs and so forth aren't refreshed and yo have to exit and reclick the planet for the turn timers to update.At some point the strategic resources took up a place in the UI that overlaps the diplomacy button, I can no longer trade or talk to other civs with that UI in the way. (EDIT: This has been fixed, the game warned me about my screen resolution so I edited it from the desktop and this problem is fixed.)			"

												The game is really nice, and I like a lot of things: + Overall economy... great, just great!+ Resources, very nicely done, could be more of them + Planet management, the fact that you can build more buildings of the same type and they add up for bonuses, you can specialize your colonies+ starbases and bonuses from them, very cool!+- Ship designer... looks very good, but perhaps too much time invested in that, it doesn't really help sooo much that your ship looks good. What I think would turn this into a perfect 4x space game: - Space Battles: turn based (my favourite) or RTS but something that you can control. With the option of ""quick battle"". There are a lot of people that need tactics to compensate for less numbers or less tech. A lot of battles are won by tactics alone- Ground battles... it's like rolling a dice, sorry but that's not cutting it. I'd like something where a good tactician can get their♥♥♥♥♥out of trouble with skill alone and without numbers and advantages- Diplomacy is not really the best, no transparency- Did I miss espionage somehow???- techtree could be longer, I hate 4xgames where you run out of things you can research, that not really realistic- Flawed game concept: Shields defend only agains beams... really? Shields should count as an add-on that defends against everything, and then armor afterwards. ECM (chaff and stuff like that) helps only agains missiles that's right. The system is flawed and it was always flawed in GalCiv series... I would change it!			"

												The game is good. Customization is difficult without a middle mouse button. An arrow key or wasd  feature should be added so that you can move the ship around in three dimensions. Multiplayer definitely needs some work and the ai needs a little tweaking when it comes to being smarter. Instead of buffs, they should be smarter about how they utilize their tiles. game is lots of fun save the crashes. Crashes ruin multiplayer. Great 4x game with amazing potential, the next update should really iron out some of these issues. If we had in game and in lobby multiplayer chat it would improve the gal civ community.

												Overall really enjoyed the game so far, the ability to create custom races and design ships from the ground up is ideal for someone who loves to take a personal edge in the game, the combat is well balanced and difficulty scales very nicely for new players, one issue for me is the seeming lack of overall variety in cookie cutter ideolgies, AI behave the same in their interactions if their both Malevolent/Pragmatic/Benevolent, the real differences comes from their starting worlds and race traits, still definetely reccomend it at a 9/10 though, solid all the way through with GREAT replayability in the custom race aspect.

												Having an absolute blast messing around with this game. After trying (and failing) to get into Galciv 2, I am well deep into #3 and find it much easier to grasp.I will warn you though that you should take the time to outfit your own ships. Use the pre-designs for the ship ""look"" but trust me, kitting out a destroyer with a load of Stingers and Ion drives will make you smile.7 out of 10. Not the greatest strat 4X I've ever played but is only about the 4th that has managed to distract me from Civ4 for any period of time. I'll be dumping hours into this game for the forseeable future; and, having experience playing stardock games (Sins of a Solar Empire) I know they'll be adding and refining this game for years to come			"

												This game is a lot of fun and has plenty of potential if it is updated further.  The basic gameplay mechanics are fun and is very entertaining if you play militarily.  Many of the problems in this game lie in diplomacy.  I found the game nearly impossible to understand playing it from a diplomatic angle.  For example there are diplomacy points that you supposedly gain from researching certain techs and building embassies.  I still have yet to see any effect of these diplomacy points in my interaction with other races, and there is no concrete change to my standing with them.  When I trade with other factions, I often can't propose any treaties without any explanation why.  There are also many minor annoying bugs like the income slider changing rates slightly without using it, and certain technologies not doing what they are supposed to (research treaty is one example I can think of). A very major (and ridiculous) problem I've encountered with the game is United Planets voting.  The AI is incompetent in this regard.   In one game I played, all of my allies voted for an enemy (who we were ALL at war with) giving the enemy a stat boost.  I like this game and have enjoyed playing it, however, I would recommend holding off on buying it until it is further polished.			"

												Great Game.  Things I would have like to have been in the game. Spying. Ground troops that are not a part of the population. Previous politcal system with your empires senate was great. I also liked that you could previously get man on the street type comments in the individual planet sections. Also a list of uncolonized planets that are colonizable. a list of planets controlled by other empires would also be very useful. Other than those small things this is a really really great game. Far better than the other Space empire games released in recent years.			"

												Essentially ""Civilization"" in space, but with more features. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys turn based strategy.Pros:Takes many existing features from the Civilization series and improves upon them, then inserts into a space scify setting. No longer shall your units ""bump"" into each other only to have numbers subtracted from their health. The ability customize your fleet both in aesthetics and equipment is fantastic. This allows you to come up with a unique strategy or preference on how you wish to do battle. Although you can not control the ships during combat, being able to set the AI beforehand (during ship construction) adds a dynamic which makes observing your handiwork during the battle all the more rewarding (or dissapointing).The planetary construction is fun and very strategic as well. In order to achieve a maximum result buildings must be placed in certain locations as each building provides a bonus to buildings on surrounding tiles. This, coupled with natural reources on the planet (which also provide bonus to surrounding tiles) makes designing your planet a fun experience rather than a chore.The game is acually quite beautiful. The maps are not just static ""space"" there are nebulae and other such obstruction which add both a tactical and aesthetic value. Additionally, the actual space battles are quite fun to watch, with missiles, lasers and railgun fire I never get tired of viewing them.  Cons:I wish planetary defense buildings had more of an effect. While invading a planet the attackers seem to have a huge upper hand. The tutorial does not give a lot of information which I think is essential. After probably about 30 hours of gameplay I still can not figure out how the base production or research value of my planet is derived. Hovering over them gives no information other than what modifiers are effecting the base value. I should not have to go searching around the internet in order to determine how such an important value is determined. It is possible a missed something back in the tutorial but it is not overty apparent in game how this value is set.Game still has some glitches. Although these usually do not interfere with the gameplay, it can be annoying. Most of them seem to be in the UI, but I have had a couple crashes to desktop. I am not sure yet if that is from the game or from my RAM issue (see below).More ""base"" model ships to pick from would be great. When designing a ship there are only about 5 for each size category and some of them look very similar.Notes:This game requires more RAM than I had expected. I am currrently using 4gb of RAM on windows 8 and I have constant problems with freezing especially the longer the game goes on. Also important to note you CAN NOT play on the largest size maps without at least 6gb of RAM. It simply will not let you start the game. I highly recommend at least 8gb of RAM to take full advantage of the game.Overall great game with lots of replayability! Also I have not tried mutiplayer yet so am unable to comment. "

												I am an old GC fan.Mixed bag, mainly good from this game. I'm not going to lie about this. So pros+ Improved science - no longer can you have it all.+ Improved building options on a planet.+ Better battles, scale matters so far. A huge ship is actually huge.And the cons- Still one hell of a hard killing ground on how many can live on a planet without slamming down pleasure domes all over the place.- Hard to determine what to research next, no real map of what gives what or in what order.- No tactical battles, have the right mix ready or it'll be a sad day.As a new player, you'll be a generalist by virtue of having to slowly research all trees at the same time, your colonies will be of the same caliber, all the same to avoid nasty surprises and your ships will be much the same, all kinds of defences and one of each guntype.It's not a horrificly steep learning curve but it is long. You should like 4X games to enjoy this. The best way to avoid weird losses is to turn off victory conditions and play on beginner level a few times to get into the groove of things.On a side note, a few things.There are more things in space now that makes it interesting, including pirates and resources of various kinds. In a way it makes space feels less empty and even in the early days of your game you have to focus on some ships which can fight back or there'll be some consequences. Nothing to hard but it pays to build a little more than just colonisers and constructors.Also, the fact that constructors can build shipyards helps with some opponents you wish to remove. Which now actually makes a little more sense to me as well as they are easier to manage. The designer however has taken a hit as it no longer has that neat pre-defined hull but an invisible box which leaves gaps in your design if you don't watch it. That is the cost for having complete freedom to make it up as you wish. It does however leave you with a problem, is your ship going to be animated to go sideways or worse, backwards?Then there is the ideology twist, it's a neat way of adding some flavour to the game and your race. It's a nice touch but the game doesn't feel as empty as before but on the other hand. It also has some effects that are interesting, short and long term.In short, some improvements from the last -  some annoyances left. Overall - solid game and gameplay.			"

I have to play incredible or above for a competitive AI. but hard AI only win by bonuses. the AI research advance like 10 ages ahead of you. so the only possible way to win is to play nice with everyone and grind for same level tech by almost end game, and then win in a blink...generally no fun at all. I agree with bonuses for AI for a challenge. but at least the tech level should not be so far ahead. right now, I can not wage war againt anyone before end game since the huge tech difference. so all the tech, all the weapons in between is ignored. only end game ships are actually used by me. a more constant challenge game with continious conflicts sounds more fun to me.

												   No real difference between GC3 and GC2 might as well purchase the cheaper GC2. A much larger focus should have been put into how the planets are managed; the current simplicity aspect is annoying to true civ fans. Wormholes are one of the least enjoyable aspects of the game in that it's only purpose is to force player vessels to meet and greet other civs while removing surveyor ships from play. Another aspect of utter annoyance is the blocking factor of asteroids, worlds, starbases etc. The game is supposed to mimic space exploration and yet the game system is dominated by a 2D travel aspect. Guess what? if asteroids are in your direction of travel in space all you have to do is go up or down it's rather easy to escape an asteroid field in space especially since they conform to gravitational bands around the object they are orbiting and yet the spaceship, per typical sci-fiction capabilities, does not. This game should have been so much more especially with today’s computer power. It should have been a more modular game in that the player should have been allowed the type of play he/she would like to enjoy (such as more control over world management with smaller tiles and the ability to manipulate the planet builds more. Stacking of ships onto solid objects since space is 3D and the allowing the player to choose whether he/she wants to enter the object or not. An emphases on mining/utilizing all asteroids even dead worlds for mineral required resources (Oh, by the way current research is showing for as many worlds found around stars there should be 20% in deep space between the stars)). I will say that I enjoy the game about as much as the original GC2 but since there is little difference between the two I have am starting to get bored with GC3 already. There are a few better items, special resources, better A.I., improved diplomacy but for all its benefits, in my mind, they do not make up for the fact that there is little difference between GC2 and GC3 so for this reason alone I would inform anyone to wait three to four years when the game will be $10 before purchasing because it does not offer much more than GC2.

												Like: * The diplomatic system and the ideology ""trees""* The resource system and the starbase functions* The planetary 'slots' and it's development in slots, population etc* The large technology tree* The awesome shipbuilding* The sometimes dark humor in the happenings/diplomatic textsCould be better:* The race perks. Most of them aren't really making much difference, not stats-wise and not in making the race unique. There are too few (most races have the same it seems) and most only add a minor stat-bonus. More races wouldn't hurt either.* The battles. Although I like the way the battle looks, I would like to have a bit more control over them. Not necessarily implementing tactical battles (although it would solve the problem) but at least give me some opportunities to make a difference as a player.* I want fleet leaders and planet rulers. Politicians, generals, scientists, heroes - you name it. As with the race perks, don't make them just ""add a minor bonus""-feature (although it could be used as a filling).* More planet perks.* The starbases, as fun as they are, would make more sense if they could somehow block or at least hamper an enemy fleet from just passing through their territory. Some player-unique variants of bases would be fun too.* Where are the espionage and sabotage options??* Where are the cybernetic and genetic evolution options?* Ground battle should be evolved. At least to the point where there is any strategic value in actually building 'resistance' buildings. Walkers, tanks, hovercrafts etc, perhaps even better handguns. And a system to handle it.* Strategic weapons would be fun. There's nothing like actually aiming a missile/death ray towards a planet/fleet on the strategical map. No overusing them, mind you, just having the option once in a while or after extensive research.* More technology. Yeah, I know, there is a lot already but there can always be more... Ways to exploit asteroids or 'tame' wormholes for an example, or to construct artificial moons. (there might be already, I haven't played the game 100% yet).			"

												When I first heard that they were making GalCiv III I was interested because it was a space 4X game and I was coming down off a Civ5 binge.  GalCiv III the base game is a okay game, the campaign is okay, not thrilling, a little short, but most play a game like this for the replayable skirmish mode.  At least I do.  Replay value is fairly good for this game, after you have played through each of the main factions you can create your own or add in ones people have created.  Right now there are some great mods and additional factions for the game. With DLC the game gets better but I dislike the microtransaction feel of the DLC.  The biggest DLC, Mercenaries, adds in merc ships that come with a variety of abilities and it changes up the gameplay enough to make it feel new.  The biggest issues I have had with the game is it not starting, which Stardock Support helped me out with, (and the issued is known now so they have guides on how to fix it on the GalCiv forums).  Also, the UI and managing empires can get tedious, especially on large maps.  Overall I find the game enjoyable, especially when using my own custom faction in conjunction with DLC, mods, and additional factions.			"

												Note: I'm not a huge fan of turn based strategy games, so take this with a pinch of salt.I think ""Poor man's civ5"" about sums it up for me. It really adds nothing to the genre and tbh is inferior in almost everyway to other titles on the market (Civ5 anyone? Anyone for a game of civ5?) The only noteworthy thing about it is the ship builder, if you can get over the clunky interface...I don't know, maybe it's worth picking up in a sale? It's really not worth the asking price (and the cost of dlc on top of that) This is a £20 game to me at most, not £40 plus another 20 in dlc.			"

												This is an incomplete game! I have been a huge fan of this series. I purchased the original on the day of its release (and wound up buying it twice more packaged with other games). GalCiv2 was amazing on many levels. Along comes Galactic Civilizations III. I waited to write this review until after the 1.4 mega update in the hopes they would fix the issues. I can't possibly list all of the flaws in this game, but here are some of the most annoying that fans of the previous games will be pulling their hair out over (I'm not talking about the wheel thing; that's just a matter of preference and I understand why some people hate the change, but it doesn't make the game unplayable like these do):1) NO CIVILIZATION MANAGERThis is the most glaring thing to disappear from the game. It would be fine if they had replaced it with SOMETHING! But no, they didn't. For those who don't know, this handy tool in GC2 gave you a quick overview of your empire. You could easily see which starbases needed upgrades, which colonies had empty tiles and defenses, and much, much more. It was absolutely ESSENTIAL to managing a large empire. Now we have nothing and the only way to find out this information is to manually cycle through all of your bases and colonies one by one. I can not possibly express enough how aggravating this is on a large map.2) Disappearing NotificationsMany notifications will disappear before you can read or respond to them. They also don't appear in the notifications tab so you can't go back and read them.3) Can't Request Custom ConstructorsDon't bother creating your own constructors (even though creating custom ships is one of the best parts of GC games) since you won't be able to call them for upgrading your starbases! If you use custom constructors, you will have to manually send each one to the base you want it to upgrade and keep track of how many you have sent to each base (or use rally points for every single starbase).3) No Search Function!!!One of the most useful features of GalCiv2 was the search option, especially on large maps. Now you can't search for anything. Not even your own resources!4) Must Manually Search Map For EVERYTHINGSomewhat related to the above issue, this goes beyond the missing search function. You may as well not bother with sensors in this game, because you are going to have visually search the map for things like untapped resources, even ones sitting right next to your colonies. To be fair, I always felt GC2 could have made it easier for you to locate resources (at least those in sensor range), but I never spent 20 minutes just trying to find an Econ resource (or relic as GC3 calls them). You also must manually search for uncolonized planets, and colonies owned by other civilizations. Information that is vital for expansion and during wartime. Why bother having sensors at all?!?!?5) No EspionageEspionage has been a part of international politics throughout history. It was also part of GC1 and GC2. But apparently all the species of the galaxy have decided they don't need to know anything about their neighbors. Why is this important? It is VITAL! Especially on the harder difficulty levels. Knowing which defenses and offenses to specialize in could make the difference between winning and losing to a superior opponent in the previous games. Now you have to manually send ships into their territory (thankfully they have added stealth technologies to the tech tree) and scan their fleets to learn this information.These and hundreds of similar little oversights make the game feel like it is still in pre-alpha stage.The graphics are decent. That's about all I can say good about this game. I wasted my money and my years of devotion to Stardock are officially over.Update: I just noticed that less than an hour ago a dev posted the schedule for future patches, claiming that in about a year most of the bugs should be fixed. So two years after the game is released they CLAIM they will have the major bugs worked out! That alone should tell you how low the level of quality control was with this release. Though, in my experience, the functionality they removed is a bigger problem than the bugs, and there seem to be no plans to fix most of the issues I mention in this review.			"

												I have enjoyed trying to manage the myriad of options involved in running the game to its maximum potential. I enjoy not having to cheat to beat it on normal. For those who like quick games with a lot of simulated battles, this game will dissappoint you. If you like micromanaging or have an OCD tendency, you will love this game. It is not a set-it-and-forget-it game. To maximize production values and advancements, one must constantly tweak settings, destroy old structures and build new, evaulate what the most efficient choise are, etc. Even the placement of starbases requires forsight into how that base will affect the placement of other starbases and the effect it will have on planet growth, production, resource utilization, and a number f other factors.I have enjoyed it and I am so glad the bugs seem to have been resolved.

Layers of details and posibilities, genormous maps and customization of ships as vast as spce! So glad to see this title as it evolved from Beta to now and eager for all the add-ons and ehanceements to come, it already has proven itself all over again! Worthy of the name 'best strategy title' FOREVER!			"

Posted: July 22, 2015
												This game is a lot of fun and has plenty of potential if it is updated further.  The basic gameplay mechanics are fun and is very entertaining if you play militarily.  Many of the problems in this game lie in diplomacy.  I found the game nearly impossible to understand playing it from a diplomatic angle.  For example there are diplomacy points that you supposedly gain from researching certain techs and building embassies.  I still have yet to see any effect of these diplomacy points in my interaction with other races, and there is no concrete change to my standing with them.  When I trade with other factions, I often can't propose any treaties without any explanation why.  There are also many minor annoying bugs like the income slider changing rates slightly without using it, and certain technologies not doing what they are supposed to (research treaty is one example I can think of). A very major (and ridiculous) problem I've encountered with the game is United Planets voting.  The AI is incompetent in this regard.   In one game I played, all of my allies voted for an enemy (who we were ALL at war with) giving the enemy a stat boost.  I like this game and have enjoyed playing it, however, I would recommend holding off on buying it until it is further polished.			"

												The game is supposed to be a turned based strategy, but in reality, most of the game is just the user clicking the 'TURN' button as they wait for items to be manufactored/researched/etc.Repeated game crashes.  I have read the requirements for the game and my system meets/exceeds it.I watched the video of the designer creating a new ship and I thought that was a pretty good concept.  Even then, they user is plagued with huge amounts of limitations.  Attempting to build a  real ""scout"" ship (instead of what the game provides as default)... to me a scout ship should be fast and have long range sensors.  The best I could do was 4 moves / turn and 2 tile scan radius.Don't recommend the game and glad I didn't buy any of the DLCs,			"

												Gal Civ 3 is a nice continuation of the series. I definately appreciate the updated graphics and artifacts. The expanded event system and ideology system is also a plus. the campaign iss definately a sidenote, so it doesn't really do the story justice. There is also a lack of an espionage feature from the previous games and some of the characteristics have been streamlined. I also really appreciate the starbase production system in concept, but agree with other reviews single ship production per turn is often insufficient. Overall, I think GalCiv and paradox have created a wonderful franchise, and I'm glad to support them.			"

												This game is a lot of fun and has plenty of potential if it is updated further.  The basic gameplay mechanics are fun and is very entertaining if you play militarily.  Many of the problems in this game lie in diplomacy.  I found the game nearly impossible to understand playing it from a diplomatic angle.  For example there are diplomacy points that you supposedly gain from researching certain techs and building embassies.  I still have yet to see any effect of these diplomacy points in my interaction with other races, and there is no concrete change to my standing with them.  When I trade with other factions, I often can't propose any treaties without any explanation why.  There are also many minor annoying bugs like the income slider changing rates slightly without using it, and certain technologies not doing what they are supposed to (research treaty is one example I can think of). A very major (and ridiculous) problem I've encountered with the game is United Planets voting.  The AI is incompetent in this regard.   In one game I played, all of my allies voted for an enemy (who we were ALL at war with) giving the enemy a stat boost.  I like this game and have enjoyed playing it, however, I would recommend holding off on buying it until it is further polished.			"

												As a longtime fan of GCiv franchise I was hooked on being the Founder for GC3 and I really enjoyed seeing the product take shape. I never once regretted it as with some other games that took my money and then sub-performed. I like the new game mechanics, the scarce resources mechanics and increased use of star bases, the new civs. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good turn based strategy.			"

												Having an absolute blast messing around with this game. After trying (and failing) to get into Galciv 2, I am well deep into #3 and find it much easier to grasp.I will warn you though that you should take the time to outfit your own ships. Use the pre-designs for the ship ""look"" but trust me, kitting out a destroyer with a load of Stingers and Ion drives will make you smile.7 out of 10. Not the greatest strat 4X I've ever played but is only about the 4th that has managed to distract me from Civ4 for any period of time.

												Highly recommended.  I was first introduced to the GalCiv franchise with GalCiv I, but at the time, I didnt care much for the game mechanics and was totally engrossed by Total War early releases.  So I put Galactic Civilizations III onto my Steam wishlist and waited for a sale.   WOW!  What timing, just as v.2.0 was released and I cant tell you how much I'm enjoying this game.  The AI is much more challenging than before and the 'Ship Builder"" is worth the money just to play around making ship designs.  And not just cookie cutter plug and play like Master of Orion but each one unique and they show up in game combat just as designed.  There are a few details missing thatI would like to see and a few minor glitches, such as: I still have not found a way to recall a list of turn notifications, and some of the notifications stack and drop before I can read them.  But for the most part, this is a highly polished game with a lot to like.			"

												Pros: 4x         Addicting custom race         Multiple tech treesCons: Apart from AI and stuffs.           Performance on very large maps with multiple AI is terrible after playing for quite a while.          Close and load again and it will be better.          Some bug and glitches          There are a few really annoying one.          1) Game tends to wait permanently at enemy turn when it gets into late game.          2) Hitting something and clicking eject on another fleet results in a visual bug.               Your ships get cloned and if you try to hit with it, nothing happens and it also leads to 1).          Both requires you to close and load again.          3) Game crashes sometimesOverall: Not really worth 50 bucks unless bugs fixed and improvements made.			"

												This is a very good game, I highly recommed it, however here are a few things to consider first.  1) You need to purchase all the DLC's and make sure you are starting with the 1.5 patch.  2) Then make a visit to YouTube and watch some video's on specific game play.  These have been very helpful for me, it has explained a lot of the game to me, the manual is wofefully inadequate for the depth of this game.  3) Prepare to do at least 3 restarts of the game maybe about 30-40 turns each this is again for you to get the feel of it and try things out that weren't explained well in the manual 4) And finally just give it a chance to ""sink in"" because once it does ""sink in"" you will enjoy it a great deal.The graphics are sweet and the maps are very interesting (especially with the Precursor DLC)   So in conclusion get the game just be prepared to put some time into it before the game ""reveals"" itself to you.

												Basically Civ 5 in space! When they say insane galaxy size, they mean insane. Spent the last two weeks playing through a game where i was filled with a manifest destiny impulse to have one big unified empire spread to each of the six corners of the mini map. Sadly playing against max ai, they not only got in the way, they treated me like space North Korea and eventually like space Iraq...maybe should be more diplomatic next time...Oh and spent at least 20 of those hours in the ship designer fine tuning each of my designs with the little lego man in my head screaming ""SPASHAP! SPASHAP! SPASHAP!!!""Pros: -Massive galaxies and uber AI can turn this into a pretty epic space 4x adventure. -Customize the look of your faction and space ships and stations using modular parts from every race to your own tastes.Cons:-AI can be a bit too uber and overrun your territory.-Late game can get really laggy with so many planets discovered and ships on the board.

												One of the greatest turn based strategy games of all time. The ability to create, adapt, and specialize is almost unmatched in this video game genre. Expansion can be done via starbases or colonies. Allowing even small civilizations to rise to the top with proper development.Deep, fleet based, combat system that opens up dozens of strategies for any number of combinations and focuses. Want to do a fleet of carriers armed with missile pods while swarms of fighters and bombers with machine guns and torpedos mop up what remains? Or maybe you want to counter that strategy with a point defense laser ships and chaff walls. It's simple to learn, difficult to master, with a smooth learning curve. And its completely up to you as a player on how you want to focus your civilization! Easy to mod and massive ingame creation tools that touch nearly every major aspect of the game.---------------------------Galciv ist eines der größten rundenbasierten Strategiespiele aller Zeiten . Die Fähigkeit zu erstellen, anzupassen und zu spezialisieren ist fast einzigartig in diesem Videospiel- Genre.Expansion über Sternenbasen oder Kolonien kann durchgeführt werden so dass selbst kleine Zivilisationen an die Spitze mit der richtigen Entwicklung steigen können.Galciv ist flottenbasiert und hat ein Kampfsystem , welches sich an Dutzende von Strategien für eine beliebige Anzahl von Kombinationen anpasst. Willst du eine Flotte von Frachtschiffen mit Raketenwerfer  bewaffnen, während Schwärme von Jägern und Bombern mit Maschinengewehren und Torpedos aufräumen was bestehen bleibt? Oder vielleicht die Strategie mit einer Punkt-Verteidigung Laserschiffe und Spreu Wänden begegnen zu wollen . Es ist einfach zu lernen , aber schwer zu meistern mit einer glatten Lernkurve.Und es liegt ganz bei Ihnen als Spieler, wie sie den fokus ihrer Zivilization setzen wollen.			"

Early Access Review
								Do not bother getting the beta version at this time very few options work and if this is the graphics end  look then would not ever buy . Has crashed on me everytime I have played it so far. Planet build is such a way that you have to delete previously built to continue game or it just keeps saying idle planet, unbelievable, I should have waited to the end game is finished ans then waited for the reviews to see how good it is.

												All in all, this game is not a bad game, but it is not a good game either. However, it is very shallow. I ever played any of the Gal Civ games before this game, so I have no prior bias. I purchase Gal Civ III because it seemed like it would fufill my desire for a interstellar 4X game. However, I was very dissappointed with this game. It starts out decently enough, requiring you to explore for habitable worlds for you to colonize and resources to exploit. You also have a tech web with several types of tech to research. Planets you colonize have tiles on which you can build buildings to increase yields of food and science, etc, etc, etc. The early game is fairly eventful as you try to build up your empire and meet the other empires. However, the pace stalls out in mid to late game. At that point, all you can really do is build up your colonized planets, continue grinding research, and attacking our defending against other empires. Also at this point, micromanaging becomes a massive problem. On the larger maps, you'll usually have a butt ton of planets under your countries. As far as I know there is no way to automate your planets. Late game turns usually consist of going through your planets to fill out their construction queues. This makes the late game tedious and un-fun.Please save your money and don't give it to this sub-par game. If you really want a space 4X, buy Stellaris.			"

												It has been a long time since I played a really good Masters of Orion type game, this is it, re-addicted, everything is just about perfect.  People will complain about influence balancing, but you can win when your whole population hates you and your neighbors are Altarian.			"

												I have enjoyed trying to manage the myriad of options involved in running the game to its maximum potential. I enjoy not having to cheat to beat it on normal. For those who like quick games with a lot of simulated battles, this game will dissappoint you. If you like micromanaging or have an OCD tendency, you will love this game. It is not a set-it-and-forget-it game. To maximize production values and advancements, one must constantly tweak settings, destroy old structures and build new, evaulate what the most efficient choise are, etc. Even the placement of starbases requires forsight into how that base will affect the placement of other starbases and the effect it will have on planet growth, production, resource utilization, and a number f other factors.I have enjoyed it and I am so glad the bugs seem to have been resolved.
