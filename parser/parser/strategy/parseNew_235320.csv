												I still have the boxset from this game in my closet since 2002ish. This game is pure awesome. Don't let its retro looks fool you.Its something along the vibes of jagged alliance. you get character progression and permadeath. Most of the main characters have their own lines and personalities written for throughout the entire campaign; i always tried to keep em alive just for that ;Dother than that, the storyline, while slightly convoluted, simply serves as a backdrop for a great rts/rpg game where you manage not only your resources, but your human resources as well. 4 Character classes where your characters can switch between and gain experience in during missions carry out specific tasks, where soldiers fight, scientists do research and heal people up, engineers start buildings and collect resources, and mechanics drive and build vehicles.Decisions you make within each mission affect subsequent missions. Somewhere down the line you will be forced to make one which will split your campagin progress into two trees. *spoiler :D*I really loved the vehicle design in this game, where you slowly overtime research and unlock modules to provide more options for modular vehicle construction. Gun+Chassis+Power source+ wheels/tracks is awesome. I like the really distinctive look of the double gun cars. <3all in all, this game is worth my 20 bucks then, and the 5 bucks now. buy it. you wont be disappointed.			"

												I got this old game because it was on sale, because I hadn't seen the concept of an RTS closely involved with time travel anywhere else but Achron, and because of its positive reviews. I was wrong - this game is nothing like Achron, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.Last night, I stayed up until 6 AM trying to beat the first two USA missions in a way I could be proud of, and spent more than an hour on the third mission besides! I've only played one other RTS which directly applies how well I performed on one level to how well I start on the next level and to the degree that it is possible to get an unworkable start if you really mess up. The best part is? The game doesn't tell me that. It lets me explore, lets me find that out. It lets me find out that level 2 is much easier if I keep level 1's wounded soldier alive, lets me discover that Sabre-tooth tigers attack my troops as a matter of course (New policy: Pre-emptive extermination), makes me find out the little things that divide a Lieutenant from a quartermaster.The tutorial's unobtrusive, taking the form of hints which pop up along a small, out of the way bar at the bottom of the screen. Easy to ignore if you've seen it before, and easy to miss if you aren't paying attention. Just the way I like it.The graphics are, to be honest, not good by today's standards. But I am a firm believer in ""Graphics matter only to the point where they help the consumer suspend disbelief"", and they are good enough for me to suspend disbelief. If you've played the original Starcraft, it's around that level of quality.Unlike in Starcraft, however, terrain is hugely important in Original War. Long grass conceals soldiers who are crawling, but is temporarily flattened if a vehicle or walking human crosses it. Harder and softer terrains have different effects on the movement of vehicles depending on their propulsion (Tracks seem to be slower than wheels on harder ground and faster on softer ground) and the movement of infantry.The variety of units we have access to is honestly extremely well done - a basic human can fulfill any infantry role, but the skills they've acquired (In four areas, which transfer from mission to mission as the character does) determine how effective they are. Whether they're effective or not, just performing in the role will increase their ability in it. The four roles I've been exposed to - Soldier, Engineer, Mechanic, Scientist - are each so useful choosing between them is actively painful, and I count that in the game's favor. I've only seen three vehicles so far - two wheeled and one tracked - but being exposed to the vehicle construction menu informs me that eventually I will have the option to deploy vehicles of multiple chassis types, controlled directly by humans or remote guided, armed with distinct weapons, and so far I've seen both gasoline and solar power represented in the game.Now, the gameplay itself. Original War features RTS gameplay, but it honestly spends most of its time telling a story of people trapped two million years ago which is reflected by the gameplay. Most RTS games accept one basic conceit - that if you click a button in the barracks, you get another man or woman with a rifle. Original War rejects that conceit, and as a result you get a game more about using up, salvaging, resource allocation, and making do than it is about build orders, micro timing, or army composition. The result neatly becomes a sort of hybrid between an RTS and an RPG, with the large battlefields and unit management of an RTS and the detailed statistics and many, many options of an RPG.In terms of what I as a player can do, Original War impresses me. Do I want the resources that captured vehicle represents more than I want the vehicle itself? I can have it taken apart for a bit of a refund. Do I think it's time for my top soldier to learn how to repair vehicles? I can make her put on overalls and carry repair tools. Do I need to build a bunch of buildings fast? Turn everybody into engineers! Frustrated at the Engineer's slow speed while carrying resources? Vehicles with cargo bays can gather that for them. Am I considering mounting a final, do-or-die assault? Why am I considering that? I can pick the enemy's irreplacable unit count down with a small group of soldiers if I move carefully. Do I want my vehicle to be built quickly or just eventually? Do I want that tech researched NOW or eventually? And this is not counting the in-mission choices - I've received at least one dialogue choice per mission and this is without mentioning the implied choices.All in all, if you like RTS games, if you like RPG games, and most of all if you like HARD, uncompromising games which ask you as a player to think, learn, and make choices I think there is a very good chance you will enjoy this game as I am.EDIT: Having completed the final mission of the USA campaign (One of them, anyway...) I have more to say.In terms of Original War's ethics, I am impressed again. Original War is from the 2000s and it would have been easy for the game to fall into the standard American action hero characterization for the protagonists in the fashion that ruined so many other innovative RTS' for me, yet it doesn't. This is most notable in the portrayal of Joan Fergusson, a scientist who was never meant to go back in time but did anyway. In the majority of video games she would be doubly hampered as both a civilian and the love interest of the USA campaign's main character which would result in Fergusson simply being a useless character in both a statistical sense and a storyline sense. Instead, the exploits of this individual are believable given who she is, where & when she is, and what her limitations are. Specifically, if you keep Joan alive she holds bases on two occasions and brings a squadron of AI tank reinforcements to the final battle that you know she built by herself. The same can be said for nearly every other character I have encountered so far (I'm finding it difficult to grasp Major - Comrade Major Platonov - but I haven't completed the Russian campaign so...) which I view as support for the theory that Original War is more of a cross between an RTS and an RPG than really either.I enjoy Original War's dedication to continuity of choice - most choices made in early levels (Yes, losing units is a choice) will come back to haunt you by the final stages of a campaign. For instance, in USA 2 I chose to spare a captured enemy Mechanic. In a later level, that choice directly affected how I went about that mission. Even small choices like rotating the Scientist and Engineer roles so that everybody gains skill points becomes a major tactical factor by the tenth level.If I have one major criticism of Original War, it is that some units seem completely pointless. Apeman Engineers are amazing, Apeman Soldiers are...not. Double Gun Vehicles are always useful, Double Laser Vehicles are an utter waste of time and resources. Original War is hardly unique among RTS games in this sense, and I do appreciate having the options even if they are largely pointless. A point that mitigates this criticism in my eyes is the potential for the player to make useless units - for instance, the abomination that is the Morphling Machinegun or the utter incompetence of the Hovercraft...anything. That some units are useless means less when allowing inexperienced players to make stupid mistakes is such a big part of why I like this game.All in all, I still really like this game. There's a better than even chance I will buy it for most of my friends since it is on sale, and I will return to 200 Million years before the modern world after my Age of Empires phase has petered out.

												Two words: BUY IT!Its old, and forgotten by their developers, but ist great anyway. It has all what good RTS game should have: - Unique story, never seen anything similar in other RTS games- Unique resorces gathering system (not seen in any other games, and still fits 100% to the story)- Unique crew management (loosing man in first mission, can make others harder up to the last one, cause crew advance with you, crew members are limited, no respawn, no training units, permadeath)- Crew has skills (and they train them on mission, and as reward for good mission score)- Three factions quite balanced even while having different units, and different technologies- Modular vehicle construction (you choose vehicle type, engine type, weapon type, and steering type)I played this game when it came out 13 years ago - still having box version, and playing from time to time. Today I saw it on steam and bought it without even small doubt.P.S. To STEAM crew. Why its marked as ""indie""? Its made by Altair Interactive ( now called Altar Games )-> the same that made UFO;Afterlight, UFO:Aftermatch etc. Its also beeing published by Bohemia Interactive (Arma game series, Operation Flashpoint, Take on Helicopters). Its not indie...			"

												Original War is certainly a product if its time. It was very quietly developed in the waning days of RTS popularity and developers were first trying to do something a little different. It is the quinessential ""Gem"" for any fans of the genre. The art style is unique and clever, fantastic music and the concept was innovative. You don't train new men in the traditional sense; you have a finite amount of men, and you can build vehicles part by part (chassis, turret, fuel source) and train local fauna (aka cavemen) to join your cause. Each of your men (and women) have a name, and stats, and a specialty. You can change their roles as a match goes on (sniper, infantry, medic etc...) to suit your needs. In campaign mode, survivors of each battle with gain XP and ""lvl up"". Having an RTS with RPG elements back in 2001 was something special, but I'm not sure this game is for everyone TODAY. I think if you're a die-hard fan of the RTS genre, this is a great pick! Even if you're a fan of retro PC gaming in general, go for it. If you're looking for a Starcraft killer, move right along.

												Don't get fooled by the playtime I have in steam.This is easily one of the best and most innovative RTS games out there.If you like RTS and Oldschool this is definitely something for you.Thanks to 2D instead of 3D graphics the game look quite okay compared to 3D games at that time.The music is alright and always nice to listen to.There is an editor with the ability to script (Pascal-like language) coming with the game and an alive community over at owsupport.com.The campaign offers for 10-30 hours of time, depending on skill and difficulty setting and offers quite an interesting storyline with not too monotone objectives.Apart from that, there is the multiplayer which may not have too many players in it, but it is still functioning and offers around 15 maps with different gamemodes ranging for regular 1v1 build base battle each other to 2v2 with a twist of disappearing and respawning units  up to 3v3 rampage and 4v4/2v2v2v2 battles. I personally enjoy the way the game handles base building and unit management a lot.The catch with this RTS is that you can't train units. You need 5 soldiers to attack the enemy? You can't train them like that. You start with a certain amount of people and those you have to stick with. You can't just say ""5 soldiers plz"" and your barracks will poop out 5 people. That doesn't work here.Some maps/campaign missions have some sort of unit spawn, but in MP it can be selected and in SP it's doesn't make you OP. You can train apes or make Computer or remote controlled vehicles to prevent loss of actual soldiers, which adds a really nice touch to the game and is a nice alternative to regular RTS games.I think everyone should give this game a try, it's one of my most favorite RTS games ever and I can only urge you to consider buying it, especially at such a low price.

												One of the most fun and conceptually interesting RTS games I've ever played. It's an Original War in more than name.The Good Things:Good mix of RTS and RPG mechanics. Humans are a limited resource, they do not respawn and you do not receive more than you start with. Each character can gain experience in 4 classes and can change between classes at any time in the appropriate building, retaining his experience. Some things (construction, vehicles, turrets) can be automated, removing the need for a human pilot, but computer-controlled entities are slower, shabbier and do a lot less damage than those controlled by a skilled human operator. You must always find a balance between risking irrepleaceable human staff and wasting resources on suboptimal AI control.As far as vehicles go, you build your own by mixing together a chassis, engine, pilot (can be manual, remote or AI) and weapon. New components are made available by researching them and/or building addons for a vehicle factory, each of which can only accomodate five - and all factions have at least six possible addons that can be mixed and matched. While higher tech components are generally more powerful than lower tech ones, they never render the low tech ones truly obsolete, by virtue of costing more, taking longer to build and being more specialized (e.g. heavier vehicle turrets cannot rotate unlike lighter ones). The game is in isometric 2D, but the terrain obeys the rules of 3D in a way no later games did - unit vision works as ""rays"" instead of a radius, trees and rocks obscure vision, units on high ground see and fire further, soldiers can go prone in tall grass to become virtually invisible, etc. Terrain layout, elevation, trees have a real impact on gameplay. Infantry uses it as cover and to avoid vehicles, vehicles require a tracked chassis to ascend slopes, and the most powerful vehicle in the game is  balanced by being too huge to climb a hill. The two campaigns are long, varied and challenging. If you go for all bonus objectives on the highest difficulty, there's easily at least 60 hours of gameplay (though I clocked 120 due to leaving the game running in the background a lot). The American campaign is the best one, having a good story and characters.The Bad Things:The sound effects are bland and lack variety. There is only one sound effect for most actions.The voice acting in the Russian campaign ranges from mediocre to terrible. This is specific to the English version only - the Polish and Czech versions actually have very good voice acting.The Russian campaign feels drawn out and padded at times, and the Russian part of the story feels disjointed.There is no campaign for the third faction (Arabs). You get many glimpses of clearly important Arab characters and see echoes of their ventures happening offscreen, but the campaign that was supposed to explore them in detail was never added since the publisher went bankrupt.There is no skirmish for the same reason as above.

												I have purchased Original War three times; first in a bargain bin in 2002, then on gog.com and finally on Steam. Let me tell you why this is one of the finest RTS games ever made. A truly exceptional example of the genre but mainly for reasons that set it apart from most strategy games. Let's talk about what it does that may not be so different but is instead allows us a comforting familiarity with what we've come to expect from Sci-fi RTS games. As is a staple of the RTS Genre the single player comes with two campaigns, a Russian and American/NATO campaign. There is the cliché'd sci-fi super-rare-new-resource, and of course it's a green crystal. What sets Original War apart from most RTS games is... Well, quite a lot actually. For one; it's set in a world where time-travel is possible. Russia and America are vying for control of a new-found substance called Siberite (known as Alaskite in the Russian campaign.) Both superpowers decide to use time travelling machines to go back and move all the  green-glowing-good-stuff to their respective territories, so that when the future comes around they'll already be in possession of every valuable deposit of said resource. For the soldiers embarking on this mission; it means a one way trip. Speaking of soldiers... Throughout the story you'll be given a single protagonist (American's get Macmillan, Russians get 'Gorky') and if they die, it's game over. The rest are cannon fodder. Likeable cannon-fodder. The problem with liking these human meat shields is if these characters die, that's it. They don't come back. Given that each character has stats based on what you had them do most (building vehicles, constructing fortifications, shooting enemies, or researching space-time anomalies) they get better at it through an EXP system. Even if you don't find yourself liking their dialogue (impossible), you sure as hell will miss their efficiency. Certain characters dying affects the story too, sometimes in a grim way (this is true of both campaigns).This is but a brief overview of the game, there's a lot more off-the-wall design elements you should experience for yourself and for it's price, Original War will not disappoint. It's difficult to find anything to dislike; The RPG elements are unobtrusive, the cheesy dialogue is heart warming and with memorable characters such as Colonel Powell and Lisa Lawson (to name but a few) I cannot reccomend it enough.

Recommended For The More Conservative Strategists+ Boasts a healthy and competent mix of RTS and RPG-style gameplay+ New units cannot be spawned mid-game, lending gravity to one's actions and the manner in which one utilizes resources+ The campaign is quite varied in terms of possible choices and effects that may result; this gives the campaign a stronger sense of replayability+ The abiliity to control time serves to both minimalize tedium and maximize one's response time; excellent and greatly desired quality-of-life feature+ Plot is interesting and creative; can be a bit silly and over the top, but it's not done so in a way that encourages a cringe+ Orders for troop movements can be issues while the game is paused- Mediocre and subdued audio- Voice-acting leaves much to be desired- Limited, uninspired soundtrack- The game has compatibility issues and can be an enormous hassle to start up successfully- Few multiplayer options; no AI skirmish or practice, for instanceLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												More or less a hidden gem of RTS games. This game has so many good points ranging from multiple minor plot branches and permadeath to comfy gameplay and characters with unique VAs that its easier to ask if you like RTS games with limited amount of units, yet with basebuilding? If so then play this game, you'll not regret it. It has also aged very well and looks good on HD displays.			"

												This is a RTS game where every unit has a name and background! I loved this idea when I first played this game as a kid and, sadly, I have never seen this developed in other RTS games (except maybe a tiny bit in the Starcraft games where a unit has a kill count; it makes that unit feel unique in a way). It's such a cool idea for a RTS game: every unit is a character and he/she matters - story wise and gameplay wise. No wonder that this game still has a strong fan base!

												I'm a few missions and 5 hours in and I must say, this game lives up to all the talk about it being a hidden gem and an unsung masterpiece.It's a great rts/rpg that has a very different feel than other rts.  You cannot create different soldiers, you can only use the ones you've got (and some you can find scattered throughout certain maps)  This means you have to treat each life as vital.You change jobs at different buildings, choosing from soldier, engineer, mechanic, scientist.  Each jobs allows the unit to perform different tasks.  Scientists heal and research upgrades and can spot and mark oil.  Engineers pick up the shipments of crates that are sent back from the future and build buildings.  Mechanics can work in the workshop (or whatever the vehicle and turret gun creating building is called) to create vehicles, guns for turrets and they also repair and drive vehicles (each class can drive vehicles and perform based on their mechanic skill.)All this adds up to quite an enjoyable game.  It also includes a pause feature that allows one to stop the action and give complex sets of orders which is certainly noteworthy and unique in thie genre.I caught it on sale for a buck and it's not too expenisve otherwise.  If you catch it on sale, it's a must have and if you're open to the universe worth of gaming that opens up to you when you look past graphics and release dates it's a must get all the time.Check it out.  You won't be disappointed.			"

												Most definitely one of my bigest gaming loves.And that is more then well deserved position! OW is (even thought it´s age) original not just in the means of timetravel and war in the far past and for the past. Above all it´s brilliant combination of rts and rpg, what makes it so unique. In terms of gameplay it means you have to care about every soldier you have (and in this harsh environment, it´s usually much less than optimal numbuer). You have to always think abut for what to use each soul and how to treat it. What skills to train, where to allocate the manpower, what technology develop and when. Becouse even won battle for valuable resource, if it took too much time, can endanger development of your base and therefore whole mission. Loosing any soldier means hell of a trouble. There are usually multiple ways how to achieve your goals, but every one need careful tactical thinking from base management to field battle strategy.This way it may sound like hardcore stuff for very patient tacticians... but it´s not. Above all, it´s very enjoyable game for anybody. The main experience isn´t frustration, but fun. Lots of fun. There are some things that help this outcome. First is excellent level design. Missions arent repetitive, but almost always bring some new challenge. They vary from more traditional base-to-base war to Commandos-like stealth action. Often there are also twists in the developement of events, which boosts gameplay with dynamics and pushes you to be prepared for anything.The last but not least quality is the main story. From the ""cliché"" of American-Russian war (just situated in unorthodox setting), situation quickly extends to be more complicated. Player is therefore forced to choose which side (and which politcs, ethics and philosophy) to pledge allegience to. Not just from global perspective, but from personal view of main hero and his relationships, too. Which even adds emotinal touch to game. Quite special for rts, isn´t it? Oh, I forgot to mention that (living) soldiers and their valuable experience goes to next missions. And that for some of the more important characters amongst them, you will soon develop special feeling.Game has, of course, it´s weaknesses (like poor voicecast), but there are not many of them. Somebody may despise the old graphics, but I like it even after all those years.So in the end I have only one advice regarding Original War: Enjoy It!!!			"

So I remembered that game was good and...IT WAS. Fantastic Voice acting, marvelous story, interesting characters, unique resource gathering, permadeath (when character dies, he/she is gone, forever, unless you replay mission and make sure he/she will stay alive)...Look how much there are negative reviews compared to number of positive reviews.At the time of wrting this review: 24 positive/0 negative (+ this one, which is positive making it 25)Summary: GO BUY THIS GAME NOW!

												This is my favorite game of all time. I found out about it through a demo disk that came along with a game magazine back in 2001 and was instantly hooked. I must have spent a good 50+ hours playing the demo alone before I finally managed to get my hands on a copy of the full game.I still to this day bring Original War up regularly in my gaming rants about how unique and inventive it was, and how disappointed I am that it didn't get the attention it deserved. I'm glad to see it on Steam now and it's fun to see how pretty much everyone else that's played it feels the same way as I do.Besides compatibility issues this game has aged extremely well. I still play it from time to time over 900+ other newer games I could be playing. While it is an RTS it actually plays quite a lot like an RPG, in that you don't mass produce anything and the few units you get to control all for the most part have their own stories and personalities. When they die they're gone for the rest of the campaign (unless you restart, which will become a habit if you're anything like me and can't let a single person die ever) which makes you actually care about who you send out and think more carefully about the most optimal ways to get all your soldiers out of each mission alive. A lot of official reviewers back in the day complained about the voice acting but personally I love it. Sure it's not super serious and amazing but I find that it adds more charm to the game, makes me laugh and makes the experience generally more memorable. I frequently find myself doing impressions of the more 'unique' characters like ""Oleg Kazimirowicz Gleb"" (you'll understand when you run into him) and lip syncing all the story dialogue when I go back and repeat playthroughs.You have to assign characters to research new technologies for weapon, building and vehicle production as well as go out into the world and collect enough resources to sustain that production. In singleplayer it's all tied into the story very well. There are also dialogue options and decisions you'll get to make that strongly impact the outcome of your game and who will survive. As far as I'm aware, the online community is still very much alive for the game however it still seems to be mostly Czech and Polish folks playing (as those two countries were basically the only places where the game was decently advertised). It's because of this that the first words ever I learned in another language besides English were polish, back in the GameSpy arcade days. They were swear words (go figure). There's also a website called 'owsupport' that actively releases patches/fixes for the game and as their name suggests, provide support for the OWar community so if you ever need help that's the place to go.Overall it was an underrated, poorly advertised game that deserved a lot more credit for it's ingenuity than it received and I highly recommend buying a copy and giving it a go.

												This game is an absolute gem. An RTS you will not forget with a story line that is right up there with the C&C franchise.The gameplay is not like that of C&C it is/was a great twist on the whole RTS genre bringing some really neat gameplay into a game as old as it is.I had this game on disk, the disk broke so I bought it a second time and now I've bought it a third time on steam. It's one of those games you're just kicking yourself that there isn't a second. I would love to play a modern version of this game.			"

												One of my favourite games of all times!My top 5 would be (Original Wars, Fallout2, Jagged Alliance 2, Silent Hill 2,3, Grim Fandango)Great Storytelling! Great animation sequences (both the Hand Drawn for the americans and 01's for Russians) I felt like I was there the whole time, replayed every mission several times, tried to take every medal without save in master strategist difficulty and unlocked all futures! This is a game where every choice you make counts! Full of great ideas and innovation! I played this game back in 2002 and I was really amazed by it! Now that I found that it is supported by steam it was an instabuy! Why this game is one of the best:It is an rts with rpg elements! Different voice,face,background story for every troop you have! if you shoot with someone his soldier skills will improve, if you heal with someone his scientific skills will improve, if anyone dies, he dies forever!You can make choices in the game that affect the future!The american and the russian campaigns focus in the same story from two different sides, you have the choice to either stay loyal to your superiors in rank, defy them and take leadership or abandon the army focused factions and join the alliance of american and russian scientists! Each campaign has it's own feeling and both are amazing! In the american campaign you will search for siberite and blue will be your favourite color! In the russian campaign you will search for alaskite and red will be your favourite color!In the Russian campaign you can build your own base from the scratch! Make the bulldozers clean the field from the rocks and trees and then start building your base! It will take you some time to built it but the buildings you made will stay in the same place you built them through out the campaign and you will feel like you are having an impact with the game! And after your Nemesis MacMillan burns your base down you will feel furious to see your creation destroyed! You will have choices like who will you appoint commander of the base when you leave, should you interrogate/kill/release a prisoner and should you go out of your way to help your friends or not? You will also develop Bombs of mass destruction, train apemen to gather resources or make them soldiers or teach them to drive tanks or explode on enemies! or train them to be suicide apemen that drive tanks full of explosives! control tanks with remote towers or AI, hack enemy AI tanks, research alien artifacts with unique properties, become major, take the russian communist quiz to prove yourself an ally of the cause, kill endangered species millions of years before they become endangered, become invisible or shoot time alternation bazookas! If you like hamburgers,time travel and/or mother russia, you will like this game. "

												This was a seriously unappreciated game when it came out, outside of Czech republic and Poland that is. It's one of my most beloved games and here's why.It's really quite amazing, and does something no other RTS I've seen. It combines RTS basics with RPG elements and a great, original story. The characters (the team your control) are unique, have their specific voiced lines and play an important role in the story, they're not just units you can crate in a factory. You're stuck with the soldies you get and if they die, they're gone for the rest of the game. Think of it as a mix of the team based Wasteland with the classic base building of Command and Conquer etc.The story:If you're a book reader and are fimiliar with Wolfgang Jeschke, more specifically the book ""The Last Day of Creation"", you pretty much know the story by now, since it's been heavily inspired by it.There are two campaigns (American and Russian) that each have multiple paths.The basic plot: A new element is found, Siberit/Alaskit, that is higly radioactive but wields an incredible power. Using this element, scientists discover a way to use it to travel back in time. There are two campaigns, so there are 2 countries (USA/Russia) traveling back in time to secure the resource, mine it up and move it to the location where their respective countries will be in 2 million years. So you're transported to the prehistoric, pliocene epoch with exact mission. It's a one way ticket only.I don't want to say more so that I don't spoil the story of the game, but expect multiple universes/futures. It does this pretty well, and suprisingly, doesn't get as confusing and convoluted as it usually does.There's branching story lines, decision to be made and you can play as all sides of the conflict.The mechanics: As I said, characters you can use are limited, with permanent death being used. You have 4 basic character jobs (soldier, mechanic, medic, builder) and you can change their jobs on the fly in the missions. Everyone has jobs they're good at or close to useless if your ignore those. The skills shift throughout the game depending on what you have the characters do. So every character is unique and special, you really start to find your favourite characters, where even if they die and you're about the complete the mission, you'll be reloading the mission.The most important resource in the game are crates. These get teleported in from the future, but since this technology still hasn't been mastered, these drop at random points on the map. So in order to get these, you'll have to go and actively search for them while weaking your camp and putting the scounts in danger.There's one issue that people have with the game, and that is that the english voice acting is supposed to be pretty bad. I've only played it in the original czech dubbing, so it was never an issue for me, although it certainly isn't great either.It's my favourite RTS of all time, and I just hope more people would discover this gem of a game.The game was developed by Altar Interactive in 2001, and it was their first big game. The core of the studio aren't together anymore and have moved on to other projects, and since this game was never very successfull commercially, we won't be getting a sequal. Or not an official one, the community is still very much alive with this one. Having Steam Workshop capabilities certainly helps.So please, if this sounds even slighty intriguing to you, BUY IT! "

												Don't be fooled by my low number of hours playing, I've spent better part of 500 hours with this game back at 2001-2005 until I lost my CDs. Short story: BUY IT! For 5 euros and with 8.4 user score on metacritic you have a chance to get something really good very cheap.Long story: This game was one of the few that tried with big success to battle the stereotypical nature of RTS games after 2000. It never got much attention because at the time noone cared about games from small developers. Even though there was clearly a big disparity from how mediocre this game was considered by game magazines and how well recieved it was by players, truth is not many people even knew about this game. A huge mistake. It is fun, long, it has high quality both single player and multi player. Plot is great and the possibilities are huge. This is a masterpiece, one that everyone even remotely caring about RTS genre should have.			"

												9/10 RTS lover? GET. THIS. GAME!!!The difference between this game and every other RTS is the core fundimentals, brilliant and original, the unique use of your troops, base building and a clever story all layed out seemlessly show this this game has heart all wrapped up in a blaze of glory... Your engineer is building a turret? hand a soldier a hammer n get him to help, watch as he gains the knowledge to build! Short on soldiers? watch as the engineers learns to kill things with finesse! This game is not a spam to win game  this game is about smart soldier alocation/training, limited troops sent to the past to assist in your victory, ready to be molded into scientists soldiers mechanics and engineers.Vehicles are custom deisgned with a wide variety of options to choose, keep an eye on fuel gages and solar power levels while keeping mechanics close at hand to pop out those dents on your path to victory.Each mission has medals to be won for showing your skill and each mission is well tied to the story.This game was made by smart people who by looking at the final product cared about what they made it really shows in the finer details as you progress through the game.the only downfall of this game is the inability to run, though as you progress you realise you don't need it.the graphics are done well and stand beside the newer games with no issueA great game that i can't believe i have never played before, it's been on my wish list for some time and now at 99c AU ya can't go wrong!A fine blend of RTS and RPGAn old game that has a heart, built before souless game pumping came about.Take on the role of Mcmillan a soldier sent into the past to collect a new found mineralhe dies you die9/10			"

												I remember when the demo for this game first came out in an edition of Strategy Gamer. The concept behind it seemed simple enough but it was the story that piqued my interest. Traveling back in time and changing history? First you had my curiousity, now you have my attention. Then the characters began to grow on me. From the opening sequences as John I could already feel my heart pang for him as he finds the love of his life but it's already a million years too late... Original War is a game where your soldiers as your most valuable resource. You are reliant upon only a finite number of troops and must manage these to the best of your ability and limit casualties. The game also features a bit of an RPG system where each soldier can develop as a Soldier, Engineer, Mechanic and Scientist where each class has its own strengths and weaknesses. And these soldiers if they survive are present for the entirity of the campaign and depending on the choices you make, follow you to hell and back. Overall I think Original War is a very fun and addictive game that never really got the attention it deserved when it was released.			"

												I absolutely have to give this one a HUGE thumbs up purely from a nostalgic standpoint.  Further, don't base my review on my limited Steam play time because I first picked this game up in 2002(ish) and I've literally got hundreds of hours logged on this title over the years.  It's an old go-to for me when I'm bored or have nothing else to play in my extensive library.Is it groundbreaking?  No.  Is it beautifully rendered?  Nope.  Is the dialogue cheesy?  You betcha!  Are the controls a little bit on the clunky side compared to today?  Yeah.  Does it have a couple of bugs.  Probably.  Is it dated?  You better believe it.But this game is still holding it's own after all these years!  This game will chew you up, spit you out, stomp on you, kick you around, pick up your mangled body off the ground, dry you off, chew you up again, then finally swallow you with a tall glass of draft beer.  And you'll like it.  You'll beg it to do it again.  And again, and again.Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.  Trust me.  :)			"

												My favourite game which is like an old lover... it just keeps coming back!I had been playing this game even before I got a stable internet connection (was using dial-up modem) and spend hours and hours every single day... Because it was and still is THAT AWESOME!My guess? RPG + RTS met in a bar, got drunk and gave birth to this little marvel.The graphics are not great for today's general public taste, but the gameplay and attachment to the characters... Priceless!Unpopular due to lack of advertisement, though it had been scored very high in top gaming magazines at the time all these years ago.Only problem was the dubbing... English is, umm, slightly worse than any of the local versions, which were available in 2002...BUT!!!There was an amazing update... which added full Czech, Polish and other dubbings, which were like a core thing... like a soul for this game... and now IT IS COMPLETE! :DAnyway, I encourage anyone hesitating to buy this game. It IS worth it.			"

												An excellent and original RTS game, yet very underappreciated. The limited number of personnel per mission makes for a challenging match (whether campaign or multiplayer) and the 2,000,000 BC setting is cool with prehistoric forests, local fauna and limited resources. Definitley worth grabbing a copy but unfortunately multiplayer matches are non-existent and there is no skirmish mode so unless you have a group of friends to play with you'll be sticking to the campaign. Workshop mods add some extra playability with some neat singleplayer missions.			"

												Original War is one of those ""hidden gems"" you never played. I'm glad I discovered it. However, you need to be somewhat retro-savvy in order to enjoy it. The game suffers from a few bad game design choices here and there, some of which can make you rage in frustration. Original War combines the alternative history time travel plot of Red Alert with the clunky vehicles and bases from KKnD and seasons it with the ""no mistakes allowed"" difficulty of Z. The mission design is terrible, I really can't sugarcoat it. Prepare yourself for trial and error, vague objectives, and invisible time limits. Get ready to play some missions over and over again. The campaigns actually become easier in later missions when all the techs are unlocked. The enemy AI is not much of a challenge; you will be fighting against limited manpower and resources most of the time.What makes this game great are the mechanics. You get a rather small but cool arsenal of weapons, each with their strengths and weaknesses. Your characters gather experience in four different jobs so keep them alive. You will need soldiers in the first half of each campaign, and then skilled mechanics to pilot your vehicles towards the end. Scientists take care of research and play medic on the side, while engineers build your base and enhance the quality and durability of buildings.And so the verdict comes down to: amazing and unique game mechanics trapped in nonsensical mission design. All you need is a little willpower. Prime candidate for a remake or sequel.			"

												Longer time ago an American expedition found in Siberia a strange artefact called EON. After some time scientists found it’s a time machine. For using EON there was necessary a fuel called Siberite. However there was one problem - all supplies of Siberite were in Siberia, in Russia. That’s why Americans decided to send an expedition 2 milions years to the past and all supplies of Siberite move from Siberia to Alaska (that time they were connected). Then would be changed the space continuum and all Siberite would be in USA one day. But the Americans weren’t the only ones, who got this idea...Original war is a real-time strategy with strong elements of RPG. The game was after it’s release (incorrectly) compared with Red Alert 2, but OW is pretty different game. There you have limited characters and every of them has own identity and skills that you can improve during missions. Often you can choose your favourite characters for your team the mission starts. If there dies any of your person, you will not be able to “reborn” him or her again. So, it’s not a strategy where you can buy hordes of soldiers and then you would crush the enemy by massive force. There you need to find the way how to defeat often stronger or better stationed enemy. + very original game (original war should be original =)) and interesting story + nice graphic (at least for year 2001) + campaigns are long and nonlinear (player has to make many decisions that can influence the story and the end as well) + three playable sides (Americans, Russians and later Aliance) and one additional (Arabians) + every side has special weapons and professions + nice cutscenes + many and sometimes funny dialogs + every character can improve skills and change professions (soldier, builder, mechanic, scientist and others)  + many characters have own charisma and special features (you will like them =)) + prehistoric animals + some animals you can use and train + includes multiplayer (you can play there for Americans, Russians and Arabians too) - no campaign for Arabians (although you can hire several times Arabians) - no skirmish modeThis game I already played maybe 100 times during last 12 years, so I think I can say this is an excellent game. I can definitely recommend this game as I have never met any person who said ""I didn’t like it"". I have to give 10 points from 10.			"

												Very addictive and original RTS mixed with RPG elements. This game is like a return to my childhood. I've spent many hours playing this game because of the unique gameplay and great story.You cannot just spawn more soldiers, you have to do whatever is necessary with what you have and keep your units alive for your own good. Every single one has unique personality and once they're dead, they cannot return. There are resources randomly spawning across the map and sometimes you have to fight for every supply you need. There are two official campaigns where you play as Americans or Russians. You'll also face mercenaries led by Arabs who were also meant to have a campaign but unfortunately it was cancelled (there is a fan made campaign ""The Arabian Campaign"" which perfectly fills the hole though).Your units can change their job during a mission. They can become a soldier, engineer, mechanic or a scientist. They keep getting better and better at their job and it's up to you to make them even better. You also assemble vehicles and turrets which can be controlled by your soldiers or just make them fully automatic.Also I live in Czech Republic, the country where this game was developed and the Czech voice acting is just perfect. Many people say the English one is not very good but that still doesn't ruin the great experience.+ Story+ Truly ""original""+ Multiple in-game choices+ Three playable factions+ Exploding apes riding a vehicle- Not very known game (only a few multiplayer matches)			"

												This game will test you, will make you hate it and will make you love it, its completely worth the 5 bucks its sold for, if you are looking for a real RTS challenge get this game, even in easy it gives you a good challenge, mistakes can be fatal.EDIT:  After playing it 53 hours more or less, i recomend this game completely, i usually play RTS games on hard or medium, but this one forced me to play on easy as it is really challenging, the vehicle customization, albeit not too big, is fun and different, the units get better further you get into the game. Its trully one of the best RTS games i have ever played.			"

												This is a brilliant game, the title says it all. Very original. New strategy games could learn from abosulte gems like this. I have had this game on disk for many years and have replayed it many times. The Campaign stories are very captivating, and again highly original, and really drives the missions. The excellent and immersive character relations are superb, ranging from the very sad to the very ridiculous with excellent humour all along the way. I got very attached to some of the characters in-game and that connection really affected my gameplay. The strategy is very involved, and the gameplay can be insanely difficult at times but it just dosn't seem to matter becasue its such fun, even to replay over and over.I most definitley recommend this awesome game, there needs to be more like it. For some reason it never seemed to get the acclaim it so rightly deserved, and its great to see a comminity on steam that support it. Oh..and the music is excellent too. :)For a measly £3-99 you can't go wrong, immerse yourself in the querky superbness that is Original War. :)			"

												Original War is a good game even by todays standards. Its not your classic RTS game where you spam hundreds of units at an enemy, instead you only get a certain amount of people each mission which if they die are gone forever. Each person has 4 skills (Soldier, Scientist, Engineer and Mechanic) which they gain experience for when they do the particular job (Which can be switched in the approperate building). Since you have limited troops you have to use actual tactics to win, you have to care about losing people.The game doesn't hold your hand at any point and just throws you into it (There are tips about gameplay when you do something for the first time).

												One of the most great games of the past that was very good but got forgoten becose of bigger tittles like Command and Conquer. Really if you want fun and great gameplay thats is not same in most strategy games both in singleplayer or multiplayer buy this game don t look on cost i already buy it for 3rd time becose CDs got missed or broken :)Only minus to this game is that it doesn t have bots so you can t play skirmish matches if Bohemia doesn t implemented thems in latest patches but other then that its great.....3 nations each diferently set with some technology same with 1 or both nations and plenty of technology specific just for that nation, with diferent looks and diferent tactics and diferent weapons and stats.Dont look on playtime on steam i already got like 100+ hours on this one outside it :)			"

												Definitely one of the best strategy games ever released. It is still worth your money. I you are a fan of strategy games this is a must buy. I may be a little biased as nostalgy hits really hard, but I swear I will try not to be biased. I will not give you any spoilers without warning.It offers:-Unique gameplay: Every soldier only lives once. You lost him in one mission, you won't get him in the next mission. That means the better you play, easier it gets. People are nonreplaceable commodity in this game and every live matters.-Nice story: I don't want to give out any spoilers, but your characters throw jokes whenever they can and it builds a very nice athmosfere.-Original cutscenes: Cutscenes are one of the things you just must watch everytime you play.-Multiple endings to your campaigns depending on how you play or your choice.-2 campaigns and mulitplayer.-Steam workshop and ability to install mods.Amongst other things...Now to cons, atleast for some people. The game has no skirmish mode unless you get a mod for it and even then it's not 100% great. This game is really hard, because it came out in 2001 and games used to be hard back then and it may be a thing that will make some ""casual"" players not want to play this game. You can get a tutorial on internet or YT. SMALL-SPOILER This game is missing one campaign. Amongst Russian and American campaign it should have also had an Arabian campaign, because  you will meet a mysterious new enemy, the arabs. The studio didn't have enough time to finish the game as it was pushed out to early, because they were going bankrupt. Arabians are only playable in special cases in SP, but they are a full balanced side in MP. END OF SPOILER You can get one more almost complete campaign from workshop.Overall I would really recommend this game to any RTS gamer out there especially since it's that cheap. "

												Truly an old game but I find myself enjoying the struggle. Yes it has dated graphics but the play is quite challenging and I like the fact that units must be protected rather than foddered. Story is interesting and character devlopment puts an RPG twist to strategy. If you can get it on sale and feel like going back in time (no pun intended) you should check it out!			"

												Literally the greatest RTS game ever made.'ORIGINAL' War. That's all that really needs to be said, It's just completely original in every way.The graphic style is original. and at the time left very little to be desired, whilst other RTS games were venturing down the Third dimension, which left a lot of players a little sour.The gameplay is fantastic, on and offline, the versatility of the building system leaves room for hundreds of strategies to be formed online, while the single player campaign is filled with interesting characters, great story lines, and even branching paths for different ending scnearios.Truly a masterpiece of it's time.

												Reviews really are not my thing, but for a game like this I simply have too.This was one of my first RTS games ever played and frankly it has been stuck in my head since I played it as a child, now years later I find it on Steam, play it and god it still holds up today, I admit the game does have its issues, but the good far outweighs the bad, I will list everything, but keep in mind while there is some small facts in this, most of it is opinion.I'll start with the bad:- Voice Acting isnt the best, and in times even messes up its audio making a character speak with different voices.- Graphics are old, I say old, not bad, back then the graphics were nothing special but they got the job done.- Slow Paced, If you want to learn this game or just see everything it has to offer, or even just steamroll missions, you need to be patient, things take awhile to start up, building bases, some missions forcing you to wait time limits, the game itself showing you its features and unlocking things bit by bit on each mission,- Game suffers from start up difficulties and is fussy on how it wants to work, even if you have a really powerful computer, Original War will downright refuse you if it isnt set right. but these problems can be fixed with some tweaking with settings depending on the system, I'm sure that most if not all Original War players had to do something to make the game run properly.- No Skirmish mode with AI, only players, a mod is apparently being worked on but I don't know for sure. Sure, playing with players is more fun and how its meant to be played, but a little practice would be nice so you have a feeling of the difference in pace from the campaign missions.And as for the good:- Open ended story/campaign, the campaigns in this game have so much dialog, possible results and effects with decisions, I have fun messing with the game still after all these years just repeating missions to find all the dialog and effects on a mission, you can branch them out on each playthrough and it will save them going from worst to best result, plenty of replayability if you have the patience. remember, the results of one mission can easily effect another, be it good or bad, the mission after, or a mission much later in the game.- Characters/RPG elements, This game doesnt allow you to spawn more troops, besides from vehicles and buildings, the people what you have is what you get, if someone dies, your not seeing them again. this makes you want to keep each one alive for multiple reasons outside of keeping the base running, characters are far more efficient at most if not all tasks depending on their class, each class can be leveled up granting them slight stat boosts in defense/attack while being more efficient at the role they are in. This causes tension when a battle starts, should you send remote or AI forces at the enemy? having mediocre stats but can be rebuilt, or should you send your valuable characters with better stats, but irreplaceable on death. The stats of a character are important even when building a base, the higher level engineer you have not only chages how fast a building can be made, but also the quality of its defense increases too, two of the same built at different leveled enigineers, the higher level building will have higher natural defense.- Easy to Control/Responsive, In an RTS being able to command your forces and view the map is critical, while Original War does have hotkeys, you don't need to use them to be effective, you can play this game pretty decently with just the arrow keys, mouse and shift key, sure you might not be as fast as the pros and in multiplayer the experienced likely know how to group everything well with presses, But its nothing to worry about, in my opinion an RTS needs functionality in its hud and controls or it breaks apart. This has it and is easy to use.- Speed up/Slow down bar, to counter the bad of the game being slow paced or being fed up of just watching your men do a slow walk from point A to point B and repeat, or even just the time it takes to do a certain building, research or vehicle you can speed the entire game up which saves time, you can also slow down the game speed too which is useful for doing those hard decisions in which unit to attack or even just to time the retreat just right for maximum damage to the enemy and minimal damage to your own forces.The first two good things though are what really seal it though, its one of those things you have to see for yourself so you can understand, its very gripping, provided you don't mind doing a few reloads as you learn from mistakes. I guarantee it will happen.For the things in middle.- Soundtrack suits the factions and moments, but sadly they are short and repeat often, I don't mind it but I'm sure some may get annoyed with its frequent looping. I'd say its best music is the Main Menu music.- While I said the voice acting isnt exactly the best, I do find it amusing in moments, its the type of bad that can make you laugh at times depending on your sense of humour.- Similar to the soundtrack, sounds effects are also repeated over and over, its always the exact same gun fire sound and explosion for everything, again, this can be annoying if you want variety or don't like things being heard over and over, but to me anyway, they are decent enough to keep you satisfied, you know what the intention for each sound is and it works.- American campaign cutscenes are nicely drawn in front of you as the protaganist talks to you, I think its a nice effect, the Russian ones are done much differently, while I like them too for the sake of them looking and feeling different for obvious reasons, the American ones are in my opinion better to observe just for the artistic touch.- In game cutscenes are included too, but while I get some are nesscesary at times for moments in the game and to know what's happening, some of them are utterly pointless and waste your time doing something unnesscary, example, your given orders and told what to do, but instead of game just loading the next part, it decides to wait as you have to sit there and watch characters move out the map which you cant control or influence, and being the slow paced game it is, at times it can take awhile, nothing too big mind you, but it can be an irritancy to me.Well I think I've ranted enough, but overall this is a really fun game and I do recommend picking it up and giving it a try at least, I believe it needs more respect than what it got, suire its my inner nostalgic child demanding that but seriously, the title is right, its certainly 'Original' in how it plays.

Most of it is from playing by myself in multiplayer lobbies by starting up two instances of the game and joining them myself. I have only completed the American Campaign so far. I had this game in my library for about a year and played 2 minuted and put the last 58.2 hours on in the last 2 weeks. Thats how much fun I realized this game was. I will update this review at a later time.Edit: I usually play multiplayer during the afternoon and weekends. If you want to play, definitely add me. This game is worth it!			"

												This game really is one of those rare gems that never got the attention that it deserved when it was released.I picked it up at the local supermarket way back around 2002, when lookin through one of those boxes with heavily discounted stuff that couldn't be sold otherwise.I've played a lot of games over the years, but i have always come back to Original War.I've never found a game where the mix of RTS, RPG and resource management felt quite as interesting. The story is good and given the choices presented in each mission there is a good amount of replay value. Even if the character interaction is quite stereotypic, and the voice acting is terrible, it doesn't ruin the fasinating storyline and plot twists.At some point my copy of the game got lost. So when i found it on steam a couple of years ago, i couldn't help my self, i had to buy it again. I even bought a couple of copies for my friends, so that they could try this oldschool marvel that had taken up so much of my time over the years.This game really is worth trying if you are not to hung up on graphics. The game is 15 years old after all.surprisingly the game is still recieving the occational patch, as it has been picked up and kept alive by the community since 2005. New Mods are still being made, some of them really add some nice campaigns with good storyline.As I'm writing this, the game is on sale for less then a dollar.If my 188 hours recorded on steam plus my countless hours played from my original CD, is to be an indication of value for money, a buy really is a no brainer.

												This game is a jewel.I've spent many hours with it and consider it one of the best real-time strategies ever made, because it really stands up to its' name - it is original. Excellent game mechanics revolving around the most important asset of all - humans. Every loss hurts, whether it is soldier, worker, mechanic or scientist. After more than a decade this game also has beautiful graphics and terrific art. Every faction has its' face and feels different. Arabians/Mercenaries use speed, hit-and-run tactics and good infantry, Russians have brute strenght of heavy armour and time manipulation and Americans on their versatility. I think, that the setting of the game is one-of-a-kind. The characters are outright lovable and it is very easy to grow attached to them and that is not only because of the necessity of having good people in your army.Give it a burl! If not for these reasons, then for the ability to tame apemen and make them gather crates.10/10 Will give apemen machine guns again.			"

												One of my favourite RTSes, the plot might be a little silly (Though fun if you can get into it) the voice acting might be hilaribad but genuinely, it's a good game. It does away with resource/expansion camping, with resources appearing sporadically in random locations across the map, keeping players on their toes looking for and retrieving them. Also a bit different from the norm is the idea that your people are a resource, the setting takes place before modern man existed, making new recruits a difficult ask, the people you have with you are it, managing their time and keeping them alive is vital to success in the game. Combined, it makes for a really interesting experience, who's life do you risk to go and retrieve that fresh shipment of crates that just arrived from the future, do you give him or her a guard? If so that's two less people researching/building/fixing up your base!			"

												Great strategy game. It's not like a RA2 or other C&C game. Most important unit in game is HUMAN. You need them for ""almost"" everything. So there is RPG elements too for your characters. Game has SP and MP too but without skirmish, because there is no AI in this game. All ""AI"" is scripted in SAIL programming language. This game with skirmish could be the one of best strategy...A pro čechy, stáhněte si český dabbing, hra má jen české titulky. :)			"

												I remembered playing this game when it first came out, but forgot the name of the game. I found it again some time ago and fortunately it was available on Steam, so I bought it and started playing.It was even better than I remembered. This game is really underrated and offers a great RTS experience. At the time of its release it was really ahead of its time. I really like that the vehicles and buildings can be upgraded with different modules and configured as you see fit. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but I believe that the customizability will really add another dimension to the strategy. The single player missions are very nice. Sometimes the full out heads on assault just won't cut it and you have to use your smarts to overcome the situation at hand. Very challenging at times.Overall I suggest you try this game, should you like the RTS'.			"

												First, let me say that I've played many an hour of this game before it was released on Steam and so I can tell that if there ever was a great mixture of base-bulding tactical RTS with RPG elements, OWar is it. The limiting factor of your primary resources (building material and people themselves) which contrasts with the ability to recycle and train ""natives"" (apemen)/build AI war machines and all this combined with usually limited space of your base which you have to upgrade in certain way presents a very interesting decision-making tactical situation. Add a very interesting and thought-out storyline with different timelines as a result of the time travel and you have a great unorthodox game.You will want to know what happens next, you will want to know how your decision affects the outcome and you will want to branch out in the campaign to know what would have happened if you made a different decision. The game also offers tactical options, such as units with greater range then they can see, visibility obstructing terrain, including trees, higher ground granting firing range bonus. The soundtrack is also good and nicely themed - the sort of ""lumberjack style"" for US and the typical tunes ""Siberia style"" (as we nicknamed them with friends) for Soviets. Speaking of soviets, you will look forward for any communication with your superiors or cutscenes - all great jabs at the party propaganda and way of thinking.A great older game, RTS where a second here or there is not important, you actually want to carefully plan and execute.Message for Czech players about dubbing: Hra je i v češtině, ale jen titulky. Dabing je celý v Angličtině, takže pokud jste OWar dříve hráli a těšili se na parádní české nadabování, bohužel.			"

												If you love a good B-Movie, strategy games, and retro gaming experiences... this is an easy must buy. The game has aged poorly, the online is pretty much dead & is a chore to be a part of, and there is a handful of bugs with the actual game. How on Earth can someone recommend this game?First off, this game has a good storyline that has player make decisions, some of them that changes the game and are important. Imagine the story that's terribly cliche, a powerful resource that the most powerful individuals want control of, but the are in the territory of a country or territory they have no control over, but you just happen to have a time machine... what do you do?The answer, you travel back in time to move this resource into an area you do have control over so that, in the future, you can have a boat load of these resources. In the American campagin, your goal is to travel back in time before man to move this resource that you call Siberite from Siberia to Alaska. This way, you control the resource in the future. The setup? The Russians that don't belong in the same era anymore than you insists it's called Alaskite and would prefer you all move it to Siberia. With two different futures, these forces clash to fight for this so powerful resources and, more importantly to the soldiers, because they're simply ordered to. You probably have already guessed what the storyline for the Russian campaign is.There is drama throughout the storyline for both campaigns. Some characters have a personality that is likable, some not so much, and you develop newer technology as time goes by to fight the enemy. To really reveal anything more is a spoiler, but the story isn't exactly super amazing anyways. The gameplay is addictive. Anyone that likes old school strategy games will understand the value of this game. Each soldier is inexpendable, you do not have the ability to create more and each man lost is an actual loss. There is no getting these individuals back, they're dead. Each vehicle requires a driver unless you design them to be AI controlled, which has some draw backs for either choice. Each structure requires people to man it. Even defensive towers require people to man them unless, again, you make them AI controled which does have draw back. Your people, they're all important. The most important character is you, the main protagonist for the campaign. You must survive, or it is a mission failure and it's time to start over. With your people, you need to gather resources of three types to maintain your base. With these resources, you develop your base, vehicles, and the likes in order to maintain a feasible stance on the battlefield. You have to research technologies and abilities, you have to upgrade structures, you have to constantly improve yourself to maintain equal grounds, or even the advantage, with your opponents. Top it off, there is RPG elements that each individual person can improve which changes the difficulty of all these tasks, making it important which individual you use for each task.The soundtrack is pretty good, too. Graphics are not too shabby either. There is a lot of charm in this game even for today's standards. The modding capabillity is as simple as early Command & Conquer games too, so you'll find plenty of mods to keep it fresh if you like!So, it's a great game for a 2001 title. What are the draw backs?Well, it's terribly dated. There was a time when RPG elements in an RTS was rare. There was a time when soldiers that perma die and cannot be replaced was rare. Today, there is plenty with both of these. This is now nothing special.There is also the lack of good voice acting, or at least for the English version. I have heard that it's better in another language, but I only speak English so that's no good for me. If you cannot withstand B-Movie material, get ready to cringe. Additionally, some of the drama in the storyline can feel a bit empty or pointless when attempting to develop character depth.There is also a handful of bugs, which OWSupport is infrequently fixing. They used to be super active, but I have no clue as of now if this is still the case. Some problems include structures originally controled by AI in campaign can be captured, but they still auto build vehicles and such. There is also this terribly consistent frame rate slowdown that happens, as far as I can tell, randomly for at the very least Windows 7 users which I would report, but what exactly would I say other than ""so, there's a problem. I cannot tell you the cause of it, but good luck fixing it.""There is no singleplayer skirmish options, it's currently online or nothing if you don't wish to play the campaign. There is stories of mods being made, but I have not seen anything for I did not really look for it. There is this feature for the campaign where each time you complete a mission, it creates a tree under it. This is nifty, because every choice you make or every soldier lost will progress and make a difference, so if you replay a mission and made changes, it will create a new progression with a new branch. However, you cannot name these trees, so you will need to remember which is which.There is also a handful of dated issues. For example, you need to bulldoze down trees for base space, but you need to left click EVERY tree. There is also some lack in control when navigating around the battlefield unlike modern strategy games that give you a huge variety of ways to move the screen. This is an old game, if you're familiar with old RTS games, you'll know what to suspect. Overall, this is a great game for its asking price. If you wish to play it online, you will need to do some research on it. It's doable though. For singleplayer, it's a good experience. It's not too terribly long, it has a good amount of depth for its duration, it will bring no tears in your eyes but it's enjoyable. I think that due to the fact I played this game actively since 2003, I have a bit of a bias for this game. So it's difficult to realisticly rate it out of 10. I think that, in general, it deserves 7/10, but a part of me feels that is a bit low for what it really deserves. Pros-Good storyGood soundtrackGreat BalanceRPG elements, perma death, in game choices matterOnline and Mod community does exist, even if it is very smallMost of the bugs from 2001 are gone and they're infrequently fixing more of them.The ♥♥♥♥ing price, especially on sales, is very good.Cons-Acting is terrible, some of the storyline's drama is a bit cliche or boring, or meaningless to playersThere is some bugs still present, though they're very few in number they are also very noticable.It's a chore to play online, from port forwarding to running a third party software.It has some dated problems that probably will not be changed.*for modders* there is a lot of hardcoded issues that simply cannot be changed due to menu sizes and such, so there isn't a whole lot beyond different campaigns you can really do.

												Brief summary: Original War is an RTS with a look that feels old but not Dated due to its style that focuses highly around the story and characters. each mission if you lose a character the character is gone for good (except if a bug occurs in character selection on one or two of the last missions) so keeping your men alive is key. Story (few spoilers as possible):The story in it is kinda simple but complex without trying to give spoilers. During WWII America finds an alien artifact. after years of research and naming it EON they find crystals in Siberia of a similar nature to EON and look into both. they soon discover EON is a device that can send anything placed within, back in time, using the crystals now named Siberite. most of the Siberite is in Russian turf though so to solve this they send soldiers back in time 2 billion years in the past to transfer the Siberite over to Alaska. when they get there they find resistance however. The Russians are ready and waiting from them. Downsides:The sounds can get a little aggravating if you're not used to them. basically get used to hearing ""FINE SIR!"" or ""OKAY SIR!"" every time you move a unit, in a high pitched voice most of the time.  ocasionally there's a bit of bad voice acting too albeit most is pretty good. there are a few missions in the game where if you do not know what you're doing or haven't done the mission 50 bazzilion times before like i have it can be VERY difficult even on easy mode. The only ones really to note though are the ones where you join the Alliance so if you're not planning to its not a bother. Unfortionatley due to the game being fairly obscure most of the multiplayer is empty unless you can get a friend to tag along with you. the final downside is that the game Lacks a skirmish mode or an offline non-story mode. it would of benefitted greatly from it due to it being so hard to find a multiplayer opponent. Brief background summary:Original war is a game that proves even rushed games on low budget can be good. the company was starting to go bankrupt near the end of the game's completion so it was all they could do to quickly get the game out before they did. As the company that made it is not around to maintain it, the game has become community run and there's even projects to get a third campaign currently underway by people who want to see the game more known. There's alot of modding from the community too if you can find them. some such as a third Arabian campaign albeit short an unfinished and ones that let you do a skirmish mode as the game lacks one itself as i said previously.Conclusion:I would highly recommend it because the story is interesting, the gameplay is fun, the soundtrack is pretty good and overall it can be a great experience. If you like old games, obscure games or retro games then I would say you get this game in a heartbreat. for those just looking for a fun RTS I still highly reccomend it but i feel its worth looking at before you get it to see if you like it. not much a fan of giving number based ratings but hey, people like to know so here's mine.Gameplay- 9/10 -pretty fun but can be frustrating if you lose lots of units.Story- 7/10 -Starts good and pretty interesting but can feel kinda meh in places and can show at times its semi rushed. it doesn't take away from the rest of it though.Soundtrack- 6/10 I LOVE the soundtrack and music for this game however you will hear it ALOT so i cannot give a full rating of 10 as i would like to.Overall- 8/10 -Personally i'd like to give 10/10 but i cannot because the flaws it has show fairly visibley. even my huge nostalgia for the game cant deny that. however the flaws dont take much from the game and it is still a great one in my opinion.

												Oh, another great game I have fond memories of from my childhood. It's a must have! The multiplayer might still be a bit wonky, it's playeable thanks to Stucuk's (OWSupport) patches that are being gradually released on steam too. The story is just amazing. As you play through the campaing you get overflown by feels. Sometimes you have to do really hard decisions that affect the end result... very often even turn the tide of a battle. The characters are really well written for an RTS game of it's age. The graphics are good even for today's standards. Though the English voice acting compared to the Czech seems a bit poor. (Maybe it's because I grew to like the game with the Czech dub.) I noticed that the Czech voice actors put a lot more soul into it and the characters felt more ""alive"".All summed up. Get this game. It's worth it. It's brilliant.			"

												I remember spending countless hours playing Original War as a youngster so naturally I couldn't help myself from buying it once I saw it's available on here. This game holds a significant nostalgic value for me but it truly is a gem. It introduced (possibly pionieered?) a handful of unique features to the genre, such as: campaign/story branching, RPG elements, visibility mechanics, death system, vehicle design... to name just a couple. All these novelties enchance the gameplay greatly and make the game really stand out even nowadays. Original War came out back in 2001 and some of those features are nowhere to be found in more modern real time strategies. You just can't overesitmate the level of innovation and creativity that's present in this title, even by contemporary standards. The thing I like the most about this game though is it's absolutely amazing, immersive and original (pun intended) setting, based on Wolfgang Jeschke's novel ""The Last Day of Creation"". Time travel... Americans... Russians... apemen and resource war waged in the past... I'm in!Unfortunately Original War suffers from rather poor voice overs and lack of AI. The campaign missions are downright scripted and the game does not offer single player skirmishes against computer. Multiplayer is there along with a couple of play modes. I only wish there were more challenges on steam which would add some replayability value.Original War has aged a lot over the years but it's aged with dignity. I'd say it's definitely worth trying out, especially for people who are into old school gaming and especially for this price. Bottom line: this game deserves either a decent remake, sequel or prequel, would love to see it out one day. Or how about a FPS spin-off? Nah, I'm going too far ahead here - the world isn't ready.EDIT: they added 21 achievements one day after I wrote this review, wow. Looking forward to Original War 2 now, I guess.			"

												Strategic war without unit creation, but where every unit you have is a person with a name and a personality.RPG elements, where you improve the individual skills on all the members of your team.Very entertaining story.			"

												I hope that one day Bohemia Interactive remakes or makes a spiritual sequel to this game, although the story ends with this game, I still feel like the very essence of what this game is, is what the RTS genre needs. We tried going back to the roots of command & conquer, now let's go back to the roots of Original War.The game presents you with unique gameplay, a great story, laughs, tears and anger. A must buy, especially considering how it is priced. I still have my original CD-ROM, and where others have their old console games, this is my retro game that I refuse to give up on.			"

												I can't think of an example of a game, that is so brilliant, and yet receives barely any attention. The story follows an armed conflict between the world's superpowers, which fight over a control of a newly-discovered natural resource called siberite, with the twist that they sent their soldiers to fight two million years into the past by using an alien-constructed time machine, which uses that same substance they fight for as a fuel. While this sounds like a cliche B-movie (and it kinda is), every other aspect of this game is rather unique (some might say, pardon the pun, original)The game could be characterized as RTS. You build bases, in those bases you explore new technologies, build vehicles, defense towers etc. The game however features many RPG elements. As sending people to past is demanding, you only get a set number of soldiers for each mission. They all have names, personality, and skills, and they are at your disposal for the entire campaign. If you lose a soldier, you won't get a replacement, you are one man short for the rest of the mission. If you lose a skilled soldier that has been fighting with you since the beginning of the campaign, not only does this hurt your performance (you no longer have that guy that could all by himself clear out a small enemy base), you also lose a person that talked to you and other soldiers, made jokes, expressed concerns and otherwise interacted with the entire unit.There are many more aspects of the game and it's gameplay, that could be considered innovative, but I will leave exploring those to people reading this. If you are considering buying this game, then I can only recommend that you do. You won't get just another Red Alert or Age of Empires clone, I can guarantee you that you will get a game that is unlike anything you've ever played.			"

												Childhood nostalgia and one of the best strategy games i ever played if not the best. Story is about time travellling, aliens and riding a mastodont. There are two campaigns each with 20 or so mission for the main 2 factions, where some of the missions are from the point of the other side but they aren't the same missions as you may remember it from the previous campaign, there is always something different. Oh and your choice does matter!! It might take a while but character that survives in 3rd mission might pop-up in 10th and save the day. Actually all the characters are unique, you can't 'make' more, once they are dead, they stay dead. Don't even let me start on character development, yes this is a RTS but every character have it's own stats (speed, armor) that depend on it's level and a class (soldiers have more armor, are slightly slower and are better at fighting than scientists). Your only source of manpower are apemens with their own set of classes (yes, suicide vest apemen is one of them).The game has multiplayer but luckily it's not plagued by 'competitive' balancing so all the faction feel different, play different. Also it's much slower paced than most of RTS games.In conclussion it's a story driven RTS with massive RPG elements, original story, unique game mechanisms and it's cheap af. I bet you never played war so original as this. "

												Like all games i played when i was younger, i'm still not entirely sure if it was a really good game, or if it was just the fact that i was much younger.  In any case, i do remember also having played bad games when i was younger, and i remember having a blast playing Original War (over and over and over again), so i guess the fact that i was impressionable didn't make everything seem much better than they are.  Think what hooked me to this game was:- the fact that some characters are persistent: if they do well in one mission, they'll be better when they appear later; if they die in a mission, they're gone,- the starts and branches of the game are interconnected story-wise,  (although the story itself isn't all that great)- and you only ever have a limited number of characters and resources to play with, so strategy actually matters.Well, and it's a really good game.  I tried playing RTSes and didn't enjoy them for very long for the most part (C&C Red Alert was fun, for example, until everyone figured out that it's just a race to a tank rush), but really enjoyed this one for a pretty long time.All that said, it's also a really old game.  The gameplay is still there, and can't help but feel nostalgic for games where the only instruction you receive is ""Survive"" and if you don't, game over.  But the graphics are dated and a lot of things we take for granted in modern games (like detailed step-by-step guidance as to what to do next and well-nigh impossibility of failure or even penalty of any real sort) are simply not there.  Although, to be honest, i find that refreshing and kind of like that.  No idea if you will.			"

												A Fantastic RTS/RPG Hybrid that I wish I knew about 15 years ago, I would have loved it! Give this game a chance, it has a bit of a learning curve, but since you can pause and issue commands, as well as slow down and speed up the game at your leisure, you can truly think out each move.The story is highly original, and really interesting, across the 2 campaigns both American and Russian. Both Campaigns have a branching path to another faction known as the Alliance. You also have the Arabs, and the offshoot mercenaries The Legion. In fact, the modding community has brought back the Arab campaign that was originally planned by the devs. There are a few flaws in this game, but nothing major. Like I stated above, there is a bit of a learning curve, and the game does have a good tips pop-up on the UI, but I do wish there were more tooltips to explain certain icons. This is apparent on the Alliance last mission with the Artifacts you can use. I also wish the Apemen were used more, the Americans can't use them to their full potential, but more than that, except for a few missions, you only get maybe 3 apemen per mission.I am glad the Original War Community continues to support this game, and I hope it only grows. The game took me about 40 hours to complete with all of the achievments, which is seriously impressive for an RTS. I want to come back to this game from time to time and replay key missions, as well as play the full Arab Campaign once it is finally complete.			"

												Simply put - this game is awesome, the idea and the design of this game blew me away when it was first released and to think it came from Altcar (at the time a smaller lower budget company from Eastern Europe). The RTS RPG blend is brilliant and the difficulty is challenging even on easy setting. Keep your people alive or suffer the consequences long term. They live fight build and all learn valuable experience that makes them un-expendable. The characters speech is full of comedy and character interactions keep you smiling even as you curse every mistake you make.A must own game. Nothing else out there that matches it for originality!Top recommend.			"

												A briliant, underrated gem created around the golden times of the RTS genre. Original (duh...) gameplay mechanics, pretty, colourful graphics, with likeable characters and interesting, non-linear (in RTS!) story told from two different perspectives. What's not to like?It is a great shame that such a game didn't really hit it with the mainstream. But it still maintains a cult following, and even receives updates to this day after developers had given the code to the game to the community.If You like RTS genre, You don't mind older games and don't mind questionable quality of voice acting, then please, give this game a shot.

Micro and makro in real time strategy with posibilities of pause and changing game speed give you ton of posibilities.You can save thenever you want, i advice to do so often.The best is that game is simple to understand and has a lot of help tips.

Enough complexity to make it addictive, and simple enough to make it easy to play. The only downside is that you WILL lose many hours playing! I forgot to eat a few meals already! Brilliant game.

												The Online community by this game is still alive and you can find people to play here.Well long ago I did by this game on CD, it did really impressed me by the story and game play.Gameplay . You have here 3 Factions and your resource are actually your people.You in online games from 9 to 24 people, if killed they are hard to replace, you cant buy them again.You can let appear new , but even on fastest option it takes time.You change by your characters any time with right building in 5 Classes.Trooper, Scientist Mechanic Worker or Special trooper after Update. You can research a lot of Stuff here, and build a lot of interesting Tanks.Its a special RTS, in most you do just let people die, here you must look that they survive.By do their job the level up and are this way more efficient, but can be equipped anytime to do other stuff.You collect crates and can train apes to help you, build tanks and people do drive them. You can upgrade your tanks so far that they are controlled by PC, but Tanks with people are more efficient. You can fuel your tanks with oil and must refill them or with a special Crystal, so they don't need to be refilled.Best is the Story, there are several outcomes of the story and you can anytime look what would have happened if you choose the other stuff. Like what if you do side with rebels or stay by the order.You have really good characters you can either play American or Russia in the Story, in Multiplayer you can play Arab, who do have suicide Apes or their Tanks can explode. In Story each you your Troopers is a character with own voice and story,you do permanent loose a character if he dies, you don't have him in next mission, you can replay anytime the mission so more people survive. Its not like you have just 10 Missions and do them. There are situations like you are asked, stay loyal, rebel or join a new side. You can try out all 3 outcomes. So its more like 100 different ways to finish the game the way you want.Each human has its own name and portrait, speed, firepower and defense scores, and experience levels.American and a Soviet campaign are awesome. Missions on both sides tend to contain scripted events, multiple-choice situations and sidequests. Human units persist between missions, so that each loss is a loss for the rest of the game.The Story did really impressed me, not like today here you go just kill or bomb someone. If you still like 2D RTS games, you have here a solid, well balanced and good game.			"

												I can see that, if I'd played this game when it was first released, I would have strong nostalgic feelings for it. It may even have come to reside in that special place in my heart - you know, on the 3rd shelf, next to C&C. For many others, it clearly still does, as it benefits from a strong, active community.However, having only found this much later in its life during a Steam sale, I was somewhat disappointed. It suffers similarly to the RTS games of the same era from single- or two-trick-pony AI. The script and voice acting with which it is delivered are, frankly, terrible, undermining what feels like would have been a fun, novel setting back in its day. Even as a fan of the old-skool RTS games, I have to, somewhat sadly, say this was more miss than hit for me.Worth checking out if you are a fan of similar games from that era, but one I'd recommend you catch in a sale.Reviewed after just under 50 hours play.

												This game has nothing to offer (with the possible exception of story: don't know, did not play long enough), except nostalgia, that is not already offered in spades in many other RTS games.  The controls are clunky, and the game expects you to learn mostly by getting your nose bloody and reloading the game.  Marginally fun; and marginally OK, if there weren't much more polished products out there for dirt cheap (Age of Wonders, when on sale, for one; or even Age of Empires II).  Priced right, at the $1 or so I got it for; but, even at that, it is not worth the disk space.  Calling in my refund after writing this review.			"

												Game is poorly optimized unless you fiddle with it before booting (guide to be found in the Steam game-hub). This does disable any Steam-functionality, so no achievements for those intrested. Story is hardly inspiring, even though it does make a few twists and turns further on. Regardless, it's hardly enticing from the start.Pro's & Cons:+ Intresting gameplay mechanics (Vechiles running out of fuel are pushed by the driver, etc... intresting eye to detail)- No tutorials aside from the tooltips that appear AFTER you've constructed the unit/building or met the event. Confusing what units do/can do at first.- Cliché storyline: Starts off incredibly bland & far-fetched. Picks up if you can wrestle through it.- Pathfinding AI utterly garbage at times- Period in which the game is set is hardly used to its full extend (gameplay & story-wise).- Sound design: Repetitive voices & bland music hardly inspire.Final comments: Cheap, but not worth your time. MANY more games out there that are far better, even in its Russia vs USA strategy gerne.			"

If there is a video of this, I recommend you watch it first if you think that my judgement is a bit harsh after only 17 mins of playing. I bought it for like 80 cents, that's about the pricetag it deserves, the devs deserve to develop their skills and might eventually make that RTS game that we'll all know and never forget.

												the game is great however it did keep crashing on my computer after mission two. But i have fixed it now what you need to do isopen original war and where it says launch game, mod launcher, read me, website, configuration and quityou need to enter configuration and 1) Turn off hardware scrolling in game's settings (in the launcher).2 do not use extra video memery3 resolution 800x6004 windowed make sure they are clicked and then hit back and then start the game and that should fix it. Also do not forget to save it just at the end and start of each level as there is no auto save . So if you got a bad feeling that means save the game.after completeing the usa mission the game is great but crashes some times you need to un select the 1) Turn off hardware scrolling in game's settings (in the launcher).2 do not use extra video memery and then re select them again or the game will crash at the end of every mision and even on start up if you dont do this.  Game is great but with the crashes buy on sale do not pay full price as the crashes strips away the pounds from this game and it is a good game but with the crashes not worth full asking price so buy in sale like i did. and im glad i did			"
