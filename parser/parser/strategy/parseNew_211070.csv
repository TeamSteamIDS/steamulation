												It has a very annoying DRM, not only requires a Nick and mail (and that’s too much already) it is mandatory for you to give a name, address, phone… a lot of PERSONAL data for no reason that I can’t find its logic.Do they have a second business apart from gaming selling databases to sponsors or who knows?I ALREADY had installed it, my HD broke down and now it wants to register againPLEASE don’t encourage companies with these disgusting practices buying their products.

												Horrifically invasive DRM.  I thought this level of ""give us all of your personal information and register immediately and have an active internet connection"" type DRM was gone... or at least publicized.As for the game... it's a terrible Battle Chess wannabe.  And it's easy to tell why they were forced to change the name.  This is certainly not in the spirit of Battle Chess.  No charm, no character, and the animations (which you can't zoom in nearly close enough to enjoy) are canned and generic and the developers seem to think that particles can replace variety.  That's not the case.I paid 3 bucks for this and I'm a bit upset about it.  That'll teach me not to check the reviews page!			"

												It is animated and has some nice looking graphics, but does not give you more than one ai opponent and one chess set.  No tools for rewinding your game to see where you went wrong, or sugested opponents that chessmaster had.  There are maps to choose from but only one chess set, all you can change is the background.  If the oponent wins the game with their queen, she will bounce her ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  No way to check where you rank, if you are improving or not.  The tutorials are simple to the point how peices move, no strategy.  If your looking for animated chess and dont mind using one chess set, there can be great fun in the various challenges and play modes.  Graphics are nice looking with fantastic animation and sounds.  If you are learning chess maybe you can benifit from the tutorials to get you started, but this one is more for someone who is bored of the traditional chess peices.Also threefold repetition is not recognized.

												Buy at your own risk. Check vs Mate offers a profoundly confused game concept utilizing shoddy storytelling and nonsensical game modes to advance a single gimmick, chess as warfare. Punishing optimism with an exposition that even fails to accidentally tell a story. Without an active online community of players, narrative, or strong chess engine Check vs Mate cannot compete with free alternatives. Chess.com, Chesscube, Chess24, Redhotpawn and ICC are all better for straight up chess. Or if you want a twist: Chessmaster, Fritz, Rybka, Blitzin, Dasher(Stockfish/Fruit/Shredder/Crafty) and Battle Chess offer coherent chess variants. Check vs Mate is lost somewhere between a wheel spinning exercise in self deception and a text to speech app bugging on the phrase ""Slow Children at Play"".			"

												Not worth the paper it is printed on.Started up a ""Campaign"", where the first battle's goal is to capture all the opponent's Pawns.  I was given a legitimate move with my King to capture the last one, but because that put me in a ""Check"" position after, I wasn't allowed to move him.  Wait a second...  wasn't capturing the Pawns the entire goal?!  Apparently not.To add insult to injury the entire game is basically copied from Battle Chess, which is why the name changed.  And the DRM isn't that graceful.Save your money and get it (if you dare) in a bundle.			"

I like chess and I wanted to have a little fun watching animations. It is not the GOAT chess game, it is a chess game with animations, straight up plain and simple and that is why i bought it to play and little fantasy. The animations are great if you want to play in windowed mode look into the cfg file, overall fun chess game. I recommend for the sale price.			"

												**********NOTE******************Battle vs ChessCheck vs MateSame game, but both will activate on the same account and both will be added as separate games. Both link to the same store page but are exactly the same.If you own one, do not activate the other as it does not add a thing.*******************************************So loading this game up required me to register a bunch of personal details... input cd keys etc.The game itself can be normal chess, but you arent there for normal chess... There is a ddr mode for some reason, a few small minigames...But generally you are playing the game for its combat which is pretty much a hack and slash. You control one of the piece and hack and slash on a battlefield whenever 2 pieces meet.Ignore actual strategy in this game, its all about reflexes...Now, if you wanted to play normal chess, you wouldn't care about the combat mode. You would just play normal chess. You are getting this cause of random fights.			"

												This game reminded me of an older late 80s computer game called Battle Chess.  I've been looking for a similar version for some time, and this is it.  Like chess, but want to see you pieces battle it out as you capture you opponents pieces?  The queens are sexy.  Sometimes I don't care who wins when they are fighting each other.I haven't found any issues with the software.  I'm runnining the Linux version and haven't had to do any additional DRM like I see mentioned in the other posts (however, maybe that is what the Wine dialogue was supposed to be about that I saw when installing, but it didn't work-- but, it didn't prevent me from playing the game either).  Would recommend if you like chess, but wished it was slightly more entertaining.			"

												I decided to write a review for this since there's a great deal of misguided, negative reviews for this gem of a game. I bought Check vs Mate because of course I enjoy chess, but what made CvM stand out was that it had done FIRST what no other chess game had done: Animated piece fights to the death. This small detail added into an already awesome game made CvM worth looking into. I played it, I enjoyed it, and the only reason I don't have a whole bunch of hours into it is because I forgot how much ""fun"" playing against AI can be compared to a human player, and none of my friends had bought it until recently.Please ignore all the hateful reviews that are blatantly lying about a ""Horrifically invasive DRM"". I'm not a fan of DRMs, but CvM had no such DRM as described. I literally only had to register the CD key, and I started playing right afterwards. If you wanna complain about an annoying DRM, look at Uplay. To clarify, CvM came out August 16, 2012 whereas Battle Chess: Game of Kings came out March 17th, 2014 so people need to stop claiming Battle Chess came out with the animated piece fights first because they need to get their times straight.I'm honestly starting to think a lot of this hate is coming from people who are bad at chess and wanna take it out on the game for not holding their hand, so they come up with lies to make people not wanna buy the game.It's good! And for 86% off for $2.79 (currently), you're not spending a whole lot of money taking the risk. "

												Best Chess game I've seen on the market. The graphics and different styles of play keep it from being overly repetative. I like chess but playing it over and over again on the basic black and white windowed box that comes standard with your OS usually gives me a headache. So I would reccomend this to pick up the scenery a bit. 10/10. It looks fancy, runs smooth, is challenging but not impossible. PvP is really what caught my attention, kind of nice to have that option through steam. Anyways it's chess sooo if you like chess it's worth picking up in my opinon.			"

												Highly Disapointed.  Where to begin?  On the lower levels, the game is way to easy.  On the higher levels, the computer will (not always) but often, make a completely unexpected move like move the King forward (early in the game) to cover the bishop, and then move the king back on its next move.  It will even sometimes on its next movet decide to cover the same bishop again.  Also early in the game, I capture the computers Queen with mine.  My Queen is not covered.  This is known as a Queen Trade.  When I capture the computer's Queen, stading next to the computer's King, the King runs away?  I used to teach Chess to kids as young as 4 years old; otherwise you'd hear me say, I have never seen that.  On the highest level, the computer takes several minutes to make a move.  When the 7th move was exceeding 10 minutes, I quit the game.When you get into the different modes that it offers, it becomes kind of a joke.  There are two options for combat Chess.  IF you're good at Guitar Hero, you'll probably do well with the Duel part.  When the arrow key lines up in the circle, press the arrow key.  Do so successfully, and you'll begin to do damage to the piece you are fighting against.  In some ways, this part was done well;  but its not Chess.  IF you are attacked, you can defend your square, and make the attacking piece retreat, and have its health reduced.  When you go to capture a piece, win the combat and you get the square.  Lose and you stay where you are.  After about 4 games of this, I got good at it.  Now, I can advance a pawn straight up the field, taking each square as I go, and stopping the computer pieces from harming me.  I was able to Checkmate the king in 4 moves as I moved the Kings pawn straight up the field, put him in Check, and though the pawn wasnt covered by any piece, I beat the King in combat, and won the game.The graphics I think are good, if not a little predictable and repetitive.  You'll be sick of the repetitive battle music after 4 games, and the lack of additional ""Chess Sets""  is kind of disappointing.  Thought the intrusive DRM problems that everyone was writing about were going to be a problem.  Instead, after playing the game for about 2 days, I'm basically done with it.  What else can I say, I'd look elsewhere for a decent game.			"

												Do you wanna play chess like Ron and Harry Potter?If you love chess and past chess games like ""Chess Master"" and fighting games like ""Soul Blade"" then u will love this one. You can play chess the chess way or the fighting harry potter, my rook will joust yours and we'll see who winns E7 way.Over head or eye level zoomed in or not, lovely grafics and animated locations like a heavenly feelds, grass waving in the breeze- or Volcanic Mount doom exploding as the ground below crackles and seperates shaking your pawns.

												The DRM is completely invasive and redundant; however, give them fake info to counter that bit: problem solved. The game itself is great, the environments are nice and the AI seems good enough for my skill level. I would recommend this game and equally recommend that the game creators put down the pipe and realize that this game is on steam...we've all been verified already, no need for more DRM.			"

												A throw back to Battle Chess from the '90s, Check vs Mate offers up several modes of play and an AI that will keep you on your toes.  The visuals/music are well done and make for a nice atmosphere to play your games.  If there is one complaint I have against the game it is that the multiplayer is broken.  It would have been nice to play against actual players once and a while even though the AI does provide a challege.  Overall, if you are looking for a single player chess experience with a nice presentation then Check vs. Mate should fit the bill.			"

												This game or the franchise of this game was the very first game I was introduced to at the age of 4 and never left me since. If you guys want to have a match with me, let me know. Also, FYI you can play vs plp if you use the LogMeIN Hamachi program and make your own server to use so people can play against you. go to this link to download the corrosponding software and start owning people in the mother of all strategic games, Chess. http://hamachi.soft32.com/free-download?gclid=CLun4fjxrbICFak7Mgod5zUAGA "

												if you have windows 7 and chess titans then only get this game for the animation of pieces killing each other.  plays an okay game of chess.  plays only full screen, can't window it which imo is a pita.  the other built in chess variants imo are not worth having.  maybe for 5 bux...

												Worth the $5 sale price but probably not more. Some decent puzzles and the campaign mode is interesting. Sometimes there are different objectives and you are given a different set of pieces. I think this will really improve my chess game. Oh, and the real-time battles in the Skirmish mode is ridiculous but a very cool idea.			"
