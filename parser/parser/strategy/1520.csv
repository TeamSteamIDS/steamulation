												This is how much I love this game:14-04-2015, 12:00Channel Five News: ""Breaking news: The US has launched a pre-emptive nuclear strike against North Korean ICBM silos causing collateral damage to several large cities and thus inflicting more than a million casualties. The exact numbers are not certain but the city of Pyongyang was hit directly as five silos where reportedly located in the center of the North Korean capital. The decision of dropping nuclear warheads on North Korea has stirred massive debate between UN members on whether or not the US should be punished for its deeds.

												Defcon simply put is perhaps the most brutal yet elegant strategy game you will ever play. While the game only supports 1 map, little gamemodes and very little unit choice, this opens a whole new realm of micromanagement/strategy where games can be won in a matter seconds. I could go for a whole page critically examining the intricate depths of Defcon strategy and how intense but fantastic it is, but honestly I find the mood of Defcon speaks for itself......""The Defcon counter slowly counts down to DEFCON 2, as you manoeuvre your subs to deliver a fatal first strike to Asia. The slow hum of a massive turbine and background radio remind you of a massive nuclear bunker, where deep underground you are determining how many people die from your orders. The slow strings of a cello pass the time, as you anxiously wait for DEFCON 1.......3.........2...........1........the massive letters of DEFCON 1 flash across the screen along with a high pitched siren.Suddenly you spring into action clicking on your subs, activating your dormant SLBM's methodically targetting the major cities across the Asian continent. A quiet piano beings to play but you don't realise it when your too busy concentrating. As you finish the last of your targets another warning signal blares and a small nuclear signal flashes on top of your sub. The SLBM's slowly fire up, then gracefully turn towards their targets. Satisfied you take a break and nervously watch the SLBM's fall down as a now louder piano plays sombre, dark notes......flash......Tokyo hit....4 million dead.....success your first SLBM hits the target dead on, soon after the entire coast of Asia is alight with bright flashes and messages.....Beijing hit.....Honk Kong hit......8 million dead.....6 million dead. As the last of the SLBM eradicate the last survivors you glance at the scoreboard, excellent you are leading by 50 points. Content you move over to your Pacific fleet to co-ordinate your bombers to deliver another fatal attack on Asia and as you again click on further targets with deadly precission you hear the faint coughs of a woman along with the humming of the loud turbines. Horrified you realise how clean and elegant the deaths you have been presented with. A flash, a confirmation and a number killed. Reality brings you back as you further witness the extermination of the rest of Asia, the whole continent  glows brightly as ALBM's rain upon the cities illuminating the world map.Despairingly you imagine yourself deep underground, ordering the death of an entire population by a simple click and you don't even see their deaths. Only a small flash and a number killed.			"

												It's amazing what can be accomplished with a handful of previously used concepts and carefully balanced rules. DEFCON: Everybody Dies, the latest title from UK-based Introversion Software, places you in the middle of your very own nuclear bunker, planning the demise of the world above. Surprisingly enough, the most attractive aspect of this game is its simplicity. A single glance at a screenshot will quickly illustrate that this isn't a graphics-intensive game which, like so many on a nearby retail shelf, incite purchases with incredibly realistic rendering.DEFCON is like a game of chess with a deadly spin: a series of units is placed on a pre-defined map and a set of strategic actions take place. However, when the king falls, more than half of the world's population has been killed. As the website suggests, it's not about winning, it's about losing the least. The game divides the world into six territories  which are pitted against each other in an epic struggle of who will press the big red button first.Since the rules of the game are so easy to understand, anybody can quickly join in on the mayhem. As the game timer advances, the DEFCON level increases, changing the combat options of the players.The key element to this game, which Introversion has expertly mastered, is maintaining the atmosphere. No dramatic music is queued when launching your nukes, no explosions challenge your subwoofer when a city is vaporized, and no screams are heard when a few million people die. DEFCON highlights just how easy it is to ignore the painful deaths of half the world's population when you're safely hidden in an underground bunker somewhere, plotting the demise of the enemy.DEFCON has a fairly nice presentation. Both the game's manual and website are built on a very fitting template made to look like a 50 year-old booklet which hasn't been touched since the end of the cold war. The manual reads fairly easily, in part due to the simplicity of the game.The auditory elements of DEFCON are limited at best. The game's atmosphere thrives on solemn low-volume music which just barely breaks an otherwise dreary silence. Whilst the tracks themselves are fairly good and appropriate, most gamers won't really notice unless they really crank up the volume.DEFCON is clearly intended to be played against human players. The variety of tactics and strategies that make this game challenging can only come from human minds. The AI is still respectably intelligent though, if you're not quite ready to challenge real players.Simply put, it's an amazing game. It could be argued that the appeal is limited, as after all, there is only one map to play on. But due to shifting alliances and perceived threats, the game never fails to feel anything but completely fresh.An interesting concept, classic battle graphics and tremendous replayability, this game has it all.

												Have only been playing the game for a very short while and have found myself in a very Fallout style 'Great War' situation between China and the United States. - I sweat nerviously as minor skirmishes lead to my Naval power being destroyed beyond a pair of Submarines hiding away in the Ice Caps. -The Chinese Navy has prevented any Recon Aircraft from penetrating to find the Chinese silo and Radar locations.-Nearly an hour passes in DEFCON One and neither side takes the final steps toward the Nuclear Madness, I sneak my Submarines deep into Chinese waters, one off the coast of Tokyo, the other off the coast of India. -I step away for a moment to make dinner.-Alarms blare, Panic ensues. I return at a dead sprint stubbing my toe on a table and falling to the floor screaming in agony. I shout to my Girlfriend ""FOR THE LOVE OF GOD FIRE EVERYTHING!""-In the Chaos, Silo's spit forth their rods of death at major Chinese Cities. Aircraft Scramble from the assorted airfields located in Alaska, Fighters to draw fire for the Bombers carrying their horrifying cargo. The Chinese respond in kind, their Silos bursting to life. My submarines seize the opporunity to deliver a harsh counter attack firing their arsenel at Chinese silos.Soon i manage to collect myself and make my way back to my computer horrified at the propects that await me. To my even greater horror i realized something. The Chinese didn't fire first. A TV show my son was watching in the background had alarms and threw me into a panic. Soon after the casualty reports came in.9/10 would plunge the world into a Nuclear Apocalypse because of a kid's TV show again.			"

												This game only really comes alive in multiplayer as you destroy all of some poor Guy's cities and turn them into a glowing pile of  thermonuclear waste and ash. The plodding slowness of the ICBM's to reach their target will make you groan with impatience and yet the sheer amount of things that need to be micromanaged will make you feel almost badgered. It all goes towards the tense atmosphere it manages to create.. The simple retro graphics are also great and also help to distract you from looking back on the film in a sort of  'Flight of the Navigator' way.  (Let's face it, this foreboding map and the 'Control Room' thing that looked like NASA were the coolest things about it) The audio is bang on .. but I have headphones on for teamspeak so that woman's anguished screams are just too creepy .. if you could just turn her and her coughing off it would be a plus.Oi Introversion! I will give you a better review when I get the email about how you've all started work on Darwinia 2. <-- Apparently this is the sad state of gaming journalism these days. Shame, but gotta move with the times. Here is my quote for the website, metacritic, steampage, box .. I hope they use it as it took me a while to come up with .. 'DEFCON It's like digital Chess, if Chess had loads more moves and thermonuclear weapons.' GazOverall .. good game.			"

												DEFCON, in simple terms, is a simulator/game where you can destroy entire countries and continents by using nuclear weapons to decimate populations and cities whilst watching them burn. You can choose to be either North America (Canada, USA), South America (All South American countries), Africa (All African countries), Asia (Most Asian countries and far east countries), Europe (All European countries) or just Russia (Just russia, duh). There is a DEFCON timer, in which it starts from DEFCON 5 all the way to DEFCON 1, signalling nuclear war. The DEFCON system is a US defence and readiness condition system in which state the military should be readied at, depending on the current condition, five to one. Slowly or very quickly depending on what speed you want it on, the DEFCON level will drop until it reaches DEFCON 1 and nuclear war will begin. The game is based on a film called Wargames (1983) and is about a hacker who gains control of NORAD's nuclear missiles and threatens nuclear war. The GUI and game is very similar to Wargames' control systems and computer simulations. In order to start the game you need to select one of the continents, you can place down radars, missile silos and airbases. Each one of these has a certain strategic importance. Radars can detect incoming nuclear missiles from nuclear submarines or land based silos and show their trajectories. Airbases have the ability to launch fighter and bombers to city targets or fleets of ships in the oceans, the bombers can also drop one nuke onto a city or military target. Silos obviously have the ability to fire up to 10 missiles anywhere at a target. Silos can also become air defence systems in which they will shoot down incoming missiles, fighters and bombers within their range. There is also the ability to place fleets of ships (nuclear missile equipped submarines, battleships and aircraft carriers). Submarines can attack ships on the surface of the sea and sink them and can also fire nukes at cities within a shorter range than silos but they are more stealthy. Battleships are an all-round ship, they can attack all kinds of ships including aircraft. Aircraft carriers can launch nuke bombers to cities or military targets and attack them and launch fighter jets to attack ships. It is also worth mentioning, you can't win. It is impossible to win. As the games motto/slogan says ""Everybody Dies"". The whole object is to loose the 'least' by having less casualties.  For each 1 million citizens killed, your continent gains 2 points, for every 1 million citizens killed on your continent, you loose 1 point. The game is easy to grasp but can be a bit challenging at times and difficult to use. It does take time to learn, but hey, its really cheap on sales and what isn't good about nuking the ♥♥♥♥ out of Africa? TL;DR11/10 would nuke Africa multiple times again.			"

												This was my first game bought online on steam... years ago. It's an an-and-off relationship, and recently I got back into it a little, and the old fever caught on again!Pro:- not much required in terms of specs (although it can blow the fan a lot in certain situations)- UI has a great visual design- soundtrack is fitting- game mechanics depend on other players to work out one way or another: good online games are common- interesting game modes, for example: diplomacy. Everyone sees everything at the beginning, being in one team. Who defects first? Lots of maneuvering and chit-chatting among parties and backstabbing! Oh the backstabbing! Boy did we have fun with that!- can't strain this enough: the players are awesome and you need to communicate with others in larger games- there are some mods out there- this is a fun game that at the same time illustrated the madness of nuclear weapons in real life: you juggle multiple millions of lifes around with the press of a button! It's not about winning... it's about losing the least!Meh:- Units need to be selected individually, no C&C-style multi-selection. This makes it extremely fiddly when starting an all-out attack, and you definitely give away that something is going on when slowing down the game speed as is necessary- the community is still active, albeit in small numbers: sometimes you need to wait a while to fill a server. once you find a suitable game, it's awesome. - usually longer games. my longest was 6 hours real time!Con:- smaller bugs live forever: sometimes units' targets can't be switched in time, and the UI seems unresponsive. Maybe it's a feature but it comes across as a bug because this made me blow up my own stuff by accident more than once. Verdict: Get it. Get it now! 10 bucks are fair for this game. Sometimes it's on sale. GET IT! And then everybody dies...			"

												DEFCON is perhaps the only game which allows you to commit a global-scale nuclear genocide...and award you for it.Although simple in design, this is probably one of those rare games which have a ""timeless"" stamp on them. The slick, elegant graphics that pay homage, or rather, ""totally worship"" classic films such as Dr. Strangelove and WarGames, serve their purpose in a most appealing way. You may only see one screen in the vanilla game, but it is more than enough for the sheer beauty DEFCON is.Background music also deserves massive praise - it is simple, minimal, ambient, atmospheric, yet haunting. Haunting is the right word. It is the perfect setting for this game. Hearing a distant, muffled cry of a woman somewhere in the background while the screen is coldly informing you that you have you just erased millions of lives is an experience no other game offers. As for the gameplay, the most important thing, after all - do not be fooled by the looks of the game. It is a complex strategy title, a unique one in the bunch, which doesn't fall back behind any of its genre ""collegues"". There are many ways to commit nuclear holocaust, many little details and tactical manuveurs to be had - I admit myself that I'm still quite an unskilled player, but seeing the ways I was eradicated of the map and reading several walkthroughs, I can confrim - this game is truly a strategy game.Only real flaw of the game is its community, or to be precise, the lack of it.I had to wait for more than half an hour, sometimes, to fine an open spot in a game. Creating your own game can result in even more time spent.However, there are still players, you just need to be a tad bit lucky.In the end, I recommend this game - if you're interested in an unique experience, picking this up on a sale day is no wrong doing.

												Get this game. Sit down in a dark room, headphones, no distractions. Set up a cold war scenario, America Vs USSR or some variation of East Vs West. Doesn't matter which side you are. Turn radiation on in the options menu. Imagine you are a commander in a fallout bunker, your only connection to the outside world is the screen. Your duty is to 'win' the coming war. Keep it at real-time speed.As the final klaxon goes as DEFCON 1, watch to little blips that represent fleets, fighters and bombers dance on the screen before flashing from existance. Feel every second your warheads arc towards the enemy. Listen to the broken radio chatter, people you can't save, thier lives becoming a statistic on the screen. When the 'victory' timer begins, take stock of what has happened. Continents now uninhabitable radioactive wastes. Death tolls on both sides in the tens or hundreds of millions. How long did it take to create hell, just a few hours? Less? The 'Victor' is announced on the screen with cold detachment. Uninterested in the millions of lives lost or the billions more doomed to much slower deaths in the coming nuclear winter. There is nothing more to do on the screen. Everybody dies.Experiance this game. Its as close to seeing a nuclear war hopefully we'll ever see.			"

												One of those games that is both well programmed and well made to make nuclear war just another giddy joyride.The game focuses on a world during the late 70's and early 80's, where nuclear war is taking place, and up to 6 nations can declare into it, the nations include The European union (and several other nations not currently in the EU) The USSR, (A and some parts of Kazakhstan) Asia (Not Ocenia, Australia, or Mongolia) Lain America (Not including Cuba) Africa, and North America including Canada and the United States.In order to win, you must get more points than your foes, you get points by killing each millions of people with your ICBMs, there are multiple modes, but I'm covering the stock mode.The game starts at Defcon 5, you can place Radar on your territory, Nuclear Silos (Which will shoot down enemy bombers and fighters as well as launch ICBM) and finally, military air bases that can launch Bombers with nuclear capacity, and fighters.Also during Defcon 5, you can place ships, either battleships, which focus on fighting directly at sea, Subs, which can scan the area and launch nuclear missiles (However said launch will let the rest of the players see them) and Carries, that can't fight, but can use depth charges to take out said Subs, and can also launch bombers and fighter jets. (Each jet also has some small amount of radar to let you see enemy silos and Radar)You can only place units until Defcon 3, when battle becomes more intense, and you are allowed to send jets into enemy territory to scan for military bases and whatnot.After getting to Defcon 1, Nuclear weapons are permitted, and can be launched by Bomber, Silo (Which will prevent the Silo from protecting against incoming jet, bomber, or ICBM.)After you or them launch, the entire game flashes with the warning that one of the players dared to go launch nuclear missiles, and silos (Or Subs) That are launching them will be revealed to the world, and nuclear missiles will launch, but will only be seen if it's under a general radar of a team..A nuclear missile will destroy Radar in one hit, and air bases in two, and silos in three, also destroying half of that building's current housed warfare. (Be it be bombers/fighters or ICBMs)A missile, hitting a city, will kill half it's living population, which is usually a a couple million each hit, depending on where you strike. Despite a majority of the community is gone, the game is still here, unlike TF2, which is aimed at multiplayer play, this can be played with well programmed AI, of which aren't generic, and actually are quite hard at times.The achieves, however, can't actually be attained form fighting bots, so you have to play online to actually get them, but due to a dwindling community, it's quite hard to find those players, so try to get friends to play if you want to competition against an actual person.

												I don't usually buy games like these, but after playing the demo, I had to have it. There's just something about strategy games such as these that make me feel in control. ""The Life In the Machine"" story from the reddit no sleep board described it perfectly:""People in their daily lives have no control over their environment. They are told what to do, where to go, and how to live. Their jobs consist of standing or sitting somewhere until it's 5 PM and they're allowed to head back home. It's no mystery they're unhappy.For many people videogames are an escape to a world where they are in control, or live exciting fake lives filled with adventure. The aspect of control is found in strategy games.""Or in this case, the strategy of nuclear holocausts. Military strategy games in general draw my attention, but the simplicity of this game makes it seem real to people who don't know any better. I love it.			"

												The Cold war= A very expensive and deadly d*ck measuring contest.  9/10Edit - since not alot of people can take a joke in reviews , i gotta say this game is very good. The learing curve is quite easy to learn , but difficult to master .I have approximately 20 hours in offline mode , you can still find people playing multiplayer despite the game being released in 2006 . There some bugs here and there and some occasional crashes. But its realtively a stable game. Its a realatively small game about 60mbs , you can play it anywhere and it cost about 1 dollar when it is on sale.  The feeling of being a genecidal  general and  watching  enemy cities get annihlated  Is fun  , a must have for any military or Strategy game buffs.			"

												This game should be in everyone's library.It has a dark view of the global wars and what will actually happen. Game play is really slick and better with all humans, as alliance's are a big part of stratagem, when to side with someone stronger/weaker and when to finally stab them in the back.At first glance and after a couple of games, it looks easy to play, but the more you do the more thought and skill is involved.The guys behind this game are really approachable as well.

												A deceptively intuitive, dark, and horrifying game of nuclear apocalypse. You play as a general in an underground bunker, and make the decision to launch the missiles to (hopefully) kill more of them than they kill of you.PROS:+Deceptively easy to learn, difficult to master.+Absolutely minimal graphics requirements. You could likely get this to run on Windows 95.+Yet the above-minimal requirements work for the aesthetic, which calls back to the maps in NORAD from WarGames.+Game can be played both at a high speed (completing in as little as 30 minutes) or in real-time (stretching to as long as eight hours).+Game has a notable focus on the Nuclear Triad, with the ability to launch missiles from Bombers, Submarines, and Missile Silos.+Game has an amazing atmosphere. Even in victory, you take one look at the total civilian deaths and feel empty inside.+Highly strategic game with an emphasis on placement of your bases (including radar, airbases, and missile silos). Poor placement leads to an easy defeat.CONS-Not for everyone. Some people can't handle the long, slow gameplay many games stretch out to, while others simply don't like strategy games (perhaps even on this scale).DEFCON holds a dear place in my heart, and is best played with all of the lights off, in a room where the only light comes from the monitor fortelling the end of civilization as we know it.

												I've now managed to waste over 7 hours of my life on this game. It actually suprised me when I saw my time played because I never thought I'd spend more then 20 Minutes in this game.Your goal in Defcon is to 'win' a nuclear war by gaining the most points. (There are other game modes aswell but we've never played those) You can get these points by sinking the enemys fleet or nuking their cities. You can play singleplayer against AI or multiplayer with or against your own friends or some randoms.Its a complex but small game that i recomend you to buy when its on a sale. I don't think its worth 9,99 €.			"

												If you remember the old Film 'WARGAMES' then you will instantly know what this game is all about. You control a nation and it's entire military, including it's nuclear arsenal. You have other opposing nations and the objective is to descimate them while keeping your own country safe from harm. DEFCON is a very challenging game, not in the sense that each country has any real advantage over the others, but in the sense that there is no real sure fire route to victory. The soundtrack also gives a rather creepy yet fitting undertone to the game. After playing this game, i'd actually recomend going to play Fallout 3 myself, it would kinda fit afterall. But should you want a rematch, then try the different continents, or a different alignment for your facilities. This game is a good deal of fun and i would absolutly recomend it.			"

												Defcon is one of those games, or your everyday products, that will grant you a different perspective and will eventually change your entire perspective when it comes to understanding the big picture. You'll end up playing an imaginary god of war and you'll ruin or *save* more lives than you would -or wouldn't- think of.You'll get the ultimate point of view and the game will hand you a set of warfighting machines and mechanisms to kill as much as people as you can in order to win an endless war. - Or, simply use Diplomacy. Which might seem boring; And it actually is, when it comes to the comparison between killing millions to kill more millions. At this point, Defcon gives you the ability to slaughter the nature itself and unleash the true nature of men; Unleash the savage side of yours upon the entire World. - And, eventually, turn our little blue and green *heaven* into a dust.With its minimalist and just-enough artstyle, Defcon is one of those games that will never get old.

												The only thing I can put here are some quotes from the game itself and elaborate on them. ""Everybody dies,"" is not an understatment. Doing well at this game is being nuked to hell, and doing poorly is getting nuked to hell, and then some. This game is brutal, addicting, and the AI is one heck of a challange. ""It's not about winning, it's about loosing the least."" This statment fits the play through so well. When you ""win"" you don't feel like you won, because you didn't. You feel like you've been tranpled on, but managed to make it out, dealing tons of damage to the person that hit you. You can't win this game, simply lose the least. Never-the-less, it is rewarding to see that you made it... with bilions of deaths world-wide.			"

												Brilliant atmosphere, you feel the tension of the impending nuclear war as the timer counts to the next DEFCON level, moving your units in to destroy as much of the opposing continent as you can. Then you reach DEFCON 1 and watch the nukes you launched heading to kill millions, while the grim background music plays. It's too simple though, ships and planes move and shoot eachother on a small map for about 10 minutes while nukes fly overhead. I was hoping for it to all come together and get me hooked, but I got bored after an hour. I don't hate it, I simply enjoy other games much more.			"

												This game is scarier than any of the horror games I've played- and it's not even a horror game! It's a simulation/strategy game about nuclear war, if you couldn't figure that out. You nuke the enemies' cities to earn a better score, and if the enemy nukes your cities (or destroys your units), then you lose points and stuff. The team with the highest score wins. It is a very dark game, for example: you can hear people crying sometimes and when a city is hit with a nuclear missile it shows the amount of people who were killed, it's especially frightening if it's a place you live in or if loved ones live there. The soundtrack is FANTASTIC, and sets the mood of the game PERFECTLY. I'm not very good at playing the game, but you don't even have to play! You can set up AI battles, and I sometimes hop on and watch one. They're actually pretty entertaining, and the AI is good in my book. Speaking of setting things up, it's very customizable. A single game can be very time consuming if played in real-time, and the nukes take a while to reach its target. Also, when I played in real-time (and quit after ten minutes i dont have time for that) I felt like I was the one giving the OK to launch the nukes and responsible for the millions of deaths I caused, not to mention feeling guilty about my cities getting exploded by the enemies. Overall, it's a pretty good game, but it can be difficult and is very dark. Unfortunately, the last update was sometime in 2014, so it seems that the developers have stopped updating it, however it feels finished and the price is reasonable for $9.99 USD. 8/10 - Solid game. But why is it scarier than the horror games I've played? That's because it can actually happen...			"

												Well... Let's say, I'm a hardcore gamer that has seen many both strategy and war-like horror games, but...I just can't play this one. Seriously. I thought it would be a fun fast paced strategy, but...It just... It tears you apart with that pure horror of nuclear war. 10/10 strongly recommended!			"

												This game is pretty good, or at least I think it is. The game has DRM inside of its Steam client for no god damn reason. This game, upon startup, requests authentication from Steam. However, even in 2014, they still have not fixed a bug where the game just will not authenticate and only runs in demo mode. I paid for this game and I deserve to be able to play it. I recommend if someone else wants to play it, buy the non steam version.			"

												I bought this game on sale during the winter of 2016 for around $3.00, and I really enjoy it for the price. There are a lot of people having technical difficulties getting the game to actually function, but I haven't had any, and I'm running on a laptop. This is a fun low-demand game for people with cheaper PCs (I've heard it doesn't run on Macs but I'm not certain), but it isn't without its flaws. The game itself is fine and allows for a large amount of strategy and seems like one of those games you might play at an office, having a LAN party (It even has a stealthy office mode, in case the boss shows up), much like DOOM might have had, back in the day. The soundtrack leaves a little to be desired, but from what I understand, this game is highly moddable, though I don't use mods myself, so it seems like an easy change to make. Cons about this game is that, due to its age, there are not as many people playing anymore, and those who are are often far more experienced than your typical new player. Fortunately, this game is just as much fun in single player, allowing for a maximum of 6 players (plus spectators) in any game. There is a variety of game modes that can either stress fast decision making, diplomacy, aggression, or defense, meaning that there's always something else to try. If you can find a few friends to play this with, it's definitely worth a few game nights, since alliances can be made or broken on the spot, in game. DEFCON does not support in-game voice chat, though, so maybe run skype in the background. All in all, I give this game an 8.5/10			"

												You start a game placing down your ""defenses.""You then begin to slowly deteriorate that word till it is practically a synonym for ""tools for world wide genocide."" You even get a nice little tally too of how many people are dead thanks to your negligence, even some stats come up when blowing the c**p out of a nation as to how many people were caught in the blast of your death dealing.Then you end the game knowing you have basically wiped out most of the world in unexplained, random and (if you are with friends) grudge-filled gamer rage of tossing near infinite nuclear warheads at each other.

And then the waiting game begins as you watch the countdown descending towards DEFCON 1 when you can set your nukes on course for your Friends continent and striking down their cities and silos before they do the same to you.Simplistic, quick game about nuclear war.

												Amazing game. It's very simple, both visually and gameplay wise, but there's a lot of thinking behind it. The whole game intentionally feels detached emotionally, giving players an awkward, sometimes distubing feeling as the game casually announces that a million people have just been obliterated. The point is to provide an emotionless simulator, which profoundly impacts one's view of a nuclear war. The game doesn't try to flood you with emotion, but rather pries emotion out of the player by simply, mechanically reading the facts. It's a lot of fun to play, and while it's easy to play there is a lot of strategy behind moves and unit placement. The visuals are very simple for a game, but it's perfect for a nuke sim. It doesn't need fancy graphics, why have them? I think they've done a fantastic job, I love this game!!			"

												DEFCON is a Cold War based strategy game inspired by the 1983 classic film Wargames, starring Matthew Broderick. The game itself is played in satellite-view above Earth where you play as a Military General who taken shelter in an underground bunker while having total control of weapons of mass destruction. Your goal is simply to annihilate all your enemies before they return the favor.Here is the catch, NOBODY WINS! EVERBODY LOSES. Since every corner of the world is armed to the teeth, the only thing to pray for is to have the least casulties.On behalf of it's all it's players, the reason for it's mixed reviews is mostly because this is a very difficult game to play, the mechanics are unlike the usual games featured on steam.Prepare to sink into madness with the most unsettling, depressing and terrifying music you will ever listen to, and it's done on purpose.FYI: DEFCON is an acronym for DEFense readiness CONdition, it's a alert state developed by the Joint Chiefs Staff and used by the United State of Armed Forces. Under certain conditions, it increases levels from DEFCON 5(lowest state of readiness) to DEFCON 1(Nuclear War Imminent)8/10 Prepare to be accused of murder, on a global scale! "

Your horror instantly becomes rage how can I get back on these pesky Russians. I then spot my hidden submarines just of the Russian coast, full of beautiful nukes.

												Good game - who doesn't like nuking the crap out of someone?However, the online multiplayer is dead. It is really hard to find a match, and when you do nobody ever speeds it up. The best part of this game is mulltiplayer (Just like Civ) because, at least in my mind, it is way more fun playing with a person you can actually talk to and strategize against - and maybe even ally with. The computers (or should I call them mindless drones?) will never befriend you, always act the same, and it always feels the same.I personally think that it would be way better if more people played. However, the game is still fun, even in sungleplayer.Due to the deep strategy you (may) be able to incorporate in singleplayer or multiplayer, it is still a good game. More of a timekiller for me, but if I find a match its on.I still have to recommend - maybe more people will start playing multiplayer sometome.7/10EDIT: Eh, more like 7.8/10 - Earth probably has too much water anyway.

Product received for free
												Defcon first thing I have to say in my review. I love the game is motto, everybody dies. Also upon launching the game and gazing upon the menu. I noticed that apparently the official URL for the games website is titled. Defcon Everybody dies.Com, which I personally found to be absolutely hilarious. Also I love the plot of the game which is apparently it is 1983 and you are a General, Hidden away in an underground fallout shelter. While are you are leading your chosen alliance into total Nuclear armageddon. Simply just the setting and the plot of Defcon reminds me of the novel, On the beaches. In that novel pretty much the same thing happens at the end, everybody dies, no survivors. I love the art style of the game, which reminds me of a radar screen thing. I also love how the game plays this very eerie music, that simply reminds me that this is the end of the world. And I am a guy who appreciates excellently written and performed game soundtracks. But so far I've only played against the AI, but I still found the matches to be extremely entertaining. Even though a lot of people would say otherwise. Because I simply love strategy games. Defcon is simply right up my alley. It is just simply mesmerising to me seeing my nukes giving hell to the Russians, especially Moscow. And also see Beijing getting flattened at the same time as well. But when the match is over, and the population display is entirely red. Indicating that everyone has been practically annihilated in those areas. And the matches final score is tallied. For some reason it feels so dam rewarding to have practically murdered so many millions of people. And my real first match I played as what is practically the EU. (before the UK left) in a solo match against the USSR AI. I murdered as my final score 45.6 million Russians. Even more people than Hitler and Stalin combined could have ever hoped for. But they are all Communists, so who gives a dam?! Also I may have killed Putin as well loI. love how when you start a match you have a brief moment of calm, before the storm when everyone is on Defcon 5. For you to decide your strategy. Placing down your missle launches/air defences, fleets, bases, and finally your radar stations. Also the game does have modding support which is really neat. But so far the only mod I've seen is a mod that changes the map to an real world map.But however I do have a couple of issues with Defcon. I don't like how in a full match it is practically just a big free for all. No allies or alliances, but I supposed you got give some slack. After all, it is the end of the world. So why the ♥♥♥♥ not as we give the UN, The only thing a supposed to be stopping a total nuclear war from happening. The middle finger, as we go into the point of no return, otherwise known as Defcon one, everyone will die. Also the normal asking price for the Defcon is 11.99 NZD. Is a bit too much in my opinion considering that Defcon doesn't have a lot of content or replay ability. I think 5 NZD is away more reasonable asking price. However I bought my copy on sale, 85% off - 1.79 NZD. Which I think in my opinion is way more reasonable, and you should deathly wait for a sale to buy Defcon. But for mods there are no steam workshop support, which is quite unfortunate. But above all as my final conclusion. I can happily conclude that Defcon is deathly a game worth buying and recommending, for anybody who loves strategy games. Especially if you are like me, and loves post apocalyptic books and so on. If I was to give an score rating of 10. It would be 6 out of 10.			"

												This game is FUN! When i picked it up I was not really sure what type of RTS it would be. I can say after some initial confusion it exceeded my expectation. I am a fan of C&C, WarCraft, StarCraft and AoE type RTS games. Ones with resource gathering and elaborate tech trees. So when I started playing Deacon I was NOT in familiar territory. In fact my first play session I was so confused on the most basic controls that I lost 95m people without landing a single nuke on my enemy. I thought the game was broken…… but then I cam back and tried again. I learned more each subsequent match until i FINALLY won! Once you figure out the ins and outs of the game it is very rewarding. All sides start with the exact same resources and do not get anymore. It is all about unit placement (and starting territory) and then how you move and deploy them. My only complaint is that there is not a more robust skirmish mode that allowed the user to make more unique scenarios. If you like chess, the movie war-games or planning a nuclear winter, this is the game for you! "

												As I have always been interested in the Cold War I thought this game would be fun to play and decided to get it and I am  glad I did.At first one may be fooled into thinking this is a simplistic game, as compared to the graphics of other RTS games, the graphics are basic but then again the game is recreating the big style screens that were on the walls in the NORAD command center and it recreates it well.Also the options may also seem limiting at first, as once again, you do not have hundreds of options to choose from but maybe a couple of dozern or so but behind this is a lot of strategy that does not forgive mistakes.For $9.99 this is a good buy and I highly recommend this game.

												Propably one of the most original strategy games ever to grace our computers, with all of the gameplay mechanics cleverly reconstructing the dread and absurdity of ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Wargames"". It's not just a strategy game about nuking your oponents to Stone Age - here warfare is not only a multi-layered clash of bombers, missiles and subs, but also a psychological conflict of bluff and patience.  Simple and accessible interface, plain, easy to grasp rules and haunting soundtrack all create a unique experience. If you ever wanted to nuke billions and than feel guilty for the rest of the day - DEFCON is for you. At least if you have friends and your internet connection doesn't call shenaningans.			"

												War... War never changes. In Defcon, a realistic simulator that places you in a warroom, you get the power to direct your troops towards winning a nuclear war. The world goes to ♥♥♥♥ enormously fast, and DEFCON ONE is achieved within 24 hours. You get to detect missiles by radar, get nuclear subs into position and make sure your country survives the nuclear war. Very hard, very frightening. So far, the world has not seen a DEFCON ONE situation. Let's all hope it never comes to that. In real life that is; in a video game, it's fairly entertaining!			"

												NO FIGHTING IN THE WAR ROOMDEFCON is the second title from the brilliant independent company Introversion Software. It's a haunting and daunting game, where you are charged with the offensive forces of a portion of the world as a timer ticks down the stages of the US Defense Readiness Condition system. (5 is peacetime, 1 is nuclear war.)Gameplay consists of placing buildings such as radar sites, missile silos and air bases in your chosen territory and assembling your naval fleets with aircraft carriers, battleships and submarines. As the DEFCON clock ticks down, air and naval combat is enabled, then at DEFCON 1 nuclear strikes from silos or submarines is authorized against population centers and military installations. Your overall goal is to lose the least; to get away with less civilian megadeaths (millions of deaths) than the other combatants. Hence the game's slogan: EVERYBODY DIES.The macabre nature of gameplay combined with the chilling NORAD-command-screen aesthetic and melancholy music makes for a tense game pretty much every time you play. Especially if you're not terribly good at it like me. That, and the main menu is nifty and there's good mod/AI support.Anyone who is interested in the Cold War or wants a dark twist to their RTS gaming owes it to themselves to at least try this game.

Ever wanted to hear innocent civilians crying faintly in the background of some incredibly depressing and emotional music? Do you like nukes?If you answered yes to any (or all) of the above, then buy this game!

But be warned, this game can take an incredible amount of time. So buckle up and get ready for a fun (albeit depressing) time.			"

												This game is an odd one, Immagine being in an underground bunker at the times of the cold war. Only instead of the USA and Russia being the ones who are having that cold war they could be any or all out of a preset of North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Russia and Asia. The only thing in front of you is a screen and possibly some high-rated generals. This is your ""war room"" At your disposal are radar-stations, airbases, nuke-silo's, and quite a few naval vessels. The carriers carry planes, the battleships battle, and the submarines do what submarines do. Best get your war face on, get your combat vessels in the ready, prepare for the inevitable nukes that soon will be flying overhead on this map. Send your battleships to engage other battleships, which in turn also carry nukes so you can guess what happens if they make it to the shore of your terretory. Submarines can do the same but they are below the surface, it is to anyones guess where they might hang out, untill they surface and drop a few nukes up the undefended side of your area. Fighter/Interceptor planes are best used in the sky because they can shoot down incoming bomber-aircraft from your opponent and incoming long-range nukes, unless if they can be shot down themselves. It is a game where you get twofold the points for anything you kill, and lose onefold the points for anything you lose.This game will no doubt be very interesting upcoming LAN party, it will run on an old laptop of mine and as such will be running this game from the edge of my table, running the ""diplomacy"" game-type. In that game-type you're allied to everyone in the game, untill anyone decides to leave the alliance ( perhaps start a different one with a different player ? ). Scoring is determined on the amount of survivors left in your area instead of normal ""scoring"". And like with any game-type it takes 12 minutes to set up your pieces on the board, after that hostile actions are allowed, and after 30 minutes nukes are allowed. Playing this in real-time instead of fast or faster speed as is usually the case on many multiplayer games ( The speed can be changed by the press of a button ) should give the nessesary ""why do you break the alliance now ? You know I just started on my pizza !"" funtimes :)In the end though, every game stops when 80% of all assets are destroyed, which can take infinitely long with the diplomacy game-type.Everybody dies. Well except for Australia, Because Australia is not a zone this game is taking place in. And hence will not be bombed... I guess that Introversion Software has a soft spot for kangaroos.			"

												If you saw Wargames, this is what the WOPR was playing out. It is a fun lovechild of Missile Command and Risk. You pick your country region, try to deploy as much of your bases/equiment and fleet during the ""cold"" war, then either declare war or respond to it. It is very fun and enjoyable. The music and sound effects put you in the feel of things and can be very stark and haunting as well. I have yet to see another game quite like this. There are simmilar games but this is the best missile war game I believe. Its more on the arcade side, so hardcore strategists may not enjoy this as much. One additional nice feature, speed up time. You have pretty much wrapped up your war and just need to get on with things...advance the speed of time.			"

												This game is a great game, I have played it a few times before and it is quite fun. When playing the game it feels like an old game because of the 1980's style map, but it is a great. The best parts (to me) are being able to fling nukes backwards and forwards trying to beat up as many of the enemy's places as possible. Another thing that is actually quite fun to watch is when two different countries team up (like america and russia teaming up or something) then a few minutes later one of them shoots down the other's plane or blows their boat up. Suddenly you'll see battles happening all over the place and then nukes and it just gets really amusing to watch. This game has many fun achievements to get like the achievement where you nuke santa while he flies overhead and many more! I recommend this game to those who would want to play a strategy game where you just direct things to places and wait for an explosion or something to happen but the game is more than that. I also recommend it for those who want to see what WWIII could've looked like and for those who want to be 'pressing the button that destroys it all' (doomsday button)!!!!!!			"

DEFCON lets you feel like you're sitting in the war room in a secret bunker waiting to flip the switch and send the nuke flying. Far from glamourising all-out thermonuclear war, DEFCON makes it abundantly clear that everybody loses when it comes to nuclear war by showing how many casualties each city takes and the radioactivity of each bombed location.

Inspired by the Cold War and the many movies that illustrated what could (and thankfully) didn't happen.

												Sometimes, you just want to watch the world burn. And sometimes this feeling comes at a time that you are fascinated by the whole concept of neon-glow. DEFCON is an atmospheric/minimalistic approach to the time honored wargame genre. It does not exault in the slaughter of millions as so many games do. All it provides are the bare statistics of all those you killed at the push of a button, and a rather haunting soundtrack to give you the full understanding of what you have just done. Some games push realism in wargames through more and more complex and life-like gore, but as we all know, society is a master of desensitizing itself in the face of horror. Thus DEFCON proves that thought-provoking and yet satisfying gameplay CAN and does exist in the surreal sub-genre.Envoy RATED: 10/10			"

												This game surprised me in way more ways than one. Beneath the simplistic, computerized graphics (which fit it perfectly) lies a surprisingly deep strategy game with an unnervingly incredible amount of atmosphere. The music blends with the sound to create a haunting array for your ears, while the visuals offer a very detached, ominous feeling to the nuclear war you're enacting. Give it a go, you won't be disappointed.			"

												Defcon destills the strategy formula into a refreshing and polished little game. Its atmosphere is detached and haunting, and its promise of large deathcounts in nuclear warfare are delivered. Your objective, as the militant leader of a country of your choice, is to kill as many of your opponent countries citizens as possible. You must think about how best to use the resources available to you, such as stealth bombers, nuclear subs, and missile silos. Simultaneously you must find a way to defend against those of the enemy. The result is always fun fun fun via a morbid nuclear holocaust.			"

												I bought into the hype from the other reviews here sadly... the only thing i can say about this game is that the idea is great, sure i want to play NUKEWARFARE SIM, but this is just bad, they added sombre atmospheric music to make it seem like it was a deep and emotional game, when really it isn't, not even in the slightest. The game also feels like it's got a mind of its own, i mean, it started off in 1920x1080 fullscreen mode, but when i changed some of the options it ""reverted to safe mode"", a mode oddly enough which it had never been in up to that point. So i reversed the few options i had changed in order to start the process again and see what was going on, but sadly from there on out i was never able (or allowed it seems) to get back into 1920x1080 fullscreen. Having only bought the game for 0.59p i can't say I'm feeling the loss, but then no one in their right mind would pay for a bad experience would they?... i guess if you are a liberal you would, but for the rest of us who aren't mentally defective liberals we don't want to. If they were to update this with modern graphics and a command center view which isn't done in retro Atari 2bit style, then i might take a look at that game, otherwise, if you are looking to get this, you'll probably only play a couple of 'rounds' and then think why you just wasted your pennies on it.UPDATE: I decided to look for mods, since mods make the world go round an all. Ok so i discovered a mod called 'SatCon' which does away with the Atari darkness, and gives a proper view as if from space with the landmasses coloured and the seas represented in blue. Much better right away. Here is the link for the mod:http://www.introversion.co.uk/defcon/mods/All you have to do is make a folder in the main DEFCON folder called Mods (if there wasn't one already like in my case), then unpack/unzip the mod you downloaded into that, then start the game up and choose Mods from the menu, then activate that mod and job done. Now I'll look for mods which give a proper representation of each of the nations powers, i mean, the US certainly has more than 7 radar stations and 6 nuclear weapons facilities to launch nukes from.Anyway, I'm going to change my not recommended vote to a recommended vote, next time I'll be sure to look into mods for a game before voting good or bad. Still though, this isn't really a deep detailed global war sim, more something along the lines of a game for your tablet device. I got it for 0.59p so i really shouldn't give a negative vote because it isn't at all bad, just not as detailed and deep as I'd like it to be.			"

You start out by picking your country to defend/reinforce, then you spend time strategicly deploying radar stations, nuclear bases, and airforce bases. All leading up to DEFCON 1, in which point in the game you can start launching nukes at your enemies countries, but be carefull the enemy can launch at you too.THE GOODFun strategic gameplay, you have to really be careful about your decisions.High replay value, with many different countries which have better/worse defensive areas.The game supports modding, where you can add different maps and units from the website.THE BADWithout modding the game it can get bland after a couple matches.79/100      79% Fun "

												I want to recommend this game on the sheer philosophical level that games are an art form to be experienced.This game made me feel things.  As gamers we've slain zombies, killed Nazi's and even exploded innocent towns in fallout.  And yet, through all the years of gore and hyperviolence this simple vectorized representation of the world has made me feel more guilt than any video game I've played.  This game is unsettling to it's core and has made a huge impact on me.The soundtrack is, in my opinion, perfection and lends a staggering amount of gravitas and torment to the game.  Even when you're winning, it is disturbing to think you so easily caused 5.8 million deaths in Tokyo.  In the background you hear the final gasping cough of a women as she succumbs to radiation poisoning or the cry of a mother over the death of her newborn.Even if unintended, this game makes a moving and bold statement, all represented by a very detached and matter-of-fact way.At least try the demo!

												DEFCON, A game where you choose who lives and dies, while attempting to locate that pesky enemy submarine sitting off your coastline pelting your cities with nuclear missiles.DEFCON allows players to simulate outright nuclear war across the entire world, watching cities reduced to nothing with the press of the red button - without the real world concequencesAlthough this game takes some getting used to, trying to get the right tactics in place to defend your own cities while trying to obliterate your enemies, or even betraying your friends, it is a fun yet tense game which can be slowed to real world time to really get that feel of what it would be like to watch the world burn			"

												""It's global thermonuclear war, and nobody wins. But maybe, just maybe, you can lose the least""Sums up the whole game in two sentences. The AI is one hell of a challenge. The sounds of children playing and people chatting in the background give it a sinister and forebording side. Graphics aren't very 2006, but this is a Cold War game, based on a Cold War 80s film. The graphics aren't meant to be great, and it helps give an authentic feel to the game. Also, at €10, it's not exactly breaking the bank.Like no other game out there, this game really brings home the horror and loss that war inevitably causes, and all without any blood/gore effects. It's just the cold, distant '2.1 MILLION DEAD' reports that calmly appear after each hit that show you the impersonal and overwhelming destruction that MAD would have visited on the world. Just like in the film, you'll keep replaying, convincing yourself that you can win, that next time you'll be faster, smarter, better and outdo the enemy. But, just like the film, the only real winning move is not to play.For best results, use a projector and stand with hands clasped at your back watching the bombs rain down.			"

												DEFCON, in simple terms, is a simulator/game where you can destroy entire countries and continents by using nuclear weapons to decimate populations and cities whilst watching them burn. You can choose to be either North America (Canada, USA), South America (All South American countries), Africa (All African countries), Asia (Most Asian countries and far east countries), Europe (All European countries) or just Russia (Just russia, duh). There is a DEFCON timer, in which it starts from DEFCON 5 all the way to DEFCON 1, signalling nuclear war. The DEFCON system is a US defence and readiness condition system in which state the military should be readied at, depending on the current condition, five to one. Slowly or very quickly depending on what speed you want it on, the DEFCON level will drop until it reaches DEFCON 1 and nuclear war will begin. The game is based on a film called Wargames (1983) and is about a hacker who gains control of NORAD's nuclear missiles and threatens nuclear war. The GUI and game is very similar to Wargames' control systems and computer simulations. In order to start the game you need to select one of the continents, you can place down radars, missile silos and airbases. Each one of these has a certain strategic importance. Radars can detect incoming nuclear missiles from nuclear submarines or land based silos and show their trajectories. Airbases have the ability to launch fighter and bombers to city targets or fleets of ships in the oceans, the bombers can also drop one nuke onto a city or military target. Silos obviously have the ability to fire up to 10 missiles anywhere at a target. Silos can also become air defence systems in which they will shoot down incoming missiles, fighters and bombers within their range. There is also the ability to place fleets of ships (nuclear missile equipped submarines, battleships and aircraft carriers). Submarines can attack ships on the surface of the sea and sink them and can also fire nukes at cities within a shorter range than silos but they are more stealthy. Battleships are an all-round ship, they can attack all kinds of ships including aircraft. Aircraft carriers can launch nuke bombers to cities or military targets and attack them and launch fighter jets to attack ships. It is also worth mentioning, you can't win. It is impossible to win. As the games motto/slogan says ""Everybody Dies"". The whole object is to loose the 'least' by having less casualties. For each 1 million citizens killed, your continent gains 2 points, for every 1 million citizens killed on your continent, you loose 1 point. The game is easy to grasp but can be a bit challenging at times and difficult to use. It does take time to learn, but hey, its really cheap on sales and what isn't good about nuking the ♥♥♥♥ out of Africa? TL;DR11/10 would nuke multiple times again. "

												WARNING: If you don't like giant explosions, war, nuclear weapons, or even the thought of committing mass genocide, then stop reading and get another game, like Galacon 2. However, if you like the former, then keep reading.Imagine being in an underground bunker, for say the United States, and there was a massive series of crisis that unfolded. Your clock ticks ever so slowly towards zero as Defcon 4 approaches. You start mobilizing your navy to try to defend your coasts against the inevitable assault against your country. You establish airfields and silos along the coastline and close to your cities, so you can protect them. It's Defcon 3 now, and the enemy started to mobilize their forces against each other. Only 5 minutes later a battle fleet has come into radar range of your fleet. Your fleets start to open fire, aircraft carriers launching bombers and fighters while your battleships launch cruise missiles and fire massive guns at your enemy. It's Defcon 2 now, and you are being attacked from the east and the west. Finally, it reaches DEFCON 1. You hear a woman crying in the background, knowing that she is disturbed greatly by the outcome of the events beforehand. You start opening your missile silos and launch multiple nukes at your nearest enemy: Europe. Luckily, you had an alliance with South America, who was helping you defend against the enemy assault. However, 10 minutes after you launch a salvo of nukes, your radar detects a nuke heading towards your country. That nuke becomes 2, then 3, then 6. Your radar detects even more nukes coming from Europe. You then detect a strategic missile sub off the East coast, but you destroy it with depth charges before it can fire. However, you then see a wave of nuke bombers coming from Europe. Your defenses are spread thin, and only 2 bombers were shot down before they fired. You then launch almost every nuke you have against Europe, only to realize that Russia has also fought against you. You launch your last nukes at Russia, only to watch 10 nukes land in Europe successfully, of the 25 you have launched. You then admit defeat as tens of nukes tear your country apart in a glorious storm of radiation and fire, killing almost every human left in your country.This is what you will experience in DEFCON. What I didn't mention in this, is the atmosphere is EXTREMELY effective at what it does. The occasional woman crying in the background, and the ominous, and slightly creepy, soundtrack just makes you feel remorse, even dread, just for launching fake nukes at a fake country. Yeah, it's THAT powerful of an experience. Hell, the game even comes with a manual on how to survive a nuclear war.			"

In the game you need to attack your foes with nuclear warheads, but at the same time you need to defend, and the pace is quite quick so you have to be on your guards.			"

												This is a game that aims to do a single thing, and does it so well that it's almost impossible to find fault with it. It is a game which always begins with a feeling of nostalgic joy, and ends with a sense of pessimistic dread. I find it an excellent companion to start watching films about the Cold War.			"

												WARNING: If you don't like giant explosions, war, nuclear weapons, or even the thought of committing mass genocide, then stop reading and get another game, like Galacon 2. However, if you like the former, then keep reading.Imagine being in an underground bunker, for say the United States, and there was a massive series of crisis that unfolded. Your clock ticks ever so slowly towards zero as Defcon 4 approaches. You start mobilizing your navy to try to defend your coasts against the inevitable assault against your country. You establish airfields and silos along the coastline and close to your cities, so you can protect them. It's Defcon 3 now, and the enemy started to mobilize their forces against each other. Only 5 minutes later a battle fleet has come into radar range of your fleet. Your fleets start to open fire, aircraft carriers launching bombers and fighters while your battleships launch cruise missiles and fire massive guns at your enemy. It's Defcon 2 now, and you are being attacked from the east and the west. Finally, it reaches DEFCON 1. You hear a woman crying in the background, knowing that she is disturbed greatly by the outcome of the events beforehand. You start opening your missile silos and launch multiple nukes at your nearest enemy: Europe. Luckily, you had an alliance with South America, who was helping you defend against the enemy assault. However, 10 minutes after you launch a salvo of nukes, your radar detects a nuke heading towards your country. That nuke becomes 2, then 3, then 6. Your radar detects even more nukes coming from Europe. You then detect a strategic missile sub off the East coast, but you destroy it with depth charges before it can fire. However, you then see a wave of nuke bombers coming from Europe. Your defenses are spread thin, and only 2 bombers were shot down before they fired. You then launch almost every nuke you have against Europe, only to realize that Russia has also fought against you. You launch your last nukes at Russia, only to watch 10 nukes land in Europe successfully, of the 25 you have launched. You then admit defeat as tens of nukes tear your country apart in a glorious storm of radiation and fire, killing almost every human left in your country.This is what you will experience in DEFCON. What I didn't mention in this, is the atmosphere is EXTREMELY effective at what it does. The occasional woman crying in the background, and the ominous, and slightly creepy, soundtrack just makes you feel remorse, even dread, just for launching fake nukes at a fake country. Yeah, it's THAT powerful of an experience. Hell, the game even comes with a manual on how to survive a nuclear war.			"

It's easy to play, easy to get other people into and through it's graphical presentation, really drives home a deeper message about nuclear proliferation.As you mindlessly launch nukes at your friends countries, then cheer as it lands and states ""5.6 million killed"", it really makes you think that if nuclear war broke out, the guy watching the screen would have the same feeling that you do while you're playing this game.

												This game is based on War games, and I have to say I always had a good interest. After a few hours of play, I have to say I am not really that impressed. It seems that it appeals to a sense of nostalgia, although I do love the simplicity of the strategy and the overall design. The music is wonderful and ambient, it really sets the mood and to me is probably one of the stongest elements of the game. The game itself was part of a bundle and so the price I pretty good in terms of value, however the problems for me are with the gameplay itself. The tutorials do give you the very bare bones basics, but really does not prepare you that well for what is coming. I enjoy a good learning curve and a good difficulty, but honestly I cannot say that the tutorials really helped that much. I think the problem with this game is that the strategy element is during the placement phase and if you place your units and elements incorrect at the beginning then the game is as good as lost, no matter how well you play after that. I had to laugh at one bug, which I screenshotted, I had won a game, and was waiting for the victory timer, after the timer ran out the scores changed, giving me a nice loss. I guess there really are no winners in war. This game for a casual player like myself, has a learning curve that is just to steep, and gets pretty repetitive pretty fast. I'll bet if you are in to deep strategy games and were to read though pages of guides and websiges for how to best counter and place units etc then you may get a lot more out of this game, But I just cannot spend time doing that at the moment, I may take a look at a later date when I have time to look through some guides, and I'm sure the multiplayer element may be more fun.I found the most fun for me was watching the rolling demo's and predicting who would win, the music is great as an ambient background noise, it was actually quite relaxing, I can see me watching some of those when I don't feel like actually playing any games myself. Overall I perhaps expected too much, but this one just wasn't for me, not at the moment anyway.			"

												Gobal Thermonuclear War.  Mutually Assured Destruction.  In the final war, nobody will win, and everybody dies, but in DEFCON perhaps you can lose the least.Taking inspiration from the 1983 film Wargames, you take control of a global superpower on the verge of the nuclear apocalypse.  Deploy your silos, radars, and submarines, defend your territory while blowing the other guys away forever.The game takes about 15 minutes if played on the fastest speed or up to 6 hours to complete if left on the slowest setting.  You can jump back and forth between them as you see fit, allowing you to give orders in very slow time without being overwhelmed, then speed up time to see the results of your actions.Boiled down to its core, this is a game of chicken.  Should you strike first, hoping to cripple your opponents chance for retaliation?  Or should you wait, attempt to outlast their attacks, and deliver your own killing blow when they’ve been depleted?  Do you send your naval forces aggressively towards the enemy coastline or keep them close to home in order to defend?  It takes them a long time to travel the whole ocean, so your decision will be a lasting one.The music is somber and funereal, as it should be in a game about dealing instant fiery death to untold millions of people.  The graphics capture that cold, heartless, military wargame style perfectly.There is no campaign to work through, no storyline to finish.  There’s just the single scenario of global destruction to play again and again, though depending on the numerous modifiable game settings and which continent you play, they will always turn out different.  You can make it so losing your own citizens is weighed more heavily than killing others, or vice versa.  You can make alliances unbreakable, or change the number of units each team will have.  There is endless replayability here.It’s a good thing that this scenario is no longer in the forefront of our minds like it was in the 60′s, 70′s, 80′s, and even 90′s.  We no longer fear this afternoon of destruction, where the entire world is wiped out due to a domino effect of retaliation.  Yet it is still very much possible in today’s world.  Nuclear arms are still held by numerous countries the world over.DEFCON is an interesting little strategy game with some really good decision-making opportunities.  This would be a perfect game for a LAN party full of deal-making and backstabbing, but playing it alone is a rather somber experience.			"

												This game is a very well made video game. It isn't word for word realistic *How did Europe become one country? Why is Mexico conisdered a part of South America? Who the hell gave the Africans nukes? But aside from that. It is very balanced, and fun. It really has a horrifying nuclear end of the world feel to it. It takes place represented by a cold blu and black global map, with soft crying, screaming, and coughing. And very sad and somber music.                           Also, in global nuclear war, all that matters is your airforce, navy, and nukes. Armies mean nothing. On the surface, anyone can play and do a pretty decent job of it, but it takes a lot of skill to master it.                                                                                                                                               Overall, DEFCON is a very good game, in global nuclear war, nobody really wins, but maybe instead of your country being turned into a charred radioactive wasteland, maybe just 3/4 of it collapse from being blasted by nukes, and the remaining 1/4 is shaky, battered, a bit of radiation, but still standing, and life can go on.

												DEFCON borrows some of its lore and most of its appearance from portions of the movie WarGames. The multi player scene is still active, and it is very easy to find open matches with all kinds of different settings. Personally, I prefer playing against the CPU, much like in the movie. The map is fairly accurate, depicting the geopolitical era of the Cold War. Implementing orders to your units can sometimes be confusing and inadequate, but with enough attempts, you become used to the interface, and will be able to do all of the game's strategical requirements. What is most valuable in DEFCON is the replay ability. Certainly, each match has an ending, but the game truly shines when you play it repeatedly; alone or online. Winning is not easy. Several things must go right, and occur at specific moments in order to be successful. Because of these timing issues, sometimes you will win or lose depending on how quickly or how slowly your units execute orders in conjunction with timers. Nuking cities and other strategic locations doesn't exactly feel like you are killing people. There isn't very much tension. It all just feels like you are clicking around on the map and delegating orders. The feeling that lives are actually being lost is not truly present. At the end of each match, you will be shown a small statistics screen with how much of the enemy population you have killed, how many of your population have been killed, and so on. Each match takes between 15 to 20 minutes to complete, and it often feels like each instance ends abruptly without much of a climax or excitement in the confrontations. The entire atmosphere is very cold and impersonal. Setting up a new single player match means you will have to go into the advanced settings every single time in order to change a few options to single player mode. The default (which can't be permanently altered) is set to multi player, broadcasting your match as public. This is quite annoying and should not have been programmed as such. I am certain that there are many DEFCON players that prefer single player mode and this preference should not be hindered by permanently set options from the developers. The longevity of DEFCON is dependent entirely on the player's interest in its short matches, be it single player or multi player. Besides your initial location on the match, it feels like every single match is played almost exactly the same, with very little occurring differently or alternatively. The strategies necessary to play this game are limited and basic, regardless of whether you win or lose. The only major change as you become better at the game is that you will begin winning, but this does not mean each match will be played differently, or go through a different turn of events. As repetitive as it is, there is a small amount of entertainment gained from playing DEFCON for more than three or so matches at a time. The gaming experience quickly becomes dull, repetitive, tiresome, and almost identical to every other match you play. DEFCON is best played in short bursts in order to preserve its replay ability. Seriously lacking in variety, this diversion is suited for fast breaks and brief encounters.DEFCON is mediocre.			"

												Don't buy this game at full price. get it on a steam sale or somthing becuase its not worth $10, i paid $1 at the xmas sale. The game is very fun to play with friends but gets realy repetitive playing with bots as most games will playout almost the exact same (wait wait wait and then send every nuke you have).  There are hardly ever any active servers running and when they are they are either locked or moded. This is why i can't recommend this game. thank you for reading!			"

												This game appeals to a very specific group, the most hardcore strategy-turnbased players. It's like nuclear chess. DEFCON can be hard to get into and is quite expensive for someone with a low game-budget. The immersion is nicly handled by the graphics and the amazing score. DEFCON is not easy to become good at and it can be quite difficult to find a multiplayer match. Purches when on sale and with caution.			"

												The main issue I have with this game is that it lacks immersion and therefore gets tiring pretty fast. While the graphics would work great, the soundtrack and the weird game pace destroy it really. Even when I fast forward I constantly feel like: omg, move forward already... this takes forever. And quite unnecessarily so. While there's some micromanagement possible and necessary there's simply long parts in a match which don't need much attention and feel like they take forever. The whole concept just seems unpolished even though it's a simple game really.			"

												The following review was copied straight from my review at http://officialvghc.com/vghc-reviews/defcon-pc-review/#.UpROXsTmN_Q, because I'm too lazy to write a new one.I’m a huge sucker for the movie WarGames. So when I found out about the game DEFCON, I naturally couldn’t resist. Finally I could play the “WarGame”.How wrong I was.Being a gamer, I naturally was like “eh, tutorials, I don’t need those.” However, this is one of those games where you do need those without them telling you. And boy is that tutorial lengthy. So, 6 chapters and 30 minutes later I was thrown into the 7th chapter: use what you’ve learned to defeat this extremely-easy AI. Oh wait, did we say easy? We meant hard. as. ♥♥♥♥. Oh, and I still really didn’t grasp the game.Well, that was demoralizing.Thing is, officially DEFCON is a multiplayer game. It’s possible to play against the AI, but that’s even harder than in the tutorial. When you keep in mind that one can’t complete the tutorial because the AI is too hard, you get really depressing ideas about what the AI in the actual game is like.But it’s a multiplayer game right? So why not just face other players? Yeah, about that… There aren’t any other players, really. You’re going to need a friend to play, if they’re willing to play this ♥♥♥♥ at all.Thing is, the game was “inspired by the infamous 1983 movie WarGames.” So, naturally, I had big expectations. I knew that I probably wasn’t going to play against Joshua, but still. When you make a game inspired by a movie about computer from the MS-DOS era, at least make the graphics resemble that era. Don’t make elaborate maps with perfect borders – make them liney and polygonal. Don’t make elaborate icons – make sure that the game looks like it could run on MS-DOS.So what are you supposed to do? Well, the game starts off at DEFCON 5. It’s time to build a military defense system. Place missile silos, create fleets, create military airports, place radars. You know – a defense system.Many actions don’t unlock until you hit a certain DEFCON level. For example, you can’t dispatch planes until DEFCON 3, and nukes can of course only be launched at DEFCON 1.Now this is the point where you expect hell to be unleashed. Nope, that’ll take a while. You can use missiles to explode nukes in the air (because the radioactive material totally won’t fall on your territory if that happens above land), but it takes a while for those nukes to come. You can try to strike first – but if you’re Europe and your enemy is North America then you’re screwed because you’ll need nuclear submarines, and once those get above the surface they get destroyed because they’re suddenly visible.It’s also really not clear what the goal of the game is. My best guess is “destroy the enemy’s cities” – but that’s damn near impossible because I needed all my nukes to destroy New York (I had like 40 nukes). So what then? “Destroy the enemy’s defense systems”? That might be possible. I’d rather just know instead of having to guess though.I feel incredibly let down by this game. It’s just not fun. There’s also some kind of alliance feature for when you play with 3 or 4 players, but I didn’t get to test it out because I didn’t grasp the game and only have one friend to play it with (and he uses the demo).Know what I miss most? The command prompt. That stuff was awesome about the movie. It would’ve allowed for some great references as well. A missed opportunity.So, all in all, this game is a huge letdown. It fails to deliver what looks like a fun game, and falls short on many aspects. Too bad, guys, too bad.Score: 4/10			"

												Literally the biggest waste of money, you have to do time consuming, ridiculous tactics. The AI is also ridiculous, for example, the anti-air defense destroys all of your missiles firing on the enemy, while your anti-air defense does jackshit, and you can't recover on point value. Other things like the enemy AI fleets doing loops around continents. To be honest, you cannot win except for the turtorial, the game is pretty sutpid and the only way you CAN win is playing an inexperienced player. Don't buy			"

												I was looking for this game even before I knew it exists, so when I found it I put it in my wishlist, then I bought in a 90% reduction sale, I'm glad to have waited for the sale, the idea of the game is so good, but the gameplay doesn't make it challenging at all, in addition, the diplay in the screen is not very well optimized, the menus are small and difficult to read. I played 5 or 6 times, and don't feel atracted anymore, maybe in the online mode is better... don't know.I would not recomend it for the real price of 10€, but if you find in a sale it's fine, you can get a few hours of nuclear anihilation, and destroy the cityes you always wanted to.PARIS HIT: TWO MILLION DEAD			"

												DEFCON is an incredibly depressing, boring, bland, poorly designed, cheeky, insulting parody of real-time strategy games whose primary gameplay focuses on not having any care whatsoever for what happens during a round (read: the polar opposite of what you usually do when playing any game ever.)Due to its extreme callousness and its abhorrent, hamfisted gameplay, DEFCON is among a small collection of software calling itself a game that actually makes me angry every second that I am playing it (the only other I can name right now is The Stanley Parable.) That is because I cannot accept that someone was actually callous and asinine enough to put untold effort into this piece of ♥♥♥♥ and put it out with their tongues firmly in their cheeks, or that there are people in the world who actually enjoy watching this game.Note I didn't say playing this game, because that isn't really a thing you do.Each player is assigned a general region of the world in which they may place a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ they should not condone any attachment or value to. It seems to be that the only attacks you have are battleships, submarines, silos, and aircraft, the last of which are launched from carriers and airports.The game will begin in DEFCON 5 and eventually progress to DEFCON 1.DEFCON 5: (Placement phase) No hostile actions are permitted; enemy units are completely invisibleDEFCON 4: (Placement phase) Enemy units become visible to Radars / ships / planesDEFCON 3: Ships and planes may now attackDEFCON 2: APPARENTLY ♥♥♥♥ING POINTLESS AS NOTHING CHANGESDEFCON 1: Nukes may be launched (silos, subs)DEFCON 0: Basically if DEFCON 1 goes on for too long the war ends automatically and whoever's the least dead wins.You will quickly find that the game WILL NOT ♥♥♥♥ING LET YOU PLACE UNITS except under incredibly specific criteria. That is, you have to click-hunt until you find a spot you can actually put something. This is most obvious when placing seacraft, because they have to be within your territory but also in fairly deep water, which is probably like 5% of your ♥♥♥♥ing territory.The biggest problem with this game is that it is little more than a long-exposure camera simulator. You are playing on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, nigh-unintelligible projection map based on some classic movie because creators who aren't able to make their own iconic content just poorly mooch off of someone else's already popular work (see Chris-chan, Borderlands 2's writing, etc.) You will give a few orders and then sit there and wait while their trails sloooowly fill the screen as they go do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they're doing why do I even care in a game that tells me flat-out that nobody's going to win.The projection map has a small problem called ""you can't see jack ♥♥♥♥"". This can be abated by toggling on or off the KIND OF IMPORTANT WHETHER THEY ARE ON OR OFF OVERLAYS that do such things as show you your radar range and where everyone's territory is, as this can affect how much the unit icons blend in with the background by shoving highlights and ♥♥♥♥ everywhere.I wish I could write more but I cannot stand playing this hunk of YOLO crap long enough to obtain further information on it.I honestly can't tell who this game is supposed to be marketed to. It's completely uninteresting and underwhelming in every possible way, and its message is an explicit mockery of human suffering.Don't play this if you have any respect for games or humanity at all. It's filthy.			"

												Stupidest game mechanics ever created. Completely unrealistic time-turn based combat where the computer always makes the right move and you can never win. The creator of this piece of junk has never read a book related to naval warfare in his entire life. This game does not follow any standardised military tactics whatsoever and seems to have been programmed by an idiot. In reality naval warships can attack land based targets quite easily. But not in this game. Also there is a thing called a Stealth Bomber which is impervious to any forms of radar detection and flies so high up in the atmosphere that land based missles can never reach it. But not in this game. Total waste of money. Do not buy, the childish gameplay will only aggrivate you. This is a game designed to steal your money not to bring you an entertaining experience.

												(I bought this game so I could give people who are buying this a warning.)From playing the demo for about 25 minutes, and the actual game for about 10, I could tell that this game needs A LOT of work for a 2006 game, if not a complete rewrite. First of all, the tutorial crashes the game, leaving me to figure things out on my own which I gave up on.+Interesting, but ruined concept.+Based on World War II/The Cold War+Nukes used to decimate different human races.-Tutorial crashes the game.-Can’t choose where you want your territory to be.-CPUs that have no difficulty setting.-Little to no strategy involved. The only viable strategy I found was to release everything all in one go which still pushed me to defeat.-You can’t even tell where to fire unless you’ve been fired at already.-Radars are almost completely pointless since they only give you a couple more seconds of awareness.-Some fleet ships can sustain several nukes head-on, where some feel like they’re made out of paper.-No real graphics in this game, just a bunch of low-quality neon-colored lines.-Got bored of the game within 20 minutes of playing it.-Strange and unfitting music.-Almost a ripoff of Plague Inc.-A lot of other things that I could go on for hours talking about.For the sake of your time and money, don’t get this game unless you want to write a negative review on it.

With careful planning and pricision of units and structures one can guide thier selected country to a safe heaven within destructive powers,removing all threats of nukes or be completely obliterated.

It's easy to control, quick (ish) to learn, and fun to play. I have it filed under ""distractions"" rather than ""strategy"" becaues it's a pretty quick game.I'd love to see a sequel with a bit more to do. Maybe some unlockable tech or a campaign mode.

You don't have researches, level-ups or power-ups and matches rarely go over 12-15 minutes, so you can bet your a** that this game requires pure skill... and maybe a little bit of luck as well. :P So if you like MMO RTS games with that kind of approach, then what are you waiting for?

												Very few games can convincingly portrait the desolation of the nuclear conflict. Defcon manages that with minimalistic graphics and a great soundtrack, but atmosphere that is positively depressing and gets progressively more so, as the countdown nears zero. When the first missile leaves the silo, submarine or bomber and  you desperately try to outlive the others. As the casualty reports start to come in, you realize that the game's subtitle does not lie.			"

												For the couple of hours I've played, it's been fun.  I can't help but feel that it's very random based, but maybe that's just cause I'm not very good at it.  I guess it's a homage to the War Games movie where it's a simulation of Global Thermonuclear War.  You launch your intercontinental ballistic missiles from silos and when it hits the target a lit up circle appears over the target.  It's pretty cool watching all the missiles fly at your targets and lighting up part of the world with dots of radioactive fallout.  Not sure if I would recommend it at a full price, but I will say it's worth checking out if you're interested enough to read this review.			"

												I love diplomacy servers.SPOILRS!In deplomicy servers, it is not wartime, so you dont fire all nukes at defcon 1. Instead, it ends up being Player A is a ♥♥♥♥/does something dickish and ends up in a war with player B. Players C Through F take sides (Usually the less dickish of the 2 is chosen) and then the war starts. When the radioactive particles settle the nukes start flying from one of the survivors, usually one who is a tyranical warlord,(Refered to as Player C) and he screws over his ally (Player D) with nuclear subs and missiles. E and F nuke the F($k out of player C and he dies. Player D is so far gone he is no compitition, and there is a strained peace for the last bit of game. Then, at the last 5 min, whoever is in second (Player E) sends a Bomber or two into the FIrst place player (Player F)'s territory. Once in position, they fire.(If player F is not a new player, he will see the trap and fire long before that) Within seconds of breaking the truce he has nuked a few of their biggest cities.			"

												DEFCON always reminded me of those good cold war movies - such as ""Hunt for Red October"" and ""War Games"" (which is where DEFCON originally drew its inspiration from). A tactical game which doesn't sport any fancy graphics. It may very well run on a mobile device. Your objective is to nuke your opponents while protecting your own cities from getting nuked. Can be played solo or against other players. The soundtrack is especially engaging! Very fun!			"

												A good majority of strategy wargames out there focus on the high action or grand spectacle of seeing tanks and troops move in sweeping engagements. Not DEFCON. This takes the pure strategy approach to Mutually Assured Destruction, putting you in the seat of the head of state who gets to sit safely in some bunker while they watch the body count rise in the millions. It's very challenging, but also haunting when you really realize what you're doing exactly.This is one of those simple games that is simple to get the concept of, but it takes a long time to really get the hang of it. Anyone expecting a grand victory for moderate work is going to be disappointed, as fortunes can change quickly from overwhelmingly good to horrifically bad in one salvo or even one white-hot nuke detonation. There's some initial challenge when you are learning the control interface, but with practice you can quickly issue orders and begin to focus more on strategy. The best comparison I can come up with is the ages-old game of Chess. It's simple, it lacks flash and thunder, but if you are willing to apply your braincells, you can orchestrate victory for your nation. Whether you feel good for laying waste to millions of civilians or not is a whole other question...			"

												Well... This game is literally crazy, I've had it for awhile now and haven't really played a whole lot of it, but of what I have it just is really different from most games that are out there. Basic premise is.. from the title, DEFCON stands for DEFense readiness CONdition, a military concept for alert readiness for the Armed Forces. As such, this tasks you with playing on a realistic representation of a global worldmap in a region of the world and places you in the position of basically that countries nuclear armed arsenal.And then.. game plays out as if the world is going through the real-life DEFCON countdown which ranges from 5 the lowest state or nominal/normal, all the way down to 1 which means Nuclear War is about to ruin your day. It gets crazy at that point, with nukes passing by each other in the sky waving to each other as they are about to warm-up a couple million people. Yes, crazy but for some reason also fun in a morbid way.			"

												Would you like to play a game?Clearly inspired by the classic move Wargames, Defcon puts you in charge of the nuclear arsenal of a bloc of countries during the countdown to nuclear war. It's coming and there's nothing you can do to stop it. The whole game is played out on a world map that resembles a NORAD command display. There are no fancy 3D graphics, just clean vector lines. It's pretty chilling, especially considering that the folks who would have to do this in reality would be looking at something quite similar.There are many, many strategic decisions to be made over the course of one game. You have to manage your naval and air forces intelligently, and plan where and when you will launch from your silos.It plays slowly and deliberately and requires some patience, but is worth it in the end.

												""Greetings.  Shall we play a Game?""If you like a great strategy game, you should look into DEFCON.  Reminiscient of the popular nuclear deterrence movie, WarGames, DEFCON really pulls you into a world where you're on the brink of nuclear holocaust.  The whole of the game operates on real-time, and every second counts when placing your units.  As the tide of war edges closer to DEFCON 1, you need to really be vigilant on where and when your opponent will strike.  And one of the ways they can strike is by nuclear attack sub, which is really the proverbial knife at your throat.  Another way for them would be to send a squadron of nuclear-armed bombers into the heart of your territory.  But if you are capable of countering the enemy, you may stand a chance of surviving the looming apocalypse.  All in all, a great game for a superior strategist, or for people who just want to blow sh*t up and end the world to feel better.  9.5/10""A strange Game.  The only winning move is not to play.""

												This is honestly one of my most beloved games, I often times find myself playing this game with some of the community, rather than some of the AAA titles like GTA V. Some of you may not like it, it requires patience, especially if you want to get good, you'll have to wait for people to join games, and you'll have to wait in games as some people are micromanaging their units to get ahead.Fun game if you have the patience, still a fun game if you want to just mess around nuking your friends			"

												Everybody dies. No one wins in this extremely compelling game about nuclear warfare. 10/10 soundtrack, design, and gameplay is simple yet strategic. An extremely good obscure indie game, and it's made by the same guys who made Prison Architect.			"

												Great game but one thing that you cant escape for sure is the fact that this game is exteamly hard to master it will take you countless hours of playing just to learn how to win the game. If you just start by shooting all the missles then you will be left losing the game. Its horrible in the fact that it requires a great deal of planning just to win a round so well worth checking out if you enjoy that type of game.			"

												This game is now terribly old and definitely shows it\'s rough parts around the edges.  Still, I have yet to find a replacement for blowing up the world, WarGames big board style.  Something about killing everyone in the United States can be terribly stress-releasing sometimes.I would recommend getting this if you really want to blow up the world and can overlook a very clunky, outdated menu system and almost nobody to play with online.

												I've been wanting to play this game ever since I saw the last 20 minutes of WarGames. It's pretty simple, but really challenging to not get blown up. It even has multiple game modes for those that like tricking people then blowing them up rather than just blowing them up.			"

												This game has achieved perfection. While it looks simple, it is actually a very special strategy game,  where sometimes not acting is better than acting. This is a game where strategic thinking is more important than a hight APM. All in all, a brilliant game.			"

												DEFCON. A game for minds of steel.Looks minimalistic, is minimalistic, but you're in for a lot of tension. Leading a nuclear war isnt all fun and games, but here you can push that little red button yourself. Gather some Friends, Bunker up and do some serious damage.Try Office mode for that extra tension. No speeding up, everything run in real time. Hours of watching a blue screen and nukes crossing the earth. Or the Quick mode ""Speed defcon""Everything at 20x the speed. Fast, Ruthless, Intuitive.A must have for every strategy enthusiast			"

												I have had this game forever and I just started seriously playing it on a whim. It is fan-freakin-tastic! Strategic depth and intense action all in one. Don't let the look of the graphics deceive you- anything more complicated would make the game more difficult to play. This goes on sale somewhat regularly here on Steam and is commonly include in the HIB. Keep an eye out for it.			"

												Overall, I liked this game because it was fun to go back to the Cold War era and relive the atmosphere of 1980s graphics and possible nuclear annihilation. But this game barely makes onto the recommended side, because after a few times playing it, you realize it's not that fun. It's really designed to be a multi-player game, and while you can have AI's to play against, I felt like there were issues with the balance between making it challenging and making it fun to play. It seems you can tweak and adjust every parameter in the game, so you can make it easier or harder, but I feel like it's a lazy way out of designing a game to just tell the user to set it up for themselves.
