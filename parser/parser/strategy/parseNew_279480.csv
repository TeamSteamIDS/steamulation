												Achievements won't work, portuguese language is listed as supported but doesn't work either. There are also some black screen problems for higher resolutions on fullscreen, but it works for me in windowed mode.This is an otherwise very pretty adaptation of a very nice board game, however it's plagued with problems and the support is totally uninterested and unresponsive, so it doesn't look like they're going to be fixed any time soon. I don't recommend it (I might change my mind if those problems are fixed, though), only get it if it's VERY cheap and also if you don't care for achievements.			"

												I've always loved this board game! It's sort of an abstract sumo wrestler strategy thing where you're trying to lure opponents to the edge and use their momentum against them. The weight of the pieces as they clack along the track and against each other was just perfect.This adaptation does a great job of capturing the physical feeling and the controls are just right. It's also nice that you can try out moves and undo them without the opponent seeing, rather than having to imagine the outcome and poker-face.Matchmaking finds me an opponent within about 30 seconds and seems to do some amount of matching based on skill. Since lag and language isn't an issue it can easily pull from the worldwide pool. There's no chat features... I wish there was at least a selection of emoticons so I could congratulate good plays. After each match you can watch the full replay at fast speed. In about 10 games I've never seen anyone rage quit when I'm clearly at an advantage.I haven't tried the single player vs AI or non-traditional layouts. But it has a nice interactive tutorial and several simple practice levels of increasing difficulty to teach the game.My only complaints are the missing chat feature, a way to see the total online pool of players searching, and the stupid chime sound when you knock out a piece. Otherwise I'm really happy with this version.			"

												A faithful transposition of the eponym board game. Interface and mouse commands are comfortable. Game itself is good, no complaint about it.However, steam achievements don't work at all. Players opened a relative topic on dedicated steam board long time ago.And 4 months ago have sent a (polite) mail to Bulkypix editor.Time has passed, still no patch or answer from devs.It seems they published the game and left it out.Here a negative review among other to call their attention on this bug.Or at least, to inform about it as players knowingly buy or don't buy.(And sorry for bad english.)

												The game runs all right after tweaking (black screen if run full screen for me). Whatever you do, do NOT hit 'esc': there's no dialog box, so the game closes to desktop no matter what you're doing. Local multiplayer crashes about half the time, and online multiplayer sits waiting to connect...then exits to desktop.It...looks nice? There's a positive. The rules are consistent, and the AI doesn't seem to cheat. The control sceme is fiddly with my mouse, even turned way down. Don't know about anyone else.Acheivements aren't a priority for me, but it'd be nice if they *worked*. As anyone can see from the forums and other reviews, the developer just doesn't care. If you plan to buy the game, only get it super cheap (say, 50 cents or less) and and don't expect achievements.			"

												Abstract board games are amongst the oldest entertainments devised by humanity. And despite the dominance of ancient classics like Chess and Go, abstracts are still being designed and produced in the modern age. Like most abstracts, it’s pretty simple. The game is played with marbles on a hexagonal board. You can push a group of one to three marbles as one move, so long as they all move in the same direction. If you can line up more marbles along an axis than your opponent, then you can push them backwards. The aim is to push your opponents’ marbles right off the board.A slow paced game that at first is reminiscent of Chinese checkers, but is actually quite different. Whether playing the puzzle mode against the computer or a game against a friend, board game and puzzle fans will find value in this title.While the gameplay is extremely engaging however, the camera controls and presentation are a little on the average side. The textures have a soft blur focused look to them and the background music isn't that memorable. Also, there is no move function when zoomed in and the game is forcing you to zoom back out instead.In general, fans of the game, or those that love competitive board games like Chess,  should be very entertained by this game. It has the right balance of depth and complexity, and barring a few niggling control and visual issues, is a top notch digital version of a very interesting board game.			"

												I tried to install this game - and my antivirus deleted it. So after couple more tries, I turned off antivirus and installed + ran the game. So I launched it, and turned antivirus on. Game got deleted again.So in the conclusion, I can not recommend this game. Simply because my antivirus finds a virus in it.Gen:Variant.Sirefef.439http://www.europe.f-secure.com/cgi-bin/AT-Wdescssearch.cgi?search=Gen:VariantSo devs, fix it, I can play it and rate then.			"

												I bought this so I could play online, but after quite a few matches I'm not even sure anymore whether I'm playing real human beings or some AI made to pretend there are actual people playing this half-hearted abomination of a port.There really is no way to tell, because the game offers no chat functionality or any way to make contact at all. In addition to that nicknames seem to be masked or something - every search for player's profiles I made on Steam turned out empty. Why?Well, if there are people playing, matchmaking almost always gives you ridiculously weak opponents: they walk into the most obvious traps and let their forces be split incredibly easy. Out of my 50 games I had like 2-3 really good ones.Besides that the game has a lot more issues:- some people seem to be unable to start the game at all- Devs don't care / forum's dead- Connectivity- Ugly unintuitive menusDon't get me wrong though - Abalone in itself is a great tactical game with a certain geometrical beauty to it. Try it if you dare!			"

												Frankly, releasing a game on Steam that loads a black screen on today's resolutions is a bit sad.  If you are like me and were getting the janky background music on a small black screen try dropping the resolution of your launch monitor to 1024x768.  That at least permitted the graphics to load for my rig, which nominally has a multimon setup at 3640x1920.Once in the game, however, things didn't really improve.  ESC doesn't bring up a settings menu, it exits the game.  That's massively frustrating when you are searching for the controls in order to get going.  Thankfully, the launch sequence takes a while every time you reflexively hit ESC in an attempt to get to any control-map or settings.Ultimately, this is a bad port to PC.			"

												Abalone is a strategy game with very simple rules (the tutorial will take about a minute of your time), but is pretty tricky to play.  I've never played the physical boardgame before, but this digital version seems solid enough, and in addition to the requisite multiplayer options, has many single-player scenarios to teach you the basics and progressively tougher strategies (I've only played SP so far).See those screenshots on the store page? That's exactly what the game looks like--no bells and whistles here.  I've encountered only one music track so far, and it loops pretty fast, but I just turn it off and play my own music... or have silence if I need to concentrate, which is most of the time ;) The controls are very simple, and there are easy ways to backtrack if you accidentally click on the wrong piece. However, you can really tell this is a port of a game that had touch controls; small things like having to move your cursor all the way to the bottom right corner to finish your turn could have been a bit more streamlined for the PC version.The big question for single players is: is the AI good?  As of now, I'm working through the scenarios to learn the game and the AI is still at the Easy level, but as a complete newbie I find there's still a fair amount of challenge to be had and I'm improving and making steady progress. Would a veteran Abalone player be challenged at more difficult levels? I'm not good enough to judge properly! But for a beginner, the difficulty seems accurate so far.Just a note for achievement hunters that this game does have achievements, but they appear to be broken.Abalone is straightforward strategy game that wears its boardgame origins on its sleeve, and has a good amount of content for the Single Player. It may not have any flash, but it's solid.			"

												Abalone is a board game app done by a company called Bulky pix which doesn't seem to exist anymore as I could find no web page and the developers never respond to any customer’s complaints about Steam achievements not working. The game is really awful. It has a terrible tutorial which tries to teach you how to play the game while quoting some random quotes from Sun Tzu as if it's some sort of profound sensei.4-5 million people have played the game Abalone throughout their lifetime and for those people this version is hardly to be considered fun as it has no proper match making ability. Hence a novice will probably be pitted up against a world champion in no time. The ai in the single player is perfect and never makes a mistake. Some people have made a statement that violent video games make people violent. I don't believe that. I personally believe that BADLY MADE/UNFAIR GAMES make people violent and there are a few of those that I have banned myself from playing. This is soon to be one of them. The game is so unfair that I often start shouting 'FRUIT' at the top of my lungs and yodelling threats that I’m about to get a sledgehammer so I can turn their marbles to gelatine.The board game has often been criticised that it’s possible to make a game go on forever by simply taking a defensive position and maintaining that. This version prevents that from happening as you’re often dictated that you need to win the game in so many moves etc.Because of non-working Steam achievements, deaf eared developers, bad match making and completely unfair ai, this game gets a solid thumbs down as I often found myself losing more than my marbles every time I played it...Below is an example of me playing one of the advanced levels called ‘war stage 3’, originally I was going to give someone 5 steam games for simply showing me the solution to it, but somehow I magically found a bug and was able to win by setting out only one of my opponents marbles though in reality I was supposed to set out two. After that I begin to look at ‘War stage 4’ and after getting frustrated with it after a couple of seconds I now hold out the 5 Steam game reward to the person who can show me the solution to this puzzle. It should be enough of a sample for you to work out if this is the game for you. Thanks for reading…
