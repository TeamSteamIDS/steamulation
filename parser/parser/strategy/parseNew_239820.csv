												Game Dev Tycoon has taught me a lot about how consumers and reviews influence which games succeed and which don't. I started off on my second full playthrough of the game having some knowledge of how to play it already. However, this time I was doing something different. I named my company ""Activision"" and set out to reinvent the First Person Shooter, starting with Call of Duty but not going overboard with it. Call of Duty was a great success with reviews and sold millions of copies! I made a few sequels and once I had enough cash and enough skilled employees, I decided Call of Duty had outlived its usefullnes and decided to stop making sequels. I was now ready to reinvent the shooter, it was going to be a cyberpunk adventure FPS with a focus on story and characters. The idea was great in my head and we even spent millions on a new engine for the game to really shine. I pressed the ""Finish Game"" button and was expecting 9's and 10's. What I got was nothing of the sort. My heart sunk when I saw the 3's and 4's saying that ""Cyberpunk"" and ""FPS"" don't mix well and was even more nervous when I saw the low sales numbers. We were nearly bankrupt damn it! That engine alone cost us  millions and the game took a huge amount of money to develop! I paused the game and sat there, thinking what we could do to save ""Activision"". I then looked at my game history. We had a few games that sold alright but nothing that sold as well as ""Call of Duty"" that's when I did the unspeakable. I clicked the ""Make Sequel"" button and made yet another ""Call of Duty"" game. I felt sick as the reviews came in with 8's and 9's, saving the company and making millions, but stomping on our morals and values. The entire reason I made the company was to avoid such a thing, when in the end I had become what I had set out to destroy! 10/10 for realism			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a tycoon strategy game where you create your own game development company. You start as a guy/gal working out of a cramped garage in the 80's and as you create popular games you'll gradually grow until you have enough money for a new premises as well as the option to hire employees. As you continue to grow you'll be able to make bigger, better games, research new technology to gain an advantage, create your own MMOs and even create your own powerful game engines.+Nice simple graphics+A lot of depth to it, especially as you unlock more things to do later in the game+A huge variety of topics to choose from when creating your game+A wide variety of consoles that come and go as time goes by+The market responds to games in a realistic way+Some good random events though there aren't enough of them+The game lets you grow your company at a natural rate and only allows you to expand when you have enough money+You can take publishing contracts or other freelance work to earn some extra money inbetween making games+You have a lot of control over your game as you can decide how much time is spent working on certain aspects/elements of the game, when working on larger games you can choose who works on what aspect+You can train yourself and your employees to be better at different skills which improves your games and improves how quickly they are made+The game keeps track of what topics and genres work well on what console and what elements of the game are most important+Very relaxing to play+Lots of replayability+Nice sound effects+Workshop support+Very low requirements to run it-Once you've played it once nothing comes as a surprise such as when games consoles get taken of the market-The size your company can reach isn't overly big, it never gets any bigger than a medium indie team-Soundtrack is a bit repetitive at timesVerdict:9A fantastic game development strategy game with nice graphics, a lot of depth and a real feeling that you're in control.

												I enjoyed this game greatly, Unfortunaly the mods do not work for me, but that is a personal problem (bad pc) so don't let that discourage you. I shall now make a list. The Good : The replay value is very good for a non-sandbox gameMany strategies (bumps up replay value even more)Steam Workshop (mods available)I just always wanted to make my games, but I am terrible at code (personal opinion to fill up the list)Many other small touches to the game (how they changed the console names a bit, but enough to be rocognized, historical events {nigerian scammers for example} or other small things) The Bad Too short of a history periodNot enough historical events, or even normal events that make big impact and The Ugly Not enough offices Need a news reporter that says when a big event occurs (ties in with nr.2 in The Bad) Wishlist DLCs!!!!!When new engine is available (lol) a sequelThat more people get to play this awesome game and feel the joy it brings..... oooow wait... that's my part as a reviewer right?Thank you for reading			"

												This game is basically the most addicting drug for anyone that loves and collects Games. When you start playing it, make sure you have nothing important planned in the next 8+ hours, because the next time you look at the clock your time will simply have vanished without you even realizing it =)I got the game way before it was on Steam directly from the developers website, they where fast and uncomplicated with providing steam keys, very nice!The game is not without flaws tough, the gameplay is fairly limited and not really complex, i am sure it could be expanded alot, but as this game was previously made and developed for pads and the mobile crowd, the devs most likeley kept it simple for those simple minds.Its also very fast paced, even when you set the gameplay lenght to the maximum, i didnt like that and felt a bit stressed because of it, neverthless you can play on endlessly after you have finished the ""storyline"" which reaches till the current next gen consoles.I encountered no bugs or other bad things, and generally its a pleasure to play. I can deffinatly reccomend this game to anyone who loves games and ever wanted to make ""Kitten Furball Apocalypse"" or similar funny games =)			"

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Game Dev Tycoon 

			Views: 1,295		

			Trent sits down and lives out a life long fantasy by running his own game development studio... Well, kind of; he actually just reviewed Greenheart Games' Game Dev Tycoon.		

Game development is where art and technology run headlong into one another; an arena where money, geekery, hubris and passion collide compressing under extreme heat to form gaming's diamonds, or going awry leaving behind Superman 64 style turds... While many gamers think they understand the tremendous amounts of skill, passion and balance required to make a great game, one trip to a message board usually exposes how little some of them understand about the process and challenges of game development. Greenheart Games has delivered a simulation that illustrates just how many compromises are made in the developmental process by emphasizing the budgets and time constraints that most titles are developed under and just how disastrous it can be to misappropriate time to features that are not central to the type of game that is being developed. Game Dev Tycoon comes together to form an accessible but insightful view of game development. Like any entrepreneurial endeavor, it all starts with giving your budding studio a name before setting up shop in your garage and plugging away at your keyboard. Aside from providing a facsimile of running a studio, Game Dev Tycoon is also a bit of a history lesson with the in game timeline chronicling the release of fictitious consoles that are based on the real life machines that many of us gamers grew up on. The demographics an traits of these platforms is represented as accurately as possible, meaning that a family friendly casual game might be best suited for a mobile platform while an intricate simulation will probably have the most success on the PC. Likewise, pairing an appropriate theme to your game's genre will yield the best sales and reviews. Developing a medically themed action game is a great way to go belly up. In this way, Game Dev Tycoon isn't interested in giving players the freedom to create eccentric titles that carve out their own niches, so developing your own Katamari Damacy or Mr. Mosquito is not a dream that this game is meant to help players fulfill. It's about business—moderating costs and selling as many copies as humanly possible. To do so, you can hire and fire staff, develop your own digital distribution platform, choose appropriate marketing campaigns and research new features and technologies that will earn new fans.  Developing a game in Game Dev Tycoon is somewhat reminiscent of playing Civilization, each member of your team has a Design rating and a technology rating. Each area of game development falls into these categories. Programming AI is all about technical experience while graphics are about design. As your game goes through each stage of development, your team will generate tech and design points and how many they generate depends on their rating in each category. The higher their rating, the faster they will produce these points. Balancing your point output to meet the needs of your game is imperative and team members can be trained to bolster their tech or design rating. The more experience a team member has the higher their level will be which also means that they earn a larger paycheck. Having six level ten developers working for you may sound like a recipe for success until your operating costs dig deeply into your profits. Fortunately you can hire and fire employees at any time. To manage costs.  Costs also mount when researching and developing new technology. Technologies can then be implemented into your studio's in house game engines. Keeping up with the tech curve and developing proprietary game engines keeps your studio on the cutting edge and can help generate sales. Bear in mind that the costs of new tech are not limited to implementing them into a game engine—each title you develop utilizing  special technology costs extra so spending the money to integrate surround sound into your latest text based adventure is ill advised.  Rounding out the fantasy of running your own development studio are PR and marketing opportunities. As your studio grows, the press will want to know about your latest products and your answers to their questions can earn additional fans and sales. Exercising unrestrained bravado and overhyping your games can earn your studio a Peter Molyneux sized ♥♥♥♥♥ slap, loosing fans and hampering your sales. Having a rabid fan base ensures a certain degree of success since loyal fans will line up to buy your newest project—even if it's titled Grass Growing Simulator or Guitar Hero: Nickleback. Also integral to the PR song and dance is having your own booth at industry trade shows. Having a booth requires a chunk of cash but with enough exposure, your studio can earn additional fans and prestige making it worth investing in. Investing in a marketing campaign will also boost sales potential but timing is key if you want to get the most out of your marketing dollar. While Game Dev Tycoon integrates almost every major element involved in bringing a game to market it does have a few faults. The largest of which is the lack of randomization. The proceedings are rather predictable, so don't expect any calamities to come along and shake things up. Your staff is always compliment and unlike real life they don't seem interested in seeking newer more lucrative opportunities, you never run into major development snags or delays that would force your studio to cancel a title. Combine this with the fact that running out of money simply means having to take a loan out from the bank and you have a sim experience that is far more forgiving than most. The genre and theme combinations never change nor do the demographics for genres and platforms so once you have discovered a few successful formulas in one playthrough, they will certainly work in an additional playthrough. All this comes together to make Game Dev Tycoon far less repayable than other titles in the genre.  Game Dev Tycoon is an enjoyable game that offers a bit of insight to the process of creating games and it even gives younger players a bit of history about gaming. It's clean and colorful visuals keep the mood light and it's mechanics make it far more accessible than other simulations games. The downside is it's predictability and lack of variation make it difficult to come back to after a dozen or two hours have gone into it. While it's price is set appropriately, fans of other simulators may be left wanting.			"

Don't touch me you filthy casual, she hissed at me as tears ruined her once flawless eye makeup. The efforts to console her were as pointless as our failing relationship. Let me start from the beginning. We grew up together, her and I. We learned so much from eachother, I can't even imagine being the person I am today without her. All the while, my cowardice refused to show how I'd felt deep down. The dread of knowing what we had wasn't going to last forever never showed its twisted skeletal frame during the time we spent together. In the interest of moving this review along I should say that the early days were coming to an abrupt end the night she caught me playing Game Dev Tycoon. It was a slow summer day at the office and I did some reading on the game. I was blown away by the brilliance of the developers who allegedly snuck in a bug in the leaked pirated version that made it impossible for your game company to succeed due to piracy. Irony deserves my money just as much as I do, so I made the purchase. That night I came home and sat down with her. She suggested I continue Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. I told her I'm not in the mood. She then pleaded, what about Bioshock Infinite? You've only put 2 hours in to it! No thanks, kinda really want to try this new game, Game Dev Tycoon. I've heard good things about it. It took minutes to finish the download and needed no update; she gave me the that's it? look. Ignoring her slights against the game's file size and dismissing her huffs against it not even warming up the AMD Radeon 7850, I continued to enjoy managing my way to become the next Valve. Figuring out the best game combinations and platforms is surpisingly addictive. The changes in the hardware industry brought back so many fond memories of the everlasting GameBoy and the all-too-brief Dreamcast eras. Hours later, f.lux triggered, my screen shifts to softer colors and that's when I realized what had happened. I was enjoying a casual game. That's the moment I knew her beautiful core i7 powered brain would never look at me the same way again. I tried not to cry. I cried alot. Her 500GB SSD would never want this memory of me, so I formatted her shortly after in the hopes that at least one of us will forget what we had. Goodbye my sweet BitFenix Prodigy build 01, may you forever dream in code. Oh, that and I didn't want to activate Windows 8.1. That OS is complete sh!te and you should stay away from it.			"

I recommend custom PCs to be built by the hardware lab. Just more things in general. This game is virtually complete as it reaches the point of modern technology and can advance no further. people complain about the lack of content and while it may eed a little bit more it does have just about everything. I recommend you get mods for it once it gets boring on normal. The mods and more topics and allow you to build different stuff. Be careful though as you may break the game and have to restart from scratch. I highly recommend this game it is defintatly woth $10.00. If you have played this before then you will understand me when i give this game a 10.25 out of 10			"

												This game isn't realistic at all. I keep trying to make the same war-themed FPS over and over again with the same engine, the same story, but different names. However, they sell too little, and I keep getting low scores. The developers of Game Dev Tycoon should learn a little bit from something called 'reality.' For instance: take a look at how well Call of Duty does both financially and critically. How come I can't sell garbage for a lot of money to a lot of people?Please, fix this on the next update.			"

Well, with all that being said, all you need to know is that this is a clever, and altogether fun game about developing games.			"

												I enjoy this game so much. Whenever I'm bored, I just play this game over and over again. When I first bought this in May, I was lost at why I wasn't doing good and kept going backrupt. I then had to go to the wiki to write down and memorize the algorisms to do well; at the beginning it was a b***h, but later I got used to it. Then once the 1.4 update came out it added so much more to the game like multi-platforms, new consoles in the timeline (mBox One and Playsystem 4), and so much more! When they changed the algorisms which kinda disappointing but made more sense when you logically think topics and development phases through such as world design being more important in RPGs and not as much in causal games. However there's something about this game that makes me wanna keep playing, it makes me want to challenge myself and use different approaches to developing games. I believe the best part of this game is trial and error, the use of editing almost everything, and the replay value. I love greenheart games for the approach and philsophy they took towards this game. No microtransactions, no charging extra for the essential items that complete a game, just a straight 10 dollar game from developers that give you what you paid for. I highly recommend this game to anybody to at least try it. I'd give this game a 9.5/10. The reason for that is although I could play this game for hours on end, there are some realistic functions that this game is missing that I'd love to see. Such as company functions, combonations of different topics and genres, and ect. This game still has some work to do like all games; however, I can guarantee that you will find enjoyment in this game. Good Luck to Greenheart Games!! :)Update!: I have used mods recently, I recommend you DO NOT use them. The mods are currently in beta however they seem to just add consoles and far too many sports topics (Eg; tennis, ice hockey, hockey, unnecesary pointless topic that go under the catorgy ""sports"" for a reason). Feel free to try them to enhance your experience of the game. I just didn't enjoy it myself.Update (9/25/14): I waited until the steam workshop was added onto this game and I must say, the mods have made the game 5x better! You have from new topics, to pie charts, to making your own prices, to new consoles, and so many more! I now highly recommend them THROUGH THE WORKSHOP! I cannot say downloading them from the developer's website is the best solution, mainly because the workshop is optimised for the game and best for those with little to no mod knowledge. But I will say the mods have made this game, easily, one of my most favorite games and my choice for best modern tycoon game to date.			"

												A fun little indie game with some nice easter eggs built in.The all allusive 100Million achievement will keep you going and going at this until you achieve it.A little bit repetitive, however it is still good.I would reccomend that once you complete it first time to play through using the hints you have obtained about the different genre's, gaming systems, etc. To improve your chances of getting the 100 Million Acheivement.One thing to note is that i still consider MMo's to be bugger as costs keep spirallying upwards never down.

It incoorporates facts and real events into the game like the release of the PS1, NES, etc. Game Dev's real gem is that it can be played over and over again. The thing about game-Dev is how well it was madeand functions realisticaly (although not everything is realistic in terms of a tychoon game). Game dev has an overall rating of 9/10 on my list, and I think it would be too on yours. Please buy this game, it will be a good descision.			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE:I'm reposting some of my old reviews because I adopted an easier to read format (and because for some reason I can't edit my old reviews)INTRODUCTION:The first game developed by Greenheart Games, Game Dev Tycoon is a Simulation game that, not just tries to mimic the events and hardships of game development studios, but also teaches the player a little bit of history on how our favorite pass time (or hobby) grew into this giant of an industry we see today.STORY (No Spoilers):Game Dev Tycoon places you in the shoes of a start up developer who will be making games for the different gaming platforms. Starting from the early days of the PC and Govodore G64 (Commodore 64), the game will send you through history up until the Console wars of the MBox One (Xbox One) and the Playsystem 4 (Playstation 4). Make games, hire staff members, research new technologies and build yourself to be the most popular and successful Game Developer in the world.PROS:+ Very nice 'Fash' type Art Style and animation+ Surprisingly fun game mechanic+ Relaxing and pleasing sound effects and music but...(See CON #1)+ Great Re-playability+ Fairly accurate historical progression on the video game industry's history+ Good Value / Play time ratio+ Minimal system requirements+ Steam Cloud and Workshop Support+ Devs trolled pirates of their game (They uploaded a cracked version of their game that, if played, would backrupt the player's company ironically due to piracy.)+ Relatively cheap (at $10 or your regional equivalent) for its highly replayable game timeCONS:- Could use more Soundtracks- Could use more randomized and recurring events- Limited Staff- Game Review is a bit lacking on information on why your game did well (or poorly)- A bit predictable if you followed the Game Industry's history since you can easily bet which platform would be most successful.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME. Easy to understand and easy to learn but very difficult to master. It is a game that both Hardcore gamers and casual players can both enjoy.WORTH IT?For $10 (or your regional equivalent), the game is well worth its full price and should be a no-brainer if it goes on sale. Playing this game gives a great feeling of satisfaction as well as a bit of understanding why game developers make the decisions they do.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Game Dev Tycoon is game about making games. You start in the 80’s and make your way up to modern times with new and innovative technologies.As far as the story goes, Game Dev Tycoon kind of lacks one, but in this instance, thats a good thing. The gameplay is your custom character sitting in a desk making games and sometimes doing contract work. After you make a large sum of money from a large selling game, you move up to a more spacious office, instead of your garage. After time, you progress further, making new games, developing new game engine’s and making a name for your company. The sound in the game is good overall, the music fits well. The sound of the research bubbles is oddly satisfying, but may get annoying over time. The graphics of the game aren't the best, but aren't needed for this sort of game. The way the player makes a good game is based on complex math algorithms, but the player can check trends in the market, and experiment with different combos of game styles and genres in order to appeal to the masses Game Dev Tycoon does some things wrongThe lack of story after completion makes the game boringIt’s easy to go bankrupt from a few bad games in the first 3 areasSome employees early on are useless unless trained, costing a lotThe random events sometimes get in the way of game productionThe game isn't always as realistic as it could beIts slow to startSometimes you start with bad gamestylesThe games achievements aren't very easy to mostGame Dev Tycoon does a lot right tooThe feeling of going through the years is satisfyingThe ability to name your games and companyIt’s a satisfying feeling getting a high score on a gameThe game makes you want to keep playingThe researching is realisticThe game has playing cards and a steam workshopGame Dev Tycoon isn't the best tycoon game available, but i would argue that it is the best game dev game. Its an Indie casual game made to kill some hours, and that is just what it will do. Overall i think the game is worth the $10.99(CAD) price tag, if you blow some hours into it, and play it more than once. "

 Game Dev Tycoon  Review: Overview Game Dev Tycoon is a small game where you start up a game devlopment studio; starting from working in a basement into having a large workforce in a studio. The idea is quite innovative since you are literally taking on the role of making games inside of a game itself. Not such an attempted idea as the infamous 'Superheroes fighting against Villans in a large city' where the hereos always win. Anyway, back to the game. As a developer you choose the name of the game, the audience, genre, topic, which staff member focuses on what part of the game (such as Jeffery does most of the Graphical work, Stephanie focuses on the Sound and so on) and basically allows for mass customization. Heck, you can develop a racing game without any DLC's and that focuses on actual gameplay instead of pretty graphics that you will look at for 2.3 seconds before crashing due to high speeds. Keep in mind, the game tries to take itself seriously, so a game that focuses too much on one thing, too little on another, will recieve lower ratings (four gaming reviewers will rate your game x/10.) and therefore less sales. As you get more cash and more staff, a larger studio will become mandatory unless you want a smaller but more trained workforce (yes, you can train every worker to be good at a particular subject, such as Technological workers and Designers) so less workers will be stressed out enough to need a vacation (bad for business, games are meant to be made at a gaming company). You can plan out a strategy for your workers if you want, I remember I used to be a researcher due to a high speed rating (speed levels can make your worker to research/train themselves faster and become more efficient) and let them create the games. Gameplay Quite fun if you ever considered doing this as a job or a hobby. The game can be classed as educational in a way since now you know not to mix Racing with RPG or some other, terrible combination.  It's fun because it shows brings you on a journey of a once single developer living in his (parents') basement and how their hobby turned into a job, granting them a lot of cash, workforce and vice versa. You choose how it plays out, choose terrible combinations and take it as a joke; you will stay in the basement. Actually pick something innovative; you will succeed in game development. Other than having a moral, the game is still fun no matter if taken seriously or as a way of passing time by since you can accidentally create an AAA game by raising all the sliders to full priority and watching the crowd go crazy racing to the nearest Gamestop. Quite hilarious. Pros and Cons: Pros:Great funMoralCheapRealistic situationsDecide the story outcomeQuite useful for future devsCons:HuD is quite huge and not very attractive TL;DR Great game for a great price which is a great buy for a great deal of tips. Definitely worth considering on sale or buying the discusses sequel.  I have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.

Line a 24cm square baking tin with greaseproof paper. In a large bowl over some simmering water, melt the butter and the chocolate and mix until smooth. Add the cherries and nuts, if you’re using them, and stir together. In a separate bowl, mix together the cocoa powder, flour, baking powder and sugar, then add this to the chocolate, cherry and nut mixture. Stir together well. Beat the eggs and mix in until you have a silky consistency.Pour your brownie mix into the baking tray, and place in the oven for around 25 minutes. You don’t want to overcook them so, unlike cakes, you don’t want a skewer to come out all clean. The brownies should be slightly springy on the outside but still gooey in the middle. Allow to cool in the tray, then carefully transfer to a large chopping board and cut into chunky squares. These make a fantastic dessert served with a dollop of crème fraîche mixed with some orange zest. "

												Absolutely amazing game  but disappointing at the same time.  Pros - ""Pick up 'n play"" - After a year of not playing, you'll still remember the controls and mechanics.- Very simple but yet effective UI.- You make this game as difficult as you want - do you stick with small and medium games and make decent income, or do you focus on AAA MMOs and dominate the market with your financial power?- There's actually a 'goal' to this game - to achieve as high of a score as possible before 36(?) in-game years.- The game has a amazing casual feel and good gameflow, time spent playing will slip through your fingers like sand.- You're not limited to just games and you will work your way up as you go along - you start off in a basement/garage building small text games and before you know it you're the CEO of a AAA company building your own engines and consoles. Cons - After moving in to your last office, having unlocked all the R&D stuff and after having built 1 or 2 consoles, the game gets boring really quickly. (Starting a new game might resolve this bug)- To me personally, the game feels lacking, don't get me wrong, it is amazing as it is, but I feel like it could have been  so much more.  What would be nice is maybe building your own OS, creating your own software and maybe have the game expand more on the consoles you get to make. I understand that this is a  game dev  tycoon but I see this game more as an amazing base for a computer industry tycoon and I really do hope that the devs do something and try to expand on this.- The Steam Workshop feels lacking, while there  is  a Steam Workshop, do not expect too much from it. Unless you want a more accurate translation to Chinese or Russian it might not be for you. TL;DR This is an amazing game and absolute worth however much money you happen to spend on it and will grant you many hours of enjoyable playtime and yet feels lacking in some areas. This is a game I would most definitely recommend			"

												Yes I like the game.But I really dislike some part of the mechanics.If possible, I would rate this neutral. As I can't do this, I decided for negative.The problem is: when I just mark this review as ""positive"", no one ever reads about negative remarks in this game. But currently there is barely any negative rating or posivite review with a ""contra"" that has more content than ""I don't like this"" (although there a quite a few funny ones ;) ).So I write this to show people like me, who read negative comments first, that this is a good game in general. But still not 100% recommandable.Also, after reading the wiki about the rating mechanic, I really thought about stopping to play. Unfortunately (?), I'm kind of a perfectionist, wanting to finish the game at least once...Simulator + PC = GreatEveryone/Mature + PC = GreatDesign: 100, Tech: 80That's basically the main flaw of the game:The Design/Tech Ratio. Design is great / Mechanics, for a sim, not!Design:* Love the artwork, the productive bubbles and sound.* Also love all those somewhat ironic texts, scam mail ( I am nubian princess with lots of money for you :D ).* And fu**** love all those hidden references to lots of games and even movies (seriously, back into the future!)* Nice touch with moving from garage to office to bigger office and lots of things you can do.*And, of course, the relation to real world PC and Console over the past 30 years.Awesome, guys!Tech:* Great Sound* Beautiful graphics.* Moving around feels a bit sluggish and menus not always responding, but that's still ok.Aaannd here comes the big fat but (one ""t"" only):The calculation of game scores.1) As you're the only company in this game, your scores are always calculated against your own.This effectively means 2 things:- You need to improve your score from game to game. Not too fast, only steady improvements. So if you make some awesome RPG with great Tech/Design ration and then an potentially great Simulation - the latter needs to have a bit better Tech and Design values (according to ratio) than the previous game.- That leads to times where it is better not to make a huge jump in quality, as it then is harder to improve further. But instead to leave bugs in the game for decreasing it's rating, and making it easier for the following game topping the score again.This is a really annoying part of the game in my opinion, as you cannot focus on good values and features, but might have to ""sabotage"" your efforts if you see the game might be ""too"" good.Maybe something regarding the engine features would've helped here (like a new game should not miss certain features games before from the same genre had )2) Tech/Design ratio mechanicNo matter how great your design or your tech is, you will get bad scores if the ratio is not perfect enough.In general this makes kind of sense, as a simulation needs more tech focus than a casual game.But let's see this: I make a 10/10/10 game with 100 tech and 160 design (like RPG). Then I make another RPG with 200 tech and 250 design afterwards. This will get worse ratings than the previous, as the ratio is not 1.6, but 1.2.So lots of improvements, yet the game sucks. Ah-hah.2.5) This is especially annoying if you take the sliders into account, as the granular settings mean nothing (which maybe could've eased up the previous problem).After you make a lot of post-release game research, the game tells you how important one thing is for what kind of genre. Like Action games have a ""+++"" (very important) in sound, whereas RPG only have a ""++"" (for example, don't remember exact values right now).But when developing a game which needs a ratio, let's say, 1.5 (more design than tech) and you have only a ratio of 1.0 in the end of the 2nd development phase...The sliders might tell you that you should put ""++"" in tech (e.g. sound) -> but when doing so, you will usually get an even worse ratio!In the first playthrough I failed in the 2nd office, because after having a couple of successful games, where I adjusted the sliders to my general game knowledge, I used the slider recommendations (e.g. --- for nothing, +++ for full, ++ for half) and now the ratios were complete wrong.In no tutorial or whatsoever I found the reason for my mediocre games.Only after reading a couple of wiki pages about the ratio thingy I started to ignore the game recommendations and only adjusted the sliders depending on ratio I needed. Which is usually 100% for 2 of them and 0% for another (even if that 0% is according to game ""+++"" !)That's it. Combine this with a couple of staff trainings after each great game and you're done.3) SequelsMaking a Sequel in nearly 1 Year after another brings BAD scores. (if it's around <1 year - did not measure exact amount of weeks).Like 1/1/1 BAD scores.Unless you use a major upgraded engine. Then you might get a 3-5.Not major upgrading the engine for a sequel in general is also bad, even if the previous game was made a couple of years ago.Really?Ever heard of Call of Duty? Or Fifa? Or... ;)Summarum:Great game!If you like sim games, definitely get it.But there is still room for improvement!Try a better tech/design ratio next time, Greenheart Games.And remember to upgrade the Engine and wait >1 Year or so ;)PPS:If you're bankrupt some text similar to this appears:""Fortunately, Electronic Mass Productions has bought your studio.Fans cry and bury their hopes.""- Guess the reference :D  UPDATE Dev Response 2016-01-26 First, thank you for your comment.Glad to see that you care even about an older game here on Steam :)I believe you when you say you changed that behavior.Which, however, confuses me somewhat: as I did play this game some time after the Steam release (and only installed it then), most of your tweaks should've been in there by then.When using said imbalances I found in the wiki, as outdated it might be, to my favor, I was:* able to consecutively get great game scores (>8 average) while not listening to (most of) the ingame +++/--- report evaluations* failing most of my games (<=5 avg), when listening to the evaluations -> common in the last dev phase, where the ratio gets fu.. mixed up.* feeling that, beside said sliders, most other things like engine features had diminishing influence* still having that first game after every 9,x hit which was 90% of the time way worse in game rating (esp. when not having a real perfect ratio). Best seen after a hit or having very high scores, for example, right after adding a good team member and/or lots of staff training in one go* seeing sequel mechanic somewhat lackingMaybe my wording in this review here was somewhat biased in the end after reading about everything. Too much time since then, can't really recall, sorry.Still the mechanics (and my ""what the heck am I doing wrong?"") at that time where the reason which lead me to even look into a wiki in the first place. So in the end my experience was still the described one:Where I found the core tech/design mechanic to be too indistinctive about the seemingly huge possibilities of not only slider adjustments, but also team, engine etc. Thus making my game scores a total mess or, after reading and comparing my own game scores, very predictable.That being said:Your are mostly right, that those problems are somewhat overstated for many players. Which is also the reason I still say that simulation fans should still try it. And I really hope your game (still) is a success.Just for some players like me, these issues are like an itch in the eye you just cannot ignore.			"

												really nice, it may look ridiculous but it is totally not! in fact, you are constantly aiming to get that infamous 11/10 score for your game, and probably willing to play until you get it.so you just start in your garage with a pc and some knowledge for developing games, you make your first game, get some money, make a new/better game, research some stuff and gain some fans until you get a bigger office, after that you search some workers to help develop bigger games, and so on....you have to look out for getting bankrupt and scammers, so it's not just adjusting sliders to make a game, create new stuff and become one of biggest game developers in the industry!good luck ;)i give the game a 8/10 a bit more stuff would be nice, but ofcourse it's from a small company so it's pretty damn nice!One of my favorite games really!

												There are a plethora of “Tycoon” games on the market.  The smartphone market is flooded with them, Steam has a ton, and there are new ones hitting the cheap deals stands at Walmart on a near constant basis.  Lemonade Stand Tycoon, Airline Tycoon I and II, Chocolate Tycoon, Zombie Tycoon, DinerTown Tycoon, Offshore Tycoon, Hotel Giant, four Prison Tycoon titles, and Zoo Tycoon doesn’t even begin to cover 1% of the Tycoon marketplace.  When Game Dev Tycoon hit the market, you can imagine that it didn’t even make it onto my radar because that genre is so saturated.  You can imagine my surprise when some of my friends simply couldn’t stop talking about it.  After more than a decade on this side of the fence, it was time to see how the other half lives – it was time to become a Game Developer.  Much to my surprise, it was time to review a Tycoon title.Starting off in a small garage all by yourself, Game Dev Tycoon casts you an aspiring game developer.  You’ll kick of your career like most indie devs – mere feet from boxes and your tarp-covered car.  Picking a name for your game, a topic, a genre, a platform, and an engine to power it are the building blocks for pushing a title out the door, at least in the beginning.  With humble beginnings you’ll only have a few topics to pick from – sports, medieval, military, and space, but a great many more are just waiting to be unlocked.  Similarly, genres are fairly limited in the beginning, giving you action, RPG, simulation, and strategy to start.  Much like the real thing, in the beginning there is only PC as a selectable platform because consoles and handhelds haven’t been ‘invented’ yet.  It’s nothing if not simple in the beginning.After nailing down the elements of your game you’ll work through the development process.  There are three phases to releasing a game.  In the first phase you’ll chose how to divide your time and resources between story, gameplay, and the engine. The sliders for all three can be drug all the way to the top, but this does extend the development time of your game dramatically.  When you are a one-man shop with very limited funds, this is a dangerous gamble.  The second stage of development asks you for the same decision on dialogues, level design, and AI, then stage three gives you the same thing for world design, graphics, and sound.  As your fingers dance away at the keyboard, your development bubbles up game points towards technology, research, and design.  It also bubbles up bugs – bugs that will cost additional time and money to fix…that is unless you turn a blind eye to them and hope your fans do the same.During development you can also add additional features.  The pool is pretty shallow to start, but like genres and topics, you can use research later to unlock many more.   These can be mono sound, 3D graphics, joystick or steering wheel support, and other bullets you might see on the back of a real-world game box.  When the game is finished and all the features are locked you can release it immediately, but you might want to think about fixing those bugs first.  The longer your game dev goes, the more points will bubble up towards all of the development areas.  When it’s said and done you’ll earn experience in all of the areas where you’ve focused, as well as personal experience for you as a developer.  Publishing the game brings the moment that all developers absolutely love, anticipate, and dread – reviews.  Shortly after completion you’ll get a stack of four reviews from a random slice of fake game reviewers.  They all come with a short blurb and a score from 1 to 10.  These scores have a direct impact on the sales that follow, so putting out a well-reviewed product becomes important quickly.  You’ll earn more fans with a great game, and build your fanbase with great releases.As you develop you’ll also earn research points that you can spend on learning new topics and genres as well as new features for your basic engine.  New topics, multiplayer, online support, and much more can be attached to the engine, eventually transitioning it to a fully-3D system.  The best dev houses out there build their own engines though, and you’ve got an opportunity to do exactly that.  Building an engine is a costly proposition, both in terms of development time as well as researching and building features.  Adding stereo sound to your custom engine instead of just mono might not be all that expensive, but moving to a full orchestral soundtrack is a colossal undertaking.  Your engine won’t take you forward year after year though, so you’ll end up making several over the course of the game.  You can’t switch engines mid-development (Prey, Duke Nukem Forever, Anachronox, Too Human, etc – pay attention) so selecting the right features and sticking with it is your only choice.Sitting around cashing the dwindling paychecks from your freshly-released game might be great, but when it dries up you’re gonna have a bad time.  Your game will only stay on the market a limited time, and audiences get awful upset when you release a sequel immediately (e.g. Left 4 Dead 2), so branching out gives you a slight bonus to your experience as well as a better reception with fans.  Spending research points means not spending time developing games, so you might find your cash beginning to dwindle. To help keep your shop afloat you can also take on contract work.   The contracts ask you to generate a certain amount of design and tech points in a specific timeframe.  Failure to hit your contract goals forces you to pay a penalty, so biting off only what you can chew is critical.  Given that new contracts only pop up every 6 months, you’ll have to use them wisely.People don’t want to work in your stinky, greasy garage.  To begin your development in earnest you’ll need to build a team – you can’t do everything yourself for long.  Once you move into a small office you can begin to hire staff and develop their skills as well.  At this stage you’ll have access to books and classes that help build up your design, speed, tech, or research skills, as will your staff.  Just like time developing an engine, it’s not being spent on building games, so balance is key.Hiring talent isn’t cheap or easy, so advertising the job will cost you somewhere between 20k to 2 million.  Getting a good mix of specialists and generalists will help you create a team of world-class game developers, but balancing budgets and payroll against income starts to affect the types of games you make as well as development time.  Strategy really begins to kick in here. When you get to the point where you can start making Engine specialists, Level Design specialists, and other disciplines you’ll have to carefully plan to not tip the scales too far in any one direction.The game industry is in a constant state of flux, and platform leaders have a chance of changing with the introduction of new devices.  Snarky plays on the real world give you things like the “Play System”, “Ninvento TES”, “G64”, and many more that I don’t want to spoil for you.  Developing on these platforms means paying a huge lump sum to the parent company before you can even start, so building a game on a new platform could be costly.  That said, if that’s where the market is, you’ll have to join the fight where it lies.When I finish some games I smile, nod, and then shelve them forever.  Once I completed Game Dev Tycoon I immediately fired it up for round 2. For the price of a cup of coffee you can pick this game up. Don’t be one of the 97% that pirated it.  Game Dev Tycoon is the one Tycoon title worth buying.Recommended "

Played it for days on end and finally got around to getting a steam account. First thing I did? Bought it.  While I haven't played much since purchasing (as free time seems to be harder to find these days...mainly to pay for my crippling addiction to buying games on steam) I loved every single moment of this game and hope to see more from the developers in the near Future. If you haven't played it yet, for the love of Odin; get on it.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a lot of fun, but ultimately pretty shallow.  The lack of a randomized console marketplace means that if you know anything about the game industry, you can just make X type of game on Y console at Z point in time and easily crush the marketplace, over and over and over.  And while that's fine for one playthrough, the whole thing plays out the same every single time you go again, meaning there's little to no replayability due to the predictable nature of the game.Visually it looks nice, audio-wise it works out well.  There are a few confusing gameplay elements, things like MMOs and how/when to release expansions aren't explained very well to the player (with some trial and error you can figure it out, but you might bankrupt yourself while you attempt to understand it), and sometimes it's hard to get a sense of what else is 'happening' in the industry as a whole, so you can't really respond to it.If the game added random marketplace behaviors and simulated other companies alongside you(instead of just releasing X game at Y timestamp every time), it would be fantastic and very replayable.  As it stands, I can't recommend it for more than a cheap steam sale purchase.Though there are some mods available for this game that could potentially alleviate some of these issues, it would be better if the developer dealt with them themselves.  Unfortunately, they seem to be done updating the game and there are still some core design decisions here that are unfriendly towards repeat playthroughs.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a business simulation game in which you have to replay the history of the gaming industry.The game begins in a garage with a commercial PC. The goal is simple you begin to develop games and try to become more and more successful. Once you move into a small office you can begin to hire staff.  At the start, income will come mostly from contract work. Research which you gain during gameplay can be invested in unlocking new game topics, technology and leveling up the abilities of your staff. Development itself is divided into several stages.Once you have decided a name, topic, genre, and console platform, the player is prompted with three screens of development factors. Each screen has a slider with three different elements, for example world design, sound and graphics. You can equalize all elements or focus on one. The player can later buy licenses to create games for ""Ninvento"" and ""Vega"" consoles, new challenges are introduced in the form of managing a staff, dedicating money to researching new technology and following current market trends. The game has a simple interface which makes it easy to jump in and play. Each run takes around 6-8 hours of gameplay. The game is very predictable, bet on history and you can not go wrong.The graphics of Game Dev Tycoon are very basic and it is fairly a quiet game in terms of sound effects.Game Dev Tycoon feels like a polished and very absorbing online flash game. But I have to admit, it is an addictive little game that eats away your time. So if you are looking for little game to spend your spare time you could try it with Game Dev Tycoon.Sounds 3/10Graphics 4/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

It is so much fun to experiment and discover what combination of game genre, platform and target audience is appreciated by the gamers. Your own experiences and insight sometimes proove you right, but sometimes they can get your company almost bankrupt.It also gives a very optimistic sneak peek of how an indie game developer's life is.

												When I look at all of the other reviews, I realize I put a lot more time in than some of these other players. The reason being is that this game is VERY fun. It gives you the freedom to name and design the way you want a game to be (to an extent). In my opinion, it is very replayable and you can easily put in many hours on this game. Once you ""beat"" the game, you can continue, although no new consoles will come out other than your own. The UI is simple and not cluttered. I notice many other tycoons make their UIs complex and harder to get the hang of. So this is a definite plus for me.Tl;Dr: If you like tycoon games with a lot of replayability and a sleek UI, this game is for you.			"

It takes a little while to figure out what works best and it can be frustrating at times, but once you get it the game is pretty easy. Should be fun to replay to see if you can beat your previous scores, since you can keep all the hints you found from your previous games.			"

												Score: 8.5/10Full Text Review:What Is Game Dev TycoonDid you ever want to start off your own video games company and create the games YOU always dreamed of? Game Dev Tycoon lets you replay the history of gaming by starting your own company in the 80's and start from nothing and become the most successful company in the video games industry.Like in any other business, you wanna reach the top in that industry, you wanna make a name for yourself that people will remember! But in order to achieve that, you have to start from scratch and from nothing. You start the game in the 80's, a time when the first PC's just came out and when the gaming industry was growing fast.The GameGame Dev Tycoon lets you start your adventure as a company in a small garage office as the only employee of your new company. With a small budget of only 70k, you finally start the action and start creating your first video game.The first step in developing your game is to pick a topic, a genre, a console to run in and of course, a catchy name that will attract the attention of gamers and game critics.When you are happy with what you picked, the 2nd part in developing your game is to choose a graphics engine for your future game. When you just start the game you can pick 1 out of 2 graphic engines. The simple text-based engine or the more complicated and advanced 2D engine. Later on you can research better versions of a 2D engine or a 3D engine.After being done with that, the more complex part comes. You are now creating the game itself, you will need to choose how much time to put in each part of the game. Let's say you are making a fantasy RPG game, in it you will want to spend more time on the dialogues and level design and less on the A.I. or if you are making an airplane simulation game then you will wanna spend more time on the engine and gameplay and less time on the story and quests. In order to create a good game, you need to know where to focus on the right elements. This can be mastered by trying and failing. or by basic knowledge (e.g. gameplay/engine on a military action game).While developing your game you will see design and technology points starting to generate. These points will determine how good the game is on design and on the technology. To get a good game you will want this to have a balance and not too much on design or too little on technology.During development, you also generate research points, as I said before, research points are used to get new engines, new game topics, new things that will help your company and its games grow such as marketing and a target audience.As you progresses in the game, new platforms will be released with their own target audience. Companies like Ninvento, Voony, and Mirconoft (A funny small spin-off for Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft) will start releasing their first gaming consoles with each focusing on different audience types.After a few successful games, you will leave your garage and move into a small office building or your own company headquarters that will let you start expanding your business and increasing your games potential even more.With this move, you will start making larger games, hiring employees and more opportunities to stand out in the crowd and finally start making that name of yours.Hiring new staff is an important thing that has to be done; each employee will be different, each with his own skills in design, technology or a balance between the two. Training your staff will improve the chances of releasing larger and more complex games that will require more money and better employees.If you don't have enough fans to create a large/AAA game (100k fans), you can use the help of a publisher who will grant you a small percentage of the total sales if you meet their requirements. If you fail to deliver the score for the game they asked for, you will have to pay a penalty.In your first few times you should aim to create games that are not that much different so that you would know what staff you would need so that you don't buy employees that have too much design and not enough technology skills will make your game fail cause as I said before, to get a good score you need a balance between design and technology.After your game is completed you will get a review from 4 critiques. The review system is not that good and will not provide any in-depth information on why your game got that score. When you get the score, they don't dont tell you why you got that score or tell you what had a major impact on the score.Even if your game is bad, you can create some hype around it using marketing campaigns. The more money you invest in that campaign, the more impact it will have on sales. You can also attend the G3 (like E3) convention to promote your games and boost sales and make lots of hype around your company and the game you are working on.If you need some extra cash or some research points you can accept a contract that you will need to complete within the time limit or you will need to pay the penalty like with a publisher contract.Later on in the game you can create your own research and development lab (R&D) that will grant you access to new projects like a digital distribution platform - Grid (like Steam), MMOs and even huge AAA titles.Creating your own hardware lab also has its advantages; you will be able to develop your own console and compete with other platforms and maybe even achieve the highest market share.The graphics of the game are decent for this kind of game, they are not meant to impress you but more to give you an idea of how successful you are, what are your works doing, etc...The sounds of the game are nice and are good for the background.The game also now offers people to use Steam Workshop to share thier mods and download them through steam.While playing the game I have found no bugs at all.The Good- Game ProgressionMoving on in the game, watching the video game inustry evolve is a lot of fun.- User FriendlyThe game is simple and easy to learn, features a tutrial at start, the rest is easy.- Sounds and Graphics Serve the Game WellThe basic sounds and graphics of the game are more then enough for it.- Simple GameplayNot really complicated and can be mastered by the average player.- Variety of Things to ResearchTopics, consoles, engine features, etc...- Easter EggsConsole names, posters, etc...- Steam WorkshopYep.The Bad- Repetitive (Steam Workshop helps with that to some, didnt help much to me)After a while, making a game is something you do by instincts and becomes too easy and simple.- Reviews for Your Games Are Not Detailed EnoughYou get a score, you at least wanna know what for.- Not Much Place for CreativityIf you try and do what is not what people are use to like a simulation RPG about pirates you will fail.The VerdictGame Dev Tycoon will take you back to the roots of the gaming industry and will let you start your company from scratch and get to the top. The game has a big selection of platforms and has a great game developing management and the ""story"" itself is good.The game has a few easter eggs that would take you back to the old days or remind you of some cool games you probably use to play, sounds and graphics that serves the game well and simple and fun gameplay.One thing that really bothered me was that a major thing in the game development is knowing how to improve your future games and yet the game fails to show you how to do so. It does offer you the option to write a game report but that wont tell you why you got that specific score.I highly recommend this game for any one who likes tycoon games or wants to just have a good time and open his mind to new games or be creative and make cool things such as engines, games and platforms.8.5/10 - Must Play			"

""N/A NOT WORTH A STATEMENT.""- Game HeroFirst of all, I want to thank you Greenheart Games, for the golden product of 2012. Second of all, I am truly impressed with this little indie gem. Telling about the history while going into history. Or at least memory of the players.I remember back in early 2012, developers released article about them, software piracy, and paying for games. I thought it was just a promo for the game that is about that at some point, but then again, it was truth. (If anybody know of wchich article I am speaking, send me a link to it because I cannot find it anywhere.)I am not entirly sure, why this game got me that much. I assume that it was during the time I was writing my seminar work and it was actually about history of gaming industry. Me myself, I am not even considering this game as a Game Dev Simulation. For me it is more about history and I want to say it is tribute to Gaming Fewer era back in the days, when it was hard to get a game, when it was hard to get a thing to play a game. And not even to the era, but also to the game itself. Companies and devs too.This is complex history, in absolutely awesome way provided to the gamers. For somebody it might be repetetive after while, but it all depends on how you do it and how you play it and if you enjoy going through the history and being inside the history. I have replayed that at least 4 times and still do not have enough. I am like the virgin after first sex now - I cannot get over it.However, this is first Greenheart Games project and I am not even going to lie - I WANT ANOTHER!Also I saw some requests of making DLC to the Game Dev Tycoon, and for me, I would support it definitely.Let us updated Greenheart!Bonus Point: Back To The FutureRating: 9.5/10 "

												This game is surprisingly addictive and fun as hell. It is a fun look at the history of real life game development through a fictional alternate world view. So, instead of an Xbox, for example, you have an Mbox. anywya, developing games and seeing how they pan out critically, watching their sales, etc...while also training your staff and learning more about developing games so you can create more powerful game engines that in turn allows you to make more powerful games, while trying to determine which console/computer type to release your games, what genre of game to develop, whether you should go multi plat (later on), whiole seeing what genres are trending, chatting with the press, fielding requests, teaching students, and so on and so forth are only a small part of what is actually a simple game, despite all that, lol.Plus, you can name your games whatever you want. I went with crass, vulgar, and offensive, lol. My company name in fact is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Disks for example (and that is relatively minor in my list of awful offenses in the game, lol).Anyway, this is a really, really, really, really fun game that I recommend trying out. You cant possibly conceive of how cool this game is without taking the leap and adding it to your library. Do this thing!9/10			"

												Although you probably won't find yourself wanting to go beyond a single 10 hour-ish playthrough, while it lasts it's a surprisingly fun, deceptively deep strategy game that allows you to work both halves of your brain, first pushing you to logically determine the right mix of genre, audience, platform, and developer skills to create that 10 out of 10 masterpiece, and then allowing you to give that masterpiece the most creatively ludicrous or obscene title your devious little mind can come up with.

												AAAAaaaa.... The bubbles pops up and the game I am developing gets better and better!!This is a very simple Tycoon game that's centered around our favorite industry. The game industry. You start out a your Garage around 1980 and eventually grow the company into a modem computer lab and make AAA titles! Probably take around 10 hours for 1 play though but takes quite a bit longer to master all the hints.(yes hints carries over each game even if you get game over).Not much story in it except we see all our favorite game consoles in a bit name change show up and then rise and fall during the electrical and digital age until now. Everything is number based with some randomized luck factor. Quite good music and sound effect is a bonus to this game. Last time I had this much fun seeing bubble adding states would be plague inc.The execution and planning is very well done and organized and interface is quite friendly too. Personally i think the game is a bit too fast paced that could use a bit slow down but difficulty will probably drop because it anyways.A solid 9/10 for this Tycoon game. I wish every Tycoon game is this well game.			"

												I can say without a doubt Game Dev Tycoon is one of the most unique games I have ever played. It is fulled with simple but fun and filling gameplay, that I find hard to describe. What it comes down to, gameplay wise is avoiding bankruptcy in your dev studio by releasign gmaes and doing contract work regularly, all while trying to release that hit game.  You hite staff, They each have four stats that increase with experiacne nad training, speed, research, design, and technology.      After you have you character and your staff good to go, you start making games, by choosing categorys, themes, genres, platforms and then deciding how to use your time developing graphics, gameplay, world design, etc.  Your research decides what you can make, so the more you research the broader and more complete games you can make. The default game runs your studio through 35 years of development, though the game has full mod support on the steam workshop, and has custom games.    I recommend Game Dev Tycoon to indie fans, or anyone who thinks it may be interesting, its really not that bad.			"

Game Dev Tycoon is a cute and witty take on the video game development process.  There is a certain level of addiction the game instills in the player, pushing you to continue to develop new titles or create new businesses to try and squeeze out the best review scores ensuring a steady stream of sales which equates to more cash for your little simulated development company. The pacing works well and gives you roughly 6-8 hours of play time for the 30 years you get to play. Once you reach the end the game does allow you to keep going, but no more story elements unfold (nothing beyond the PS4 and next Xbox).If you can find Game Dev Tycoon on sale on Steam it’s certainly worth picking up.THE GOOD- Addictive gameplay- Solid design- It is easy to understand- Fun real life gaming representations- You can interact with the communityTHE BAD- Can be very easy- Flat gameplayDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												Nice game. Very easy to start playing. Definitely easiest way to create your own game, so if you ever dreamed of that, you should try to realise this dream. It's funny for few hours but after some time it's getting boring, so if you are looking a strategy game for whole winter, this is just not it.VERDICT:If you in the mood to play simple tycoon and you dreamed whole your life about creating your own video games, you've just found the solution.Like this review?

												I really wish we had a yellow ""neutral"" option for reviewing a game, because this game really has a lot of great things going for it. Unfortunately, it also has quite a few bad things going for it that limited my enjoyment. Overall I'm marking this negative because even though the game was enjoyable, I find that it isn't worth $10.Before I get into the negative aspects I'll say what I liked about it. The graphic and graphic style is very nice. The sounds are pleasant and satisfying. The UI is a little finicky, but overall quite nice. Gameplay is also quite calming, and I found this game fun to play while watching something on my second monitor. Micromanagement is obviously a part of the game but not so much that its overbearing.So here's the bad parts. First, how the game works (in brief). In this game, you develop a game. You then get a rating from 4 reviewing companies on a 1-10 scale. How high your game is on the scale directly affects sales.This is all fine and well, but there is some obvious tom foolery in how the rating system works. You can read more about the finer details on other reviews here, but in short, if you do well early on, you'll do worse later. That's right: you can develop an amazing game with a damn near perfect design/tech ratio, release time, console match, playerbase match, ALL the matches, and get an average rating of 6.75 because you released a blockbuster game a while ago.Effectively the game punishes you for doing well. Pretty lame, right?There's also some more drawbacks. Things like the fact that there's no competition. Nil. You feel like you're the only person developing anything because you ARE. You're always the developer of those smash hit games like ""Dance/Casual"" for the ""Wuu"" (AKA Dance Dance Revolution). There's no such thing as a topic being overdone by anyone except you. This is a HUGE drawback for a game that is essentially a business tycoon. Hell, you can set up booths at video game conventions to build hype for your game, and the game tells you that you were the 75th most popular booth at the convention.Who the hell are those other 75 companies ahead of you? You have no idea because they don't exist! I wanted to play as the gamer's-dream, consumer-friendly company that eventually rises above its competitors because of how committed it is to its playerbase. But you can't do that because there's nothing to rise against except game reviewers that critique you based on a game you released 8 years ago.Another problem I have is the lack of choices. You'd think that, being a game development company, you'd be able to be creative in how you run your company. But really, you don't do much. You make games of a certain genre and topic (which you'd think is room for creativity, but it really isn't because you're essentially just forced to methodically go through and exhaust every genre/topic combo you have). You give the game a name. That's about it. Sometimes you have choices, like some fans want you to release an old engine you made. You can choose to release it, sell it, or not release it at all. The problem is, there's virtually no drawback to NOT releasing it. You lose a bit of money by releasing it but the amount is so small that its virtually insignificant. The only reason you would choose not to release it is if you want to roleplay the ""evil moneygrubbing company"". Which while fun, is still roleplaying, rather than just playing the game.So overall I found the game okay. It's worth about $5.00 in my opinion. I think the developers of this game did an alright job, especially for a first release, and what is clearly a passion project. But they left out some key components of what makes a good business/management tycoon and that's what put this review in the negative section.			"

												A game about making games, and if you wanted you could make a game about making games in this game about making games. You might even call that game 'Xzibit's Exhibit'. Maybe.You start as a lone game developer in your garage during the 80s, you work away making basic games and hoping they'll be successful. For legal reasons real life consoles and PCs names aren't used (however this is easily changed with mods), but the game does a good job of hinting at which 'console era' you're working in.It even has loose story elements as it recreates historic console releases and events, so if you know your gaming history you might be able to plan around these accordingly. As you progress through the game, and with each game you make you gain experience, which you can use to learn new aspects for your games as you create the 'perfect game engine' for your crazy creations. You might want to have a one-use-for-all Engine, or you might even create Genre Specific engines. However, you'll soon realise that time and resource management will become an issue the bigger you aim with your gaming projects.You can choose a Topic and the sub genres within it - Sports RPG? Zombie Simulator? Then within that design process you choose where to allocate time and effort - gameplay? Sound? Level Design? What's more important to you?

I do wish it went a little deeper, but what it does offer was good enough to spend 6+ hours in the '35 Year' Storyline playthough. In short it's a fun game, and the fun comes from your imagination and sharing your creation with friends. What will your biggest game be?			"

												Developing your company from a garage developer to a well known indie developer is really fun, and enough for me to recommend this game, however:1. The replayability is not great, each game is pretty similar2. The modding community is a bit scarce3. The system for rating games is bad. Because you compete against youself, if you make a really good game, all your games after that will get bad ratings unless they are better than your really good game. This is the worst thing about the game because it discourages you from making good games and encourages you to make games that are just a little bit better than your last, whcih isn't fun.If the devs make a sequel and take the community's advice on board it could be a masterpiece because this is a great concept.7/10			"

Or will be it be utter garbage?

												Short Version-Good Game, slow paced but fun. If you like Tycoon games you will probably like this.Long Version-15 hours in and it still has my attention. For a non-action game that is something impressive. For me this game is perfect during long lectures on my school laptop. kept in windowed mode you can switch to another window easily and it pauses on its own when you do this. The sound is somewaht unnecissary for this game so it is fine to play muted. Small download with minor system requirements means that this game can be installed and run on just about any computer. The gameplay itself is engaging, with multiple genres and topics and consoles to work with there is allways new combinations to experiment with. the achievements are a mix of introductory awards, easter eggs that are rather witty and some downright challenging achievements associated with game sales. Although the game is rather inexpensive i personally waited until it was on sale to purchase, and i would probably suggest doing the same if you are on the fence about this sort of game. In all honesty i was not expecting to get as much enjoyment out of this game as i have and i can understand the hesitation about buying a game set in a seies of rooms with your avatar sitting at a desk pushing buttons while small decissions are made about what game to make. While action fans are going to be turned off by that the fans of tycoon games might be dissapointed by the lack of visual stimulation that could be gained in games like zoo and roller coaster tycoon. In the end this game serves an niche audiance but i suggest that anyone on the fence gives this a chance because it is more ingaging and fuffiling than words or the trailer can describe.8/10			"

												I think almost every gamer once dreamed of developing games. With Game Dev Tycoon, everyone can imagine yourself with your own company, creating your own games, engines and technologies. GDT is a casual and light-hearted game about making games for people who love games! It's a great time killer with a lot of options to keep you occupied for a while and Steam Workshop support with nice mods from the community. GDT isn't great as Theme Hospital, for instance, but it's worth your time. You can have fun and discover some things about the gaming industry.			"

												I admit it, I have 30+ hours of playing this game on record. Is it addictive? Maybe. Is it good? Not exactly.Game Dev Tycoon is one of less than a half-dozen in this very specific genre. That is its success. It's failure is that, in a world full of very solid sim games, it lacks balance and depth, delivering only moderately clever puns and a menial supply of easter eggs to keep you coming back. If there were a better Game Development simulator out there, I'd be playing that one, but there isn't. Game Dev Tycoon as a title represents what I want in a game, but not what exists.Final score...4/10 Not good, not bad... simulation games are great for pc... ;-)			"

												Yes, it's repetitive after a while. Yes, it's not an AAA title (although you can make them ingame). And yes, the scope is not huge.But it's made with love and for 15-20 hours you can absolutely play the game without it getting boring at all. The game mechanics are simple, yet not everything is clear from the beginning (sometimes that's good, sometimes not so much). It's not always that clear how a good game is made, I often have it that a ""test title"" is a huge success, while other titles I planned to become good flop.I once invested 70 Million in an AAA MMO, it totally flopped. Guess I should have tested the combination Space/RPG before. :PThe game controls are intuitive and are learned instantly. I did not notice any apparent bugs.			"

												Awesome game. You begin as a single dev. in your garage, and end up being one of the biggest team ever. But on your way, you will encounter conflicts with other bigger teams and companies, suffer from financial issues, you may have to ask your bank for more money.Will you release buggy games to make as much $$$ as possible? Or will you be the kind of person that tries to make nice little gems, and gain love from your fans?It's all up to you, but be careful, as your ambitions may be your worst enemies...			"

												Game Dev Tycoon, or GDT, is a video game about developing games. Game Dev Tycoon was developed by Greenheart Games and released in 2012. GDT is a very simple yet beautiful game. The game is user-friendly and it reinforces this by a clean UI that packs many features in a simplistic tone. For example, the menu button would have a research tab, a developing games tab, among others. These features would be packed in a list of sorts where a click to each individual tab brings up another small window. It allows for the player to quickly understand the various features without feeling there is too much.Creating a game is very nice and rewarding. The development of games is easy in that you have a few sliders and you produce a game to how you feel it would be best. For example, making a music game? Choose the music genre and move the various sliders to how you feel is best in getting a 10/10 on a game. The idea behind the sliders is that the more importance you have on a particular slider, ie. gameplay the more your employees and yourself focus on that aspect. However, the bigger picture in determining whether your game will be great is the list at the top of the menu that are bubbles. These bubbles mean four different things. One is bugs, the amount of bugs in the game you are making. Another is technology, how much your employees incorporate into the technology side of things in developing your game. Another is design, how much your employees incorporate into the design of the game like story, and research. Research allows the player to research more features to place into a game and to unlock new things throughout the game. But to summarise these four bubbles, they affect your game. You want the least amount of bugs and the most amount of design and technology points to ensure a better chance of getting a higher rated game. The best way to produce more is to train your employees. If you have not noticed it is a cycle that is easy to understand once you get into the game. So the gameplay is simple. In a short summary, you make games. You imprve your skills making games. You hire employees to help on games and you train them to accumulate more design and technology points, which garners you higher ratings for games. The game is pretty limited. The features list is basic and has less depth than the newly-released Mad Games Tycoon. The You will get a good thirty years in game, which is a few hours, but there is essentially no late game. Just a full-on sandbox experience that has replayability, but not a ton. To use myself as a benchmark, I played about 40+ hours of GDT when it was released then purchased on Steam and stopped at eight hours. So for the price of $9.99, you will get value out of the game.Overall, the game is a really good game. The clean UI and simplicity of the game allows the user to enjoy playing the game instead of attempting to understand the game for several hours. The gameplay is a cycle and everything is rewarded from continously developing games to hiring employees and even making your own console. The gameplay is basic, which makes it fun and easy. At $9.99, I recommend the game. 8.5/10----Thanks for reading my review!

												I would have loved this game if the machanics were sensible, but they aren't. In Game Dev Tycoon you are a game developer starting out in your garage, who gradually builds thier studio until they are a AAA gaming juggernaut. You select games of different genres (action, adventure, RPG, ect), differnent topics (Sci-fi, fantasy, history ect) and then you empaphasize different elements of your game (graphics, gamplay, dialogue, ect).  Every game you make is given a review on a scale of 1 to 10. Depending on your choices your game can be a massive hit or a total failure. The object is to make good games by combining the right combination of genres, with good emphasis, and good timing. Right? Unfortuantely, no. The math is a bit complicated, but essentially the game is always comparing your to your highest score recieved for a previous game review. The game review score you get is based on a hidden score, and then compared to your highest previous hidden score. This make it possible to produce a very high quality game, get a great score, and then to produce a game that is very nearly as good for every game you make after and get poor score. The optimal way to play is NOT to maximize your score every time, but to start low, that is to intentionaly produce a bad or mediocre game, so you can easily and gradually impove on your scores as you go. If you figure the system of bonuses out early and nail a couple of games it actually hurts you in the long run, making for a very confusing and counter intuitive experience. You can end up in scenarios where you intentionally sabatoge your game by releasing it with more bugs or by skewing your ratio, so that you don't accidentially create something much better than anything you have previously done. This turns the game into a confusing and tedious set of spreadsheet functions, instead of what it really ought to be; a game simulator that rewrads you for making good games.  I really enjoyed Game Dev Tycoon in every other respect. Its clever, and well put together, and icrediably addicting. Unfortunately the underlying math of the game forces you to think along lines that are counter to what makes Game Dev fun in the first place. For that reason, instead of being an amazing buy, it is instead a bitter disapointment.			"

												This game is suspiciously close to being a complete rip-off of Game Dev Story, the famous iOS title of the same genre. It expands on Game Dev Story overall, but not by very much, and not particularly well. The visuals are prettier, sure, but only if you look past the terrible interface. Oh, and as for the game development part - the in-game review system is so insane that you'd have to randomly lace cereal boxes with narcotics to get the same type effect in the real world. I agree that Game Dev Story wasn't really realistic in that department, either, but at least it had some logic to it - you were always getting better, so your games, naturally, were always getting better. I suppose I should applaud this Tycoon game for at least attempting to be more realistic, audience-wise, but it takes it to the point where you can't really understand how to reproduce good results. Seeing as I generally try to be successful at the games that I play, I found myself reading a multi-page printout from the web just to know how to configure the sliders correctly for a (hopefully) positive outcome. Multiple pages of tables with numbers, combinations, probabilities, all that nonsense, and yet, I can't say it made much of a difference. And at the end of the day, I have to believe that life can be better than that. Over time, just like Game Dev Story, Tycoon remembers good combinations and makes it easier for you to produce good results... but even so, why is it so complicated to produce even semi-consistent results? Perhaps there's just something in the cereal.			"

												REVIEW FOR GAME DEV TYCOON:Game Dev Tycoon is a game I really wanted when I played it as a kid. So very recently, I've got myself my first Steam Acount and played only Level 1 of this game. So was the game good as I remembered it when I played the DEMO or a waste of time?Sounds:So the music sounds okay. I can hum a few tones from the game.  6/10Gameplay:So this is a business tycoon game. A really popular concept. Now I've heard that there is another Game Dev Game, but I think that this game is better. Plus I'd never played the other one people talk about. You are going around making games and getting fans and money. And if you make a hit game, you may get an office. Now I haven't played the office yet, but holy crap is this game fun. It also makes you think sometimes. If I had a few flaws, when you start the game you may get a white screen unless you clear the cache or something. Also it is pretty hard to come up with some ideas but that is a realsitc concept so maybe I am bashing it for what it is. The games really fun and I think you should play it! 8/10Story:The Story is just epic. While I don't think younger gamers would really understand it (unless they look in the history books), it well be faithful to some gamers. Due to copyright issues they changed the company's names but you can get an easter egg if you type one of the Offical Names. I hope it gets better! 9/10Graphics:They look pretty darn good. They look very smooth and maybe a little generic but I don't have a lot of complaints. 7/10Replay?:This game is something that you may play a few times after 43 years in the game. It could be very fun to create a ton of games. And maybe you would like story. Just to be fair I will give Replay: 7/10Is this game Good?:Yes it is! It is a game that I think every video gamer should play unless they hate tycoon business games. It is fun and faithful to gaming. I'll give this game 8/10 A must buy! "

The Inception of GamesBasically this is a game where you build games. This game can be played for hours on end as you start off with basically nothing and work your way up to be a big game development company. There are many great things about this game, one of these is that it has a huge amount of replay value as there are so many possible game combinations to choose from. This game is very easy to understand and to get into and lots of fun which is why its definitely worth trying!			"

												In one word Game Dev Tycoon can be reported as ""Acceptable"".Surely, this isn't a ""brilliant-you-shouldn't-miss"". It's a short game, and doesn't have grip of ""one-more-turn..."" strategies.But it's ok, since the topic is so rare and game process is enjoyable and polished up to flawless. Well worth for appox. 10-12 hours of your interest, and possibly can keep on for thousand(s) hours ""to catch them all"". No need to, really, it's better when you left something on plate.So, should you buy it?It's good pick for good game collection, good ""office tycoon"" experience, and, most of all, good example of what some decent programmer can make on his own today. Really, I remember some ""evolution-yourself-making-your-thing""-themed games with just texts and tables. Now, there are nice video, audio and all other supplemental things, like cloud-saving.Not recommended for ""only AAA gamers"" and complete casuals, 'cause it's a tribute to games development history, and those people most probably don't care for this.But... you're a hardcore, right?I mark it as 7,5/10, ""a good little tycoon"".

												I enjoyed playing this game more than 20 hours yet as the game says, it falls a bit short. After realizing that your past success has a negative effect on your later titles, I lost all my pleasure to play it. I enjoy investing a lot for a game and from that point I would like to be infront of the era in the game. I want to feel like I'm doing rocket science in the prehistoric era but the game does never allows it because I have to beat my own success after that.It certainly has a tasteful concept but I like replayability, different starts and real AI competitors in my tycoon. I would recommend this game to other game devs but not to strategy lovers.			"

Game Dev Tycoon is a casual business sim game. From the post-console crash of the 80s to modern gaming scene, you run an indie game studio from your garage, aiming to become a world-renowned developer team.Pros: You progress through different location, from your garage, to small office, to upgraded small office, to a larger office allowing expansions. Plenty of freedom in game type, select one (or later two) genre, a theme (from a huge amount), a target audience, a game engine (which you develop as you research new technologies and assemble new engines) and a platform (allowing multi-platform later in the game). You can hire additional staff members (while keeping a balance of design and technology), train them, and specialize them if the various fields you focus on through the various development stages. As you progress through the years, the game parodies events from actual gaming history, a nice wink to “old school” gamers.Cons: The game is very, very simplified. There is no clear competition, no way to determine how much you concentrate on tech use (besides selecting whether or not you use them at all), no way to grow to a larger company (the likes of which, say EA did, from a small indie studio to one of the largest publishers). Topic/genre/target audience combinations are fixed no manner how good your game’s specs are (and I’m sure you can think of actual games that broke those conventions and were great successes). The difficulty grows with your success: hit a 10/10 game and make your life hell for the next few games until you develop better techs and train your team more, until you eventually peak and can’t continue without restarting a new game.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youThis is a fun and addictive game! Sure, there are games that dig in deeper into realism (such as GamersGoMakers), but if you just want a casual game you’ll play an hour or two (or more) at the time, give this one a try!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Game Dev Tycoon is a casual management sim around running your own game company.  The game has a simple but charming asthetic and follows the story of gaming from the early boom of the 80's to the modern day.  Making decisions on  the theme and design of your game and managing your staff are early challenges.  Later you will train staff, market your games and even develop your own console.The main drawback of the game is the weakness of the core development mechanics.  As you are required to use sliders to decide on the main areas to focus on for each game.  The preset combination that determines what reviewers deem ""a good game"" is often a mystery to you until you fail.  With a lack of detailed information of why your game failed its easy to become frustrated by this core mechanic.  This can be seen by the huge number of guides available on how to win the game, at this point you might as well be playing ""spreadsheet the game"". Overall, i'd say the games pro's outweigh its somewhat shallow mechanics.  If you can pick this one up on sale for under a fiver I'd give this one a somewhat half-hearted reccomendation.			"

												What an addicting Game!Starting in a garage, you build your own gaming company. You develope through 35 years of gaming industry, devolping (hopefully) the milestone games, everybody loves. With increasing success you gather more fans, move into bigger buildings, hire employees and devolp biger games. Creating the games at first seems simple, but nuances can decide between a hit and a flop. With more research, come more options, and with more options come more decisions. Balancing the focus of the games, training employees, researching new topics and gaming aspects simply leave you sitting hours infront of this gem.Plus, marvellous easter eggs, which can be obtained via hints, leave you hunting for achievements, to become the gaming mogul, you always dreamed of becoming.Pros+ Great Story (travelling through 35 years of gaming industry)+ Although at first seeming limited, the options creating a game are just endless+ Just the right difficulty. At the start it seems so easy, but going on, it gets so hard.+ Superb Easter Eggs (For Gamers only)+ Just pure Fun, if you enjoy Simulations/Strategy and a bit of RPGCons- Sometimes frustrating when you invest millions in creating a game, and everything seems rght, but it turns out to be average or a flop- You will loose all your spare time, because it is a so addicting game :D			"

												Nostalgia and a fun concept can't overcome serious misteps in the game's mechanics.  Ambiguity in the feedback will have you scratching your head as you attempt to connect decisions you make in the development cycle to the resulting game reviews and scores.  At times you will struggle to understand what tradeoffs, if any, are tied to your choices.  If, out of frustration, you turn to online information in your attempt to better understand how the game calculates failure and success, you'll only increase your disappointment, since, for some inexplicable reason, the developers decided that success in Game Dev Tycoon should not be based on making the best game possible each development cycle, but rather on creating games that are only marginally better than your previous one.  That's right.  A surefire way to undermine your ability to get good reviews on future games is to make your current one too much fun.Apparently, the developers of Game Dev Tycoon took that strategy to heart.  Their chosen core mechanic will keep a game with plenty of potential from ever being too much fun.			"

												This game contains the distinctive history of Computer Gaming like the Commodore 64 and how Nintendo broke up with Sony in 1993. With your own choice of making games with the integral engine components and research, you can also create your own games console near the end.The only disappointment I find is the ZX Spectrum, Amiga and the Atari not featured in there as they were a big hit, especially in the UK during the aftermath of the US Video Games Crash 1983. But you can get 3rd party mods to enhance your game here, but be warned as those mods could corrupt your saves.			"

												This is a very addictive game. You start alone in your garage in the 80's. Your long term goal is to grow bigger as a company and eventually become a huge game company. In order to achieve that, you'll have to sell hit games and hire people to work with you. You can research new topics for your games as well as developping your own engines to give your games the right assets. Your sells are heavely influenced by the reviews game magazines gives to your games which make it crucial for you to keep on with the newest technologies out there.Anyway, BUY IT! For this price you cannot have better ;)			"

												Game Dev Tycoon... Well, I don't usually like or even play this kind of games, but I clap my hands twice for this one!!! This is seriously one of the best and most addicting games I've played in a while! It simply gives you the opportunity to feel what it is like to make your own games. It is beautifully made and has a lot of cool features, like easter eggs...You can pretend to be any company in the world, or you could create yours, as well as the games you'll make! When you finish the game by reaching year 35 (or any other you've chosen), you don't have to quit the game, you can keep playing it 'til the game gets boring! And the more you play, the better your games will be! I'm enjoying my break/vacation from game development playing a dev game... That's kind of funny! haha9.5/10			"

  Game Dev Tycoon.Developer: Greenheart GamesPublisher: Greenheart GamesReleased: April 28, 2013   Summary:  Game Dev Tycoon is a business simulation game in which you replay the history of the gaming industry by starting your own video game development company in the 80s. Create best selling games. Research new technologies and invent new game types. Become the leader of the market and gain worldwide fans. Game Dev Tycoon is a great casual game, and for the price I really can't complain. It's an indie endeavor, and while it doesn't achieve great technological marks it is very entertaining and will keep you occupied for hours (unless you pirated it! Shame!) as you progress through the different levels of the game. The mechanics can be a little obscure at first, but once you master managing your staff and achieving balance it becomes much easier to produce hits and dig into the deeper end-game level content. I could play this game for hours and days. Hard to master as it has a unique mathematical algorithm to rate the games you make based on a number of different variety of mixing. ~GildaTheGriffin.

												This game was really amusing.  I love how you begin the game in your garage, car covered, and it's just you doing what you love.  Next thing you know as you progress you are given options to move to a newer space, make various moral decisions, hire a team and of course create better games.  Though the game is short lived... 35 years; you are able to continue afterwards.  I am looking forward to seeing maybe some more content as far as customizations and such.  I must say the comic relief was quite funny.  While streaming this game, viewers did ask if there was an ability to customize your office.  Answer is not really.  You will be given some options to add improvements such as air conditioning, moving to a new office, hiring new staff etc.  But the focus of the game is to make it big in the gaming industry.Some Screenies

												I love most of this game... But there is one thing: All of your scores are based on your previous scores! This means that you HAVE to constantly improve. Staying at the same level of ability means you will have a lower score. It means a constant 10 streak is almost impossible, and if you make 'the perfect game' you can never do it again.

												Game Dev Tycoon is a fun and cute game, and I really enjoyed my two playthroughs. I will recommend it to anyone that likes simulation management games.  The game is summed up well in the descriptions, so this review will more be my experience with the game and nitpicks.I haven't fully figured out why some of my games fail, even though they were a great combination, and others just explode on the market. Which lead to me doing significantly worse during my second playthrough. The bank lending me money at least once during almost every stage of the game, but it was actually a bit funnier and more challenging when I constantly fluctuated between hits and failures. The last phase was way to easy on my first playthrough, because I had no specialists in my team, so I didn't go into the labs. But even though spending money on discovering things in the lab and building consoles made it more challenging, it made it way more fun, and on my last years of my second playthrough I had the second generation of my console out and a hit MMORPG.The reviewers in the game can be jerks. On my first playthrough I made a lot of hit games, and there were constantly two of them that switched between giving me 9, so I got 9.75 instead of perfect ten. Felt like they were just trying to keep me from getting the achievement. :( And like I said, I got worse at the game the second time, so I'm probably never gonna get that achievement.There is a lot in the game, but it never gets too complex to manage. The game that comes closest to the same experience of playing for me is probably the sims series. Where you just keep playing and there is so much to do, and a lot of minor variables, but it is all easily presented and managable. However... It suffers from the same problem that the main Sims games have for, which is that there are no natural ""exit points"" no real quests, so it can be hard to stop before you reach the end and can lead to game burnout eventurally. (I know sims doesn't have an end, but this game kinda has one where you get your end score) You could argue every time you finish a game within the game it is an exit, but then you get the reviews, then it goes on the market, and while it is on the market or before it gets reviewed you put your team on the task of developing, reaching, or training something else. So there is no place where the game feels like it is a natural place to take a break I would love if they make a sequel or spinoff game where they include some kind of quests or in game objectives beyond the achievements.But it is still a topranking simulation game, and I am glad I bought it. 9.75/10			"

Special Events, Conventions, put an ad in a magazine.  Later your able to hire other people so it also becomes a management game, you'll have to send your employees on vacation when they get tired or they wont produce.  Also can train your employees.  Later in the game, you can make your own console, MMO's and even exspansions on those MMO's.  8/10			"

Posted: June 24, 2014
												Game Dev Tycoon is a game that can be challenging at first, but is extremely satisfying once you get farther. When I started out, I really hated how all my games that I thought would be really cool came out with crappy reviews and awful sales. I didn't like that to the point where I decided to use guides on the internet to try and improve my games. I don't regret doing it, because I really hated playing the game without it, and it helped a lot. One thing about this game is that it's really hard to get started. It takes a long time to get all the hints and then to know how to use them to the best, and I still haven't unlocked all of them after creating Game Reports after every game. I've still been continuing to use guides, and it's been improving the game for me.Another thing I don't like is how random the game reviewing system still feels. Sometimes I will follow the hints and guides exactly (and since I'm using the hints too, it's not just the guide being wrong) and the game will still come out with a 6-7 review.I think it can be challenging to determine what I should be using my research points on, and even more so as I'm getting farther in the game and I need to start having specialists in certain areas. I know this is something you have to learn on your own, but this is a situation similar to getting the topic-genre-gaming device right where it's not worth the effort to look into, and it's a nice thing to know in advance.The one thing in the game that has bothered me the most, however, is the lack of a reminder to name your game. My biggest issue for a really long time was forgetting to name my games, and I know you aren't reminded to do that because it affects the reviewing process, but I feel like if you got a little reminder to name a game it could go a long way. In my opinion, it doesn't even make sense to let a game called ""Game #38"" onto the market anyways, it doesn't sound like a game at all. The way I finally got myself to remember to name games is by being in a skype call with my friends and getting them to select from a bunch of options to develop my games, and then getting them to name it to make it more fun. Other than that, more than half my games have been unnamed.However, this game is still really fun. Where it does have it's downsides, there is still something that keeps me playing. One thing might simply be that I haven't completed the game yet, or that I want to get more achievements, but one of my favourite things is easily how satisfying it is to make a successful game. The income rate is amazing, I love seeing my money increase, and every time I see a ""10"" on the initial reviews I know I'm in for a treat.Overall, this game may not be worth a full $10, but if it's ever on sale at a price of less than $5 I easily recommend that you get it. It has some faults, but when you succeed it's easily worth the sadness of previous failures.			"

												Fun little management sim with some limitations. Although enjoyable for a while, there is not a lot of depth in the gameplay. You basically choose a combination of genres/topics/platforms for a game, researching and improving your skills along your journey to make more complex (and hopefully better rating) games. The better the ratings after release, the more money you get to grow your business. You will progress from your garage to corporate office and hire employees along the way. There are also a few other basic things you can do like training employees, research new tech, marketing & sign with publishers. Game Dev Tycoon uses some play-on-words to 'loosely' follow historical references to progress the game through release of new consoles and hardware to modern day.Gaming combinations that might be popular in real life don't necessarily correspond to a good game in Game Dev Tycoon and there are also some strange ones you can choose. Mastering the game really come down to memorising what combos works (through trial & error) which starts to detract from the experience after you have played a few games. What you have learned in previous games can be kept for future games to help out. I was really hoping there would be more strategic depth and more varied tactics you could use to change the game outcome and wanted to be able to go all the way to an EA or Valve type of game dev. Regrettably, you can only have 6 employees and is not designed to be open ended with a fixed end point finalising your game. A game on making games is a great concept. Fulfilling many gamers fantasies of developing their own unique games, but this needs more content, more detail, much more customisation & strategy to become something special. Game Dev Tycoon is still a decent bit of fun, despite it being simplistic and with limited replayability so gets the 'Thumbs Up' from me!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

I was young and dumb, and decided to make some sequels. That is when things went down hill, I mad a sequel to my multi-million dollar game ""Who sued my Cat?"" and it was a flop. I made a sequal to my hit ""Prison Simulator"" and lost millions. I made a sequel to ""Aliens ate my Cat"" and failed big time. And then I went bankrupt... But I decided to play again, and again, and again. I will never stop playing this game. I will one day be a trillionaire. Epic Games will succeed!			"

												How it goes whenever i start this game.  ""Jeez I guess I'll play for an hour but only an hour cause I'm tired.""  5 hours later ""gosh I'm passing out I guess I'll just go for one more hour""... 3 hours later ""someone shoot me please""What a deceptively fun game.  Its the most casual game I have ever played outside of solitaire or minesweeper.  But its so addicting.  Basically all you're doing is deciding what kind of game you're company will make next.  And by make i mean watch as little colored balls fly up the screen and add numbers and move sliders on where development goes.  Is you're next game a hit? Or will it flop?  Depends.  Gotta find good mix of genres and platforms.... I learned the hard way horror doesn't do well on the Gameboy.  But on the flipside I basically made Mario Kart on the Dreamcast and made millions.  Its these little things scattered throughout that makes this game work.  Be warned it will suck you in if you let it.  That need to make another game that doesn't get all 3s becomes an obsession.  People who value real lives need not apply.			"

												Really amazing Management game where you have to build up a Gaming Company, hire people to work at your company, market your game and alot of other stuff, i bought this game only because i saw Jacksepticeye play it and loved his let's play so i decided to buy it for myself and play it :D, and im really glad i saw that lets play of jack and decided to buy it myself because this is a really amazing indie game, if you like games and really like to get the nostalgia back of how it al began back in the day i would highly recommend you to buy this game because this game is really accurate and is mostly based of of real life stuff that happend in the Golden Gaming Age :D, the music, gameplay and ''storyline'' of the game are really amazing and well done/well composed :)!Overall i just really like this game and would really recommend this game to anyone who likes the gaming industry and just wants to get the nostalgia back of the good ol' days. I must say tho i only have one con with this game and that is that the ''storyline'' is in my opinion tooooooooooo short i would have loved to have a longer story in the game but yeah atleast they allow you to continue with ur company after the main storyline is done which is a cool feature!! Also the workshop has lots of cool mods for the game too if ur interested in mods :)!!9.3/10 #PCMasterRace			"

It is easy to pick up and easy to play for hours on end while losing track of time. Immersive enough to be replayable as well. I really don't have many critisisms of this game except maybe that it can get redundant after some time but that is why they added modding!			"

												I had orginally bought Game Dev Tycoon of their website when it first came out, I only just got round to putting the steam code in.Let me first say, if you can create a dancing simulator called Slappin Dancin Bit**es you will have good fun.First let me say, Game Dev Tycoon has a solid idea behind it, the use of the sliders to decide what you want to spend your time on can often be annoying.The reviews sometimes seem to be alittle harsh, maybe though its because I make bad games.Currently, on steam I havent played that much of Game Dev Tycoon, but trust me, I have played many hours of it from when I had it installed off the website. Eventually it does become quite repatative but I feel you will probably go back and play it again like I will.7.5/10			"

												4/10This game is very shallow. You might not think so at first but as time goes on you begin to realize that the mechanics are extremely simple yet arbitrary in unnecessary ways. Accomplishments really seem to come all at the same time in each play through and failures are too common for unnecessary reasons. You will find yourself constantly building a company and then watching it come burning to the ground because you released what you thought would be a high ranking game. Game Dev Story on the mobile platforms is far superior to this copy-cat. I really wouldn’t recommend this game as it’s ultimately more frustrating than fun. "

												What is there to say that hasn't already been said? Of the ""Tycoon"" style simulation games, this one certainly isn't the best. However, if you have a deep love of video games, the gaming economy, and the business aspect of video games you'll find this game quite entertaining. Not to mention, those who love management to begin with. There is so much to micromanage in this game, I actually found it hard to find time for everything (although I'm not a huge fan of management games, so that may just be me.)Pros:- Lots of freedom- Great walkthrough of the ""history of gaming""- cute art- fun writing (for the few story aspects)- tons of researchable topics and technologies- great system allowing for combination of genress and game topics- diverse character modelsCons- music gets old, limited music options- reporters ask the the same questions over and over again- sometimes, critics' reviews feel very random- doesn't feel very competitive when you never get to see sales of rival companies			"

												Amazing game 10/10 perfect score. This game is the reason i started game development im not even going to lie when i got to the end game i felt like i wanted to create games and began learning basic code and design and since then ive done nothing but learn and i have this game to thank. Now for the game review i would say it is an addictive yet fun game to play as it pushes the player to try and get better scores with reviews and explains pretty well how games are developed and can even teach players of this generation to apreciate what developers can go through for a game to be published. I would also say for an older type of game that the pixel art looks nice and runs easily for any PC. I strongly recommend for users that are intrested in the games industry to play this as it could maybe give more insight to what happens behind the scenes.			"

												This game was fun for a few hours. It may have been luck, or maybe it was my long love of RPGs, but I hit one out of the park and moved out of the garage after a couple of games. After that the game went stagnant:* The history of gaming unfurls before you, in exactly the same way every time. It's cute to see the ""PlaySystem"" launch or to see the ""Gameling"" dominate mobile gaming for a long time, but putting a real-world analogue into the game is inviting meta analysis. I'd rather see random platforms and performance for an alternate universe feel.* Once you get into the groove, the game becomes exactly as much fun as Microsoft Excel.* The game tries to punish you for making the same game over and over, yet doesn't seem to encourage experimentation and risk-taking. I'm sure it's to do with my own playstyle and missteps, but my company was always one game away from bankruptcy, which made it tough to try that mBox Lawyer RPG instead of another iteration of Vampire RPG for the PC.

												This is a great game if you're craving for the feeling of running a game dev company but don't have the time nor skills to do it.This game takes you through the 30 or so years of video game history, and you participate in everyone of these phrases.I keep coming back to this game to statisfy the itch I get from this, and if you have an interest like I do, you'll probably do the same.PROS:- Great mods- The slider formula allows you for fast and easy gameplay.- The advancement of technology branches out the possibilities later in your journey.- Clever references- Great mods [2].CONS:- This is just me, but after awhile, you start to realize the lack of content and lack of immersion in some phases. There are some times where you want more small features that can really help with the immersion. Unfortunately, it's not there, and  even the mods can't help much with it.- It can get repetitive after awhile, which is why I left it until the itch started coming back.Even with these cons, it's still a very good game. Great job, Greenheart.			"

But after the first 30ish minutes I began to find myself bored. This isn't a game that I will sit down an play when I have so many other games that can keep me entertained.

You are for sure ready to release that hit game.Then when you are ready to publish your game, Bill ♥♥♥♥tard Bradly decides to throw in a bug at the last second, the market changes so the game you were making is no longer in demand, and the system you had been developing the game for takes a hit in userbase.What was for sure going to be the best possible game in the world, now turns into a mediocre, no one gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥game that causes you to lose profits out of your♥♥♥♥♥The bank then decides to be friendly since you are, having a hard time, and gives you $1.5 million cash to help you get back on your feet, but expects you to pay them well over $3 million within a year. And if you refuse you go backrupt.After laying off Bill and sending him to a slave ring for being an incompetent moron, you'll then hire a stunning blonde programmer named Amanda who drinks more coffee in 10 minutes than you should physically be able to consume in a month.You'll then develope a sequel to your greatest hit game ever, to save yourself and to be able to pay that mafia bank back, but then the reviewers will curse you for making a game to similar and you will go under.

												I was originally given this game as a gift by a good friend of mine.Usually, I don't tend to delve into Steam at all, I have been pro-console all of my life, until I played this game. After being a fan of simulation games on consoles (with the occasional PC port here and there) such as Football Manager, The Sims, Rollercoaster Tycoon to name but a few, I was skeptical going into playing this game, but boy was I wrong. The game starts you out in a lowly garage with a start-up cost of 70K. Now to some, that is a lot of money to start of with in any game, (well, from your Garage at least) but taking into consideration the fact that it takes 8K a month to run the costs of everything, we can say it is justifiable. You also have the start-up option of running your games from a G64 (a hat-tip to the Commodore 64, which was obviously name changed due to copyright reasons) or the PC. There are also five game topics you are given to start-up with such as, Fantasy, Dungeon, Sports, Surgery and Military, but these can vary when starting up a new game, you could even get topics like Alien or UFO! It all depends on what the computer decides it wants you to have at the beginning. You are able to unlock further topics by 'researching' them with the points you have accumulated for creating games, these points can also be spent on other things such as, improving the games engine, sound (or later on in the game) quests, among others. You are also given the option of choosing which marketable area you would like your game to go to once you have unlocked the 'Marketing' option once you have released enough titles to warrant these, or enough time has elapsed, there are split into three categories E (Everyone), M (Mature) or Y (Young), I only ever used the 'Everyone' option, but that worked well on every topic I did indeed choose. As time progresses, you and the consoles around you do too, shortly into the game, the 'Ninvendo TES' (a homage to the Nintendo NES) comes onto the market, (which in some respects is a good thing as the consoles evolve, just like they did in real life) the G64 comes off of the market and later on you are introduced to other consoles, such as the in-game SNES, Master System, Playstation and eventually, the PS5 (the in-game names now allude me, I apologise). Once you have reached the 1Million currency mark with creating games, you are offered to move into a bigger office, with much more space (I would personally advise this to be taken when you have about 10-20M in the bank, as you'll more than likely go bankrupt if you take this option too early on in the game). You accumulate the money by releasing good, titles (ratings with 7/8s are what I was getting until I released a Racing Simulator game which gave me 9s) which are rated by four gaming magazines. Now, if you're going for the achievements of 'Perfect Score' you are more than likely going to get it during the larger rooms, not necessarily in the Garage, I haven't personally seen it happen as of typing this.Now, you should have enough money to advance to the next room, where you can employ people, a maximum of four is allowed in this room and this is where the fun starts to really kick in. You have the option of training them once you have employed them, if this doesn't happen, you will be stuck producing the same scored games for a while, also, switch up the genres once in a while too, its amazing how much a well researched game topic can jump from 4s to about 8s from the last time a game was made and a word to the wise, DO NOT make two game genres the same one after another, your fans will not like that and would probably end up losing some as well as money. I could go further into the last room, but that is something that you need to find out for yourself to play, create your own consoles, release an AAA title and have up to 6 staff members, that is all I am going to let you in on there!All in all, I would recommend this game to anybody and everybody and I am ashamed I never bought this myself and waited until I mentioned it to a friend to buy it for me as a gift, otherwise I would have bought it day one. 11/10. Loved every minute of it and the achievements leave you wanting more.			"

												First off, the idea is really cool! The implementing is good also. You start as developer in a garage. As soon as you have enough money you can move house and build your company. To get money you have to develop good games but that's hard!Additionally, the developers made the game with much love. You start in the 80s and get to know the whole history of gaming consoles. Just the names of the companies and consoles are changed but that's no problem.The game is well conceived. I don't miss any things in the game.Summarized, the game is awesome. It's realistic, quiet hard, makes fun and a bit addicted.Buy it! :)			"

												It is easy to learn how to play Game Dev Tycoon; figuring out how to maximise profits is a bit more difficult. You have to mix and match different genres to find what sells best. After you figure out what genres work well, you have to target an audience for your game. Then you have to decide what your going to work on more: gameplay or story? Dialogue or level design? Graphics or world design? In the end, all of your choices will be what makes or breaks your game.Game Dev Tycoon is definitely in my top ten favorite games. I have played many playthroughs and enjoyed each one. It is also relaxing to watch all of the design and tech bubbles float to the top of the screen. I would recommend Game Dev Tycoon to any of my friends.			"

												Awesome game to sit down and play for a few hours. I bought it and played about 11 hours and figured I was done with it after getting to the end. Recently I played it again and wound up putting in another 14 hours, and will probably do something similar again in the future. This game is incredible and the devs deserve a 10/10 for this relatively simple but very enjoayable and addictive masterpiece.			"

												Gave Dev Tycoon lets you start your own company as a game developer. At first you start small in your garage, but as you make more and more successful games you can change offices, hire staff, and upgrade your skills through training. While it is a simple concept, game dev tycoon is promising, in the sense that it keeps adding variety to your game making process and letting you make more complex choices as you progress through the game. The graphics and music are quite simple and not really an asset to be discussed for this game. Its gameplay largely consists of you adjusting sliders so as to decide which concepts you are going to give emphasis on while creating each game, such as sound, graphics etc. You also witness the emergence and disappearance of several types of consoles and decide where to release each game, while also keeping in mind the market trends. The most prominent problem with this game, would be that you get to decide based on trial and error more often than not, and the feedback you get about the choices you made is not entirely helpful for you to choose better next time around. The existance of a wiki for this game has made it so that tons of people end up following just that, since it is way less frustrating to progress in this way. Overall, I wouldnt call game dev tycoon a bad game, but a game that could use some polishing to shine.+ great genre/topic/platform variety+ easy to grasp, hard to master- game choice feedback is vague			"

												In all honesty there have been few 'Tycoon' games I like.  I bought this title because, I want to be a game developer.   The Premise of Game Dev Tycoon is, rather... well you are a game developer, and you play through the ages and generations of video games, starting from the NES era of gaming and work your way through today.The game progresses from you working alone in a garage, to a small team in a smaller office, to a massive corprate headquaters where you can pump out tripple A titles.So the question is thus, what about the game development part.  Well basicly there are three parts to game development, and three sliders per part.  Pending on Genre and type of game pends on how the sliders need to be set, where you need to spend your time and resources into making a good game.  Then you watch bubbles (With one of the most addictive sound effects) float up into a compleation bar.  That's about it.So in all honesty theres not much to gameplay at all, its simple, it's straight foward, and I quite like it, personally after hashing out a few sequals it makes you think on what you are creating, and has given me some neat ideas for games just because I kept pumping out sucessful sequals in this game.So All in All, I recomend this game, it is a handy timewaster, it is fun in it's own way, a little addictive, and is easy on the CPU.  So by all means give it a whirl.Note to the Developer: I think a demo of the first garage era would go a long way for this game to get more people to play it.			"

												I put a great many hours into Kevin Toms' Software Star. I would invariably do extremely poorly, because using Hype was basically lying about how good your game was, wasn't it? That wouldn't be right. Tell the people the truth, they're only going to find out when someone hands them your game on a C90.But I digress. THIS game is the same basic idea (Sim Games Dev) with a really pleasant presentation. Hire and fire, develop game features and engines, churn out cash-in franchises as often as you dare and throw as much marketing money around as possible to push you over the top.It's essentially a toy for people who like games and gaming and the games industry and think about them a lot.

												The game is easy and fun to play, but at the same it lacks the depth and complexity, which is number one requirement in most simulation games. Sadly, the developers said that they are not interested in adding new features or creating a DLC. However, the recent addition of Workshop is awesome, you can get a lot of interesting mods from there.  I'll recommend the game to anyone who wants to spend some time just experimenting with combinations.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a simulation game where you become a video games developer.In Game Dev Tycoon, you start from your own garage in the 80s and then work around the become a major games developer company on the market. It's fun to play as you can create your own games in your imagination. You can create games on many platform. Decide yourself which aspect is more important for your game, the game engine, AIs, world design or graphics and sounds. Your decision is really affecting the review score for the game you create, the better the review, the more it will sell and the more fan you will get. The platforms and consoles that is available in this game has very funny name like the Playstation in this game is Playsystem. All console from the 80s to todays XBOX One and Playstation 4 are there in the game and you can create game for those consoles, or you can create your own consoles.This is yet the best tycoon game I ever play. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												Playing this game is like having a business. You fail the game when you get bankrupt, but you can become Bill Gates in the game if you succeed in managing the company.There are several reasons why you should buy this game. First, you get to experience being the manager. Managing is really hard imo, but this game can be a motivation for some because it requires skill and hardwork in order to succeed in the game. Second, it enhances one's creativity. You get to choose genre and categories to create the game you want. You can even name it. Third, You get to see the evolving technology of the consoles starting from G64 and such. Lastly, you get to have millions of fans lol.What I didn't like in the game is that the last of the achievements. I have 31/33 achievements and the rest are based on luck. It's quite frustrating but i'll get it for sure. Try this game first before you use a guide, you'll be needing it later on. Probably. 9 - Thumbs up.			"

												I was very excited to see this game come on sale recently, as I'd had my eye on it for some time. It is a very good game at first, despite a lack of polish here and there (inexplicable error message on first launch, the odd spelling/grammatical error in the dialog boxes, etc.). Therefore, I think it is worth getting on sale.However, it quickly gets old; mostly, I think, due to its cyclical mechanics and unrealistic time scale. As a simulator, these factors take away from the experience. For example, a game may take as little as several months to produce, bug-free, and is ""on the market"" for only a short time, even if it is a smash hit. The result is that you must constantly churn out game after game, whereas I naturally tend towards producing 3 or 4 titles that I can release the next installments for periodically -- not unlike real life. By the fourth year, having produced several hits and sitting at a cool 4.4 million, with a new office, an employee, and lots to research/train, I said to myself, ""Just 31 years to go...ugh"".So that's basically it for me. Something tells me that I stopped right when the game was about to get its second wind. I've no doubt that I'll pick it up from time to time to tinker with. It is well made and fun as far as it goes, just not something I can really sink my teeth into and feel satisfied. I'm flagging this review with a ""Not recommended"" just so that people can see an alternate perspective amongst the sea of absolutely glowing reviews. I'm interested to see what Greenheart Games will come up with next. :)			"

Although the game mainly relies on text over graphics it still manages to create an addictive formula with some really interesting choices to make along the way. The game is also quite difficult which is nice. Trying to build a company out of your garage is not easy, but once you manage to get big enough to move to an office it is extremely satisfying.

												[Full review of Game Dev Tycoon]Graphics:The graphics are very basic but they're clean and go well with this type of indie game. However, I feel like the game would've benefitted from more customization options for characters and the actual businesses. The graphics are so simplistic that more customization probably would've been pretty easy to pull off, making it seem a little lazy. - 7/10Audio:I like the music but I'm pretty sure that there's only 2 or 3 tracks playing on a loop so it can get pretty repetitive if you play for hours at a time. The music that is there fits the game well though, I just wish there was more of it. - 7/10Gameplay:The gameplay is really unique and can get pretty complex, providing a great challenge for both new and veteran players. However, it can be a bit difficult to tell what was bad about certain games because specifics are not always offered and the review system has always seemed a little off to me.I think that there are enough unique aspects to keep the game engaging though, and you're able to hire on new team members to attempt larger games in the later stages, which are the most fun imo. - 8/10Story:There really isn't one. It's a typical tycoon game where the story is just ""one day you decided to start making video games and become successful"" - nothing too deep. The cool thing is that you start making games in the very early stages of the gaming industry so you actually get to see all the “now-legendary” consoles released and make games for them! It can be pretty funny too since the developers had to come up with some pretty creative names in order to avoid copyright. A story isn’t really necessary in these types of games but it would’ve been nice to see your company presented with various choices or something. - 7/10Replayability:Like any tycoon game, you can play as many times as you want and it can also be pretty easy to fail so you might even have to start over a couple of times anyway. The beauty of a simple concept like this is that it never really gets old and I, personally, keep the game installed on my PC just in case I'm ever in the mood to play it, which is pretty often honestly. I’ve completed the game a couple of times now and it’s always fun to play, just don’t expect a totally new experience each time you play it. - 8/10Overall:Overall I was very impressed with this tycoon game, especially considering the fact that it was made by a 2 man team and was released for the extremely low price of $10. There’s a lot of fun strategy to be had here, but only if you like the tycoon genre, and only if you actually have an interest in the gaming industry. If you’re bored by either of those two things, this game has nothing to offer you. Also, there are mods for it now. - 7.4/10			"

Bought it because it was on sale and as a software developer myself, I wanted to see if I could live the dream in a virtual world :)The concept is really simple and it's repetitive BUT the repetitive actions occur fast and have consequences which you need to quickly adapt to in order to avoid going bankrupt, which keeps you on your toes.You start in your garage and you have to research concepts, teach yourself different skills to develop, decide which consoles (N64, Gameboy, Playstation, PC, etc) you are going to develop games on etc.It's really nice to just play in windowed mode and enjoy a few clicks every now and then. Definitely worth every penny based on the current Summer Sale price.The welcome message from the dev team was nice too :)			"

  You'll Enjoy This Game If You Like:   Time/Money/Resource Management   Running a business   Coding alone in your garage   Lots of options/choices that impact each other This is a very solid sim/management game that caters for two different types of players. The first is the casual gamer who just wants to kill a bit of time, develop some games, expand their business and just ""see how it goes"". But it also caters for those that love analysis and want to squeeze every bit of efficiency out of your approach.Genres, topics, systems and audience chosen for your game, along with other selections based on how long you spend developing certain aspects all play off each other to produce your score/profit. The casual gamer can get by, by responding to the feedback after a game hits the market and more analytical gamers can look into charts and tables that show what is the most effective way to produce a new game.It's lots of fun, is pleasing to the eye and you get to live out your dreams (or nightmares) of becoming an indie dev and possibly even making the big time.

												I have been playing video games since Asteroids, and I have alwas loved them.  Of course I have dreamed about making my own games at times.  So I just had to try this game.  I have played it a good bit, and I am not quite done playing it still.The game follows the historical progression of gaming technology in a parodied way.   Instead of Xbox's it is all Ybox's and stuff like that.  In one way I enjoyed that because it takes you down memory lane.  Ah yes the fabled Dreamcast.  However it also left me knowing what to expect.  I didn't bother buying licenses to produce on certain platforms because I already knew those platforms were not a big sucess in the real world.The trailer says ""create games your way.""  You can do that, but they'll flop.  This game seems to have a fairly narrow view of what kinds of games will be successesful.  Although it's entirely possible I just have not figured out how to break out of the mold.  It's ironic because the devolpers of this game are thinking out of the box somewhat with their game about thinking within the box of of what maybe EA games would tell their staff to make.  Just like the historical technology in the game, the definition of what can be a success also appears to be tied to gaming history.They have opened this up to the workshop, so that's really cool.  I haven't used it yet, but am excited to see where it takes the game.Even with my reservations I really do like the game.  It is a fun simulation and it is challenging.  I'll make my company grow for a while only to run afoul with a couple flops and then be strapped for cash.  It keeps me wanting to try again.I think it is a fair price and would be a good addition for anyone who likes simulations or is interested in the history of gaming.  Also worth mentioning is that the game has a good bit of educational value as well.  It teaches bits of finance and company management.  Good game!			"

												This game is pure crack! I had no idea such simple game mechanics (basicly using sliders) and micro managment could keep me so interested for such a long period of time.Game Dev Tycoon is solid proof 2 guys in a basement can make better games than some ""AAA"" titles out there.This game holds some very interesting gaming history (you progress through 35 years. once they're done you finish the game).Wonderful sense of personal growth - you start off as 1 guy in a basement and end up 7 people in a fancy office building.Game Dev Tycoon helps non game developers understand some basic game creation modules, such as game engine and what the hell are contracts, which I found very interesting and informative.Also, this game holds more depth and choice variety than first meets the eye, I'm impressed.Important notes: - The game ends after 35 years (eventhough you can keep playing the same run).- You get to keep your learned knowledge from previous runs in case you decide to start again - Two cons I can think of: 1. Slightly high price (considering the simple game mechanics). This feels more like a $5 title than a $10 title.However I bought it at nearly full price to support the developers and its well worth it.2. Repetetive music - If only they'd get more music variety instead of the same couple of 2 minute tracks on repeat. This is the only game in the world that guilt trips piracy! They get bonus points for that :)TL;DR - Great game, addictive as hell, BUY IT! 9/10.			"

												Holy crap is this game addictive. Grabbed it during the Holiday sale and do not regret my decision. This game is pretty darn accurate as far as the video game industry works. Sure, it's just a simple simulator but you have to make decisions based off what gamers will like in the game that you are developing which cannot be taken lightly. It takes awhile to get used to the fast-patced mechanics and hectic lifestyle of a developer. You must pay attention to every detail when making a game and make sure that what you are developing is top-notch or otherwise the game will flop. If you fail a few times and go bankrupt in the game, learn from your mistakes and try again. This game is super addictive if you think you know what it takes to develop a AAA title game and please the critics :)			"

The game is very similar to Game Dev Story for mobil devicesI reall loved Game Dev Story, but I felt like Game Dev Tycoon really expands on Dev Story like more consoles longer game time tycoon 30 Y story is only 20 Y. Dev Story in my opinion  has less replay value do to less time and since new consoles have come out Dev Tyccon has more replay and more Dev options and more features all making it better, I suggest Both however Tycoon is definitly the stronger of the two.Game Dev Tycoon 9/10Game Dev Story 7.5/1o			"

												This game was an attempt to make a better version of the Kairosofts Mobile game: ""Game Dev Story"". So far they have not yet succeeded! The mobile game is very simple and easy, but still fun. Game Dev Tycoon has failed in making a complex design feel simple. The system made to creating a game, is very complex and they hide this complexity, not helping the player enough to simplify it. Online there is a wiki concerning the game, that shows how oddly complex this system is...The difficulty of the game does not feel high. It feels RANDOM, even if it isnt! The game is playable and can be fun, but it feels like they have failed in their own goal of making a better game. I hope they make a second game with a much better ""making-games-system"".			"

												After having completed the game three times previously with minor obstables, I recently started playing Game Dev Tycoon with pleasent memories in mind. Those memories were brutally shattered after two playthroughs. At a certain point, about seven hours in to the game, reviews change instantaniously from 8.5 and more to 4.5 or less. On two different save files this happened, so I went online and read up on what games to create and great consoll, genre and audience combinations. Regardless the effort, getting back the sales and reviewes that had been given consistently since ""the garage"" was impossible. The twoes and threes kept coming. Fantasy/RPG, you name it. Bankruptcy on all attempts. So I jumped back on both save files and tried following game creation guides from a point where it all seemed to be going great. The reviews where flying all over the place, 9.75, 9.5, 9, everything was going great again, I could finally get that fuzzy feeling again when Game Dev Tycoon came to mind. But on both occations, with everything researched, the reviews turned sour at the same point as previously. So I do not recommend the game as it now appears. There is no logic in the difficulty patched by the developers of this game. If you crave for a great game dev game, Game Dev Story is much better.			"

												Pick the perfect combination of concept, genre, and platform (while managing marketing, budget, and personnel), and you could have the next gaming sensation on your hands.Game Dev Tycoon is a fun business sim with plenty of inside jokes for anyone who follows the gaming industry. Graphics and sound are quirky (in a good way), the interface in unintrusive and functions rather smoothly, and gameplay is entertaining. My major criticism would be a lack of replay value; after you've successfully completed a 35-year ""career,"" I'm not sure there's much reason to return for a second pass at the game.Nevertheless, that first trip through the game consumes a solid five or six hours of gameplay -- during which I never found myself bored.

No current DLC which would be nice	The game is short, you can complete it within a few hoursI 10/10 recommend this game to you all that likes a fun short Tycoon-Simulation Indie game.			"

												One of those games where you don't expect much and then it surprises you. Yes, the core gameplay mechanics may be around sliders and yes, at late stages when you have R&D/hardware lab researching something it may lag here and there even on high-end PC-s but put a little imagination in it and it will entertain you more than 90% of today's AAA-s.To re-create some of the most memorable titles is really priceless, there are easter eggs and some amazing feelings of satisfaction as you get successful. Also, I would recommend some mods for expanding the game even further. At the price, it's not spending. It's investing into some nostalgic gaming moments. Just plain and simple fun.86/100			"

												Game Dev Tycoon, as the title says, is a Game Development Tycoon. Its a fun game in which you can develop your own company, produce games and consoles and make millions.Pro:-Good mechanics.-Streamlined menus for easy selection.-Its fun making games and consoles.-Its great seeing that your game got a 11/10 and made millions.-Lots of research and development options.-Mod support was recently added.-Translations to other languages. Multiple translation projects are going on and some are already finished.Cons:-You sadly can't make any boxart for games but thats not that bad.-The game slows down dramatically when alot of things are going on. Its really irritating.-Not everything is clearly explained. You need to work it out yourself or read a guide.This is a really good tycoon game and I recommend it if you like tycoon games.I give it a 8/10.			"

												This was one of the best indie games I've played in a long time, if not ever. If you're a fan of simulation games/tycoon style games, this one will be right up your alley. The game starts basically at the dawn of early gaming starting at the Commodore 64 (renamed G64) and PC, working all the way down history to the Xbox One, PS4 and even simulating new ""future"" consoles. Your goal is simple: make quality games and lots of money to move out of your garage and eventually start your own game studio. Trying out new genre combinations for games is interesting and deciding where to allocate your resources for best effect (for example, you generally want to go with Fantasy for making an RPG game, Military for Action games etc). Eventually the process gets more and more involved as you have to assign team members to work on games and train their individual strengths deeper. Eventually you can create MMORPGs and ""research"" projects like a Steam-based platform, and even develop your own console so the game depth only increases as you go along.My only gripes with the game is sometimes critics will be all over the place in regards to their scores. When creating what you thought was an AAA title, they may only end up rating a 7-8, whereas a title you didn't put as much money into, might score 9-10s. Critic score generally dictates how much your game is expected to sell. Also, you move through the eras a bit too quickly, as I completed the game before I was even able to start researching some advanced technologies (like Steam). Though, you could chalk that up to it being my first playthrough.Overall, you're likely to get 6-7 hours out of it your first playthrough assuming you make it to the end without bankruptcy. There isn't a whole lot of replay value but if you're an avid gamer, it's definitely worth it on sale alone for the tongue-in-cheek gaming humor and entertaining gameplay!			"

												Pretty fantastic.  There aren't many games which keep me up til the next morning that day I get them, but this is on that list.It's especially amusing if you follow the games industry closely.  Funny, yet respectful, this is a stand-out 'one more turn'ish title.  I highly recommend you pick this up ASAP.(Mechanics stuff:  Develop your skills, research new engine technologies and techniques, choose what aspects of a game to focus on based on its genre, research new genres, recruit staff, allocate roles in games, choose licences for platforms, encourage pre-release hype, keep up with the console wars, rebuild your game engines, train to increase more skills, attend game exhibition/conferences, etc, etc, culminating in having your own R&D department to host your own conference or build your own game console.)

												Pick the perfect combination of concept, genre, and platform (while managing marketing, budget, and personnel), and you could have the next gaming sensation on your hands.Game Dev Tycoon is a fun business sim with plenty of inside jokes for anyone who follows the gaming industry. Graphics and sound are quirky (in a good way), the interface in unintrusive and functions rather smoothly, and gameplay is entertaining. My major criticism would be a lack of replay value; after you've successfully completed a 35-year ""career,"" I'm not sure there's much reason to return for a second pass at the game.Nevertheless, that first trip through the game consumes a solid five or six hours of gameplay -- during which I never found myself bored. Overall, Game Dev Tycoon is well worth the price of admission, especially if you can pick it up on sale.			"

												If you're a fan of tycoon games I would recommend picking this up.  It's obviously not like actually owning your own game company but it's pretty exciting to release a new triple A MMO title and get all 10s from the critics.  A few mods have been released that change the gameplay a bit so it has some replayability.  When you near the end and have everything unlocked it can start to lag but it's not too terrible.  Overall I would give this game a 7.5/10 and recommend it to anyone looking for a new tycoon game to sink a few hours into.			"

No current DLC which would be nice	The game is short, you can complete it within a few hoursI 10/10 recommend this game to you all that likes a fun short Tycoon-Simulation Indie game.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a fun, simplistic simulation of the interesting game industry and how making games called ""Booty Blasters 2: Return of Jaffar"" is perfectably acceptable for Young gamers. So is a Typing game with a steering wheel.Positives:-Charming, plain graphics that aren't too hard on the eyes.-Provoking, legitimate strategy when it comes to making a successful game. It isn't just about having correct focuses such as Gameplay or Artifical Intelligence, but also properly using your game's theme in conjunction with the Rating/game console, using specially trained employees to highlight game aspects, research, etc.-The game's difficulty and complexity growth isn't too sudden, most mechanics are pretty easy to understand when they're introduced.-Overall charm and dialogue of the game is fun, it's clear the developers were intentional with their easter-eggs and choices.-Mod support, though modest, is still available and can add to the experience like with many Steam games.Negatives-There are only a couple of soundtracks used, and though they're nice the first time around, it does get a bit tiresome as they loop often.-Replayability is a mixed bag; it's fun to try different strategies and game-styles you didn't try before, but if you know what you're doing, it can become an easy trip until the later years/consoles. Though going for certain achievements can help spice things up a fair bit.-This is a personal note, but I find that the only way to get some of the most interesting parts, such as making an online MMO or your very own console, is to play incredibly optimally or to have the year limit higher than default. More of a nitpick than anything.Overall, I really like Game Dev Tycoon! The price is near perfect for what the game gives you imo, and if you're a fan of tycoons or simple strategy games, this one should be right up your alley. Just make sure to get all the bugs out of your game and you'll be golden! "

												Yes, I know this is a improved copy of the iOS game, Game Dev Story, I had it and probably spent 100s of hours on a tiny screen. But I'm not reviewing that, I'm reviewing Game Dev Tycoon, by Greenheart studios, not by Kairosoft. Although it's not Game Dev Story, it still is one of the more fun games I have played. You play as a guy/girl who starts their own buisness in their garage, with only 70k (I think :P) and a computed (And maybe a car that's half covered). You must create multiple games until you move up a stage and make a buisness with workers and so on and so forth. Since this game was released, you can now generate a game report, which tells you what you did right, what you did wrong and what you could do to make it better. I know I only have spent a couple of hours, but the game is still amazing and although I've started multiple times, I've never been annoyed with starting over, because I want to see where I went wrong to go bankrupt and how I should change that.The Good: -Addictive gameplay -Fun combinations -Never-ending gameplay-Funny company names (Like, Ninvento or Vonny) The Bad:-Lack of genres - Reviewers suck sometimes Overall score:8/10			"

												Game Dev tycoon is one of the only games in recent times that has had mee hooked for hours straight, causing me to go without brishing my teeth or getting changed in favour of playing this gem of an indie title rather than catch the bus to the job that I don't have.This game is addictive as f**k. Starting from a guy in a shed in the early 1980s and watching the company of your own name (in my case, NotEACorp) growing into a company releasing games about ninja princesses and getting punched in the balls by critics is wholly satisfying, except for when a critic pans your game, which only makes you want to make a better game to impress him/her/it, thus contributing to the addiction.My only complaint about this game is that, for a game made up of a load of 2D sprites, the randomly appearing framerate drops, while suprising, are more annoying than anything. I understand that indie games aren't the best optimised games on the market, but this is giving me horrifying nighmares about GTA 4 all over again.VERDICT: Go do everything you need to do in your life, gather a stash of food, then buy this game. You'll be glued to your PC until an inevitable powercut comes along to say Hi.10/10. It's not perfect. There's no such thing as a perfect game. But this is as close to perfect as games really come these days.			"

												So yeah this game kind of sucked me in. The basic premise is that you start up a software company in your garage in 1980. Back then that was very common, many of the big names started that way. You get a few specific genre's and topics to pick from and differnt graphic modes and such. Then you work on your game. As you go through the game you get new technology such as 3d graphics and branching story lines. As you level up and make money the game opens up more research topics for you to use and new office space. This game doesn't offer a huge amount of options as you play through, however what's here is done very well. I have played through 2 careers doing slightly different things and still find it fun. WIll this be a game you play a year from now? Maybe for the fond memories of it, but it's not really engaging enough to keep you playing it all the time. However, the creators did add a couple of nice messages in the game thanking you for the support and for purchasing their game which I thought was kinda nice,Price vs playability: 7/10Graphics: 7/10 (this is two people who developed the game)Enjoyment: 9/10 for the first couple of play throughsOverall: I am going to give this an 8/10 simply because I did enjoy the game as much as I did. And yeah, I will add more hours to my play time, at least for awhile anyway.			"

												An simple tycoon game where you own your own game development company. You start off in a garage and work your way up to an office and employees. It's obvious that the creators of this game has knowledge about the gaming industry, both when it comes to gaming history and game development. There is a steady storyline (although not the most intriguing) throughout the game, where you, your company and employees evolve aswell as the gaming industry. I have never come across a tycoon game with this theme before so I was glad to find that the tutorial was short and easy to understand. Also the tutorial is only mandatory upon your first game.When creating a game ""you"" have no knowledge about what subjects, theme and platform works together, but as you develop games, the game register the outcomes which helps you make better games. Personally I think this function isn't ultimate and would prefer a full register (for example a grid) where you clearly can see what works and what does not, instead of having to click everything and see if the game tells you it's a good combo.Overall this is a great game. Even though the story doesn't change, I keep playing! I would like to see the creators make a sequel or an upgraded version because despite my criticism, there isn't really anything wrong with the game, there's only a lot of room for improvement. Considering this is their first game, that's impressive! "

												This game is more of a history lesson through the years, rather than an actual game development simulator. Many of the combinations in the game are obvious, and the only real excitement you get is when you create a game that gets ""10"" reviews across the board from every ""reviewer"". These reviewers tend to be little ♥♥♥♥♥es, and before you ever create a perfect game, one of these little ♥♥♥♥♥es will give you a 9. You'll probably cry for a couple of hours like I did, but then you'll feel a little better and MAYBE replay it if you're feeling like you should be beat in the face a little more.I mean, the game has good replayability value when it comes to perfecting your algorythm and getting that perfect game, but it's tough to enjoy the game at face value when everything tends to not only be the same, but also ridiculously predictable, whether it be console releases, or which console will be on top in the ""war"" (SNES>genesis, RIP dreamcast gone too soon, and N64>PS1). There isn't a whole lot to discover in this game after you get three or so good combinations. It was too easy for me to continuously switch between sequels for my RPG ""ELDERLY WRITTEN PASSAGES"" and my shooter ""Shut up mom, I'm in the middle of a match"" and consistently get high ratings and drown in it (the cash, that is).Overall, it's a fun experience the first time, especially if you don't remember the early console wars, but after that, the fun dwindles down. I give this one three little ♥♥♥♥♥ reviewers, and one midget ♥♥♥♥♥ reviewer out of five			"

												I've been playing this game for only a day, and I already want to have its babies. It's the first game in two months that made me stay up late so I could keep playing it. The mechanics are simple and easy to understand, allowing you to get right to the important business of building and customizing your games. And when you finally get that first 10 rating, and that first million bucks, everything has been worth it. Greatly looking forward to sequels/updates/mods/finishing the game.-----This is five weeks and 40 hours of additional gameplay after that first paragraph. I still recommend this game, but with a lot less enthusiasm. The game gets very repetitive after a while, especially because financial success hinges on putting out one near-perfect game every few years or so, with everything else just being filler. I absolutely hope there's a bigger badder sequel in a year or two, one that addresses the following issues:Idiot Publishers: Your mid-game is overly dependent on using publishers so you can make larger games for more money and fans. But more often than not the publisher will either ask for a game you haven't researched, a format you don't have rights to, or a terrible topic/genre combo. I get that it's supposed to make you take chances and expand your options, but if I'm desperate and need a medium game fast, I'd like to actually be able to make one.Employee Stagnation: In order for their skills to improve, your employees must train. Making games gives them nothing; you MUST spend time and research points and capitol on boosting their skills. And you have to do this a lot, which means that you can't be constantly working on games - or researching new topics/engine elements.Chronic Indie Mindset: Even once you hit the late game and become an industry juggernaut, it's still just seven dudes cranking out a game. Yes, you can eventually develop a hardware lab and an R&D department, but they don't directly assist in game-making. I want to become a monster, with dozens - or even hundreds - of employees, making multiple games at once, training some people while others are dedicated to improving my engine and so on.Research Bottleneck: As mentioned above, you need research points to train employees as well as to research new topics and game engine elements. The only way to generate RP for most of the game is to make more games, a newer engine, or generate a game report. As such, you often end up falling behind in either training or engine (or god forbid, both) as you struggle to devote enough points to their multiple needs. I'd recommend being able to create an R&D lab much sooner, thus giving the player many more points to work with, rather than reducing point requirements.Hardware Focused: When I first started playing, I really loved how the game told the history of gaming consoles, as it's not something you hear about a lot when researching gaming history. But consoles are almost exclusively the only outside influence on your game-making. Nothing about software or legal battles or any of that. Just console development. And while interesting, it's such a small part of the story.Forced Conformity: One of this game's mechanics has you matching game topics to genres; the better the match, the better it sells. In other words, you can't make a unique game. For example, according to GDT, Prison/RPG is an okay combination. But what if I want to make a stellar Prison/RPG? Instead of just stating that such-and-such a combination is good or bad, it should be up to the player to make it good or bad. Also, the entire nation of Japan would like to say something about Romance/RPG not being a great combination; I have 60 hours of gameplay and that still messes me up.And yet despite all those flaws, it's still an enjoyable game. In my last playthrough I jokingly made a Vampire RPG called Count of Calypso and it got me out of the basement. The three sequels got me into the final game stage, paid for my R&D lab and new game engine, and became the game I was known for, respectively. I created the Fallout franchise with the help of Dave Johnson, head of Departure Science. Tom Schoffer is somehow a tech genius and became my first AI specialist. I made Half-Life, Half-Life 2, and won the game before I could releas Half-Life 3. There are so many good stories that come out of Game Dev Tycoon; I just wish it were less frustrating to create them.			"

												A fantastic single player game... Took many hours away from my life... Many times trying different combinations and getting timing of releases correct. A truly difficult game to master. Very satisfying when you release a perfect game. Towards the end game, you may choose what your developers specialise in; Sound, Graphics, Gameplay etc. This adds a new dimension in to the releases and resource management of your staff for your game.Read the guides for assistance on easy money making combos.

												This game is extremely fun.  You start out as a 1 man developer in the garage of your mother's house.  As you increase your ability as a developer you increase your stats of technology and design, which allows you to make better games.  As you make better games you make more money, which allows you to upgrade from your garage into offices.  Once you enter the realm of being a professional developer in offices you are able to hire employees and designate their responsibilities from design to technology to research.  All of it works together to allow you to keep upgrading your office, employees, and games.  This game has a way of keeping you hooked.  You get so focused on making sure your next game release is better then your last.  Before you know it, hours have passed and you have work in the morning.  I highly recommend this game.  The price makes this game a no-brainer purchase.			"

												An indie game made to be a developer.Well, it's actually alot of fun. Creating games , to input genre , graphics , create engines , have staff , give names to the games you make , and watch them get butchered or praised in the reviews is a great feeling !Join conventions to show off your game , make campaigns to promote your game. Also , since time advances quite fast , you start off in the late 80's where the first pc and consoles are existed like , nintendo , cartridges , floppy disks etc. Names of consoles have been changed in a fun alternative.It's just really fun !

												Without a doubt this has become one of my go to games when i feel like playing casually, it's simple and easy to understand and can be a little addicting. I often find myself playing it for several hours without realizing it, or sometimes for just half an hour, and that's what makes this game so good. It's just so easy to pick up and play,  and it can take a very long time to master or even simply complete the game. I often found my self ecstatic whenever i made a perfect 10/10 game, and  what makes it so special is the reward you get for creating a master piece, keeping you exited and happy. It just makes you want to keep on playing, keep on succeding, trying to hit that perfect mark again. In all honesty this is a well polished game that is incredibly fun to play, and i would recommend it to any one who is looking for something new or just something fun and rewarding. It is very fearly priced that deserves your attention, so try it out because i doubt you'll be disopointed.			"

												As an Indie game, this is not bad. I'm a fan of the original Tycoon games, so it's safe for me to say that this Indie game made it pretty far. If you think about it, it's not about the graphics or music - it's about the strategy and the satisfaction you get from that successful achievement of being, well, successful. This is one feeling we all have deep down inside and it can come from anywhere, real life scenarios, or video games. Rather you're fishing and finally got a hook, or moving to the next stage in this game it's the same feeling of accomplishment. The only thing the game lacks is maybe a higher time frame between console releases. It seems to be a little too fast-paced when you're actually sitting here playing it. This game could also use a meter on how fast you'd like time to pass rather it's real-time or 100x faster for example.Pros:-Addictive gameplay-Allows your creativity to fly-Good engine-Basic controls (Rather you're a gaming veteran or a newcomer, anyone can play with ease)Cons:-No control on the time flow -You'll mostly always feel rushed-Could use some more tweakingOverall, I'd give this a 8/10. I can tell this took some time to actually develop - as I said before it's not about the graphics or music that made this the game it is today, it's the gameplay. From what I can tell, it took awhile to actually make this game fully functional which needs to be credited. This could be a text-based game and I'd still enjoy it.Would I recommend it? Maybe, I wouldn't say $10 USD would be worth Game Dev Tycoon, however I'd say around the $4.99 or lower range (on sale) would be reasonable. Some have regrets about buying this game, you need to give it time or maybe start over. The point is, have fun.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is exactly what you expect: a videogame developer tycoon. You are supposedly warped back in time to 1985 to a reference-filled (hint: flux capacitor) garage, where you begin your endeavour into the gaming history books. Like any developer who travels in time to 1985, you are absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥at programming because the technology is so different.  You have a computer that's literally worse than a modern graphing calculator, yet you decide to make games. If you are successful, you can grow your garage into an actual company, with actual people, and actual results. You have to strategically market your games for specific audiences (you know, like ""T for Teen"" or ""E for Everyone"") and try to match genres to different gaming platforms to different audiences.For example, kids. In the real world, devices like the Nintendo DS (which reminds me, tell you later) or the great old Gameboy are very popular. Add a role-playing/ adventure game like the Legend of Zelda, and you're all set. Target marketing at young people, and kaboom: ez skins, ez life. Although ""skins"" probably means nothing to the world of the 1980s and 90s.So, now, about the NDS. The developers, in an effort to give you a good laugh, and avoid copyright infringement, have sort of parodied every console on the market. If I'm correct, the Nintendo GameCube's counterpart is the GameSphere. It's actually kinda freaking amazing.I'll give GDT a solid 8, maybe an 8.5 because of the extensive workshop mod support.TL;DR: Time travel to 1985, make games, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥es, get money. 8.5/10			"

												A forgettably bland spreadsheet simulator. While many games can be reduced to the math to some extent, the art of hiding this, or simply increasing the complexity to the point where optimization is no longer feasible due to multiple constraints and varying situations, is crucial.Game Dev Tycoon has nothing to do with making games. It is solely concerned with making the player drag around a set of sliders to find the optimal combinations, in the pursuit of ever larger numbers. The window-dressing of a game development studio is immaterial, as it impacts precisely nothing.This is not to say that it is a bad spreadsheet, in and of itself. The game is perfectly functional, and the puzzle of searching for ideal combinations might satisfy an evening, or more for the kind of person that enjoys the optimization challenge. However anyone who does not find such appealing would be well advised to find something else to do with their time.			"

												Not a fan of the genre, just a guy who was interested about the theme of the game. And, from the theme perspective, it's very flavorful. But when you figure out how to ""game"" the system, how to manipulate the numbers correctly, then it becomes a simple spreadsheet, that's nothing more than chosing the correct options every time. There isn't enough factors to challenge the player to think, to actually do the logical things that are true in normal game design. It's all way too set in stone, and it's way too easy to figure out the way to play the game, then it loses all the appeal for me.			"

The game is all about making your own company as succesful as possible, you start of with a couple of options and when you proceed in the game you unlock newer offices, topics, employees and much more. I think this game is definitely worth a buy.			"

												A great game developer studio game, a genre which suprisingly exists but is all the better for it. Game Dev Tycoon uses real life events like the Gameboy, PS1 etc. It has pretty much every main console that was released in the last 30 years including the Xbox One and PS4, it even has a go at future consoles. While the game does have many problems such as large unpredictability wheather your game will be reviewed well, which tells you how well your sales will be. While the game does take many elements from the iOS and Android game Game Dev Story it improves and modernises most aspects of it to a higher level. I'd give this game a 8/10Score: 8/10			"

												'Game Dev Tycoon' is certainly the best Tycoon game I've ever played. It's paced masterfully, starting off as exceedingly simple but then introducing you to the more complex areas rather than chucking you in the deep end like other titles in the eponymous genre. I've played for three hours(first playthrough) and have not had a dull moment. It's easy-to-grasp, extremely funny and almost scary as you wait for the reviews of 'Behind Enemy Lines 2: Behinder(Sequel to 'Behind Enemy Lines' and predecessor to 'Behind Enemy Lines 3: Behinderer(joke titles(another great thing in this game('Ninvento', 'GameSphere' and the 'G64')))). 'Greenheart Games' have done an excellent job with their first title, as I did mine and I look forward to some great entries from them in the future.			"

												One of the most entertaining games I've played in awhile. I'm not normally into indie games, but I enjoyed the idea and theme of this one. I took a chance and decided to purchase it and I wasn't disappointed.If you enjoy business management simulation type games, you would probably enjoy this. Start a game development company, hire staff, release games whilst attempting to create a hit. Upgrade your staff and location as you unlock new genre's and other unlockables.It's a lot of fun, I would recommend it. Worth the $9.99 price point, imho.			"

												This game is ridiculously addictive. Almost in a scary way... I dropped everything I was doing to play it for three days straight... only sleeping once within that time. I showed it to my friends and got them hooked, too.The game is simple to play but requires a lot of time management and foresight to play well. Knowledge of gaming industry and trends throughout history is helpful, so it's especially a kick to players who have been in the hobby since the 80's. But it's not necessary -- as you play, you can research your published games' success (or failure) to learn what was good or bad about it, and it will add hints to your options next time you create a game, so you don't have to memorize the best audience for the dozens and dozens of topics.There is a really great variety of topics to make games on, from staples like Fantasy, Zombies, and Military, to more obscure things like Hospital and Virtual Pets, to things I don't even understand why they are in there, like Vocabulary and Evolution.There's plenty of replay value, as when you clear the game (make it through 35 years without going bankrupt), you can continue playing infinitely and launch a bunch of consoles or try to get a game to sell 100 million copies, or you can start a new save file (you can have three at once!) and keep all your unlocked research hints from your last game (so you don't have to memorize what combinations are good together, and which games need which focus). And since there's tons of topics, genre combinations, and matchups between those things, you can keep discovering new hints as you play, too. Not to mention there's the hunt for easter eggs (hint: look at the decorations!) and just the ability to expiriment and do weird stuff and see what happens. Maybe you can see if you can last 35 years in your garage, or see how fast you can get to a full staff of employees. The game creates a 'score' based on everything you did before you get to the 'end' mark so you can see which playthrough was the most successful, too, on your personal high-score table.After a while, you stop really thinking about what you're making, though, and just react to the proper categories to file things under... you stop thinking about the actual game you're making and just see it as a number. As long as you push the sliders right and put the right combinations together, it will sell, and that becomes way more important than making the games you want to make. And all the games just boil down to a critic score and sales figure. You can try to role-play, but you will probably fail. Releasing a long-lasting MMO is literally impossible. Want to just release identical sports games every year and rake in the cash like EA? Can't do that. And good luck figuring out what combination sounds most like Super Mario or Sonic the Hedgehog (Fantasy Action?!) ... You start to see the limitations pretty quickly. But it doesn't stop being fun. It just becomes more about the numbers and less about games. I kinda don't even think of it being about games anymore. Perhaps this is an intended criticism of the industry? My guess is it's just an unfortunate byproduct of the game's nature, heh.Anyway, it's very easy to blow away tons of time on this game. You won't want to put it down. If you like recognizing patterns and watching numbers go up, up, up -- this game is definitely for you.My only real complaint is the lack of extra for-fun customization. You can name your games, engines, and character, but other than that, everything is the same every time you play. Same office with the same decorations, and the employees are random and all look similar (can't name or design them). Your character customization options are very limited, ESPECIALLY if you want to play a female character (your clothing options are like... beige shirt... beige long sleeve shirt... etc.) And since the games are nothing but numbers in a log of your completed games, naming them really isn't all that fun after you've done it enough. I started using real game names, but subtituting in the word ""mustache"" for a word. Or just naming it stuff like ""i'm hungry but don't want to get up"" for a flight simulator. Sim games, especially ones named ""Tycoon,"" tend to boast a lot of creativity and customization options... but there is next to none here. This game is all about the strategy and the numbers.			"

I bought this 6 hours ago and have 6 hours played. There isn't TOO much value end game or replay value I think out of 6 hours but it doesn't matter, its a rising indie and a cheap title. 10/5$ is too little to ask, and you will buy it! BUY IT. NOW.People who rate games with numbers are gay. With that being said, I give this a 9.75/10 it's sooo goooood. If there was more in depth game creation that would be even BETTER but it's still a 10$ indie game. This is a jewel. Pick it up and give it a chance. Also, prepare for the nostalgia trip.			"

Also I love how it follwed the drama between game companies and how this affected sales. Creating the the games was probably my 2nd favorite thing in the game. 1st was seeing how they did after i realeased them. I have completed the game and I see how they made it so its ""never-ending"" but it kinda goes downhill from there. I wish when you get employees, they implemented more things to do with them. Instead just make the game creation process go faster and pick who does what in making the game. Overall, I give this game a 8/10.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a fun little casual game well worth picking up while on sale. You start as a single person in your garage and work your way up to the CEO of an AAA game studio. Anyone who has played a variety of games over the years will enjoy coming up with their favorite game combos and thinking from the end of an indie game developer. I think the style of the artwork may convey a generic-ville type feeling but it's a proper game. There is no in-game purchasing micro-transaction garbage. The game has a definite goal and is not a mindless grinding simulator. I am a slow gamer but it took me about thirty hours before I was able to complete all the achievements in the game. I will likely put another ten hours in just to see how fast I can beat the game now that I have proper experience in it.I think some of the negative reviews that are on here are frustrated with replay value and min/maxing their games. I'd like to address that. This game is most fun when experienced at the beginning without a guide. If you go in with a guide you're just going to want to hit all the hard points right off the bat and you'll completely lose the fun the game, even if you succeed. Don't be afraid to try things and learn, as the game is very good with rewarding you regardless of success or failure. For example if you decide to try a game combination/configuration that does not work, the game permanently records a reminder in your history when you write your game report. Should you decide to restart your game, it will give you the option to retain that knowledge in the new game. Game Dev Tycoon is also good about not giving you too much to handle up front, easing you into the development process, while at the same time not giving you any choices that are completely useless. So feel free to experiment with new opportunities! When it is beneficial for you to use a publisher the option will appear (never too soon.) and even the random 'events' that occur give you a bonus even if you make the 'wrong choice'.When it comes to replay again I believe it relies on not getting a game guide right off the bat. You'll go bankrupt a few times learning but it's okay, like I mentioned your 'progress' is still pretty much saved. Once you get the swing of things you'll quickly level your studio up quickly to where you were previously. With a guide you'll just be frustrated you are not hitting 10/10 games every single time and just quit at the beginning.			"

												It's a trial-and-error-based strategy game, and once you start to figure out each of the five genres, the game is pretty easy. Even with multi-genre mixups it's pretty self-explanatory on how to allocate your time during development. Past this thin surface level of gameplay, there really isn't enough depth to keep you going.A lot of seemingly obvious features are missing from the development process, probably to keep the game simpler and more accessible, but I feel like a lot of replayability is lost in their absence. For every step in the development process of a game, I found myself wanting more concise control, but this is by no means a game of micro-management. You market your game by pressing ""market"" and have little to no input on HOW your game is marketed, for example. The success of your game winds up relying on when you release your game, and how you allocated your time. It's so bare-bones and minimal that the sense of achievement wears off quickly and you begin to feel like you're not working for your success. That being said, I still played for about 10-12 hours before it was effortles and mundane, so I think I still got my moneys worth. If you're looking for a simple game to relax to where you don't have to do much aside from click through menu's, it's a great choice, and that's really all I wanted.			"

												The most fun you'll have playing a game where the focus is to simply create games.. It's addicting and fun and for the first 5 hours of owning it, I couldn't stop. This being the case in the same week I received free copies of ACIV, Splinter Cell: Blacklist, Batman:Origins, and Battlefield 4. This game is a gem and definitely worth trying out!			"

												There are few games as rewarding as this. I got completely hooked watching my games sell breaking new company records, getting the reviews, launching my own console. Really quite impressive for a small team of indie developers. I bought this as soon as it came out and I just installed it again on steam. Hoping for some expansion or DLC or something like that.

												I reviewed this game quite a while ago after I played it through till the end when I first bought it a couple of years ago, I recommended it and praised it as a good game. After playing Game Dev Tycoon  through again for a while to get some of the last achievements (Finally managed 100%) I still think it's a good title, but I'm not entirely sure how much fun it actually is after a certain amount of time. Tycoon games are always hit and miss, this one is probably one of the best I have played, it is very adictive and simply fun to play, tons of combinations making for many possible results make acheiveing your goals somewhat of a challenge at times, unless you discover a formula that happens to work for you constantly. I'd say one of the best features about the game is how it takes you back to the 80's and runs through the timeline of real game development, showing how different consoles by different companies effected the market and sales of games in reality, a really nice trip down memory lane.There are a good amount of achievements to acquire if you like to push yourself the extra mile like me, some of which can be really difficult to acquire such as Unobtainium and the 11/10 achievements, this gives the game some replayability and is one of the reasons I re-installed and played it through again. The games technical aspects go much deeper than you'd expect just by looking at it which I'd say is a good thing and makes the game less predictable, you'll certainly understand that if you go achievement hunting. After a while however, the game stopped being fun and felt more like a grinding chore rather than actually playing a game. It's not a bad game by any means, I just feel it can lose it's charm after a while, as is normally the case with some forumlaic games.With all that being said, Game Dev Tycoon is still probably the best management / tycoon game I have played and definitely recommend buying it if you're into that sort of thing, or maybe even if you're looking to get into the genre I'd say it's a good spring-board for it. For it's low price, you will get a fair amount of gameplay out of it and for the most part it can be good fun.			"

												A great game developer studio game, a genre which suprisingly exists but is all the better for it. Game Dev Tycoon uses real life events like the Gameboy, PS1 etc. It has pretty much every main console that was released in the last 30 years including the Xbox One and PS4, it even has a go at future consoles. While the game does have many problems such as large unpredictability wheather your game will be reviewed well, which tells you how well your sales will be. While the game does take many elements from the iOS and Android game Game Dev Story it improves and modernises most aspects of it to a higher level. I'd give this game a 8/10Score: 8/10			"

												'Game Dev Tycoon' is certainly the best Tycoon game I've ever played. It's paced masterfully, starting off as exceedingly simple but then introducing you to the more complex areas rather than chucking you in the deep end like other titles in the eponymous genre. I've played for three hours(first playthrough) and have not had a dull moment. It's easy-to-grasp, extremely funny and almost scary as you wait for the reviews of 'Behind Enemy Lines 2: Behinder(Sequel to 'Behind Enemy Lines' and predecessor to 'Behind Enemy Lines 3: Behinderer(joke titles(another great thing in this game('Ninvento', 'GameSphere' and the 'G64')))). 'Greenheart Games' have done an excellent job with their first title, as I did mine and I look forward to some great entries from them in the future.			"

												Bought this game on a whim. Absolutely glad I did. One of the most fun games I've played in a while and I haven't played a ""tycoon"" or ""theme <park, hospital>"" game in at least 12 years. Surprisingly addictive with feelings of immense satisfaction when you create a game that skyrockets you to success.  There were several times where I thought my company was going to go under but suddenly found myself on the top of the charts with a random, often extremely goofy, idea.Ended up with a company worth over 1 billion dollars with such hits as ""Dragons Everywhere"" the fantasy RPG adventure. ""Flying or Whatever"" the ground breaking Aircraft - RPG/Simulator and ""Pew Pew UR DEAD"" and its sequel ""Pew Pew I'M DEAD"" which were basically both my ideas for CoD / MoH ripoffs. And who can forget the classic History - Sim/Strategy game ""George Washington Simulator."" Get this game.			"

												This is the first game of this type that I've played. If you are excited by the idea of owning your own game developing business, this game will hold intrinsic delight for you. That was the case with me, so natuarally I liked this game.Especially at first, it's fun creating the games. Basically, after you decide to make a video game, you allot portions of time to specific development aspects like graphics, sound, world design, etc. You do so by sliding a meter up or down depending on how much time you want to spend on that aspect of design. You must use wisdom, because certain game genres and topics will turn out better or worse depending on how much time you spend on a certain aspect of design. At first the gameplay was exciting for me. It's enjoyable to see the monetary effects of your good game design ;) . But for the most part, you as the player as repeating the same processes for designing each game.  It's not a thoughtless procedure (because you have to figure out what to spend time on in development, pick a topic, etc) but you're pretty much following the same game mechanic(s) over and over to make each game.As times goes on, you can market your game, research new topics, train  and hire employees, put up a booth at the National game convention, take publishing deals, etc. Though these are varying ideas, you pretty much get the same ""feel"" when you're playing. It's point and click stuff, which is normal for a tycoon like this I suppose. For me personally, the game began to bore me a couple of hours into the gameplay, but I allowed myself to enjoy it and had fun making profit. What will keep you coming back is the steady introduction of new consoles and features. Just when you think you've seen all the game features, a new one may come up, like being able to use a Research and Development team to undergo projects.The bottom line is that the feel of the game mechanics feels somewhat repititive and will likely bore you UNLESS you like the idea of being a big-time game dev. If that's you, then that idea which stands behind this game--and the desire to succeed--will be an incentive to play for some time. It wasn't an entirely enthralling experience, but I liked it.			"

												In Game Dev Tycoon, there are a wide range of games you could release on a variety of consoles throughout the years. You start right when gaming takes off or so, with two options to develop for, as time passes on you get more options. Those options are twists on the real names of consoles that have gone through over time, as well as the companies who developed them. A big part of the game is research. What is research exactly? You get research from doing various things such as completing contract work, which gives you money for completion, but takes your money if you don't complete it in time. You can also get it from other things like making games. What is research used for? Upgrades to your games to make them even better and bring in those big scores. Big scores means big money to make more big games. It turns into an endless cycle, until you're a billionaire. Your games can have different topics which you have to research, and can be in a variety of genres. It's up to you to decide what genre and topic works best, and where you should divert your resources during development. You can also hype up your game by putting out ads, or going to the game's equivalent of E3 and setting up a booth. Hyping up a bad game is bad for your company, but hyping up a really good game will reward you greatly. In the second stage of the game you can start to hire staff. They're really useful but aren't that great at first. Remember to train them up, but don't forget to work on your own character as well.Game Dev Tycoon also has a modding community, although some of the mods don't work very well. You can still find plenty of good mods that add content and expand the game though. I didn't get mods myself until after my first or second playthrough though.Some bugs and annoyances I've found are that late game, with too many bubbles your game can lag, although a mod can fix that on the workshop. Also I've recently run into some issues with tabbing out and changing the size of the screen. I haven't run into any game breaking bugs, but watch out if you plan on modding because some of them can conflict, and break the game.I'll give this game a 6.75/10. I enjoyed it a lot but I feel that it does have some issues. I still recommend it, though.			"

												If you ever wanted to have fun and see how you would do in making your own games in a fantasy setting, this is a very good game. I have had fun playing it multiple times and some are just for ridiculous games and others are just ""remakes"" of real games that I love. I always love how I tend to make Romance of the Three Kingdoms a 10 across the review boards. Check it out if it's on sale but I believe it is totally worth full price.Graphics: 8 - Great for a simulation game, love the colors.Sound: 8.5 - Music is alright but great for this type of game.Gameplay: 8.5 - Good gameplay, I always enjoy trying to get the achievements everytime I play.Story: 8.5 - Just you trying to bring a company from your garage to a AAA studio.

												The story of the game is that you go back to the year 1985 and start your own game company. You start off in a garage which you can upgrade to a technical suite and more! As time progresses there are news popups which describe events that are taking place in the gaming industry at the time. For example: Vonny has just released their second video game system. Some games you make may be a smash hit but others not so great, you must be wise with the topic, genre and console. You can earn millions or become bankrupt. To improve the chance of making a great game is to hire staff which becomes available in the upgraded garage (becomes the technical suite). The staff can be used to help make games, research topics and research different features of the engine. When you start off, the game may be a bit tricky but once you learn which topic matches with which genre it will seem easier. With the ability to make games there is a cost. At the start of each career you recieve a certain budget which you can use to develop your first game! It randomly selects the first topics you can use so don't excpect to get the one you want. During making games with the budget you can go bankrupt, although it seems bad you can get two chances before you finally go bankrupt and have to start over.Overall Rating: 9/10 (Highly Recommended)I rate this game a 9 out of 10 because of how addicting it is, the details of the game and the dream of any gamer to make their own game company. Green Heart Games need to make a few tweaks which are only little ones. For example when the reviews of the games you make pop up it takes 20 seconds to display all of them. I feel that this wastes time but you can download a mod off of the workshop to reduce it to 1 second but hopefully they will change it anyway :).Thanks for reading this review and good luck with your game company :)Daniel			"

At first, it might seem like a very monotonous game, but in its simplicity, it still is ingenius.

												Bought this game on a whim. Absolutely glad I did. One of the most fun games I've played in a while and I haven't played a ""tycoon"" or ""theme <park, hospital>"" game in at least 12 years. Surprisingly addictive with feelings of immense satisfaction when you create a game that skyrockets you to success.  There were several times where I thought my company was going to go under but suddenly found myself on the top of the charts with a random, often extremely goofy, idea.Ended up with a company worth over 1 billion dollars with such hits as ""Dragons Everywhere"" the fantasy RPG adventure. ""Flying or Whatever"" the ground breaking Aircraft - RPG/Simulator and ""Pew Pew UR DEAD"" and its sequel ""Pew Pew I'M DEAD"" which were basically both my ideas for CoD / MoH ripoffs. And who can forget the classic History - Sim/Strategy game ""George Washington Simulator."" Get this game.			"

												This is the first game of this type that I've played. If you are excited by the idea of owning your own game developing business, this game will hold intrinsic delight for you. That was the case with me, so natuarally I liked this game.Especially at first, it's fun creating the games. Basically, after you decide to make a video game, you allot portions of time to specific development aspects like graphics, sound, world design, etc. You do so by sliding a meter up or down depending on how much time you want to spend on that aspect of design. You must use wisdom, because certain game genres and topics will turn out better or worse depending on how much time you spend on a certain aspect of design. At first the gameplay was exciting for me. It's enjoyable to see the monetary effects of your good game design ;) . But for the most part, you as the player as repeating the same processes for designing each game.  It's not a thoughtless procedure (because you have to figure out what to spend time on in development, pick a topic, etc) but you're pretty much following the same game mechanic(s) over and over to make each game.As times goes on, you can market your game, research new topics, train  and hire employees, put up a booth at the National game convention, take publishing deals, etc. Though these are varying ideas, you pretty much get the same ""feel"" when you're playing. It's point and click stuff, which is normal for a tycoon like this I suppose. For me personally, the game began to bore me a couple of hours into the gameplay, but I allowed myself to enjoy it and had fun making profit. What will keep you coming back is the steady introduction of new consoles and features. Just when you think you've seen all the game features, a new one may come up, like being able to use a Research and Development team to undergo projects.The bottom line is that the feel of the game mechanics feels somewhat repititive and will likely bore you UNLESS you like the idea of being a big-time game dev. If that's you, then that idea which stands behind this game--and the desire to succeed--will be an incentive to play for some time. It wasn't an entirely enthralling experience, but I liked it.			"

												Oh man, where do I begin. Game Dev Tycoon is one of the best simulation games I've ever played. It gives you a general feel of how the game industry has evolved throughout the years, parodying famous events, and has really immersive gameplay combined with that ""one more turn"" feel from titles like Civilization V. I'd recommend it to anybody who likes, well, having fun.Game Dev Tycoon sets you off in your own measly garage, making a 2D game. But as you make more and more games, you witness the world around you change: gaming becomes more popular, companies arise, and it becomes the next trend. The game portrays this transformation amazingly: you get to experience firsthand how the gaming industry morphed small developers into the giants of gaming today. Along this path, you manage your own gaming company, churning out titles that decide your company's fate, and, the gaming world's fate.The gameplay in Game Dev is deceptively simple. You create games, with certain genres, and you allocate how much time each specific part needs (such as Level Design, or Engine). Over time, you learn what combinations create your AAA games, and what can give you the most money. Along the way, you add more features: Character Progression, Loading Screens, etc. Eventually, you'll be able to make giant projects, and more! Throughout this entire time, you also manage your staff, control marketing, and PR. It gives a very immersive experience in the simulation genre.Furthermore, the game provides lots of replayability. Every new game start provides different scenarios, and you can tell the game to veer off course of what happened in reality. The Steam Workshop community provides even more: hundreds of mods for the game can change your experience, whether it be the addition of ""Next-Gen Consoles"", or the pcmasterrace. The game goes way beyond the initial purchase, giving you endless opportunities.Game Dev Tycoon may not be a AAA title, but it's definitely worth its price, and more. It features very immersive gameplay and storytelling, a fabulous community, and an overall well-designed game. Kudos to Greenheart Games for making one of my favourite simulation games of all time!

I didn't find the game all that challenging, but it was lighthearted and fun. I wish it would have been possible to conduct more detailed in game research and surveys.

												Game Dev Tycoon is a wonderful game for what it represents. The plot is fantastic and I love how it uses true events with slightly renamed consoles and games, far better than if they made up all the consoles and games. The game gives you a lot of choice, is very simple to understand and with so many different possibilities and outcomes, the game has yet to become stale for me so far.However, in my hour so far of playing, I am already finding it very hard to make perfect games. Whilst game reports are a very good way to get information about good and bad combos, the reviews are lacking in depth with some simply saying things like 'Enjoyed it' and 'Good'. If the reviewers went into more depth like they sometimes do when mentioning things like 'medieval works really well with strategy' then I'd much prefer the reviews and actually find them useful, however, as it stands, the best way to get information on your game is to file a game report. Whilst I have not played this game for too long, my first impressions are for the most part very positive. The game is very simple to play and is perfect for some relaxing late-night gaming. The game adds enough challenge with its numerous choices and certainly does require a lot of thought into some decisions in order to maintain enough money to save yourself from going bankrupt, however isn't impossibly difficult to grasp. Overall, my opinion on 'Game Dev Tycoon' is very positive, however I do feel the lack of in-depth reviews really does hinder its potential. But this is one con among many pros and should certainly not put you off playing this wonderfully unique experience.Rating: 3/4 "

I bought this 6 hours ago and have 6 hours played. There isn't TOO much value end game or replay value I think out of 6 hours but it doesn't matter, its a rising indie and a cheap title. 10/5$ is too little to ask, and you will buy it! BUY IT. NOW.People who rate games with numbers are gay. With that being said, I give this a 9.75/10 it's sooo goooood. If there was more in depth game creation that would be even BETTER but it's still a 10$ indie game. This is a jewel. Pick it up and give it a chance. Also, prepare for the nostalgia trip.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a fun little casual game well worth picking up while on sale. You start as a single person in your garage and work your way up to the CEO of an AAA game studio. Anyone who has played a variety of games over the years will enjoy coming up with their favorite game combos and thinking from the end of an indie game developer. I think the style of the artwork may convey a generic-ville type feeling but it's a proper game. There is no in-game purchasing micro-transaction garbage. The game has a definite goal and is not a mindless grinding simulator. I am a slow gamer but it took me about thirty hours before I was able to complete all the achievements in the game. I will likely put another ten hours in just to see how fast I can beat the game now that I have proper experience in it.I think some of the negative reviews that are on here are frustrated with replay value and min/maxing their games. I'd like to address that. This game is most fun when experienced at the beginning without a guide. If you go in with a guide you're just going to want to hit all the hard points right off the bat and you'll completely lose the fun the game, even if you succeed. Don't be afraid to try things and learn, as the game is very good with rewarding you regardless of success or failure. For example if you decide to try a game combination/configuration that does not work, the game permanently records a reminder in your history when you write your game report. Should you decide to restart your game, it will give you the option to retain that knowledge in the new game. Game Dev Tycoon is also good about not giving you too much to handle up front, easing you into the development process, while at the same time not giving you any choices that are completely useless. So feel free to experiment with new opportunities! When it is beneficial for you to use a publisher the option will appear (never too soon.) and even the random 'events' that occur give you a bonus even if you make the 'wrong choice'.When it comes to replay again I believe it relies on not getting a game guide right off the bat. You'll go bankrupt a few times learning but it's okay, like I mentioned your 'progress' is still pretty much saved. Once you get the swing of things you'll quickly level your studio up quickly to where you were previously. With a guide you'll just be frustrated you are not hitting 10/10 games every single time and just quit at the beginning.			"

												Love it.This is pretty much a no brainer, for any tycoon fan at least.Despite not being extremely important, the graphics are really nice, and don't get boring to look at (which, let's face it, you'll spend a lot of time looking at it), and are followed by a regular soundtrack. The gameplay is incredibly good, allowing you to train your character, and hire a couple more (and train them, too). You'll also be able to upgrade your office once you've earned (milked) enough money from your fans, and you'll also be able to research new technologies and such throughout the years.Eventually, you'll even be able to start your own MMO games, and that's when the real milking begins. Or it should. That's probably the one thing I feel it's a bit off with GDT. The MMO system is bad, in my opinion. And, since I'm not really into modding, I've never really tried any of the mods available, which are many. But I've read, and heard from friends, that there are some really really good mods.I've actually spent more hours playing this than steam actually states, for some reason, so, that's something to take into consideration, too.I'd recommend this game any day of the year.

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Game Dev Tycoon. More Clinical Than I Prefer, But Fun.Genre: Indie Simulation Management Game. Developed and Published by: Greenheart GamesPlatform: Windows, Mac and LinuxBusiness Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay ThoughtsThis is my first and, so far only, journey into this genre. Game Dev Tycoon premise is about traveling back in time and building a game development studio from the ground up with knowledge of what's to come. Personally, I think I would have done a lot of bets on the lottery but hey, priorities right? Build your company from nothing and try to make it to the top in the optimal way possible. From working out of your garage into your own studio to eventually commanding a team of about 10 people. GDT covers a lot of different aspects of game development including developing your own technologies, advertising, fan bases and more. There’s about six to seven hours of content to complete a single run-through. It’s a casual experience with a numbers-increasing-over-time reward feeling to it.Building a game is somewhat straightforward. After selecting the name, topic, genre and platform the game will be built for, development will start. This involves little bubbles flying to the top of the screen increasing four different point stats: Bugs, Design, Technology and Research. Design and technology points are useful for different aspects of game development. Research points are used for, well, researching new technologies. The fourth stat is how many bugs your game has created. You are free to publish a game with bugs but there may be an understandable backlash by fans and sales might be affected. There will then be three development stage windows that will popup. These will have sliders that guide how much time is spent on certain aspects of the title in process Generally, you want to optimize your time for what the genre/topic prefers. There’s also chances to include/exclude certain costly features such as better sound & graphics or other potentially important features. Once you think your game is ready and finished, you’ll gain experience (there’s a lot of different sliders) and then have the option to either release the game or trash it. Keep in mind that there are monthly costs so trashing a game should only be done if you’ve royally screwed it up.There’s some additional nuance to the simulation, especially once the company grows bigger and moves out of the garage. There’s the hiring of additional developers for different training into different specialties. There’s deciding how much advertising in traditional and non-traditional media the company will manage, choosing which new game technology to research, and much more. A lot of it is handled by staring at bars and numbers steadily increasing as your team/company gets better at its job. All of which is simply handled with popup windows and mouse clicks. There’s only a single level of difficulty and it’s enough to keep you honest but not overly punishing. Unless you make some really silly mistakes. GDT is good for an amusing time through game development history starting from the C64/oldPC era to slightly ahead of our current times in 2013. Though the biggest you can reach is a mid-range development studio. No true AAA 100+ man teams. Although, all things considered, maybe its best we don't simulate that...GDT’s Biggest Strength and WeaknessWhile the point of GDT is that you know what’s coming up next, it’s also its biggest problem. It makes the game just a little too predictable. It takes the risk out of the game since if my company was ever approaching bankruptcy, all I had to do was publish a game I knew would do well on the PC platform and suddenly huge amounts of cash. Whether that was a post-apocalyptic RPG, aka: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, a history strategy title or a military action game, I’d get my money and then some from the project. It was almost always guaranteed they’d work out so long as I hadn’t been making them constantly. The game is a bit too clinical about how games are made for my taste. What sets your game apart from the rest besides your development talents is the name its given. There’s no real branding done, universe building or whatnot. At least, not organically. These are mostly just gripes and not game-breaking problems. PC SettingsPC settings menu is a bit lacking in user choice. The settings menu gives you language choices, tutorials & hints with present on/off switches and an animation quality slider. The quality slider presents performance and quality presets though I doubt you’ll need it to run at the performance preset unless you’re running this game on a toaster. In fullscreen mode, which is really borderless windowed, the game auto-adjusts to whatever resolution your desktop is running. In windowed, it runs in a square resolution. V-sync is always on. As the game is entirely mouse driven, there’s nothing to be remapped. There’s a single audio slider for the game’s volume with on/off toggles for sound effects and music. I would have preferred there to be multiple audio sliders, but oh well. By the way, there’s only four save slots and they only save the most recent games. Final ThoughtsMy opinion is mostly neutral when it comes to Game Dev Tycoon. It's fun for the one playthrough but after that, there's not much to hook me in. It's filled with plenty of references and nods to games, platforms and the culture throughout the game which make the first run-through worthwhile. But, it's a little too predictable and a little too clinical for my taste. There's not a lot of true creative control over the games made and there's some missing aspects of game development not featured. Not that it makes the game bad, just not really what I'm looking for. Still, I can't knock it for doing what they sold the game as but I'd keep that thought in mind if you're interested in it.Read the Review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												Decent simulation of running a game development studio on a conceptual level. I mean, who didn't dream at some point about creating their own super-amazing game - Game Dev Tycoon somewhat delivers.On the mechanic side I believe it really shines with simple presentation and doesn't bog the player down with charts and statistics typical for the genre. Graphics are neat and do the job just fine.Personally couldn't see the replay value after ""completing"" the game but then considering the price of the game during any kind of sale, it's not really expected either. Would say 8/10.  "

												In Game Dev Tycoon, there are a wide range of games you could release on a variety of consoles throughout the years. You start right when gaming takes off or so, with two options to develop for, as time passes on you get more options. Those options are twists on the real names of consoles that have gone through over time, as well as the companies who developed them. A big part of the game is research. What is research exactly? You get research from doing various things such as completing contract work, which gives you money for completion, but takes your money if you don't complete it in time. You can also get it from other things like making games. What is research used for? Upgrades to your games to make them even better and bring in those big scores. Big scores means big money to make more big games. It turns into an endless cycle, until you're a billionaire. Your games can have different topics which you have to research, and can be in a variety of genres. It's up to you to decide what genre and topic works best, and where you should divert your resources during development. You can also hype up your game by putting out ads, or going to the game's equivalent of E3 and setting up a booth. Hyping up a bad game is bad for your company, but hyping up a really good game will reward you greatly. In the second stage of the game you can start to hire staff. They're really useful but aren't that great at first. Remember to train them up, but don't forget to work on your own character as well.Game Dev Tycoon also has a modding community, although some of the mods don't work very well. You can still find plenty of good mods that add content and expand the game though. I didn't get mods myself until after my first or second playthrough though.Some bugs and annoyances I've found are that late game, with too many bubbles your game can lag, although a mod can fix that on the workshop. Also I've recently run into some issues with tabbing out and changing the size of the screen. I haven't run into any game breaking bugs, but watch out if you plan on modding because some of them can conflict, and break the game.I'll give this game a 6.75/10. I enjoyed it a lot but I feel that it does have some issues. I still recommend it, though.			"

												If you ever wanted to have fun and see how you would do in making your own games in a fantasy setting, this is a very good game. I have had fun playing it multiple times and some are just for ridiculous games and others are just ""remakes"" of real games that I love. I always love how I tend to make Romance of the Three Kingdoms a 10 across the review boards. Check it out if it's on sale but I believe it is totally worth full price.Graphics: 8 - Great for a simulation game, love the colors.Sound: 8.5 - Music is alright but great for this type of game.Gameplay: 8.5 - Good gameplay, I always enjoy trying to get the achievements everytime I play.Story: 8.5 - Just you trying to bring a company from your garage to a AAA studio.

												This game is AWESOME!Honestly, any game where you can create best-selling games which have names like 'Drop That Soap' and make advanced consoles called the 'Compubox Too' is one worth investing in. There are so many great mods in this game, but I have not invested in these too much yet.I recently played through the game in a 6/7-hour game and actually discovered several features which I had not previously discovered (such as the homage to this service which is dubbed 'Grid') and, not only was it fun to play, but the experience was different; and no two files will likely have the same development path for topics, as all of the topics appear in a random order.This game is one of my personal favourites, not only for the hilarious titles that can come up, but for the achievements which bay homage to classic games (such as Pong and Doom). I would recommend this to any casual gamer who is happy to spend countless hours playing this legendary game.10/10			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a strategy game developed by Greenheart games. You begin the game by naming your character with limited customization and naming your company, then with a very helpful tutorial system, you're off to create games as you see fit.When you start, the only thing you can do is create a game, you can make it text based or 2-D gameplay, but as you progress through the years you will be able to research new things such as the ability to make a 3-D engine, better A.I., environmental effects, all that stuff. To get these research ideas, you must get research points by making a game, engine, or doing something like creating a report on what you did wrong when developing your game. When you begin making your game, you can choose the genre, which topic it will be based on (Ancient history, ninjas, spies) and choosing which systems it will be onYou can also create your own engine with many of these research skills, which can cost quite a lot sum of dosh. When developing your game, you have to use 3 sliders to see how much time you want to spend on a part of a game, for example, do you focus on the story more than the game or vice versa? Graphics or sound, A.I. or Dialogue? As you develop your game, Journalists will ask for interviews and ask on you're opinion on things such as what's important in a genre of a game, you can also hype up the game by saying stuff like ""*Name* will be one of the greatest"", you can also sign missions such as a plan to get women into gaming which will cost you, but earn you a lot of fans and respect. Once you've created your game, you will gain experience in pretty much all your skills such as your story writing, gameplay designing, sound and graphics, etc. The game will also then  be reviewed by 4 reviewers, you may start by getting 5s, 4s, and probably 2s, but once you've managed to get your first 10 out of 10, you will want to raise your hand in success.If you've done badly, you can generate a game report which can give you advise, such as the Commodore 64 has a large adventure fanbase, or the PC community has a large strategy fanbase, and whether things such as dialogue is important for certain genres.However, if you still manage to do badly, you will enter bankrupcy and will have to take a loan from the bank, fail that, game over.As you earn more money, you can move into bigger offices where you can recruit more staff members as well as make the place look very pretty.As you make good games you will gain fans, who will definatly buy your games and if you got 100K of them, you'll be able to self publish your games, you can also sign publish contracts with companies such as úbersoft or Electronic Mass Productions to gain notice in the industry, but they'll call the shots on what you make.Later in the game you can also build your custom console to release onto the market.I gotta say, the gameplay is pretty damn addicting, so much so I've been spending 6 hours into a single play session which I never really do a lot, and that says something for me.Nothing to say in the visual department, it looks clean and reminds me of a few flash games.The sound is pretty good too, nice beeps and bloops and the music keeps a smile on my face 99% of the time.As far as complaints go.....well, there isn't any on the top of my head to be honest, I was too occupied in making games and having too much fun to notice any.Overall, Game Dev Tycoon is a brilliant game and you should absolutly purchase it as soon as you can.I'd play it for decades.9/10			"

												This game is AWESOME!Honestly, any game where you can create best-selling games which have names like 'Drop That Soap' and make advanced consoles called the 'Compubox Too' is one worth investing in. There are so many great mods in this game, but I have not invested in these too much yet.I recently played through the game in a 6/7-hour game and actually discovered several features which I had not previously discovered (such as the homage to this service which is dubbed 'Grid') and, not only was it fun to play, but the experience was different; and no two files will likely have the same development path for topics, as all of the topics appear in a random order.This game is one of my personal favourites, not only for the hilarious titles that can come up, but for the achievements which bay homage to classic games (such as Pong and Doom). I would recommend this to any casual gamer who is happy to spend countless hours playing this legendary game.10/10			"

												One of the most fun Strategy games I have ever come across. Packed full of nostalgia, easter eggs, and parodies. This would be the one app I would pay for to have it on my smart phone. Super entertaining and relaxing. If you're playing this game and not having fun... you're doing it wrong.Tutorials are welcomed in this game as there is far to much to pick up on in one play through. The achievements are superbly designed and actually seem the point to play. The points system when releasing a game is a bit confusing...All in all on a scale from 1 to 10 its... cocaine for the brain my friends!!!!			"

												A casual game that gets serious and will eat away hours of your life.If you've ever played the game: Game Dev Story, which is a mobile game, this game was inspired by that, and is extremely similar. Managing a game company and using your knowledge of console history is oddly satisfying. It is the type of game where you say, ""just one more"".			"

												Quite possible one of the best simulators I've ever played. Its such a fun game to play when you have nothing to do. There are plenty of mods around for it. (On Steam and Online) I downloaded a mod that allowed me to get to the end to see what is ahead of me and I must say it will take time and effort to reach the last stages. I really do recommend this if you are bored or want to play a game about making games whilst working with game communities within the games, game. (MMO) Great Game.

												Game Dev Tycoon is a strategy game developed by Greenheart games. You begin the game by naming your character with limited customization and naming your company, then with a very helpful tutorial system, you're off to create games as you see fit.When you start, the only thing you can do is create a game, you can make it text based or 2-D gameplay, but as you progress through the years you will be able to research new things such as the ability to make a 3-D engine, better A.I., environmental effects, all that stuff. To get these research ideas, you must get research points by making a game, engine, or doing something like creating a report on what you did wrong when developing your game. When you begin making your game, you can choose the genre, which topic it will be based on (Ancient history, ninjas, spies) and choosing which systems it will be onYou can also create your own engine with many of these research skills, which can cost quite a lot sum of dosh. When developing your game, you have to use 3 sliders to see how much time you want to spend on a part of a game, for example, do you focus on the story more than the game or vice versa? Graphics or sound, A.I. or Dialogue? As you develop your game, Journalists will ask for interviews and ask on you're opinion on things such as what's important in a genre of a game, you can also hype up the game by saying stuff like ""*Name* will be one of the greatest"", you can also sign missions such as a plan to get women into gaming which will cost you, but earn you a lot of fans and respect. Once you've created your game, you will gain experience in pretty much all your skills such as your story writing, gameplay designing, sound and graphics, etc. The game will also then  be reviewed by 4 reviewers, you may start by getting 5s, 4s, and probably 2s, but once you've managed to get your first 10 out of 10, you will want to raise your hand in success.If you've done badly, you can generate a game report which can give you advise, such as the Commodore 64 has a large adventure fanbase, or the PC community has a large strategy fanbase, and whether things such as dialogue is important for certain genres.However, if you still manage to do badly, you will enter bankrupcy and will have to take a loan from the bank, fail that, game over.As you earn more money, you can move into bigger offices where you can recruit more staff members as well as make the place look very pretty.As you make good games you will gain fans, who will definatly buy your games and if you got 100K of them, you'll be able to self publish your games, you can also sign publish contracts with companies such as úbersoft or Electronic Mass Productions to gain notice in the industry, but they'll call the shots on what you make.Later in the game you can also build your custom console to release onto the market.I gotta say, the gameplay is pretty damn addicting, so much so I've been spending 6 hours into a single play session which I never really do a lot, and that says something for me.Nothing to say in the visual department, it looks clean and reminds me of a few flash games.The sound is pretty good too, nice beeps and bloops and the music keeps a smile on my face 99% of the time.As far as complaints go.....well, there isn't any on the top of my head to be honest, I was too occupied in making games and having too much fun to notice any.Overall, Game Dev Tycoon is a brilliant game and you should absolutly purchase it as soon as you can.I'd play it for decades.9/10			"

												This game is awesome. Period.Game Dev Tycoon is a game about starting from the bottom to rise up the ladder and become a sucessful Game Developer. There are many various events that occur during the timeline (early 80's +) like new consoles, office upgrades, offers from ""Agent Blowfish"" to savatage other game companies, and scammers from other countries. It is very easy to play and understand, but can be hard to survive the years without going bankrupt.When I started playing, I started 2 or 3 saves and went bankrupt in the Garage on each one. Then on my 4th, I survived long enough to move into the first Office. I stayed there for a while and even managed to survive to the first Office upgrade. But alas, I went into the land of Bankrupcy once more. Then, I got the gist of the game and tried again, this time with some new stratagies. Now, I'm waaay past the last event and the console lab. All my employees are 1000+ on every aspect and still going strong. In my games, I make maybe 4-6 new games during the start, then I just keep making sequels of them (For Example: I make a Music/Simulation game called Musik Maker, then I just keep making Musik Makers on and on every now and then (Musik Maker 2, Musik Maker 3, Musik Maker 4, etc.)). I may occasionally make another new series but I usually stick to the same games, and all my games are always named after real games! :DAnother great thing about Game Dev Tycoon was Mod Support. If you go on the Forums, there are plenty of Mods available and being made (The game was made in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS so it shouldn't be too hard for Programmers to mod). And you are probably thinking, ""HACKS, CHEATS, UNLEGITNESS! NO MODS FOR ME!"". It turns out, most of the Mods are just Expansion Packs adding new consoles or events or options. To my knowledge there is only 1 Cheat Mod, and it's called Cheat Mod... :P It's actually pretty fun to use on a seperate save (Call it ""CHEATERZ"" or something) because you can skip to any place in the timeline and when you are developing a game, there are little plus sign orbs below that add points to your game design and technology (I have made games with 50K points each :D). I'd reccommend Mods to users who have played Game Dev Tycoon a lot and are bored of the origanal and are looking for more and for those who just want more.The game itself takes maybe 5+ hours to squeeze all the story out and is actually a bit short (But with expansion mods, Game Dev Tycoon = MOAR FUN!). Some of the achivements are really hard to get (Oh yeah, MODS DONT DISABLE ACHIVEMENTS! So if you are REALLY stuck, the Cheat Mod comes in handy :} ) and a bunch of them are Easter Eggs (I'm not spoiling :)).Overall, this game is really worth getting. 10$ is a BIT much, but it's so worth it. If it's on sale, EVEN BETTER! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GET IT NOW!!!11/10""Achivement Unlocked: Turn it up to 11""			"

												Some aspects of the game NEED to be developed such as; The reviews system (has to give the player reasons why he did good/bad), some more choices for game development (in engine, gameplay, story, etc...), some more game genres (Puzzle, dinosaur, zoo) and maybe the ability to decide what TYPE of game it is (whether its an overhead game, first person, third person). Other than that the game is AMAZING, I've played t over and over again and have amassed about 50 hours due to the games replayability, creating such titles as Beasts Must Die and When Penguins Strike(Hunting/Sim), Call Of Battle Company (Military/Action-Strategy) and Evil corporations(Business/Sim). Get this game, now.			"

My only wish though was that I wanted a hard mode so that people that didn't know which consoles would flop or not would get lured in, lets say that they added an Atari Jaguar and mentioned its '64 bits' possibility, then when they start making a game, they cant finish it cuz developing for that piece of crap was so hard!

												Do I develop a text based adventure or try to make a sim game? Ok text based adventure just to get my foot in the ground.  Oh no, what system? Can I afford a licensing fee? Is there enough market share to make it worth my time? Did I even focus on the correct attributes!? Are adventures even popular at the moment? Ok ok let's release the game, if it fails I'll be bankrupt and that will be the end of me. 7, 6, 6, 8Ok not too bad! I'll live to make a new game! Well do I make a new game or upgrade my game engine!? Should I hire new staff or train existing staff? What to do what to do?These questions and more will be up to you and your new game company. If your itching for a tycoon experience this should be right up your ally. Make games, earn money, hire staff, fire staff, change offices, create game engines, even make your own console. All of these things and more are awaiting for you in this lovely gem of a game. You may even learn a thing or two of the history of consoles, even if they are using fake names. I picked this up during the 2013 Holliday sale and wasn't expecting much, but what I got was a ""just one more game I need good reviews!"" Kind of addiction. I didn't put it down till I got every achievement! If you were a fan of Zoo Tycoon or Roller Coaster Tycoon like I am you should give this game a shot. This game doesn't disappoint! I highly recommend it.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a truly great, unique game. With enthralling gameplay with interesting twists and turns, dodgy Nigerian scammers and desperate fans, this is the juggernaut of the admittedly small Game Dev Game World. (Makes sense, right?) Follow your well-dressed character through time, starting with your bog-standard PC in your garage in the 70/80s, all the way to your futuristic HQ with a huge army of coders and some irritatingly needy uni students in your backroom... Create games for consoles ranging from the much loved Gameling to the futuristic Mbox One! You can let you and your team create a Prison Simulation in which the main goal is to pick up people's soap for them, or an action game funded by the Explody-Red-Barrel-Scientist-Guys, make 30 Million dollars in profit on a Vocabulary game, and lots more.Playability: 8/10Replayability: 9/10Fun: 10/101)Must Buy2)Should Buy3) Should buy only in sale4)Shouldn't Buy unless heavily discounted5)Shouldn't get unless free6) Shouldn't play even if free			"

												I had this game sitting in my inventory for at a month.  I assumed it'd be mediocre at best........I was wrong.  This game is great! I grew up with video games so playing this was quite nostalgic.  I love how they cycle through all the systems that were released.  It's not a walk in the park, I'd say its fair to expect to lose quite a few times.   I just sat through a good 2-3 hour sitting and I will definately play more.  For the price this game is a must have, very happy I got it.Also very cool that the team started out with two brothers.  They dev'd the game themselves but had to hire on another person to help with PR.			"

												Game Dev Tyccon is a video game business simulation by Greenheart Games based on the Japanese IOS and Android game Game Dev Story (Originally: Kairopark) that I have spent far too many of hours on, but I have no regrets.When Game Dev Tyccon starts, you get to create a character of the gender of your choice while the game also offers you a good range of ethnicities to choose from, after which you get to sit at your desk in your dusty and rusty garage, to create your very first video game.At the beginning of the game you only get a few categories to choose from, topic, genre and the platform for your game. As the game goes on and you develop more games, games you will have to research in order to unlock more topics and categories, your games will get to be more detailed and specific, especially when you start to develop your very own consoles.The point of the game is to make games that work will, games that will sell and get you fans, so that your company flourishes. There is a lot to do in the game in terms of unlocking categories, topics as well as contract for some of that side money. It took me  a little while to understand the importance of researching my released games in order to figure out what had worked and what hadn't, which ended up being incredibly helpful. When a game is finished, aspects you chose to priorities will receive XP so that they can LV up, rendering even better games.After all of this, the obvious follows, your game will be reviewed by reviewers, your sales will greatly depend on the reviews you get and whether they turn out to be positive or negative.Game Dev Tycoon is a lot of fun, and a lot more complicated than what you might expect from a game like that. As a gamer, my understanding of what works well together and what doesn't goes from common sense to personal experiences, and it was very fun to see the game point out to actual game consoles that either failed terribly or changed the gaming industry altogether.Game Dev Tycoon may be similar to Game Dev Story at the core but turned out to be entirely different. In terms of how much work and thought you have to put into a game; it turned out to be a true simulation that at times became very difficult and I have lost count of the amount of times that I had to declare A woman on the internet / facebook "

												This♥♥♥♥♥♥is quite addicting. I'm a sucker for tycoon games and I usually only play for less than an hour but this.. damnnnn nigguhhh. It's basically just repeating the same thing over and over again, but it manages to keep you playing. You'll loose track of time, 4 hours will only seem like 20 minutes. At first it isn't that fun, but when you sell a hit game you'll feel really good and proud of yourself and you'll get all cocky that you have a surplus amount of money and make a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game or hire too much employees and then you ragequit, pretty much the only thing that'll stop you from playing, but after a five minute break or so, you'll be wanting more.

												I bought this game because it looked like something I hadn't played before, and I was so right, it reminded me of some other games, but this is much more addicting and fun.I started playing the second I bought it, and everything was super simple to understand and figure out. In the beginning you startup like almost every Indie-developer, in your own house(in this case a garage). You have a relative small budget to start off with, and few variations on which platform to publish your games, but the thing is that every single thing in this game evolve with time.The first time you play it, you only have a few good selling games, and when I say a few, I mean like 1-5 max. But when the world understands what great games are, then you just have to figure out know when they are ready for different genres and specific platforms.After the first time I opened the game, I played for 6 straight hours nonstop. I had so much fun, and every single detail in the game made sense and I was nervous for every single review.If you ever feel bored, and want to try something new, buy this game, you won't regret it... it's way too much fun.

												Game Dev Tycoon is one of those surprises that you find along your game year. I was waiting until Steam Sale to purchase this game, due to lack of reviews/people talking about it. You see, I'm a big fan of Tycoon games, and its easy to play one of this genre and see a lot of mistakes/bugs ruining the gameplay. This is not true to GDT. If I knew what I know now, I'd purchase this game right away.Combining a good mixture of good design and gameplay, Greenheart Games made me feel like the little guy in the garage building my first game. You see, with Tycoon games you usually see yourself as the manager or some kind of God Like creature. In this title I felt so compelled to strive that I couldn't wait to release my major game and everytime a so-so review came in, I felt dissapointed. The pacing is great. Along the years you see consoles rise and fall and new technologies appear. Eventually you move out of your little garage and a office takes place. Then a fellow co-worker or two...And when you realize, its been 20 years already and you're a multi-million game dev studio, with lots of employees and each one with a different skill.Although the interface is not winning Design award of the Year, it's still very user friendly, and will leave no room for doubt as to where things are and how they work.This game takes me back to the time where I found a sentiment of ""wonder"" in games. Greenheart Games, thanks for the experience.""I can't wait for the sequel!""                    - Tarik Ventura			"

Serius deh, gue berusaha banget untuk mencari review atau testimonial tentang game ini. kenapa? karena gue gak pengen menghabiskan $4 untuk game kelas mini yang wtf banget. yup gue orangnya emang segitu pelitnya. tapi gue bukanlah tipikal gamer yang ""grafik ftw"" selama ""gameplay ftw"" dan ternyata... begitu pertama main, gue langsung 8 jam duduk didepan laptop gak bergerak! anjir ini game bener bener asik gila!Grafik: MINI GAME FACEBOOK. Lo inget gak farmville, Texas Holdem Poker, atau Ninja Wars? Yup itu adalah game game di facebook di era tahun 2010an. Grafik yang ada Game Dev Tycoon pun satu kelas dengan game seperti itu. Screen shot yang lo liat di store adalah keseluruhan dari game. Yup. bener bener gitu aja. selama 9 jam gue memandangi kantor gue tapi anehnya gue gak merasa bosen. Justru sebaliknya, gue bahkan BERMIMPI berada dikantor itu saking kepengin untuk bermain lagi.Gameplay: MASTERPIECE. Nah ini baru game yang bener bener game. Tujuan dari game ini adalah membuat game paling ngehit sejagat raya.. untuk bisa melakukan itu lo butuh pegawai, data research, pelatihan, fasilitas, contract, console, waktu yang tepat, marketing, daaaaaaan masih banyak lagi. sampai sekarang pun gue belum bisa menguasai semua faktor yang ada ddalam game karena BUANYAK SEKALI variasi yang bisa muncul dari game ini. percaya deh, 9 jam kurang main beginian.Gue berani kasih skor 8 dari 10 karena game ini benar benar mengunci perhatian. Lo bakalan dituntut untuk membuat kerajaan yang besar, kerajaan yang menguasai pasar pasar game. Kerajaan yang mengikuti milyaran pemuja. kerajaan yang... besar deh pokoknya.Serius, untuk harga $5 ini bener bener worth banget.			"

												A lot of people seem to think that developing games is as easy as doing what you did the last time, but only doing it better. The gaming industry can be very finicky, and usually successful games are successful if the market and timing is just right. But to anyone that thinks that they can make video games, here ya go. Starting you off at the beginning of the video game revolution, but just after the Video Game Crash of '83, this game puts you in the role of a software designer. I use that term over video game maker because you can develop game engines, pick up white hat hacking jobs from different companies for cash and develop games for a variety of consoles. I got as far as the Playstation/N64 era with my games, and saw the release of the Dreamcast, but I failed due to poor decisions, rehashes, and bad marketing. It's not that the game is tough, you should just know that you can't expect a great game just because of a name, which is true to real life. I highly recommend this game, not only because of how real it felt, but also because of how much fun it is. If you've ever wondered if you could make video games for a living, believe me, this game is for you.			"

												here is my opinion, after finishing it.the game itself designs on simple concepts, and simple gameplays as you can find in tycoon games. it is nothing out of ordinary. however, there are several things that make it enjoyable.Trials and Errors gameplay is challenging while it lasts. however, despite the fancy amount of contents it can offer, it comes down to several style of play to finish the game. after several hours, your fancy-named games will be come Games #01, Games #02, and so on.the trial and error will become the rotation between 3-5 combinations.(assume that you go for vanilla playthough)Community Mods brings the game to its peak, more contents, more challenges, and .. cough .. cough .. mul..multiplayer mod. There are good amounts of them available, ranging from simple add-on to overhaul.bottomline, check this game out if you want, it worths your purchase. recommended for those who love tycoon-style gameplay, else steer away from it.

												There is a good solid 4-6 hours in this game (just one play through), especially if you can make it to the end of the game, and make the correct decisions.  The Good: - You have to make the right decisions to make the most successful game.  There isn't a lot of randomness to your game ratings. You really do feel like you are in control.  - It is fun to see the history of the gaming industry over the last 20 years or so, and relive some of your childhood by actually developing for some of your favorite consoles!The Bad:- Each time you play through the game, the same consoles and events in history happen.  It would be nice to have alternate timelines where some consoles did bad that would normally do good.- After you figure out what combos work the best, and the mechanics, there really isn't much challenge to the game.Overall, I do recommend this game, but make sure you get it on sale!

												My first thoughts about this game were contradictory - Creating games while playing game? But I've decided to give It a try especially since It showed up on sale. I was wrong, Game Dev Tycoon brings you decent fun for a few hours, depending on your end game goal. I've found this game quite challenging from start, since you can get easily bankrupted for making a series of bad decisions while learning game mechanics, but that's what It's about, right?I had a great time watching how my company grows, but after you reach top scores and end-game, It gets very repetitive.Maybe if there was more game mechanics (ingame ones are simple and game Itself limits you in styles how you create and sell your products).Overall I didn't regret buying this game on sale, but I would if I paid full price.

												Genre: Casual/SimulationOverview: While the repetative nature of this game will limit the amount of fun you will have in subsequent replays, the initial playthrough was incredibly fun and addictive and took me somewhere between 6-8 hours to ""finish"" the game. Replay Value: After you are scored, you have the option to continue playing, but past this point no new technologies, systems, etc. will appear in the game and you are left with making games for whatever the last gen of consoles is (or for your own console). After playing around with various combinations of genres, you can import the effectiveness ratings for any new games that you make in a new playthrough.Gameplay: Many people who pick up this game have likely come across Game Dev Story from Kairosoft. Obvious influence aside, this game adds its own flavor to the game dev ""genre."" Without spoiling too much, eventually the game opens up to give the player many options through building a research team. The progression is streamlined and feels complete. The player starts in a garage and eventually finds himself the head of a major gaming corporation. With this progression, the complexity of the game changes drastically, but, for the most part, these changes are largely cosmetic in nature. The core gameplay is not particularly deep or even challenging. Any gaming vet will know which combinations work vs. which don't through common sense alone, without the need for a guide to hold your hand. Price/Value: Overall, expect to invest somewhere between 10-20 hours on this game. If this is something you deem fair for a $10 price tag, then by all means go for it. Those 10-20 hours will be a lot of fun. However, if longetivity is your concern, then perhaps wait for a steam sale. At the time of this writing, the game is on sale for $5. At this price I can wholeheartedly recommend you pick it up.Score: 7/10			"

												I highly reccomend this game to people because it adds a big amount of creativity and enjoyment while going through the proccess of making games. You can make thousands of games with many combinations, that is one of the reasons I love this game. Also you can advance into different offices which give it more of a background. One of the top reasons why I enjoy this is because it goes through the era of game-making which is truly fascinating, so you can experience how it was like in different eras and how technology advances day by day. Game Dev Tycoon hit my top list of games that I play. Go try it out for yourself, I'm sure you will enjoy it.			"

												When purchasing this game, little did I know how addicting it would be. I've played a similar game on my iPhone, but this one is by far more challenging and has more to offer.You start off in your garage, on your own, making video games. As you progress you move up into your own office and can hire people to work for you. Each game you make you choose the amount of time and effort that is put into producing certain aspects of the game. You also can research more enhancements that can be used to create your own gaming engine to produce even better games. Once a game is made and released it gets rated by four gaming magazines (those jerks can be a bit harsh at times...And yes, giving your game a name does seem to matter because if you don't one of thse guys ussually calls you on it).This game has replay value to it, which is what I enjoy. You can go back, make a new company and try and outdo yourself, try different combinations, do what ever you want. Good game, and I would suggest giving it a try.			"

While we get tycoon games that make us run railroads, prisions,hosptials, movie theaters, Zoo's, and amusement parks.This tycoon game has us being our very own video game developer. Every video gamer's dream. The only downside to this game is its ""rating"" system on games. You can't really seem to tell what's ""good"", ""bad"" and ugly"" sure it ranges from 1 to a perfect 10. But sometimes it may or may not sell well. Also working with ""medium"" and ""large"" games you can't really seem to tell that clearly what is necessarry. Also while the game gives you ""hints"" as to what's good for that game or not. It isn't really straight forwardly defined and it forces the player to make ""judgement"" calls i mean it IS a tycoon game after allWith modding including this game has limitless, endless fun. However it is sad because much like Skyrim. This game should've had a lot of these good mods in the game to begin with and not as something the modding community has to do. But then again it shows how much a community cares about the game so there is an upside.I seriously recommend this game for Tycoon fans and for all gamers who want to be that next inspiring video game developer			"

												Ricks Review:Summary:Gameplay: 8/10 - Simple and Qurky at times which is enjoyable, childlike and frustrating.Game Making: 9/10 - Researching new topics, engine and engine bits allows for managable customization of your game and with many mods extending the lists of these for more replayability. Pushing sliders up and down to influence how you game looks, feels and plays is key to making your game a success. While matchin the right Topic, Genre and Console is the most frustrating, obvious and simplistic thing ever devised, it sometimes causes frustration in ""How do they not work!"" and ""OMG!!! I got a Super-Amazing game!""Console Making: 9/10 - Although not at all similar to creating a Game and only available in the late game, it is surprisingly enjoyable to create a 15 billion credit machine to compete against Vonnys and Mirconofts superboxes. Compared to game making, the choices are few to graphics, technology and optimization, and the console designs are limited to a select few (Xbox, Wii, PS2, and the Box) with upto 3 different variations depending on the console type.MMO Making: 8/10 - I listed this different from Game Making as its selling process is totally different compared to the generic game, as it can sell Forever! Unlike basic, generic games, MMOs can sell for intill the player decides to stop selling it (which can be for any reason the player decides on). The best way to keep selling the MMO is to keep advertising it and putting Addons onto it. I rated this lower because it felt limited and cannot be unlocked through standard researching but through a R&D lab (Research and Development Laboratory).Sequels Making: 7/10 - Again placed these types of games under a different review because they are similar to eachother and different to MMOs and Generic game making. Sequels in the base game are unlocked several years down the timeline but can be modded to be unlocked after you create your first game. Sequels allow for the player to create an entirely new version of a pre-made game, (Real Honour 1, 2 or 3 etc.) the ratings of your sequel will depend on the time since last game was released and if the game was made on a new engine (with other tech changing the ratings as well). However, creating a sequel replaces that game so if your sequel was rated bad and your wanted to start from the begining you cannot do this and you'll need to make a sequel of the sequel. Addon Making: 5/10 - Similar to sequels but only apply to MMOs, you can create an expansion pack for your MMO game which can encourage more people to buy the game and play it. That is really it. You can however apply Game choices like new graphics or additions, but this is it. Nothing more nothing less.Research: 10/10 - Nothing really to improve on. You can research Game Topics (Spy, Fantasy etc.), Engines, Engine Components (Animations, cutscenes etc.), Casual genre, new gameplay additions (marketing, target markets) and that is really it. After you reach late-game, you can get a Research and Development lab which is used to unlock Console Making, MMO/Addon making, Company Exhibitions and better hardware. UI: 5/10 - UI is well designed, it is simple but accessible. However is very quirky and annoying, sometime changing the game title can be awkward. Menu buttons fail to respond or work sometimes, and clicking on a button can make another thing happen. Technical ability of the UI is poor but the display is good.Audio: 10/10 - Best thing about this game is the relaxing, jazz-style music which plays.Moddability: 4/10 - I don't understand how to mod this game, so I rely on the community to judge half of the review for this part. Lots of mods available from similar topics and research to gameplay changes and addons. Workshop compatability helps as it installs mods to your files directly and hosts several pages of fun and awesome mods. However I do occasionally run into faults with modding and workshop, from mods not being installed properly and requiring to access the game, turning the mods on and restarting the game for them to work. Although  easy to live with, just frustrating and takes time away from playing the game.Main Points:Great gameplay, from heavily customizable games to creating amazing supermachines to compete against Vonny or Mirconoft.Great jazz audio which is relaxing and satisfying.Modding support greatly extends the shelf life and fun of the game, even with its qurks.Improvements: Improve the UI technicality, sometimes buttons fail to respond or work, button pressing may cause another button to be pressed and changing the game title is very awkward.

												I wasn't exactly sure what I was in for when I got this game- fortunate enough to get it on sale for free after selling holiday cards on the market - I just thought '♥♥♥♥ it'; you know?  Well, bang-for-your-buck this one really scores HIGH.  The gameplay is pretty similar to that of the 'Democracy' series (all buttons and sliders) but still somehow manages to achieve the just-one-more-turn effect that makes the 'Civilization' series so notorious.  Despite being fairly repetative, you still find yourself replaying the game several times to unlock all the genres and find the perfect combos...and get that awkward-as-hell 11/10 review for your Cop/Puzzle Adventure game...Recommended price: anything under £6.99			"

It's a good little indie game, especially with how incredibly ridiculous you can make the game. For a good record, how about naming a company organic butts and making every game you make have butts in the title? That's exactly what I did, and you can do that too. I'd recommend it as a game to play from beginning to end, as it really emphisizes creativity and flexability. So give this one a shot, I think you'd like it a lot.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is an Indie Game worth to play. It was often compared with Game Dev Story for iOS / Android and yes, there are overlaps but this doesn't make the game bad. It has some bugs and after 10 - 15 hours there's nothing more to see or explore but it makes fun until then. It's definitely worth the low price.			"

												Reminded me of the mobile game ""Game Dev Story"" by Kairosoft. The developer certainly took inspiration from that, but also added something more. Sometimes a clone game can be terrible, but sometimes, like with this game, the clone is far better than the original. If you want to know how game development works and how much work goes into it, you will appreciate games, in general, more. You will write less angry reviews and won't be mean on the forums about it.

												One of the best tycoon/simulation games around. I can't recommend this game enough to anyone who's into such games. It's a relatively simple game, but it's pretty addicting once you get into it.You can not only make your own games (there's a variety of genres that you can mix and match to your heart's delight; even more with the Steam Workshop) but your own game consoles (even more of them too with Steam Workshop) as well. You can even make your own version of Steam in game.From a humble setting (a garage in the 1980s), this game offers you the chance to forge your own way through gaming history and I've had a blast doing exactly that.Whether full price or on sale, I wholly recommend getting this game.And Greenheart, I saw your thank you message in game. You're very welcome.			"

												This game, this game really brings me back. It reminds me of my dream to be a developer for video games. On the other hand, it reminds that will never happen. Whenever I see that I've wasted millions of dollars on an awful game, I FEEL the impact. Even if you only lose 100 fans and you have over 1200 of them, you feel dreadful. That's what I like about this game. It has feeling even if it's a game with no actual story. It's made something so brilliant I can't understand it. In conclusion, this game is one the THE BEST games on steam and you can really tell that the developers TIME, EFFORT, and MONEY into the game. Usually, you only hear about the money part of those three. So yes, this game IS great. Go buy it.			"

												Truly a great game for that price!I made hit games like ""The Caves of Satan (Dungeon/RPG)"" or ""Space Death (Space/Adventure)"".The market simulation and the historic events are awesome! I wish there were chances to give the games you develop more creative input, like designing the box of the game or the cover, or at least a brief description, you just can name the game and set the type though.Also you have the developing process to focuss on different parts of the game.I consider this a must-buy for fans of the genre!

												     Game Dev Tycoon , bir oyun yapma simulasyonudur.Oyuna Eski bir bilgisayar ve kendi evimizin garajında başlıyoruz.Ama tabikide hep aynı yerde oyun yapmıyoruz.Oyuna başladığımızda belli bir miktar paramız oluyor, oyüzden hemen bir ofise geçemiyoruz.Bir ofise geçmemiz içinse 2M veya daha fazla para isteniyor.Bu miktarda bir para gözünüzü korkutmasın.Para nasıl mı kazanılıyor dersiniz ? :     Oyunda çeşitli konular ile çeşitli oyun türleri var.Bizim oyundaki amacımız ise bu ikisini güzel bir kombinasyon haline getirerek ortaya güzel bir oyun çıkarmak.Eğer doğru kombinasyonu tutturabilirseniz sıra geldi platform seçmeye , oyuna ilk başladığımızda platform olarak sadece G64 ve PC var.Hemen endişelenmeyin ! Oyunda İlerlediğinizde xBox, Playstation , Nintendo Wii ve benzeri markaların konsolları da açılıyor.Ama dediğim gibi ; İlerleyen zamanlarda... Bu platformlar yayınlandığında ise karşınıza büyük bir sorun çıkıyor,bu platformların lisansı her bir konsol için ayrı lisans satın almanız gerekiyor.(Bu arada lisans demişken bu oyun , bu oyunun yapımcısı olan GreenHearts'ın ilk oyunu olduğu için oyunda ne xBox'ın ne Nintendo'nun ne de Playstation'ın lisansı var.Ama GreenHearts telif yememek için xBox'u mBox , Nintendo'yu Ninvento , Playstation'ı ise Playsystem olarak isimlendirmişler.)şimdi gelelim oyumuzun ilk yapılış aşamasına :     1.Aşama : İlk aşamamızda motor,oynanış ve hikaye isimli 3 tane bar çıkıyor.Biz ise seçtiğimiz oyun türüne göre bu barları yukarı veya aşağı çekiyoruz.Örn :Bir simulasyon oyununda oynanış önemliyse onu yukarı doğru çekiyoruz.Tüm barları doğru koyduğunuza inanıyorsanız ''tamam'' a tıklayıp biraz beklemeniz gerekli.Çünkü tamam a tıkladıktan sonra adamınız seçtiğiniz barlara göre çalışmakta olacaktır(Merak etmeyin çok uzun sürmüyor.)     2.Aşama: Bu aşamada ise yine 3 tane bar karşımıza çıkıyor.Fakat bu barların isimleri farklı , diyaloglar , bölüm tasarımı ve yapay zeka. Yine bu barlarıda arttırıp azaltıyorsunuz.Örn: Bir aksiyon oyununda yapay zeka önemliyse onu yukarı çekin.Tüm barları ayarladığınızda yine ''tamam''a basıp bir süre adamınızın o barlara göre oyunu tasarlamasını bekliyoruz.     3.Aşama: Bu aşamadaki barlar ise , dünya tasarımı , grafik ve ses.Burada da barları yukarı veya aşşağı çekerek vericeğimiz zamanı değerlendiriyoruz.Örn :Bir aksiyon oyununda grafik önemli ise onu yukarı çekiceksiniz.Bunları ayarladıktan sonra yine ''tamam''a basıp devam ediyorsunuz.Ve oyununuz hazır ! 3.Aşamayıda yaptıktan sonra karşınıza bir ekran çıkıyor ve 2 seçenek beliriyor : Çöp kutusuna at veya oyunu yayınla.Siz oyuna yeni başladığınız için tabikide oyunu yayınla seçeneğini seçiceksiniz.Vee oyununuz yayınlandı ! Oyununuzu yayınladıktan bir ekran beliriyor sonra yaptığınız kombinasyona ve barlardaki yukarı aşağı seçimlerinize göre 4 adet oyun profesyoneli veya dergisi(artık ne diyorsanız) oyununuza 10 üzerinden bir puan veriyor.Aldığınız puanların ortalamasına göre oyununuzun satışlarıda değişiyor.Örneğin hepsinden 10 puan aldığınız bir oyunla , hepsinden 5 aldığınız oyunun satışları arasından bir hayli fark oluyor.     Oyun hakkında anlatılacak daha çok şey var fakat çok fazla şey yazdım.Oyüzden burada bitiriyorum.Eğer oyunla ilgili sorunlarınız veya bilmek istediğiniz şeyler varsa bana mesaj atarak ulaşabilirsiniz.Ve oyunu almak hakkında tereddüte düştüyseniz hiç tereddüt etmeden alın.Verdiğimiz paranın her kuruşunu hakeden bir oyun ! İncelemem hoşunuza gittiyse ve oyun hakkında ufakta olsa bir fikir edindiyseniz ne mutlu bana... İyi Oyunlar !			"

												This game is friggin' ADDICTING!!! I get lost for hours upon hours and it stays fun and exciting the entire time, the visuals are cute and simple but the core of this game is what makes it one of best PC games I've ever played, it truely is the pinnacle of how fancy graphics are not needed to make a perfect game. I grew up with Atari, Apple II, Commedore 64, NES, SEGA, etc.etc. so this game just pours on the nostolgia with the sounds and style plus the hilarious alternative universe gaming console lineup for you to develop on, create your own world at your own pace and develop games you always wanted or you can play it like real history, pretend you were on the ground floor of Valve, Sega, Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft, create the top games of all time and see how filthy rich you can get while having a blast + training your brain all at the same time!I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this game, instant classic and one of my all time favorite games.11/10 - it's that good!

												I enjoyed this game a lot. There are a few annoyances here and there, some rough edges, but you really feel love for your own little game company. The game makes you care about your brave hero, who start his(her) carreer from basement and paves the road higher up, changing the game(and world) history in the end. But sometimes i've got really upset trying to browse through my game history or trying to click ""Finish"" in time, before last week of the month ends and i'll get bankrupt. Sliders are not the best friend of accuracy and clicking each staff member to give him his vacation could be a very tiring process at times. That's why i Would only give it 7.5/10 and hope for a bigger and better sequel)			"

The only real mechanic is combining the right parameters when launching your game, whereas they could have made it a much deeper game by adding more mechanics (other than marketing, which feels gimmicky).Still worth a play... but not if you're looking for more than ten hours of gameplay.

												I struggled a lot with whether or not to recommend this game.  It is nothing that it doesn't claim to be, but that was exactly the problem for me.  Ultimately, I settled on ""no"" simply because there is absolutely no replay value, and the gameplay is a mindless grind-fest.Your decisions have minimal impact on the course you take through the game (short of making totally stupid decisions that bankrupt your company -- if you have half a brain, that won't ever happen).  The gameplay an hour or two into the game is exactly the same as it is in the first ten minutes.  None of the content you unlock as you progress was enough to hold my interest; they're more or less just reskins of existing content.  The endgame mechanics are nearly identical to the early game mechanics, just with more staff, more fans, and more revenue.If you like that kind of repetitive zen-ish gameplay then this game might be for you, but even at $10 I don't feel like this game is worth it.  I played it one time for a few hours, and there's nothing whatsoever that makes me want to play it again.  There are far better tycoon/simulation games more deserving of your time.			"

I don't know what games I like anymore. I do know that I like this game.After finishing download, I started a game and focused one the cyberpunk genre. Quickly the gaming community embraced my love of poop themed action games. Before I knew it, I had a team of 5 and ShizenSoft had taken off into a multi-million dollar development company.I wanted to make games when I was a kid, I thought it would be fun. After getting to know some people in the industry, I learned that I love the industry too much to allow being a part of it to ruin me. Greenhart games, thank you for making a game that kept this ""old man"" up until 1am, dreaming about what it would have been like. You guys are a class act - you made me smile and brought back many fond memories. Well, untill my team went bankrupt and Stynga bought us - you guys suck after that.			"

												Every now and again a game comes along that, on the surface, looks and feels both primitive and simple. Yet, scratch away beneath that nostalgic sugar-coating, and you begin to unearth a hidden depth to the game and unlock a colossal time-sink that will occupy you for days and days. Minecraft is a good example of this phenomenon, with its retro looks and simple goal of survival. So too is Game Dev Tycoon.The premise is simple; you're a  budding game developer of the 80's, working from your garage, and all you have to do is keep making games, and therefore, money.You start out with the most basic of technology and a few topics to get you started. Over time you'll be able to create your own game engine, and create bigger and better games. Before you know it, you'll be into a proper office where you'll be able to hire staff to help you with bigger and better projects, and market your new game to create hype and therefore, sales. The game follows a fairly loose real-time-line of computer history (missing out on the Amiga though, which is nearly unforgivable!), releasing new gaming devices and technology along the way. You'll decide which platform to release to, experiment with different concepts and topics. Towards the endgame dominating the markets with your own cutting-edge technology and AAA games will be your primary goal. You can set a game to last 35 years, but you're not restricted by that. That limit is only to let you know the game isn't keeping score anymore. You'll want to carry on regardless and continue in your quest to control the world. This game is that compulsive. I have a save game that's now into it's 150th year, which with it's fanbase and regular MMO releases is bringing in over £25 billion a year!Regardless, once you've played through once, you'll want to do it again. Only this time better, and in pursuit of the fabled 11/10 review score. Which means experimenting with new topics and combos, and making sure your team are not only up to the task, but well refreshed.Staff training is just as important, too. Getting the stats up to spec of all your staff, and most importantly, yourself, is paramount. High stats unlock specializations which greatly improve your games, and are the only way to create truly successful AAA games.Graphically, you're looking at a flash game, pretty much. The only real animation you'll see is the popping of little coloured bubbles as you create a new game, complete a contract or generate research points. Again, though, the sound of the popping of coloured bubbles is instantly absorbing and before you know it, you're galavanting through the valleys of bubble-wrap therapy, and six hours have passed you by.This is a game that requires a bit of a sit-down and a few hours thrown at it in order to get to grips with the surprisingly deep game mechanics, but actively wants you to keep scratching away at the apparently nostalgic, sugar-coated surface, and discover the treasures it keeps below.For the money, I can't recommend this game enough.   85%			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a pretty cool videogame, the concept of the game is ULTRA original.I wish create a company someday, but why wait If I can do it RIGHT NOW with this amazing game.All the aspects of the game are really well considered, seems like the creators investigated a lot about videogames and how the critics would react in front of any kind of videogame.The game makes you travel on space and time, you see the launching of all those old consoles that you used to play when you were a little kid, and not just that, you CREATE those games for the generation of that time, It makes me feel really good.The administrative part it's so smart as well. You are constantly growing up with your employees during all the game, they learn new and usefull things and become more experienced in different areas.In my opinion 8/10 game.			"

												Better than Game Dev Story, the amount of fun you'll get out of this game depends on either your tolerance for failure/restarting, or how willing you'll be to keep the game's wiki loaded on your second montior. Figuring out the basics for a successful game in this simuation can be a bit taxing, but if you're willing to stick it out, the game becomes QUITE fun.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a hidden gem within the indie genre, incorporating a large amount of cool and innovative features coupled wiht a bit of gaming history in the process. The game starts you off in a small garage around the year 1980 when video gaming really first began, from there you slowly begin to make games and build your reputation. You get to choose the genre of game, how much time you want to put into areas such as 'Gameplay, Graphics and Sound' and then produce it and recieve a review. Your reviews will govern how much income you generate, making too many badly recieved games will eventually cause you to go bankrupt how ever recieveing a 9 or 10 can see your profit skyrocket. As your small company grows and expands you will have the opportunity to create your own gaming engine, company marketing and even your own console. Furthermore in the later stages of the game you can hire staff and assign them certain roles which is crucial when developing later AAA Games. Game Dev Tycoon took me around 4 hours to do a complete playthrough, that is having a company worth over $400,000,000, however there is quite a large amount of replayability on offer. Overall I do believe this was a fun and innovative indie game and is well the worth $10 (or under).8/10.			"

												The storyline is quite short. Some events could be randomized to create and endless loop to prevent new platforms from coming to existence.I highly enjoyed the concept of the game but there is still room for improvement.I really missed a start screen: You get tossed right into the game with an explanation how to get into the menu. There was also a lack of explanation of how some elements influenced the game.It does show a lot of potential and I they will continue working on it.However some of the shortcomings I have mentoined here. I found the game highly enjoyable with a great sense of strategy. Taking risks and dealing with failure and great successes.			"

												While GDT is entertaining, you can expect little more than the original Kairosoft version in terms of gameplay, plot (such as it is), and graphics. It's still as entertaining as ever, so fans of the original game that would like a more modernized and slightly more complex gameplay will be happy.However, if the original game didn't appeal to you, there's little else here that might change your mind.

												The focus of the game may sound crazy - running a game development company, but this is one highly addictive game.  So many factors involved that can make your new game turn out to be a dud despite how many features and money you spend in development.  Getting the right combination and seeing your game make millions is very satisfying. If you like games like Civilization or SimCity, you will love the depth of decision making in this game. Highly recommend picking up this game, especially at the current price.			"

												This game is enjoyable for it's genre. While playing, you, the creator of your own game development studio needs to work your way up to the development of big titles. Starting in the 80's with limited platforms on which to create games, as time goes on you take a trip down memory lane, creating titles to be released on parody consoles that mirror those that seem like a distant memory now. As far as a tychoon game goes, this one is addictive and forces you to be mindful of the components that run your business (such as althernate ways to earn income) as well as being strategic. The hardest part of this game is knowing what genres work best on what platforms, and for what audience. It's also tough because you need to consistently research new information and techniques to further develop your marketing skills and create new engines to release your games on. While tricky at points, this game is still enjoy able and will definitely find a way to take up all your time for an evening if you're not careful.			"

												This game was a pleasant surprise for me. I saw my friend playing it and it looked pretty fun. It was on sale so I bought it and I've now played it so many hours. It's great for an indie game. It follows gaming history (and since I'd taken a class on History of Gaming in art school, I was able to use my industry knowledge to know which systems to invest in and which to avoid and it was all true to real life history) and it's just a fun experience. I recommend it with a solid 9 out of 10 stars for being such a big surprise to me and for being fun for more hours than I expected and keeping me interested in playing a second and third play-through. Great job!			"

Your garage started, small business grows, beyond your compehension. You are vaguely able to control the thing. Then you loose track of every single emplyee under your command. If they are realy members of creative team or are thery just bringing a cofee?Here the fun begins after earning first million or so. Here you are given chance to try and fail and start over again. The simulation is much simplified, but realistic as far as it can get. I loved the game!			"

You come up with a genre and subject and a title.Thats pretty much at the start, but as time progresses it becomes more and more developed, choosing engines and staff. Even late game get to develop your own consoles.Mix in a little marketing and other odd bits thrown in there, and it's a game of making games.Overall gameplay, music and sounds are probably going to get repetative.

												So recently, I went on a buying binge for Steam games, and I accidentally bought Game Dev Tycoon amongst everything. Initially, I saw my mistake as just that; a mistake and I had no intention of actually playing this game, me being a natural hater of Tycoon games. After a few days of seeing the name in my Library, I finally relented and played it. And I'm really glad I did. The fact I could make up whatever games I wanted, with whatever company I wanted, and smile smugly to myself when they racked over ten million sales, or feel disappointed when they crashed and burned. The history that has been researched for game consoles made me smile, because it tells me the developers of this game put some actual thought into their design process; a trait that seems absent these days (You know who you are). The game starts with giving you a choice of what to call your company, and what to name your character. So, me being me, I called my company ""Rainbow Slot Machine"" and my character ""Red Reno"". I had four game topics to choose from initially, and two platforms. Assuming I was in the 80s, because I didn't read the tutorial my first try, I decided to make an Action Business game called ""Stock Syndrome"". I was shocked, however, when my game scored a 2.25. I thought it was a good idea. Then I tried a different tactic, and made a Fantasy RPG, which people seemed to like more, giving me an 8.75. However, I was so bad at judging what types of games people would like, I eventually ran my company into the ground on the second level, with bad publishing deals and hiring too many people. And so I tried again.THIS TIME I actually read the tutorial, and I started to understand how the game worked. THIS TIME, I had seven successful franchises, two MMOs and a console, until I decided to just make bad decisions again and run my company into the ground... again.The game is a great creation in my eyes, allowing freedom of choice in every area of a game's creation, who to hire and whether or not to be a ""good"" game developer or an ""evil"" game developer (*cough* EA *unconvincing cough*). The game's art is nice, considering the type of game, and, as stated before, you can really feel the developers put some work into this. I, being a hater of most Tycoon games, am surprised I actually recommend this.			"

												*English Version below. Keep in mind, that I'm not that good at speaking English, but I hope it's okay for you.*Game Dev Tycoon, was mache ich nur mit dir? In Game Dev Tycoon könnt ihr die Historie der Spieleentwicklung erneut miterleben. Ihr seid ein Programmierer, der in seiner Garage beginnt, Spiele zu entwickeln, sich hocharbeitet, eigene Spiele-Engines entwickeln und schließlich eine Firma mit bis zu fünf Angestellten besitzt. Ihr könnt im LateGame auch eigene Konsolen entwerfen oder einen Online-Dienst anbieten.Ausschlaggebend für euren Erfolg ist die Qualität der Spiele, wenn sie richtig gut sind muss auch die Frequenz der Releases nicht allzu hoch sein, da ein guter Titel sehr schnell sehr viele Einnahmen bescheren kann. Das Spiel ist in einem humorvollen Stil gehalten, was auch die einfache, comichafte Grafik wiederspiegelt. Da die Entwickler von Game Dev Tycoon anscheinend nicht das Geld für Lizenzen der großen Spielehersteller bzw. Hardwarehersteller hatten, entwickelt ihr beispielsweise später im Spiel Games für die mBox oder das PlaySystem. Diese Anspielungen sind durchwegs lustig und haben mir immer wieder ein Lächeln auf die Lippen gezaubert.Doch nun zu der Core-Mechanik von Game Dev Tycoon, und diese ist der Grund, warum ich mich nicht entscheiden kann, ob es gut oder schlecht ist: die Spieleentwicklung. Der einzige Weg, ein Spiel zu entwickeln, ist, indem ihr jeweils drei Balken so verschiebt, wie es euch passt, wobei euch das Spiel nie genau sagt, was wofür zuständig ist. Wo liegt beispielsweise der unterschied zwischen Graphic und World Design? Ist beides eine ""Design-Category""? Oder doch ""Technical""? Auch die Reviews, die eure Spiele bekommen, geben darüber nicht wirklich Aufschluss, und ihr könnt zwar sogenannte ""Game Reports"" erstellen, allerdings bringen auch diese nur bedingt einen Vorteil. So wisst ihr dann zwar, dass zum Beispiel Action und Military oder Dungeon und RPG gut zusammenpasst, oder dass für eines dieser Spiele die Dialoge sehr wichtig ist, allerdings kennt ihr dennoch nicht die genaue Zusammensetzung, und so ist es manchmal fast mehr Trial&Error als Spaß.Mich persönlich haben diese Negativpunkte aber nie wirklich massiv gestört, so dass für mich das Spiel immer noch Spaß gemacht hat. Ob derartige Probleme für einen das Spiel vermiesen oder nicht, muss jeder selbst wissen.So kann ich zu guter letzt nur sagen: Wenn euch die von mir angesprochenen negativen Aspekte nicht allzu stören (ja, es klingt absurd, ein Spieleentwicklungs-spiel in dem das Spieleentwickeln die Schwachstelle ist^^), und ihr so wie ich mit den positiven so eine Freude habt, dass diese dafür aufwiegen, schaut euch Game Dev Tycoon unbedingt an. Vor allem in einem Sale ist es richtig günstig zu haben, allerdings können die ganz Enthusiastischen unter euch auch beim Normalpreis bedenkenlos zuschlagen.*****Game Dev Tycoon, what do I think of you...?In Game Dev Tycoon you can take part in the history of gaming and replay it. You are a programmer, who starts to make games in his garage, then works his way up, starts to create custom engines, and ends up having up to five employees and being one of the big players in gaming developement. In late game, you can even create your own online-device or launch your very own console.To be sucessfull, you've got to develope good games. In case you manage to make really good ones, you don't need to publish a new game every five minutes, only a few will be enough, but if you're games aren't too good... EA knows what I'm talking about. :PThe game is in a humerous and funny style, which is supported by the comic-like graphics. Another funny thing is, that the developers of Game Dev Tycoon probably hadn't had the money for licenses, so later on you develope games for consoles such as the mBox and the PlaySystem. This was something I really enjoyed.But now, let's step into the core-mechanics of Game Dev Tycoon, and this is the reason why I can'T decide wether I like the game or not, wether it's good or bad: developing games. You can only develope a game by moving the kind of bars, which represent one aspect of game-developement. But there's a problem with those, because they aren't well explained. For example: What's the difference between Graphic and World Design? Is both to put into the ""Design-Topic""? Or is it the technical part? Or something totally different?Furthermore, when your game is reviewed, you don't get any more real information about what was good or bad (mainly meaning the bars). Well, you can create a game report, but they don't tell you too much either. For example, they might have you know that Action and Military or Dungeon and RPG are a good combination, or that for a certain game Dialogues are more important than for another, but they don't tell much, so in some cases it's more Trial&Error than fun.For me, the negative points haven't been too bad, so I still had fun with the game, but if you think of buying the game, you have to decide yourself. I'm not saying it's super good or super bad, it has it's qualities and shortcomings, but you'll have to decide yourself, wether it could still be fun or not.Finally, there's nothing more to say than this: If you don't care to much about the negative points (yuhurr, it's sounding absurd, a game about developing games where the game-developing part is the shortcoming^^), and you still think like you could have fun with Game Dev Tycoon, go, take a look at it. But I'd recommend buying it in one of the Steam Sales, it's pretty cheap them, but if you're really enthusiasthic, you can also go and buy it straight right now.			"

												What can be said about Game Dev Tycoon that has not already been said. The core gameplay of Game Dev Tycoon is similar to that of other tycoon games in the sense that you're out there trying to make a fortune, and what a better way than starting your own videogame company? You start in your garage, and watch as the game consols we grew up with pop up on the market, and develop for them. As time progresses, and you amass your fortune, you can move to larger and larger facilities, and hire more staff. Along the way, you research newer game engines, new topics, and even completly new ideas with your R&D department, such as project grid. I wont say anymore, as I dont want to spoil the entire experience, but I will say this. This is a game made by gamers, for gamers. Greenheart hit this one out of the park, and everything from the core game, to the smallest reference, is spot on, and I can definatly reccomend it as such.			"

												It's 2:30am, you're in your basement punching away at your keyboard on your very first game. $100 million worth of sales later and you're the new hot shot dev house!This is a neat little indie game by Greenheart Games in which you have your own game development company with the end goal of becoming the most successful company the industry has ever seen! When you start off, the types of games and genres you can make are pretty limited, however, as you progress more and more genres unlock. Earn insane sales records by mixing genres and gameplay to their most suitable platform. By the end of it you're a multi-genre/multi platform giant! This game is really neat, as not only does it offer you the freedom of creating your own video games, but it actually gives you a history lesson on the video game industry as you progress.Pick up this game to kill a few hours, and watch yourself rinsing several days on it!

												This game would be amazing if it had a few more features such as instead of a marketing button that appears every time you make a game you should have a marketing team where you can market your company, consoles, games, and engines and the more money you put into it the more fans your company should have. Also you should be able to reboot games and not be penilazied for making to similar of a game. with these and more the game would be awesome			"

												I use to not really be in to games like this.  When I heard about Game Dev Tycoon, I added it to my wishlist because I wanted to see how it was.  It finally came on sale during the Winter Sales, and along with almost 30 other games, I bought it.  It took me a while before I decided to download it, and an hour into the game, I realized it was a mistake to wait that long.  I am actually the co-writer and a voice actor of one of my friends' projects they are woking on.  I've always been interested by video games.  After starting it, I see you start with 5 genres and 4 or so types of games.  You had to do research to unlock more genres.  There was also the very immersive engine builder.  It covered soooooo many things that you would actually have had to do if you were building your own engine.  But most of all, my favorite part of this game is the extreme care and precision in following gaming history.  All of the consoles are based off of the game consoles we've actually had, along with accurate facts for each and every one of them.  While they are missing some game consoles (like the NeoGeo), the developers covered everything important.Since this is actually realistic and tailored with real gaming history, I will add that rating as well.Gaming History Friendly-9.5/10Detail of the In Game Mechanics-9.5/10Realism-8.5/10Graphics-N/A (not applicable) | N/I (not important).  Yes, this is actually one of those games where graphics don't matter.  Accordingly, I won't factor in Graphics to the final rating.Music-6/10Replay Value-9/10Overall Value-8.5Recommended buy price-$12 USD or cheaper.  Worth the price.Note: I do not recommend modding this game, though it is supported.  Beware that installing/uninstalling mods can corrupt your data.  They also really don't help enhance the game, either. "

												This game is enjoyable for it's genre. While playing, you, the creator of your own game development studio needs to work your way up to the development of big titles. Starting in the 80's with limited platforms on which to create games, as time goes on you take a trip down memory lane, creating titles to be released on parody consoles that mirror those that seem like a distant memory now. As far as a tychoon game goes, this one is addictive and forces you to be mindful of the components that run your business (such as althernate ways to earn income) as well as being strategic. The hardest part of this game is knowing what genres work best on what platforms, and for what audience. It's also tough because you need to consistently research new information and techniques to further develop your marketing skills and create new engines to release your games on. While tricky at points, this game is still enjoy able and will definitely find a way to take up all your time for an evening if you're not careful.			"

												*English Version below. Keep in mind, that I'm not that good at speaking English, but I hope it's okay for you.*Game Dev Tycoon, was mache ich nur mit dir? In Game Dev Tycoon könnt ihr die Historie der Spieleentwicklung erneut miterleben. Ihr seid ein Programmierer, der in seiner Garage beginnt, Spiele zu entwickeln, sich hocharbeitet, eigene Spiele-Engines entwickeln und schließlich eine Firma mit bis zu fünf Angestellten besitzt. Ihr könnt im LateGame auch eigene Konsolen entwerfen oder einen Online-Dienst anbieten.Ausschlaggebend für euren Erfolg ist die Qualität der Spiele, wenn sie richtig gut sind muss auch die Frequenz der Releases nicht allzu hoch sein, da ein guter Titel sehr schnell sehr viele Einnahmen bescheren kann. Das Spiel ist in einem humorvollen Stil gehalten, was auch die einfache, comichafte Grafik wiederspiegelt. Da die Entwickler von Game Dev Tycoon anscheinend nicht das Geld für Lizenzen der großen Spielehersteller bzw. Hardwarehersteller hatten, entwickelt ihr beispielsweise später im Spiel Games für die mBox oder das PlaySystem. Diese Anspielungen sind durchwegs lustig und haben mir immer wieder ein Lächeln auf die Lippen gezaubert.Doch nun zu der Core-Mechanik von Game Dev Tycoon, und diese ist der Grund, warum ich mich nicht entscheiden kann, ob es gut oder schlecht ist: die Spieleentwicklung. Der einzige Weg, ein Spiel zu entwickeln, ist, indem ihr jeweils drei Balken so verschiebt, wie es euch passt, wobei euch das Spiel nie genau sagt, was wofür zuständig ist. Wo liegt beispielsweise der unterschied zwischen Graphic und World Design? Ist beides eine ""Design-Category""? Oder doch ""Technical""? Auch die Reviews, die eure Spiele bekommen, geben darüber nicht wirklich Aufschluss, und ihr könnt zwar sogenannte ""Game Reports"" erstellen, allerdings bringen auch diese nur bedingt einen Vorteil. So wisst ihr dann zwar, dass zum Beispiel Action und Military oder Dungeon und RPG gut zusammenpasst, oder dass für eines dieser Spiele die Dialoge sehr wichtig ist, allerdings kennt ihr dennoch nicht die genaue Zusammensetzung, und so ist es manchmal fast mehr Trial&Error als Spaß.Mich persönlich haben diese Negativpunkte aber nie wirklich massiv gestört, so dass für mich das Spiel immer noch Spaß gemacht hat. Ob derartige Probleme für einen das Spiel vermiesen oder nicht, muss jeder selbst wissen.So kann ich zu guter letzt nur sagen: Wenn euch die von mir angesprochenen negativen Aspekte nicht allzu stören (ja, es klingt absurd, ein Spieleentwicklungs-spiel in dem das Spieleentwickeln die Schwachstelle ist^^), und ihr so wie ich mit den positiven so eine Freude habt, dass diese dafür aufwiegen, schaut euch Game Dev Tycoon unbedingt an. Vor allem in einem Sale ist es richtig günstig zu haben, allerdings können die ganz Enthusiastischen unter euch auch beim Normalpreis bedenkenlos zuschlagen.*****Game Dev Tycoon, what do I think of you...?In Game Dev Tycoon you can take part in the history of gaming and replay it. You are a programmer, who starts to make games in his garage, then works his way up, starts to create custom engines, and ends up having up to five employees and being one of the big players in gaming developement. In late game, you can even create your own online-device or launch your very own console.To be sucessfull, you've got to develope good games. In case you manage to make really good ones, you don't need to publish a new game every five minutes, only a few will be enough, but if you're games aren't too good... EA knows what I'm talking about. :PThe game is in a humerous and funny style, which is supported by the comic-like graphics. Another funny thing is, that the developers of Game Dev Tycoon probably hadn't had the money for licenses, so later on you develope games for consoles such as the mBox and the PlaySystem. This was something I really enjoyed.But now, let's step into the core-mechanics of Game Dev Tycoon, and this is the reason why I can'T decide wether I like the game or not, wether it's good or bad: developing games. You can only develope a game by moving the kind of bars, which represent one aspect of game-developement. But there's a problem with those, because they aren't well explained. For example: What's the difference between Graphic and World Design? Is both to put into the ""Design-Topic""? Or is it the technical part? Or something totally different?Furthermore, when your game is reviewed, you don't get any more real information about what was good or bad (mainly meaning the bars). Well, you can create a game report, but they don't tell you too much either. For example, they might have you know that Action and Military or Dungeon and RPG are a good combination, or that for a certain game Dialogues are more important than for another, but they don't tell much, so in some cases it's more Trial&Error than fun.For me, the negative points haven't been too bad, so I still had fun with the game, but if you think of buying the game, you have to decide yourself. I'm not saying it's super good or super bad, it has it's qualities and shortcomings, but you'll have to decide yourself, wether it could still be fun or not.Finally, there's nothing more to say than this: If you don't care to much about the negative points (yuhurr, it's sounding absurd, a game about developing games where the game-developing part is the shortcoming^^), and you still think like you could have fun with Game Dev Tycoon, go, take a look at it. But I'd recommend buying it in one of the Steam Sales, it's pretty cheap them, but if you're really enthusiasthic, you can also go and buy it straight right now.			"

It's absolutely awesome, I can't stop playing it.I mostly play it offline, but i played something like 24hrs in 4 days.If you're still unsure, just download the demo from their website and you'll see!

												My origional review said how enjoyable this game was and that it had some replay value, but I wouldn't play it for years. Years later I am still playing it!It's just a really good game. If you like computer games (which clearly you do) and enjoy tycoon games, just get this. It's not super deep, but it's a heck of a lot of fun. Highly recommended, especially right now since it's on sale!			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is one of those games that makes me wish there was a ""Maybe"" button in Steam reviews. It's not a bad game, but it's really not all that great. It's just that it happens to fill a very, very specific niche reasonably competently. If you've played the mobile game Game Dev Story, then you more or less know what you're in for. It's nearly exactly that game with some stuff rearranged or expanded.As biz sims go, this one is very laid back. It's not too terribly difficult, there isn't a lot to keep track of, and your goals are straight forward and repetitive. That said, if you don't mind the casual experience, what you get in return is a video game about making video games. For me, the novelty there was enough to warrant playing it. But if you're looking for a sim with any real depth, look elsewhere.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a simple game that is far from perfect but is a good way to spend a few hours.You can develop games for consoles from the early 80's to the future which is pretty sweet.It is hard to master getting perfect ratings for your games as you will have to learn what type games work best on which console, which audience is best, and the best balance between graphics, sound and gameplay.After the games 35 year end point you can continue playing, unlocking things and perfecting your games but after that it gets boring after 40-50yrs depending on how well you're doing.It took me roughly 3 days to level up my character and employees to level 10, unlock everything and get all the achievements. It was fun and enjoyable but after the 20 hour mark it did get a bit boring and repetitive but the game is moddable and people have expanded upon and improved the game which is great for another couple of hours.Is it worth buying?that depends... if you want a simple sim to keep you entertained for a weekend then yes.if you want something that will give you months of enjoyment you're probably best trying another game.

												This game is a truly amazing game for it's value, with lots of vanilla gameplay (8 hours) and hours more of modding and improving the game. While you might be disappointed by the lackluster gameplay towards the very end, the beginning and middle ramp up in difficulty easily and fluidly, and you never feel like you don't understand what's going on, but you do sometimes not know what to do.Will you sabotage your competitior for money, but risk the potential of it coming back to you? Or will you decide to keep your current outdated security system, and leave your building at risk?Though the game has lots of fun decisions and aspect, it also has a few issues as I've mentioned. Firstly, there's only about 3 generic soundtracks playing throughout the entire game and secondly the game at the end of it's scenarios and natural gameplay becomes unbelievably boring vanilla, and mods only fix this slightly.In all, Game Dev Tycoon is an interesting change from the average FPS or strategy. I feel like it's a natural evolution of the F2P games on mobile, with much more rewards and much less waiting, in exchange for less time to play.My score: 7.5/10 "

What really sold me was that the developers really wanted to educate the player about how hard, heartbreaking and exhilarating game development can be, as well teach about the history of the video game history, culture and community, while still being entertaining.It may be a bit difficult and confusing at the beginning, but after 1 or 2 games you slowly find out what you are supposed to do.And now you can also add mods, if the vanilla base game is not exciting enough for you! :DHUGELY recommended.

												A simple, yet powerfully addicting tycoon game about game design. The game starts with a single character designing games out of a garage and eventually progresses to owning a multi-million dollar game design company with multiple employees to help with the process as projects become more advanced. Highly recommended for anybody who is a fan of tycoon games or anyone who would simply like a break from the fast-paced gaming world of titles such as Call of Duty or Battlefield. This game also is a Steam Workshop title, which means there are player-creations/mods coming out all the time, which could enhance the game-play or add additional features to spice things up. Hours of fun!			"

												This is one of my FAVORITE business sim games. This isn't perfect, but for a first outing from this studio, they did a phenominal job. Pros: Rewarding entrepreneurship sim. It feels great to hire the right people and see your products get great reviews year after year. In some very important ways, this is the best entrepreneurship simulator on the market. It's challenging. I got cocky and without realizing it began bankrupting my first company. The second time around I hired more slowly and trained my people and kept a constant reserve of chash to keep my boat afloat but there were still times when my account would go from being millions of dollars in the black to being more than 100k in the red. They do a good job of rewarding ethical opperators. Your fans will thank you for making a product with them in mind and not being like some of the more infamous large studios in the real world. (not to mention any names *Cough* EA *Cough*)Cons:The years are too short and the time between consol generations are inconsistant. I would like to see this game take a solid 25 or more real world hours to go through the 35 in game years. The art is inconsistent (look at the art for the game sphere vs the playsystem) I would love to see them come out with a longer, more polished and balanced sequel. I know I'll support it.  "

												I had submitted a review for Game Dev Tycoon more than a year ago. The game has gone through a lot of changes, and I have learned a lot more while I have kept playing it. For this reason, I have decided to update my review and make it more extended.First of all, I think Game Dev Tycoon will keep expanding and growing, it's a game that shows a lot of potential. Since Game Dev Tycoon implemented Steam Workshop it has evolved a lot, especially via the ability to create and utilize mods to modify the average experience. I believe Game Dev Tycoon will continue to evolve, progress and attract more people to buy it over time because of Steam Workshop and updates done by the developers.To continue, I wish to say this was Greenheart Games' first game. Seriously, these people deserve a round of applause! This is a truly amazing game that most companies can't pull off, especially as their first game. I am excited to see what Greenheart comes up with in the future; I know it'll be just as great as Game Dev Tycoon, perhaps even greater! Following these statements, I would also like to point out that I haven't noticed a single bug in this whole game, and I've played it a lot! The game runs very smoothly in my computer and all of its artwork is stunningly beautiful! All the consoles, all the names, all news, it is noticable a massive amount of effort was put into each of these aspects to make the game as marvelous as it is.Finally, I would like to higlight tha fact this game is super easy to understand! You can be a gamer, as you may be a non-gamer and enjoy this game. That's why I recommend this game to each and every Steam player; especially newcomers who haven't bought a single game. I am sure Game Dev Tycoon will continue to be a massive success, like it has been so far.			"

												An addictive and fun game that focuses more on the development of the games than the business side of running a company. A simple and helpful interface and straightfoward goal along with the rather realistic random events and procedures all help make this game very replayable for hours. If you are interested on what it would be like to be your favorite dev team or just want to be in charge of a company without the stress, then this is the game for you. However, this game could use more options for running the company, such as realeasing alpha or beta versions of a game or allowing preorders. Just my opinion, though. All-in-all, very good indie game. 9/10			"

												Short story:The game is overall good. Like U$D10 (max) good.Long story:The game offers lots of replayability, making you test and fail several times in order to get it right. Even with guides you will fail lots of times before getting it right.So, if a game is so replayable why would I say its good and not great?Well, the answer is that the game becomes frustrating REALLY quick. You get a note everytime you make a game, and many times you are punished without understanding why. The tutorials are good enough, but at certain point you are left alone to just discover by failing several times.My out was to check a guide to understand more deeply what was going on, you might need them too. (there is a very nice wiki for the game so dont worry!).Overall the game offers some nice gameplay with acceptable graphs and animations. Although its extremly basic-looking it has certain attactiveness.I wouldnt pay more than U$D10, best price would be arround U$D5-7.			"

												This is your typical get a business up and running sim game. It does have a time limit on the 'campaign' but this is merely for story line progression. Imagine all the technology updates from real life added in the game with some name changes (copyright issues I suspect). Develop your staff, research new things and bring out some kick♥♥♥♥♥games for the world to play. I started playing it and then suddenly it was 3am! After the 35 'in game' years of play, you get your final score, but you can keep playing after. I well recommend this to sim style players. You find yourself modelling your games on real releases, and always want to hit the perfect game.Support the company, i think they can do so much more.			"

I can honestly say I've developed a fake game with all the care and time that many of our beloved indie game developers have done only to see it sell a small amount and lose me money; in contrast, I've poured fortunes into a casual handheld game about puppies just to make exponential profit and secure the jobs of my employees.

												 A fun little game when you just want to sit back, slide some things around and not have to think too hard.  The game is pretty simple but it's also pretty addicting as you try to grow your little garage company into a gaming empire. Steam Workshop support was just added as well so we should see some cool mods coming soon!			"

												Just finished my first playthrough and wow, what a great game! Had me totally hooked, couldn't stop playing.Pros:The mechanics are deep, but not complex to the point where it becomes a riddle. You will gradually get the gist of every genre, which does make the game easier, but the addition of different expansions and resources does shake up things a bit.  It gives you a nice sense of progression as you make more and more hit games.Cons (more like things I'd like to see in a sequel):Some things bothered me during my playthrough, mainly the way it deals with sequels. If you make a sequel of a hit game without doing something else first the game punishes you. There is no way of knowing the size a game series get, every game sort of has its own reception, there is no sense of franchise. Even the hype meter doesn't go wild when you make a sequel to a high selling, beloved game. I'd like to see fans claiming for sequels of your hit franchises, absurd hype and stuff like that, maybe investors claiming for sequels. Something that lets you know you've created a huge franchise and allows you to see the effect it has on the market and in your company. Still on that topic, the game history menu is really simple and never conveys to you, in a macro sense, your body of work. It should be divided, again, into franchises, so you could easily compare how every installment did. I'd also like to see some variety on the reviews of your games and maybe a monthly bulletin with news and articles about your company. Text wise, the game is just really poor, you really have to fill in the blanks with your imagination.Most of my criticism about the game falls into what it didn't do, which I know it's unfair, but I was enjoying my playthrough so much that I really missed these features. I had to come to the point of creating a notepad file where I divided all my games in franchises with its statistics so I could have that macro point of view and could decide better which franchises to keep making games for. But besides all that, it's still a great, charming game. I totally recommend it even at full price. It's just a great little experience. Overall, 8/10Awesome little game!			"

												It's fun, addicting. But, there's a slight unrealistic thing about it, CoD has been on the same engine since modern warfare (CoD4) so, I made all the call of duty's on the same engine, because I didn't use a differen't engine for the sequels they all got low ratings, which is so unrealistic, because CoD gets high ratings in real life :ONah but in all seriousness, this game is well worth the value. With mods it adds even more options to the game and I'll be playing this for a while.			"

												I originally bought Game Dev Tycoon from their website. I have had lots of memorible names. However, when it came out on steam I did not get a key. After waiting, I emailed their customer support. Within a short time the VERY helpful staff had replied asking me where I bought it from. They then sent me a steam key, free of charge. This is VERY good service and I am happy with the product as I have spent many hours playing it. I would strongly say to get this game, just because the company is awesome!			"

												The greatest game to make games in. This game is overwhelmingly addictive and very easy to play but requires more and more strategy as time goes on to make it big in the gaming industry. I'll never forget the feeling I got when I made my first big hit game and got over 200 million dollars after struggling to stay afloat with 100k or less the entire game. After that it just got super fun, and every game you play through it different. I also really like how it follows the gaming trends in our time with just different names. This game is a no brainer.

												This is a fantastic game that'll keep you coming back for more as you try to prove yourself in the competetive Game Industry and bring your company to fame and fortune.It starts you off with the simple premise that you are a fledgling Game Developer trying to make a name for yourself in the still infantile Gaming World back in the 1980s. From there on out you have to use your limited budget to try and develop games, grow your fanbase, and hopefully move your company out of your parents garage.The gameplay is rather simple and user-friendly which is fantastic for the beginning player but can get a tad tedious once you're on your 7th or 8th run through of the game, that's not to say it makes the game less enjoyable but it would have definitely been a plus if the game let you get a little more hands-on at points. As the game progresses you get to choose which consoles you want to purchase a developing license for, as well as create new game engines as new technology becomes available to you. Careful portioning of your budget is vital to gameplay and a rash spender will soon find themselves bankrupt and bought out.The game is incredibly simple but has a fun, addictive quality that certainly kept me playing for a good long while and I'm sure that most of you will enjoy as well!

												I enjoyed this game a lot. BUT, and for a ""tycoon/sim"" type game this is a huge BUT. You can't change the speed at which time flows. 8 hours of game play and 35 Years later (if you don't go bancrupt) and the game is over, technically. I would have loved to have been able to slow the time down because there are lots of things to do in the game but as soon as you hit year 35 and the game tells you that you did a good job, well done, it doesn't feel like it's worth continuing anymore just to make further technical achievements, but you can continue, you can keep going even though you shouldn't be able to live that long (achievement for worlds oldest game developer?).Anyway. Had the game not run at lightening speed throughout I would say this game is really, really awesome. Sadly that's not the case, It's not quite perfect but I would recommend it - even if you can finish the 35 Years in one day if you were so inclined.			"

												The more I play this game, the more I suspect that the devs wanted to preach a message, not make a game.That message? ""Mainstream is bad, indie is good."" Just try making a game that fits what's popular. Simulation games are popular? Every simulation game you make will get an average score of 4 or less.It goes beyond that, though, as every random event seems to cater to what the devs believe, regardless of realism.Example: People are making fan games using the assets you put the time and money into creating? Sending a cease and desist makes you lose fans, letting them be gets you more fans, no other consequences in either case.Another: People are pirating your games. Suing them costs you fans, asking them to stop without even bringing up the idea of legal action gains fans, no other consequences.Yes, that's right, NOT defending your intellectual property is the right choice.Then there's the punishment for hyping your game in a random event. The punishment? The game is essentially guaranteed to flop and you will lose a LOT of fans. Regardless of the quality of the game. Because HOW DARE a developer be enthusiastic and want to drum up interest about a game they poured hundreds of thousands of dollars and months of their life into creating, right?So to the creators of Game Dev Tycoon, I say: Good first attempt, but I suggest that the next time you try making a game that's supposed to be an entertaining simulation of reality, you step out of your fantasy world first.And to would be customers: The game is an esoteric mess, because it's running on its own brand of logic. If you think like the devs, you win. If you don't, you lose. And frankly, the fan made mods are better than the base game. Pass this one unless you really love this sort of game, but even then I'd suggest waiting for a sale.			"

												Make my own game company? HELL YEAH!! This game is great for those who want to start in game design, people who love tycoon games, or people who just like games in general. The game is easy to understand, gives you a bit of chance and exploration by letting you select what demographic, system, topic, genre, how much time will be spent on certain items, and what will be shirked a bit. Also, the slight changes in the game are almost hilarious. If you get this game, try to spot the Half-Life reference. Hint: it is in one of the offices you get.			"

												Yep.I've played enough to make a reviewLet's start.Game Dev Tycoon is a game about developing games(like the title implies);You start in a garage with only guy,and then climb all the way up to the top.There isn't much to say about the game....so let's the positive and negative points of the gamePositive-You can unselash your imagination while making the titles;-There are a plenty of combinations;-There are nice easter eggs and parodies;-The interface is simple and works well;Negative-Lack some content(DLC for normal games,more consoles)-Unlogical details(per example:you do everyone fantasy rpg and the suddenly turns it into a adventure like game for mature audience in the next sequel/in what world super famicom is average with rpg and casual titles?)-Lack of soundtrackSorry if i mispelled something.....and......i hope this review helped you!Final Score85/100			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is totally worth it. Game Dev Tycoon is something totally diffrent and very fun, I think the developer's really care about their fans and other things like that but the developer's really truly care about their fans and they work hard. It has fun consoles and cool pardoys names! I hope they do good with this game and I can't wait to see what comes out in the future. The main point is the game is awesome and is a totally new type of Tycoon. I like everything about it! Game Dev puts you in the shoes of a developer and showing how much money and how hard they work for games and how the market is a big effect in developing games and much more.			"

												On first look, for some peculiar reason, one may think not to buy this game, however taking a closer look at the game will show you that the content, structure and replayability of this game make it interesting and fun to play multiple times over, as information gained through the previous playthrough is carried over into the next, and a multitude of different topics to base your games off of are available, and on different playthroughs, these can be unlocked in different orders. I would strongly reccomend that people play this game, so they too can experience the joys of Game Dev Tycoon.			"

												So first off if you are looking for a game with complex mechanics and intricate gameplay this is definitely not it. I mean there is depth in the game but it all about  learning things and there really isn't that much to learn.So after a couple of playtroughs you will find the game boring since once you know all the best combinations there really isn't much to the game except Role playing as a specific developer (Only making strategy games for example) but really the randomness for some things that the game has makes it hard. But despite everything the game has a lot to offer i got a least 60 hours of enjoyment out of it and so can you.			"

												I fudging love this game. Its simplicty and authentic game type has only scratched the surface of the Game Development Tycoon Genre. It is not hard at all to understand, but isnt too easy to master. Overall I have played the game with 14 different Game Development companies. 9 were successful and 5 werent. But the thing with this game is that everytime you play it you are rewarded with different events and game ratings and you never quite know how good/bad you are going to go! Whats more, ITS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT ITSELF! They are continuously adding new features and the game comes with Steam Workshop integration if you want to broaden your game with mods.One small problem is that the game doesnt take a LOT of time to complete, but as I said before, its still being improved and lengthened.Overall I rate this game a 8/10			"

												This is an interesting business sim where you manage your own games company throughout various stages of industry development. While it may not be as detailled as other sim games, it makes up for it in the tone and graphics. It's just a bit of fun, making up names for games, choosing their genre and platform, then moving around sliders to find the best aspects to focus on for each development stage. After it's complete, the game is then graded and in comes your cash. Throughout the game your office improves and you hire more employers until you hit modern day. One thing that brings it down slightly is the re-play value, as once you've got to modern day, you simply start again. However, you can choose to save all of the data you gathered from your first play-through about genres and which works best together/with audiences etc etc which means you're not necessarily covering old ground and you have more room to try things you didn't do first time round. This mostly makes up for it, but I still needed a good break between play-throughs. Overall, though, a great game thats just a little bit of fun. 9/10			"

												Definately a great game. Very addictive and challenging, especially later in the game. After your first few hits you think you got it made and figured out, but then you hit a slump, your games begin sucking, you begin panicking and making worse games to try and regroup, then you go bankrupt. Later in the game with all the research and not enough points to get it all, it begins getting a bit rough. Time goes pretty quick which can make it overwhelming at times, but overall it is very fun. Very great for the price			"

												Não tem gráficos excelentes, não tem cutscenes nem jogabilidade dignas de registo. É um Tycoon simples. Mas... tão bem estruturado. É uma espécie de história da indústria dos videojogos, desde as primeiras máquinas às consolas e PCs topos de gama da actualidade. O tipo de jogos a desenvolver, a sua temática, o motor de jogo, o tipo de som, história, inteligência artificial, etc, etc... todos os pequenos pormenores acabam por entrar, de uma maneira ou de outra, no jogo. E, claro, há tipos de jogos que combinam com determinado tema e outros que funcionam de forma desastrosa. Não se faz um simulador de música, nem um RPG de corridas de carros. Há que acertar na escolha dos jogos a desenvolver e depois no tempo atribuído às diversas fases do seu desenvolvimento. Envolvente, e interessante, capaz de nos manter agarrados a jogar durante bastante tempo.É um excelente jogo casual, que surpreende pela positiva e entretém durante horas.			"

												After 2 hours of playthrough, I was hooked. I had my ups and downs during development especially when I get bad reviews while my hype count was really high. I learned a lot from this game, not just on how to play it, but also what the Game Devs are going through especially during the release of a game. I recommend everyone to buy this game and support the devs. If you're unsure if you really want this, get the free demo first. 8 USD (bought this for 3.99 USD during the sale) isn't that much, especially when you know that those money will help the devs make or improve the game and have higher chances of making new ones in the future.

												One of the best tycoon games I've ever played. The game is well-worth your money--it's too easy to lose yourself in the game and forget what time it is--and there's something constantly happening, so you're always trying to improve, whether through making games, research, or training. There's a lot of shoutouts to gaming culture as well, and most importantly, it's just a lot of fun to play. My only complaints are that sometimes the game moves too fast, and you don't get to do as much as you'd like (and if you know which consoles have done well and which have done poorly, you won't get much time to make games for those), but if you like tycoon games, then you should definitely buy this one.

												A new interesting type of game that we haven't seen much of before. It brings you back to the days when gaming was just a baby and lets you play as a game developer. You can make any type of game, from a Call of Duty type Military Action game to a Skyrim type Medieval RPG. You can create small games and big AAA titles. You start by working as a newbie in your garage, to owning a big office with other developers. You choose what element(s) to focus your game development on, and if you focus on the right things for the right game you will end up with a 10/10 game. Heck, you can even get 11/10 if your game is that good.Create your own game engine and research new topics and engine parts.Amazing game 9/10.			"

												Have you ever wanted to know what it felt like to be a keyboard warrior from the 80s?  Well get ready to get your underwear pulled over your head, because Game Dev Tycoon is going to do just that. Pull your underwear over your head.  Game Dev Tycoon takes you through the decades of gaming, letting you be that lone programmer in his mom's basement making games, instead of getting a real job.  Choose between genres, different gaming aspects, and decide what you want to focus on during development.  After the game is released, you can find out that, yes, d00m 1/2 didn't sell well.  I wonder whyPros:Game launchesFor a game about making games, it's pretty coolOnce I upgraded to an ofice with employees, I made them all asian and called them AlI was able to make a game on the commodore, knowing it was going to fail, so I guess that's my faultCons:During later parts in the game where lots of things are happening on screen, game can lag on certain systemsLate game is boring and repetitive.  In fact, just stay away from late game and enjoy the jouney, it's the best partThere is an algorithm to the game, once you discover it the game is kinda easyNintendo contacts are expensive as f**kI can bribe my employees to work 24/7, which is niceConclusion:Knowing you, you are just going to create a parody of every game in existance, and then watch it fail, and wonder why a detective RPG with a focus on story didn't work.

This is a strategy game bordering on a puzzle game (at least the first time through playing it) because there are a lot of elements that you have to play around with to discover what they do.My only fear is that there will, ultimately, be a ""best"" way to play - there are some randomized elements, but I haven't confirmed how much they actually factor into your success or failure.

												So recently, I went on a buying binge for Steam games, and I accidentally bought Game Dev Tycoon amongst everything. Initially, I saw my mistake as just that; a mistake and I had no intention of actually playing this game, me being a natural hater of Tycoon games. After a few days of seeing the name in my Library, I finally relented and played it. And I'm really glad I did. The fact I could make up whatever games I wanted, with whatever company I wanted, and smile smugly to myself when they racked over ten million sales, or feel disappointed when they crashed and burned. The history that has been researched for game consoles made me smile, because it tells me the developers of this game put some actual thought into their design process; a trait that seems absent these days (You know who you are). The game starts with giving you a choice of what to call your company, and what to name your character. So, me being me, I called my company ""Rainbow Slot Machine"" and my character ""Red Reno"". I had four game topics to choose from initially, and two platforms. Assuming I was in the 80s, because I didn't read the tutorial my first try, I decided to make an Action Business game called ""Stock Syndrome"". I was shocked, however, when my game scored a 2.25. I thought it was a good idea. Then I tried a different tactic, and made a Fantasy RPG, which people seemed to like more, giving me an 8.75. However, I was so bad at judging what types of games people would like, I eventually ran my company into the ground on the second level, with bad publishing deals and hiring too many people. And so I tried again.THIS TIME I actually read the tutorial, and I started to understand how the game worked. THIS TIME, I had seven successful franchises, two MMOs and a console, until I decided to just make bad decisions again and run my company into the ground... again.The game is a great creation in my eyes, allowing freedom of choice in every area of a game's creation, who to hire and whether or not to be a ""good"" game developer or an ""evil"" game developer (*cough* EA *unconvincing cough*). The game's art is nice, considering the type of game, and, as stated before, you can really feel the developers put some work into this. I, being a hater of most Tycoon games, am surprised I actually recommend this.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon was game that as soon as I laid eyes on, I would want to purchase immediately! And well, for the most part, it is that type of material! It's fairly short, but it's fun and engaging, also quite challenging sometimes!I've always love gaming - and it's apart of my life. Let's face it, I'm a gamer. Yet, I've always tried to make/develop little games to play (Using Unity 3D) and I wasn't too succesful, so I'm more of an enthusiast.Be that as it may, Game Dev Tycoon allowed to use my mind, and my senses to create games that would sell as if they would in real life. Now, sometimes the combinations of the topics and genres would somehow be not as successful if they were in real life (Ex: Evolution/Casual = Spore) Yet, it all made sense in the end...I guess :/Overall, it's such a short game there is not too much to review about, but I can easily produce a solid review from playing this game over-and-over.9/10 - IF you are interested in owning a company and love video games!

												I was expecting a lemonade stand type of Sim, and because of my interest in the subject would have been easily satisfiedwith a basic game dev tycoon. However the game had more depth than i was expecting and in the end its a really great game i highly recomend. Working out why your game did not get a good score when the last time you did somethign like it was positive is interesting and the reasons can be seen with a little investigating. anyway great game.

												The message of this game is money does not always lead to making a good game. I think the developer shows this message in and out of the game itself. For just over £2 this game is probably the best game I have played this year (I have completed Watch Dogs too). It's simple, easy to play and lets you understand the pressures and decisions that real game companies have to put up with every day. Even in the game, you could spend millions on creating and publishing a game to then find out it's a flop then you go and spend like a 1/4 of the money to create a more simple game and it turns out to be a top hit with the fans. I would 100% recommend this game if you are interested in game development.			"

												10/10 Played this game for daysI just finished the game a couple of minutes ago, so I'd like to share my thoughts on this game.I recently bought Assassin's Creed Unity and Halo: Master Chief Collection. I bought this game 2 days ago because I happened to see it was on sale and I figured I should try this.I have not opened any other game besides this one for the past 3 days. What's surprising is that this is the first game (after a few years) that has had me glued to seat just playing for hours on end. That should tell a lot about the quality of this game.The only thing I regret about my purchase is that I should have bought this a long time ago. I was hooked for hours. I had to restrain myself from playing because it's just that addicting.If you're a fan of business simulation games and are somewhat familiar with the game industry, you should definitely give this a try.

												Ever thought you knew everything about games the funding the hard work and telling other what to focus on is the name of the game. You start out solo as a freelancer and thus cant make your AAA games early on you need to recruit others howver you cant do that in the tutorial (since you are ecantially making games ain your basement to start) you do eventually upgrade to skyscaper and get to make the games you dreamed of (well since its a simulation game like sim city its not like you need to do everything yourself)Ok hows the gameplay? Well first you get 4 random topics (like horror, mystery, etc) then you pick a genre then you have to go though the enire process of making the game from beginning to end its automatic however you have to distrube your funds and effort to different things in order for your game to work. For example RPG dont need high quality music you need to focus on gameplay and story nearly 100%, however a dancing game its a very bad idea to ignore music you are asking for the game to take your money. you must spend research points to unlock more (which is rencondmended)The object of the game like I said above build an empire starting in the 80s (yes the 80s and see the entire gaming intrustry evolve around you) in 1992 the snes comes out, in 1996 the n64 comes out by then are you good enough to make games for that system?  Its not easy you lose money every week but you can gain massive money back if you get a blockbuster. Its a good idea to memorize what happened in real life will you invest in the sega cd or the dreamcast uh....The sad part is every event happens in the same order on every playthough but you can try to make different games to see how it goes one game you can try lots of RPGs another go for more Action games its all up to you.The game uses a rating system remember gamespot and ign? well they are all in game yes with pardoyed names but every time you make a game and delete all the bugs (its a bad idea not too) they rate you depending on where you put the focus on the most. Also they take into effect the system you publisjhed on (they are graphic you know if you dont keep up with the times they will destroy you with their rating of 1-3/10 ouch >_>) Trying to please the pro gamers is very hard and part of the fun getting a perfect score is challenging and there are so many factors that can lower your score. Overall it makes the game much better too..Ok some game hints since this is a very hard game and you probably wont make it to the end on a 1st playthough. First you need to figure out what kinda game you want to make (dont do same the types of genre in a row however do keep focusing on that since you can level up in that style <for example doing lots of RPG skyrockets your story, world building, and dialogue exp bar a lot while doing lots of Action skyrocket your graphics, gameplay, and level design exp bars>) remember once you unlock sequel this is a huge opurtunity to do it since if its a sequel to a 10/10 you did earlier but with better graphics/sound/ and features the reviewers are going to love it and you gain lots of hype since the gamers know that you are making a game to a game they loved in the past.Also another mistake beginners make is recruiting way too good employees dont go for the best of the employee you do pay them all by the month (in addion to rent costs) starting with low skilled employees and then training then over time allows the costs to remain reasonable and overall make sense in real life (no newbie company hires top tier employees they cant afford them but the employees that stay with the company for a long time gets better and can even surpass the so called great employees that demand crazy monthy prices.Also another mistake beginners make is not make games for publishers until they get a fanbase (usually around 100k fans is a good number to start making your own games without help) when you are making games for other companies like Nintendo, tecmo, and many others. You only get a % of the money but your fans skyrocket really its much better in the long run so ya...once you move out of the basement its best to work for others for a while to get the fans to know you.since the quality of the games is on your employee skill levels you should train them until they are in the 500's in design,tech, and reseasch.  With stats that high they can specialze which allows you to make even better games. Once you get 6 employees spend the time to get employees with over 700 in either tech or design (this is the only time you should hire top tier employees if you need a specialist asap and you can afford his outragous monthy price) and pay to make him a specilist (which is 200 research points and a million dollars and 3-6 weeks training) they will pay off in the long run once someone has 700 design (or you hire him) and you pay for the training you unlock the design area where the final two graphic upgrades and otehr amazing upgrades are. a 700 tech that you pay the price upgrading him can unlock the area where you can make your own gaming system which will be much better then even the playstation 5, xbox1, and wii u yes you will dominate everything once you make your own gaming console.  Some speicists require 725 tech or design <_< though.Remember the main character (you) has amazing stats 300 in everything and 0 monthy costs. Never gets tired ever. But he still can get confused (stops the bar while you scratch your head its random) Train him well hes the best character in the whole game by the end its not uncommon to have him with 600 in everything (even speed which is the most useless stat) while remaining free and has infinite stamina (no need to go on a vacation). And the best part he can specilize :D totally worth it to do that too.Ok the another hint I'll give is marketing it is really useless in the beginning (since you dont have many fans) however once you start making bigger games (esp the AAA games) you need to market or else no one will know you are working on the game and thus all your hard work and effort will be unknown. Yes marketing is great and all however the big opportuny to gain media attention is the G4 (A parody) You can choose a small,medium, or large booth once a year and this generates so much hype. Once you are a multi millionare and is making a huge game with lots of features picking the big booth will skyrocket your hype and make tons of fans to buy the game day one rather then wait. Yes you will get the money you spent on marketing back if you do a good job.Last hint If you get a 10/10 game and you see the words the other publishers are giving jealous looks the pro gamers from then on will lower your overall score. Yes they are comparing all your future games to that masterpiece it can ruin the rest of your game. A good tip is dont go for your magnum opus too early or else the reviewers will expect too much from you and kill your score on the next game. Since the game lasts 35 years on an avg playthough go for the best of the best nearing the end.The biggest component is your graphics always keep that up to date and make new engines to run them (you need a design specialist with 700 design points and pay the requirement for the upgrade) to get the final two upgrades for graphics with the final one being holographic technology which is really cool. Overall its a great game little short but at only $10 you get to expierence the gaming world from a game maker pov from the 1980 all the way to 2015 (yes the future) once it reaches that the games over your high score is tallyed and the game ends...on a first play though getting straght 10/10 ratings from all the pro reviewers is really a pain in the neck but its so rewarding once you finally see the 11/10 and the AAA badge for making a masterpiece game. OR if you're adventerious try to make an MMO without getting a game over that is very hard to pull off...			"

												This game is something else. I'm not a gamer who really enjoys ""Tycoon"" style games, The Sims/Sim City, or anything of that ilk. I bought this game because it was on sale, I love games and the idea of making them and it had a lot of people surprised. So I started it up not sure what to expect and I fell in love with it.It's what I'd call Simulation lite in that it's not super in depth with the customization choices, but it is enough so to make it fun and interesting. You basically follow the exact path of the game industry from the C64 on. You start out only being able to dev simple text based rpgs or 2d Space Sims, but quickly enter the ""Console Generation"" as Nintendo and Sega enter the scene. You'll have to pay licensing costs, but you'll need to in order to make your company a success and get out of the dying C64 market. You need to maintain a steady streak of sales in order to support your next break away hit so that hopefully it won't just be you in your garage anymore. I started out just wanting to see what it was all about, but I got sucked in. I went from, ""I'll just make one game and see what it's all about..."" to ""Just one more..."" to ""Okay. What will my sixth game be about? I need cash!"" It is one of the simplest games you'll play, but done in such a way that you can't help be enjoy the hell out of it.I'm a gamer who plays just about anything, but I focus on RPGs, FPS, Action/Adventure, etc. Even though I don't generally enjoy simulation games, this one is so playable and enjoyable, I don't think it really matters what style of games you enjoy most. It has something for just about everyone.And to the Devs: You are very welcome for the support! =D You people have a bright future if you keep making engrossing little titles like this. Can't wait to see what you do next.			"

The casual and easy nature of the game makes it a choice for most types of gamer's and as you progress further into the game it gets more advanced depending on how far you come.It's a trial and error game, don't expect your first few rounds to be perfect, you will fail and my tip is to always experiment with different combos and also take the advice they give you. It's got plenty of replay-ability, both hidden and visible achievements and there are a number of guides out there if you get stuck.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a Indie type simulator game that has teh player go over 35 years (in the game) from a poor sap in his garage to a million-millionare dollar game developer. Its a truly interesting game becuase it shouldn't be this freaking fun! The game is both interesting as you are a game developer but the game is still limited by the developers budget nonetheless and the whole game shows that. However, it can be a very enjoyable experience and I highly recommend that people pick it up. The onky issues are its oviously limited gameplay mechanics in regards to its game design and its set up but nonetheless once you ahve beaten it there is still much to play but they is depending on your own opinion.

												.... This game is amazing .... my favorite on steam...It really shows what goes down in the gaming industry and once you get your company to grow, you cant stop. If your company fails the first few times, DO NOT RAGE QUIT because once you find the right genres, the right save file then you will get instantly hooked. A fun part of customization is naming your games, so if your a fan of another game then why not make it here and make your own sequals? naming/building your own game console if you want to make the new next gen console. I REALLY recommend you give this game a try.			"

												What a wonderfully fantastic, adictive game.The game itself is fairly simple and the simple guides help you along as you play. The game really appears to be an act of love, while it may not have the best graphics, it has a ton of heart and embraces the love of video games. I found myself playing into the wee hours of the morning when I bought this! I imagine you'll be doing the same.			"

												What is Game Dev Tycoon?Game Dev Tycoon sends you back to the 80s to relive the start of gaming where you as the player will make your own games, engines and in the future, your own console. you have to worry about what areas you want to focus on when you make your games so that you might get the (10/10 would buy again review).this game is briliant, maybe one of my favorite games i've bought on steam. and the way you relive the gaming history is great you get to see many of the consoles from the 80s to present times like the xbox and playstation. but sadly because of i guess copywrite, they had to tweak the names of the consoles but if you've played games since the 80s and 90s you will probally remember them.i really recommend it as it is a really great game, well made GreenHeart Games. :D			"

Sometimes you think you're going to make an all-star game and it FLOPS completely. You can choose the level of risk. Make risky decisions and you can either get a BIG payoff or a BIG flop. Lots of replay value. I'm already planning to do a main playthrough, and then do a new one with very risky decisions. Give it a try!			"

												Fun and addictive game that you will play for hours on end if you have any passing interest in the games industry or have ever dreamed about making a successful video game. That feeling you get when your game succeeds or fails (especially when you invested a lot of money in it) keeps you coming back again and again. Pretty simple game that can get complex pretty quick. It may not be ultra realistic to real life but it's definitely one of the more fun tycoon/sim type of games I've ever played.Totally worh the $5 I paid for it!			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a neat little simulator. The main part of the game focuses on 35 years of gaming history and important console releases (They don't have the licenses for the real names, but it's easy to work out). You start out in your garage developing games on your computer, once you have enough money you can move into an office, start to hire staff, and in time you can even get your own R&D lab.The acutal 'developing' of the games is fairly straight forward, you start with a small list of topics (fantasy, sci-fi, horror, racing etc...) more of which can be unlocked via research. Once you've picked a topic you choose a genre, there's 5 to choose from, you choose which system to develop the game for, to start off and later on once you've started building your own game engines, you can pick which engines to build on too, oh; you can also choose the 'audience' for a game too; Young, Everybody, Mature.Once you've chosen all the above, the actual development is divided into three sections. Each section has Three sliders that have different things connected to them, things like; World Design, Engine, Graphics, Sound etc... Set the sliders to what you think makes that particular game good, and there you go game made! Certain combinations of topic/genre/audience can work brilliantly in your favour to sell more copies, but on the other hand it can also lead to some absolute stinkers too. After you're game is complete and just before it's released you get a quick run down of experienced gained, and then on to the dreaded games review, which actually reflect how well the game will sell, so the reviewers pan the game you won't shift many units, likewise if it gets glowing reviews you're sure to make a good amount of money. Rinse and repeat until you game your own gaming empire. After a couple of releases you can start to research better graphics, sounds, AI, better story lines etc...The graphics and sounds aren't ground-breaking, but being a simulation of sorts, then they aren't going to be. I've left a couple of things out of this review as I'm sure you'll want a couple of surprises but; All in all Game Dev Tycoon is a nice fun little game, easy to get a grasp upon. The price asked for the game is definitely worth the money as there's hours and hours worth of play.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon was game that as soon as I laid eyes on, I would want to purchase immediately! And well, for the most part, it is that type of material! It's fairly short, but it's fun and engaging, also quite challenging sometimes!I've always love gaming - and it's apart of my life. Let's face it, I'm a gamer. Yet, I've always tried to make/develop little games to play (Using Unity 3D) and I wasn't too succesful, so I'm more of an enthusiast.Be that as it may, Game Dev Tycoon allowed to use my mind, and my senses to create games that would sell as if they would in real life. Now, sometimes the combinations of the topics and genres would somehow be not as successful if they were in real life (Ex: Evolution/Casual = Spore) Yet, it all made sense in the end...I guess :/Overall, it's such a short game there is not too much to review about, but I can easily produce a solid review from playing this game over-and-over.9/10 - IF you are interested in owning a company and love video games!

												The more I play this game, the more I suspect that the devs wanted to preach a message, not make a game.That message? ""Mainstream is bad, indie is good."" Just try making a game that fits what's popular. Simulation games are popular? Every simulation game you make will get an average score of 4 or less.It goes beyond that, though, as every random event seems to cater to what the devs believe, regardless of realism.Example: People are making fan games using the assets you put the time and money into creating? Sending a cease and desist makes you lose fans, letting them be gets you more fans, no other consequences in either case.Another: People are pirating your games. Suing them costs you fans, asking them to stop without even bringing up the idea of legal action gains fans, no other consequences.Yes, that's right, NOT defending your intellectual property is the right choice.Then there's the punishment for hyping your game in a random event. The punishment? The game is essentially guaranteed to flop and you will lose a LOT of fans. Regardless of the quality of the game. Because HOW DARE a developer be enthusiastic and want to drum up interest about a game they poured hundreds of thousands of dollars and months of their life into creating, right?So to the creators of Game Dev Tycoon, I say: Good first attempt, but I suggest that the next time you try making a game that's supposed to be an entertaining simulation of reality, you step out of your fantasy world first.And to would be customers: The game is an esoteric mess, because it's running on its own brand of logic. If you think like the devs, you win. If you don't, you lose. And frankly, the fan made mods are better than the base game. Pass this one unless you really love this sort of game, but even then I'd suggest waiting for a sale.			"

												I am a fan of the Greenheart-developers after playing this game. There are many similar games on the market, but I have never played one with such an interesting motive as this little gem. This game gives, in an easy way - a brief introduction to the hectic life of a game developer, along with history and progress of what is quite similar to the real gaming industry. How the different computers and consoles are being introduced during the story mode are realistic, and the way they parodied actual products from the real market was a good way to not make it too surreal. Especially for the younger audience, 'Game Dev Tycoon' proves and let's one understand that in entrepreneurship, hard work is key for success. Also loving the small, personal notes from the developers that reflects the game's objective. Cute!			"

												This is an interesting business sim where you manage your own games company throughout various stages of industry development. While it may not be as detailled as other sim games, it makes up for it in the tone and graphics. It's just a bit of fun, making up names for games, choosing their genre and platform, then moving around sliders to find the best aspects to focus on for each development stage. After it's complete, the game is then graded and in comes your cash. Throughout the game your office improves and you hire more employers until you hit modern day. One thing that brings it down slightly is the re-play value, as once you've got to modern day, you simply start again. However, you can choose to save all of the data you gathered from your first play-through about genres and which works best together/with audiences etc etc which means you're not necessarily covering old ground and you have more room to try things you didn't do first time round. This mostly makes up for it, but I still needed a good break between play-throughs. Overall, though, a great game thats just a little bit of fun. 9/10			"

												As someone who honestly didn't like tycoon games or anything like them, this game was full of nonstop fun mixed in with a bunch of laughs. I began watching people play this game and just simply having fun watching them play it and desperately wishing I could control what they were doing. I decided to get it. Sometimes you can catch this game on sale for $5 but the $9.99 is worth every penny. I'm finishing up my second playthrough of it now. If you aren't a believer, just watch someone play this game like I did. Find someone on Twitch or YouTube giving it a go and (if they have some entertainment value) get sucked into their adventures of the gaming industry. This game starts you fresh in a garage as a 1-man-team creating your own games back when it all first began. You journey through the years gaining more technology, more people, better equipment, and much more to advance into what we play and do today. There's so much to do which makes your first few playthroughs completely different. Your first go with this game will be you learning a lot of what you can do and then with that knowledge you can have even more fun on another go. The timeline on this game is pretty much spot on, you even get to witness the break-up of Sony and Nintendo and begin making games for the PlayStation (or PlaySystem as it is called in this game due to copyright) when it drops. This game came out before XBox One and PS4 did so of course once you get around that time there is a bit of make-believe but I think they did good with it. This game doesn't just end at the current stage of gaming. It goes on a bit longer and allows you to eventually make your own consoles and your own games for your consoles. Before I go on and on and give too much away... JUST GET THE GAME! You shouldn't regret it.			"

												What can be said about Game Dev Tycoon that has not already been said. The core gameplay of Game Dev Tycoon is similar to that of other tycoon games in the sense that you're out there trying to make a fortune, and what a better way than starting your own videogame company? You start in your garage, and watch as the game consols we grew up with pop up on the market, and develop for them. As time progresses, and you amass your fortune, you can move to larger and larger facilities, and hire more staff. Along the way, you research newer game engines, new topics, and even completly new ideas with your R&D department, such as project grid. I wont say anymore, as I dont want to spoil the entire experience, but I will say this. This is a game made by gamers, for gamers. Greenheart hit this one out of the park, and everything from the core game, to the smallest reference, is spot on, and I can definatly reccomend it as such.			"

												This is simply the greatest tycoon game I have ever played. Not only do you get to develop your favorite games but, you also get to see gaming from the begining. You can choose to branch out in different directions whether you want to develop your own console or simply become the model software company, or even both if you spend the time and effort. Start from your garage in the 80's to about 2020ish and become the company worth millions you've always wanted to be. Simply incredible game and well worth the ten dollars (on sale now).			"

												This game is really awesome, the whole motive and how it is built up is amzing. The game is so simple, yet there is so much to do. I wouldnt say that this is the kinda game where you get to explore new stuff, like minecraft. But once you get to the 3rd office things start to get really awesome. I like the idea of how you go through the gaming industry, starting in the early years, and not only get to develop games, but also gets to put them out on different consoles and give them different topics and later also make AAA and MMO games. It is also awesome that you get the research and hardware lab, though i think som tweaking to the hardware and research lab would be needed, so that you could use them for more stuff. I also think that they could give us more opportunities, like instead of the same offices you could every time you played invest in a different office, lets say you hit the 1M it would be cool if you got the opportunity to move into the techonolgy park, or to move into a industrial part of a city, and the different places would be cheaper or more expensive and have different perks. Else i cannot think of much more i would like to have added to this game, all i can say is that i cant wait for Greenheart's next game. //Freddy			"

												It's 2:30am, you're in your basement punching away at your keyboard on your very first game. $100 million worth of sales later and you're the new hot shot dev house!This is a neat little indie game by Greenheart Games in which you have your own game development company with the end goal of becoming the most successful company the industry has ever seen! When you start off, the types of games and genres you can make are pretty limited, however, as you progress more and more genres unlock. Earn insane sales records by mixing genres and gameplay to their most suitable platform. By the end of it you're a multi-genre/multi platform giant! This game is really neat, as not only does it offer you the freedom of creating your own video games, but it actually gives you a history lesson on the video game industry as you progress.Pick up this game to kill a few hours, and watch yourself rinsing several days on it!

												Definately a great game. Very addictive and challenging, especially later in the game. After your first few hits you think you got it made and figured out, but then you hit a slump, your games begin sucking, you begin panicking and making worse games to try and regroup, then you go bankrupt. Later in the game with all the research and not enough points to get it all, it begins getting a bit rough. Time goes pretty quick which can make it overwhelming at times, but overall it is very fun.

Just when you think you've got a winning combination, those nasty reviewers give you a 2/10 and you have to go crawling back to the publishers to make your next game. :(I feel like I didn't  unlock anywhere near as much tech and other options as I could have during the first play through. It definitely has high replay value.Also +1 for cheeky game industry commentary!			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a tycoon strategy game where you create your own game development company. You start as a guy/gal working out of a cramped garage in the 80's and as you create popular games you'll gradually grow until you have enough money for a new premises as well as the option to hire employees. As you continue to grow you'll be able to make bigger, better games, research new technology to gain an advantage, create your own MMOs and even create your own powerful game engines.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon on the surface seems like a dull experience. Explain the nuts and bolts of this game out loud and you may think this can't be enjoyable. You would be wrong.Game Dev Tycoon stimulates your imagination by letting you fill in the blanks. In the game, you are a game dev (duh) starting out in the garage at the beginning of home video games. The game follows 35 years of history and goes a bit past present day with all of the names of the real life game companies replaced with psuedonyms. It's your task to create games for the different consoles over time while developing your skills and eventually growing your company out of the garage and into a sweet office building where you'll be faced with new challenges managing your staff. You never see the games you make; you come up with the title, decide the genre, console and prioritize what aspects of the games will be worked on. It sounds kind of meh right? But I've spent hours imagining what the games I came up with looked like and  how the cover art must have looked. It's like reading a book, where theatre of your mind is doing a lot of the heavy lifting.  Game Dev Tycoon is a great title for any fan of video game history and is reasonably priced. If you're still unsure check out Videogame Dunkey's video review. That's what convinced me that I would like this title. For ten bucks, there enough here to justify the price tag. If you disagree, pick it up on sale.			"

												The more I play this game, the more I suspect that the devs wanted to preach a message, not make a game.That message? ""Mainstream is bad, indie is good."" Just try making a game that fits what's popular. Simulation games are popular? Every simulation game you make will get an average score of 4 or less.It goes beyond that, though, as every random event seems to cater to what the devs believe, regardless of realism.Example: People are making fan games using the assets you put the time and money into creating? Sending a cease and desist makes you lose fans, letting them be gets you more fans, no other consequences in either case.Another: People are pirating your games. Suing them costs you fans, asking them to stop without even bringing up the idea of legal action gains fans, no other consequences.Yes, that's right, NOT defending your intellectual property is the right choice.Then there's the punishment for hyping your game in a random event. The punishment? The game is essentially guaranteed to flop and you will lose a LOT of fans. Regardless of the quality of the game. Because HOW DARE a developer be enthusiastic and want to drum up interest about a game they poured hundreds of thousands of dollars and months of their life into creating, right?So to the creators of Game Dev Tycoon, I say: Good first attempt, but I suggest that the next time you try making a game that's supposed to be an entertaining simulation of reality, you step out of your fantasy world first.And to would be customers: The game is an esoteric mess, because it's running on its own brand of logic. If you think like the devs, you win. If you don't, you lose. And frankly, the fan made mods are better than the base game. Pass this one unless you really love this sort of game, but even then I'd suggest waiting for a sale.			"

												I liked this game very much. I will give it a 8/10.The story reminds me of the life of Bill Gates. You start with a ""buisiness"" in your garage and try to develope new games. Every game walks through 3 stages and in every one you need to decide which part of the game should be emphasised in the development, like graphics, sounds or story. For the different genres and settings there are different parts important. After yopur first game, which normaly fails, you can analyse it and therefor learn what went good and what went wrong, e.g. that the K.I. is important for a strategie game.With this imformation you develop the next one, and the next one, ....The Graphics of the game are not the best, but good enough for the idea of the game. It was fun to play and there are several ways to play it. For me the only minuses are the short real-time in which the game-time evolves and the kind of repetitive playstile due to it. Within a certain time, there are new consols etc. But you cannot use all of them, because the time between the consol generations are too short in game time. This leads to a certain pattern for your playstyle you choosed at the beginning. So an option to play a ""marathon"" like game would be nice.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a Indie type simulator game that has teh player go over 35 years (in the game) from a poor sap in his garage to a million-millionare dollar game developer. Its a truly interesting game becuase it shouldn't be this freaking fun! The game is both interesting as you are a game developer but the game is still limited by the developers budget nonetheless and the whole game shows that. However, it can be a very enjoyable experience and I highly recommend that people pick it up. The onky issues are its oviously limited gameplay mechanics in regards to its game design and its set up but nonetheless once you ahve beaten it there is still much to play but they is depending on your own opinion. Final Score: 80/100			"

												I had submitted a review for Game Dev Tycoon more than a year ago. The game has gone through a lot of changes, and I have learned a lot more while I have kept playing it. For this reason, I have decided to update my review and make it more extended.First of all, I think Game Dev Tycoon will keep expanding and growing, it's a game that shows a lot of potential. Since Game Dev Tycoon implemented Steam Workshop it has evolved a lot, especially via the ability to create and utilize mods to modify the average experience. I believe Game Dev Tycoon will continue to evolve, progress and attract more people to buy it over time because of Steam Workshop and updates done by the developers.To continue, I wish to say this was Greenheart Games' first game. Seriously, these people deserve a round of applause! This is a truly amazing game that most companies can't pull off, especially as their first game. I am excited to see what Greenheart comes up with in the future; I know it'll be just as great as Game Dev Tycoon, perhaps even greater! Following these statements, I would also like to point out that I haven't noticed a single bug in this whole game, and I've played it a lot! The game runs very smoothly in my computer and all of its artwork is stunningly beautiful! All the consoles, all the names, all news, it is noticable a massive amount of effort was put into each of these aspects to make the game as marvelous as it is.Finally, I would like to higlight tha fact this game is super easy to understand! You can be a gamer, as you may be a non-gamer and enjoy this game. That's why I recommend this game to each and every Steam player; especially newcomers who haven't bought a single game. I am sure Game Dev Tycoon will continue to be a massive success, like it has been so far.			"

												Game dev tycoon is the perfect game for any Tycoonist.Even if you do not have that much of a interest in the gaming industry this game will furfill you every needs as addictive,fun simulation game. The develpors have really thought of evrything welst creating this game and thge diffrent scenros and historical background in the game really adds to the imersive feel. Watching your company be built up from a garage with one computer and just yourself to a multi million dollar company with high end techonligy to create your own software is really fun and rewarding. This game is well worth price tag and it will give you hours of fun, i look foward to seeing what the develpors have in store for us next.			"

												(Part of this review covers content you see later in the game)When I first played this I ended up sinking over 4 hours into it and finding out I would make the worst company of all time as I sunk countless amounts of Money into making my games look nice to wish upon a shooting star that I will turn a profit, to milking any series I made.Sufficed to say I quickly crashed and burned and am now trying to play more reasonably.The amount of stuff in this game is actually quite nice, there are countless consoles based on real consoles (And some based on consoles that arent even announced yet) that give a broad array of things to choose to develop for (Though PC seems to be the cheapest and probably safest if you arent feeling safe in trying anything crazy).You can choose many different kinds of games to make, though you cant just go in and make a fashion adventure game expecting it to sell well, what I like is the game gives you some hints but ultimately it doesnt hand hold you too much and expects you to figure it out for yourself.One especially cool feature much later on in the game is one that allows you to build your own console, which I havent got to yet but I will not rest till I have got to it. (In which case when that happens I will make sure to update this review.)Overall this game is lots of fun to play with and could easily be on of the top games I played this year!			"

												Game Dev Tycoon, so far, is an entertaining and interactive game where you try to make it big as a game developer. It's not graphically superior, and it's not a music masterpiece. What it is, is a small bit of fun you can have at your leisure. It's tricky, fun, and enjoyable.Would I buy this if it wasn't part of the Summer Sale? Probably not.Do i enjoy the game when i play it? For the most part, yes. At times it seems easy, and other times insuferable, and sometimes, the gameplay seems just right. Do I regret the purchase? No. Recommended? If on sale, by all means, i would get it. If it's full price, I'd personally add it to your wishlist and wait to be notified of a sale.			"

												At its core, Game Dev Tycoon is a sequence-puzzle game.  When I first started playing, I became a media darling, let that get to my head, and went bankrupt less than two years later.  After a number of horrible restarts, I finally relized I had the goals all wrong.  Sure, make a boat-load of money and be successful, but underneath all that is the one thing that drives many of us to play games with Steam Achievements: GOTTAH FIND 'EM ALL!When you start a game, you begin with just a few variables: Topic, Genre, Platform.  Take a chance, put some things in the pot, see what you get.  Does your T+G+P net +++?  Or is it more like a ---?  Either way, you've just uncovered one of the sequences this game has to offer.  Do you take the money you've just made and churn out a whole bunch of TGP clones to line your pockets?  Or do you go the maverick route and try a completely different sequence?As the game progress, more variables are added to your sequence: target Audience, game-Size, and others.  Additionally, as time passes, companies will debut the very consoles that launched the gaming industry.  So, now, your sequence becomes T+G+P+A+S=???I haven't actually finished the game yet.  I keep starting over because finding all the sequences is what drives me, as opposed to making booku-bucks.The game itself is a rather simplistic take on what goes into making a game, I'm sure.  You likely don't have to research ""sequels"" in order to learn how to make one, you just make it.  I'm also a little disappointed that the PC platform isn't given as much love as the various consoles that pop up.  There's no mention of when the CD-ROM drive becomes available to the PC platform; the graphic of the PC just changes to include one.People who excel in strategy games like StarCraft and the Civilization franchise will find themselves quite at home here.  For people like me, who don't, this game is still enjoyable if you remove the drive to make money.  As long as you have enough to sustain yourself, just keep inputting sequence variables into the machine and see what comes out.			"

												I love tycoon games, and I feel like it's a genre of contemporary neglect. In light of that, Game Dev Tycoon allows us tycoon fans to breathe a sigh of relief and subdue our addiction for a bit. Although slow-paced at certain points in the game and an upgrade to its save-load mechanism could have saved me hours (and tears), it's an insanely fun game with great steam achievements, increasingly multi-faceted throughout the storyline, pedagogical and easy to get into. I can definitely recommend it for tycoon-fanatics, the game development-interested and indie game lovers alike!			"

												Definitely a fun and addictive game, but needs more content. You start in the 1980's making games in your garage, and as you sell more games you can expand your company. Ultimately, while you are given many genres/topics/platforms to use to make your games, Game Dev Tycoon always follows the same path of progression. Once you figure out how to consistently release high scoring games you will be able to make money consistently and gain lots of fans. Since most of the gaming devices are inspired by real world events, if you know anything about gaming history its not hard to figure out the ""right"" choices. There are some random events to change things up, but I find they are few and far between. It would be nice if the market would be more dynamic rather than follow static events, kind of like being able to play ""what if?"" in gaming history. i.e. What if the Dreamcast had a major title that drove up console sales? Would that cause Microsoft to stay out of the market instead of trying to challenge Sony? What if the game with the most hype was really bad and led to less sales for the PS2? You do get to enter the console market with your own device, but this is so late into the game that it doesn't really mean much. Other suggestions, it would be nice if there was more to the game when it comes to sales and profit. Whether you self publish, or work with a publisher the amount of money you make seems to be only determined by the review score. You can take advantage of randomly generated trends in the market to boost sales, but if you make a good game it sells well regardless. It would be interesting to have random events in the market that can negatively affect the sales of  high scoring games. Finally, the managing of employees could be more interesting. Maybe have them leave to form new studios, demand a raise, retire, happiness rating, etc. This would provide nice challenges to managing your studio besides training/replacing/send on vacation. Overall, I enjoy this game very much, but would like to see more depth to the gameplay to make the game more dynamic.			"

												This is overall a really decent game! I bought it not expecting much but because I'm a hopeful Game Dev myself and thought it would be fun but I was very pleasantly surprised.It has a few minor problems in that it doesnt feel very well optimised considering my computer can play high end games in high graphic settings but had a few points of lag once I had unlocked everything and had a few tasks on the go. It also has a system which as first seems very odd as making an RPG with high AI settings and better sound quality results in a bad game when you would think it would just result in a better game. Once you've got used to the mechanics and realise what helps what it is a very good indie game.Overall it's a very good Indie game and deserves all the praise it gets!			"

												I bought this in the holiday sale for practically peanuts. I got hooked straight away and realised I got myself more then a bargain! I advise you to start a game and learn the basics. You will more than likely go bankrupt quite early on but you will be much better prepared for your second attempt. I failed again at my second attempt so then got the cheat mod to just stop me from going bankrupt. On my third playthrough I reinvented SEGA and made them into the number one game/console development company. Theres a lot of fun in recreating your favourite games and turning them into AAA 10/10 titles. So far it has been 16 hours very well spent. The reviews I read here made me buy this game, You wont regret doing the same thing!			"

												Great game overall, well worth the $2 I paid it for it when it was on sale a while agoI rarely write reviews but this game is actually really fun to play and considering it came from an indie developer I'm very impressed.Here's a list of pros and cons.Pros Simple and easy to understand (tool tips pop up and explain most things, basic 'help' section also) Multiple consoles to develop for (pretty much all of them, missing a few smaller ones but still great) Lots of topics and genres to build for  Progress from small slummy garage to sexy building  Towards the end there is lots of do and research (the R&D towards the end is done very well) Some similarities to other dev games, but really becomes very unique towards the middle to the end (you can specialise your workers etc) Lots of other cool stuff along the wayCons (Not really negatives, just small things that could be improved) Time passes really quickly, would have been good if there was a speed slider, or if it took a little longer for the weeks to pass Your workers are skilled in development / technology but it seems to me that only 'graphics' is the only skill that utilises the technology attribute (Maybe I just don't quite understand who to assign to different tasks on medium / large games)  Sometimes its hard to see what will be successful by combining topics and genres (it does tell you it may be a good combination after you selected what you want, given you have researched it, however it would be good if you didn't have to go back and forth to select and reselect things Lots of trial and error in discovering what works, would be good to actually research into a topic to see if the market will like itOverall great game!

												After 2 hours of playthrough, I was hooked. I had my ups and downs during development especially when I get bad reviews while my hype count was really high. I learned a lot from this game, not just on how to play it, but also what the Game Devs are going through especially during the release of a game. I recommend everyone to buy this game and support the devs. If you're unsure if you really want this, get the free demo first. 8 USD (bought this for 3.99 USD during the sale) isn't that much, especially when you know that those money will help the devs make or improve the game and have higher chances of making new ones in the future.

												Really nice game. As an indie game dev myself I have to admit GDT gives a good first overview of what the creation of a game looks like. I did almost 8-10 games (from the begining until the end... or bankruptcy :P), to try different combination, figure out how this works, and I enjoyed evey single one. It might look like a casual game, but don't be fooled by the graphics or the animation, you'll have to learn the mecanics and improve... this is some gamer stuff. Plus, they included some nice jokes and easter eggs, I enjoyed searching for them. I love strategy and simulation games, and I warmly recommend this one if you want to have a better understanding of the job of a indie game dev.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is probably one of the most ADDICTING and FUN games I've ever played. You can make awesome games, engines, and find some easter eggs in the game too! Basically, you start off in a small garage and make a game, which can be about any of the 4 random topics you recieve (ex: Post Apocolyptic, Aliens, Pirates, Evolution) and go with those. You can make lots of different combos, hire staff, get awesome offices, and maybe even hire someone famous! This is probably one of the best Steam games I have bought, you guys should get it too.

												It's on of those games that's so cute and simple. But if you have any love of being a gamer it's truly a gem. It's one of those games where ""one more turn"" turns into 8 hours. I realized it at 9 am this morning after playing all night that i had been saying one more turn for almost 6 hours. It's amazingly fun and simple in the beginnning but has the depth to make you wonder what is around the next corner.			"

Enjoyable to the max!This game is a perfect example of how a simple game with no extravagant graphics, no complicated gameplay and no breathtaking story, can still be a great and enjoyable game. The logic is quite simple. You re on your own, in your garage / working station, creating your company somewhere in the late 80's, with a passion to make it to the continuously evolving gaming industry. Your only tool is your pc and your only companion is your creativity.The game progresses through the ages, following loyaly the evolution of gaming, providing you with news from the companies as to their upcoming plans for gaming and technology to support it (both on consoles and pc) as well as the current tendencies of the gaming audience (i.e. there is a current tendency for strategy games), giving you opportunities to deliver something that will appeal more and more to your growing fanbase.As you are becoming more and more successfull on what you re doing, the game allows you to ""evolve"", taking your company to new, bigger offices and with the potential of hiring the first members of your company's staff. Each of them can be chosen based on their specialties (design, technology etc) so that they can provide a valuable asset to what your company needs most at any given moment.But for me, it s the little details that make this game shine. As your company is getting bigger and more successfull, the game provides you with random, sort of ""pop up"" choices that do fit to how a gaming company can handle certain things. From fan requests to possible ""foul play"" on your companies side or staff requests. The decisions you make have an impact on various things. Fanbase, staff productivity, market acceptance etc etc. To sum this up (and not spoil the fun this game can deliver), if you want to take a break from ""hardcore"" gaming and want a casual but funny and addicting game dev simulator, I highly recommend this game. Pros:-Low system requirements-Escalating but enjoyable difficulty-Gives the potential of going in depth to it but not as a necessity-Amusing way of avoiding copyright infringements -Personalised skill development for each of your staff-Steam Workshop support-High replayability potentialCons:-Could give the player a little more insight as to what you re doing wrong or right (although you can figure out things... through ""pain"" :P )-Sometimes it gives you the feeling that the years go by really fast, making developing titles for particular consoles a bit pointless. Unless you re willing to keep buying licences for the next gen consoles that their companies make.Overall score: 9/10For what this game is and does, it s a gem!Personal note / tip for new playersRight now my company is in a big office, with 7 people as staff (me included) and we ve made a name in the gaming industry, being currently at the 15 spot (out of 100) in game conventions, with a 70+ million budget and still going. So my advice to you is to be, think and act like you want the real gaming companies to be. Be modest.Once you make a couple of successfull titles and see the money filling your bank account, don t go cocky. Don t start buying expensive, highly educated personel (more than you can afford), in the hope that your next title will also be a success. Or you ll be in for a surprise... Take it slow instead. Listen to your fanbase, fulfill their requests as long as they are logical and keep it like that. When you re giving an interview, don t overhype your games. Cause if you do and the game doesn t live up to the expactations, it s gonna be double the fall. Don t worry about growing your fan base. Fans will come as long as your company stays true to it s original ideals and passion for gaming.			"

												8.8/10Really awesome game. I liked it, and became addicted. Woke up around 8 a.m, turned on my computer and finished playing around 9 p.m. and went to sleep.Pros:- It's addicting at start.- Keeps you entretained- You're free to do your choice- Helpful guides- Informative text- Keeps going after it ends- Many possible choices [fail or win]- Great achievements- Awesome game finish reward- Perfect for practicing micromanagment- Gets more complex the more you advance- Easy to understand at the start- Fair Scores.Ok with:- Feels a little bit short after newest consoles- Time feels short [ didn't have much time to make new softwares]- Researchs became more expenssive and harder to getCons:- Huge amount of text [not that I hate it, just that it doesn't attract the attention of my friends, they don't like a lot of text]- You become the ruler of gaming creation after ""achieveing"" many things [huge amount of money, gaming succes, etc.]- Hard to know what ""fans/players"" want.- MANY information for gameplay.- VERY specific things for different consoles and types of games.I would love to see and play a Second Game... Great Job.Anyway, that's just the things I tought about the game, all the cons I had could be stuff you like, and I respect that.			"

												A game in which you create, market, produce, and sell games. Outstanding. There are some mods for this game that make it even better thought as is it is still a really good game. If you catch it on sale for anything than what it is listed as, buy it, you will get your moneys worth out of this game.  It is addictive when you first start and your failures only assist in making you strive for success and your success make you strive for even more. Mod in development adds  multiplayer features, there are several other mods constantly adding more engine tools, and game topics to keep the game from becoming the same all the time. If you think you might be interested in this game, then you will probably be very happy with this purchase.			"

												Welcome to Vosoros Games…Starting out in my garage I referred to my trusty notepad of game ideas and began churning out one successful game after the next.  But it’s wasn’t enough to just make games with such primitive technology, and thus I built the VGE 1 (Vosoros Games Engine 1)…or VEG as I liked to joke at times, and still do.Oh I could hear the groans of my future staff I one day hoped to hire and help me build this company up further…And so it eventually came to pass that I did outgrow my garage and did hire those staff I envisioned needing the assistance of.  Our game engine grew with the company too, subtle changes at first with the VGE 1.1, but then transforming our lives (and those of our fans) with the VGE 2 and its 3D graphics.  As we continued to innovate with our engine, so too did we continue to innovate and improve with our games.  Our skills and finance grew as our successes chained beyond our wildest dreams.About 20 years after I’d started Vosoros Games we moved into our very own building (where we still reside today), setting aside space for a future R&D Department and a Research Lab to craft our very own console when finances permitted.Sure enough, with the creation of the VGE 5, we began to build the VGS 1 (Vosoros Games System Console 1), and it was a roaring success.  As a new game engine was built, so was a new console to accommodate the latest technological and gaming innovations we bought to our ever-growing number of fans.Today, Vosoros Games is the leading company in game design and innovation with the VGE 8 (our masterpiece game engine) and the VGS 4 (our masterpiece console system that accompanies it) with its virtual reality headset.Game Dev Tycoon is a gem of a game well worth buying…’cos Vosoros Games made it!  :P			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a Indie type simulator game that has teh player go over 35 years (in the game) from a poor sap in his garage to a million-millionare dollar game developer. Its a truly interesting game becuase it shouldn't be this freaking fun! The game is both interesting as you are a game developer but the game is still limited by the developers budget nonetheless and the whole game shows that. However, it can be a very enjoyable experience and I highly recommend that people pick it up. The onky issues are its oviously limited gameplay mechanics in regards to its game design and its set up but nonetheless once you ahve beaten it there is still much to play but they is depending on your own opinion. Final Score: 80/100			"

												10/10 Played this game for daysI just finished the game a couple of minutes ago, so I'd like to share my thoughts on this game.I recently bought Assassin's Creed Unity and Halo: Master Chief Collection. I bought this game 2 days ago because I happened to see it was on sale and I figured I should try this.I have not opened any other game besides this one for the past 3 days. What's surprising is that this is the first game (after a few years) that has had me glued to seat just playing for hours on end. That should tell a lot about the quality of this game.The only thing I regret about my purchase is that I should have bought this a long time ago. I was hooked for hours. I had to restrain myself from playing because it's just that addicting.If you're a fan of business simulation games and are somewhat familiar with the game industry, you should definitely give this a try.

Simple and fun with a little replay value. 10/10			"

												I totally love this game for these 5 reasons:1.) The modding community adds so much and modding is so easy!2.) So much great artwork!3.) The way its setup in both the early and late stages is spot-on.4.) Although it may just be moving sliders, its so fufilling adding features to your games and new engines and getting reviews!5.) The constant support from the developers, Greenheart Games.			"

												Não tem gráficos excelentes, não tem cutscenes nem jogabilidade dignas de registo. É um Tycoon simples. Mas... tão bem estruturado. É uma espécie de história da indústria dos videojogos, desde as primeiras máquinas às consolas e PCs topos de gama da actualidade. O tipo de jogos a desenvolver, a sua temática, o motor de jogo, o tipo de som, história, inteligência artificial, etc, etc... todos os pequenos pormenores acabam por entrar, de uma maneira ou de outra, no jogo. E, claro, há tipos de jogos que combinam com determinado tema e outros que funcionam de forma desastrosa. Não se faz um simulador de música, nem um RPG de corridas de carros. Há que acertar na escolha dos jogos a desenvolver e depois no tempo atribuído às diversas fases do seu desenvolvimento. Envolvente, e interessante, capaz de nos manter agarrados a jogar durante bastante tempo.É um excelente jogo casual, que surpreende pela positiva e entretém durante horas.			"

												So your a game developer. You come up with a genre and subject and a title.Thats pretty much at the start, but as time progresses it becomes more and more developed, choosing engines and staff. Even late game get to develop your own consoles.Mix in a little marketing and other odd bits thrown in there, and it's a game of making games.Overall gameplay, music and sounds are probably going to get repetative. But on the whole it's a good game and at the very least you get to spend a few hours living the dream of being a game developer.			"

												A simple, yet powerfully addicting tycoon game about game design. The game starts with a single character designing games out of a garage and eventually progresses to owning a multi-million dollar game design company with multiple employees to help with the process as projects become more advanced. Highly recommended for anybody who is a fan of tycoon games or anyone who would simply like a break from the fast-paced gaming world of titles such as Call of Duty or Battlefield. This game also is a Steam Workshop title, which means there are player-creations/mods coming out all the time, which could enhance the game-play or add additional features to spice things up. Hours of fun!			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is one of those games that makes me wish there was a ""Maybe"" button in Steam reviews. It's not a bad game, but it's really not all that great. It's just that it happens to fill a very, very specific niche reasonably competently. If you've played the mobile game Game Dev Story, then you more or less know what you're in for. It's nearly exactly that game with some stuff rearranged or expanded.As biz sims go, this one is very laid back. It's not too terribly difficult, there isn't a lot to keep track of, and your goals are straight forward and repetitive. That said, if you don't mind the casual experience, what you get in return is a video game about making video games. For me, the novelty there was enough to warrant playing it. But if you're looking for a sim with any real depth, look elsewhere.			"

												A really nice game I've played in a 9 hour long streak until I lost. I basicly relieved the history of gaming and learned a lot. Software sold Hardware. Trends are really important and give you a huge boost in sales. I always stole data from other companies. By the time I've ended my playthrough I lived to the next gen consoles and PC's. I totally ignored the mobile market and made several AAA-titles.I basicly remade Chrono Trigger, CIV and Final Fantasy every 2 years.I had 1.5b $I won a lifetime price as a dev.Made my own console.Basicly created steam.Held my own conventions with 3m visitors.Then I lost all the money by making a MMO which costed me 25m a week and some company bought me up.10/10 would play again to lose everything to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MMO's			"

												I am obsessed with this game! Absolutely worth the money! I just get lost in playing & coming up with funny & quirky names for my games! I looked up a guide to get a rough idea of how to better do levels & what genres work better together after going bankrupt a few times & now I know what I am doing roughly I have got better & so far haven't gone bankrupt again. So yes in short.....buy!Beautiful 9/10 - Star Games			"

												The game is really good developed. I bought the game before it was on Steam and was chained to the pc right away to keep playing the game.When I just started the game I used to go bankrupt everytime I started to grow but eventually I got better at the game and how to place the sliders for the different genres. (This was before the Game reports were added that revieled what is good and bad for a game). After a long time I managed to finish the game just to continue to see how much my MMO could make to finally get in the figures that even Bill Gates money looks like a dime.Even though the game is not always a 'correct' simulation of the real world it gives a lot of good information for people like me that want to start his/her own game company. If I could only work as hard as the no-life character you play in the game I wouldn't need to worry about anything anymore.			"

												After 2 hours of playthrough, I was hooked. I had my ups and downs during development especially when I get bad reviews while my hype count was really high. I learned a lot from this game, not just on how to play it, but also what the Game Devs are going through especially during the release of a game. I recommend everyone to buy this game and support the devs. If you're unsure if you really want this, get the free demo first. 8 USD (bought this for 3.99 USD during the sale) isn't that much, especially when you know that those money will help the devs make or improve the game and have higher chances of making new ones in the future.

												Really nice game. As an indie game dev myself I have to admit GDT gives a good first overview of what the creation of a game looks like. I did almost 8-10 games (from the begining until the end... or bankruptcy :P), to try different combination, figure out how this works, and I enjoyed evey single one. It might look like a casual game, but don't be fooled by the graphics or the animation, you'll have to learn the mecanics and improve... this is some gamer stuff. Plus, they included some nice jokes and easter eggs, I enjoyed searching for them. I love strategy and simulation games, and I warmly recommend this one if you want to have a better understanding of the job of a indie game dev.			"

												REVIEW------------------1- Awful | 2- Terrible | 3- Sucks | 4- Bad | 5- Meh.. | 6- Decent | 7- Good | 8- Great | 9- Amazing | 10- Outstanding------------------(Go down to Verdict for the Quick Anwser and Explanation)One of the best tycoon games out there, Game Dev Tycoon is a game with rather simple mechanics that slowly through time become more complex. As the game says, you are a Game Dev working hard to create the greatest video game development company. This game starts in the 80s with the Commodore64 all the way to New Gen PlayStation/Xbox, giving you a throwdown of gaming history. Now game mechanics, the first and most important mechanic, Game Developing. Game developing in Game Dev Tycoon is simple you choose a name, topic, genre, console, and engine, then you are greeted with 3 Development stages. In the all the stages you adjust sliders representing Game Ingredients (Gameplay, Graphics, Story, Engine, A.I, Level Design, etc.) you have to adjust the sliders based on your topic and genre this get slightly more complex later on. You can also hire staff once you move to a new office, this is when the game becomes more challanging and where the real test starts, whether or not you can become a successfull video game company.-----------------VERDICT:-----------------8.5/10 - This game is great filled with fun content but is more sutible for people with huge imagination, people who love making stories, or people who love the video game industry as a whole. If you aren't like this but still are intrested wait and see if you can get it on sale.-----------------COMMENTS:-----------------I basically lost my life with this game, 100 hours... anyways I'll go hide in a corner and think about my life desicions, see ya later folks!

												My goodness, I had no idea how hooked to this game I would be when I picked it up.  I purchased Game Dev Tycoon and a handful of other games that were on sale and I ended up trying this one first and did not stop until I had completed it.  This is hands down one of the most addictive games I have ever played, and I really hope there will be a sequel to it. Constantly trying to find the best matches to make the best games, while at the same time being confused when certain combinations did not work.  Not only is the gameplay fun and addictive, but you also get a bit of a nostalgia kick seeing all of the consoles and handhelds released throughout the years while playing through the game.  Crazy to think how much has happened in gaming since it all started.  I highly recommend this game.  While it is a casual game, any one who loves any kind of game should be able to start this up and have a good time playing it.  11/10			"

												Really fun game, it's a must-have for anyone who fancies progression and perfection. The casual and easy nature of the game makes it a choice for most types of gamer's and as you progress further into the game it gets more advanced depending on how far you come.It's a trial and error game, don't expect your first few rounds to be perfect, you will fail and my tip is to always experiment with different combos and also take the advice they give you. It's got plenty of replay-ability, both hidden and visible achievements and there are a number of guides out there if you get stuck.			"

												This game is something else. I'm not a gamer who really enjoys ""Tycoon"" style games, The Sims/Sim City, or anything of that ilk. I bought this game because it was on sale, I love games and the idea of making them and it had a lot of people surprised. So I started it up not sure what to expect and I fell in love with it.It's what I'd call Simulation lite in that it's not super in depth with the customization choices, but it is enough so to make it fun and interesting. You basically follow the exact path of the game industry from the C64 on. You start out only being able to dev simple text based rpgs or 2d Space Sims, but quickly enter the ""Console Generation"" as Nintendo and Sega enter the scene. You'll have to pay licensing costs, but you'll need to in order to make your company a success and get out of the dying C64 market. You need to maintain a steady streak of sales in order to support your next break away hit so that hopefully it won't just be you in your garage anymore. I started out just wanting to see what it was all about, but I got sucked in. I went from, ""I'll just make one game and see what it's all about..."" to ""Just one more..."" to ""Okay. What will my sixth game be about? I need cash!"" It is one of the simplest games you'll play, but done in such a way that you can't help be enjoy the hell out of it.I'm a gamer who plays just about anything, but I focus on RPGs, FPS, Action/Adventure, etc. Even though I don't generally enjoy simulation games, this one is so playable and enjoyable, I don't think it really matters what style of games you enjoy most. It has something for just about everyone.And to the Devs: You are very welcome for the support! =D You people have a bright future if you keep making engrossing little titles like this. Can't wait to see what you do next.			"

												Really funny game. Basicly it is about developing a company whic produces game. So idea is nice and they make it fun during the play. Only part that i dont really like is developing your staff it is not easy and you need to speed lots of time but the game has a limited time so it is a bit down side for the game other than that it is very funny and great game.

												I heard about this game a while back with their brilliantly ironic stunt against game piracy, but hadn't picked it up until very recently.Now that I've played this game, I have to say that I am very impressed. I quite enjoy the simplicity of it, granting the player a great deal of freedom while always having their own goals and targets. In many ways this game returns to the heart of what made simulation games good, back when simulation was the top of the industry. To think that this quality of process was given by a couple of previously unheard of programmers really puts the flaws of modern industry into perspective.Pick this up if you want a simple yet addictive game to toy with the idea of developing other games... No really, it's quite fun.8.9/10			"

												So, Game Dev Tycoon came out on steam and I bought it to see what it was like, and its a lot better than what I expected it to be. It's quite simple really, just develop games and hope that it is succesful. But what Greenheart Games has accomplished is more than that. This game turned out to be very addictive and I ended up playing around 30 hours of it before I started to get bored. The graphics are nothing to smile about, but the gameplay is. As you get better at game development you unlock better things to make your games better. There are also funny spin-offs to real life companies and the game also taps into the rivalries aswell making it unique and new. There are lots of things that you can do in this game and there are some easter eggs which I will let you find for yourself. However it can be quite repetitive at times aswell as  your development team that can get annoying aswell. Personally I think it was generally a good game but I wouldn't recommend to people who are not into game development as it is this games only target audience.8/10			"

												The message of this game is money does not always lead to making a good game. I think the developer shows this message in and out of the game itself. For just over £2 this game is probably the best game I have played this year (I have completed Watch Dogs too). It's simple, easy to play and lets you understand the pressures and decisions that real game companies have to put up with every day. Even in the game, you could spend millions on creating and publishing a game to then find out it's a flop then you go and spend like a 1/4 of the money to create a more simple game and it turns out to be a top hit with the fans. I would 100% recommend this game if you are interested in game development.			"

												Tagging Game Dev Tycoon with the labels 'Simulation', 'Indie' and 'Management' may be accurate.  After all, it is a simulation of managing a game development studio (and a surprisingly engaging one).  But, in reality, these tags don't fully do the game justice.  Like great strategy games, it places a premium on decision making without being punishingly constricting.  It has a vein of self-determination that good RPGs possess (i.e. want to become a megalithic AAA pumping machine, or see how far you can go working alone in your garage?).  It allows for flexible resource management like a good business sim should.  But, most importantly,  this is a game that possesses that just-one-more-turn factor that any good game of its ilk needs.  In this case a turn is really a development cycle, but why quibble?If someone isn't a particular fan of job/business simulators this game still has enough going for it that they're likley to find something to enjoy about it.  At full price the game definitely delivers value for money for fans of the genre.  For others, give it a shot when it's on sale and you likely won't regret it.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is an interesting game to me because sometimes it seemed to make no sense and at other times made all the sense in the world. My first playthrough was a disaster waiting to happen. I invested too much, generally made quirky games for a small cult following, and bought all the technology I didn’t need just because it seemed nice. My game company, SelectoBiz, made it pretty far in the business on some titles that just so happened to do well, but slowly dwindled in sales as I created more and more cult games. I went bankrupt after shamefully trying to do casual games that cost me fans. I became a corporate slave out of desperation… and I paid for it.So, for my next company, Red Bangkok, I decided to be an indie developer. I stayed in my garage for the whole playthrough. I churned out RPGs and simulation games with varying topics. I stuck to computer games only and slowly built up fans. All my games were logical sells, with some personal ones thrown in for fun. This company was my favorite. I would pay maybe 70 thousand for a game that would bring in six million dollars and hordes of fans. I created what I wanted and answered to no one but myself. I made it to the end of the game with 800 thousand fans and around 200 million dollars – and all I had to do was sit at a computer in my garage. It’s a sad game, really. The beginning shows the wonder and innovation explode and the end shows an industry that is making sequels every year. It shows how a tenacious prospect became monotonous. Red Bangkok made no sequels and only brought in a bit of money (compared to its competitors), but it made it to the end. All SelectoBiz did is sell out and die. Sometimes all you need is a garage and a computer, not a studio and hundreds to thousands of employees. Sometimes all you need is a dream and some fresh ideas instead of a bankable property. My biggest advice would be move with your audience and staying small sometimes pays off if you have morals to adhere to. It’s all capitalism in the end, but great things can be done. Even if greatness doesn’t turn out to mean big.			"

												A funny experience! In GDT, you spend your time choosing criterias for games you create. You start from the early 80's, with parodies of console or home computer like the Commodore 64 being the G64 in this game and go until now with the Playstation 4/WiiU/XboxOne. You have to make your company bigger and bigger by creating games. However there is one thing that bothers me, the rating by the critics. It is way random. Sometimes you do a game completely random without thinking about it and you get a 10/10. Sometimes you think about a game or a sequel, you make decisions better than the last episode (about the engine, graphics etc...) and then you get a bad rating. When you create a game in that game (gameception), it is a bit too much about praying for the best.Still a funny experience, I'll probably play that again!			"

This game has been there when I have been bored and it has satisfied my boredom so much. I love this game and it is so good considering it is indie.8/10			"

												If you're going to play this game, make sure you name your game company something hilarious. It's much more fun when you don't take the names seriously. I believe they do not actuall impact your project's success, and there is nothing greater than seeing ""Puppy goes Bye"" get 10s across the board and become one of the greatest selling games in history.Made by the game company ""Ninjalicious Ho ♥♥♥♥♥♥""Give it a shot, you'll have a blast.

												Really fun game, it's a must-have for anyone who fancies progression and perfection. The casual and easy nature of the game makes it a choice for most types of gamer's and as you progress further into the game it gets more advanced depending on how far you come.It's a trial and error game, don't expect your first few rounds to be perfect, you will fail and my tip is to always experiment with different combos and also take the advice they give you. It's got plenty of replay-ability, both hidden and visible achievements and there are a number of guides out there if you get stuck.			"

												This is fun for a bit but really lacks depth and meaningful choices. Everything feels ""scripted"". I know that every tycoon game just hides a “spreadsheet” and is ultimately just about knowing numbers. That doesn’t prevent me to enjoy them in general, but I feel too close to the raw numbers with this game.You do nothing but clicking until you eventually win or lose, there’s no room for player’s creativity, it’s just about numbers, and it also badly lacks hotkeys (too much clicking).The first/second run is pretty good, but if you want to get better and go deeper there's nothing there for you except knowing every combo/number/game mechanics which either you read on the internet or you trial/error every single combo of game/genre/console etc. Once you know the mechanics behind the rating of the games (read on internet) it even feels worse to play.The history part and the first few hours are fine, so I can recommend for casual play if that's what you are looking for. You do get some nice immersion and feel proud when you get a big hit. Get this game if you don't plan to think it over too much. At least it has its niche. Don't get if you want to play a challenging simulation where you want to have meaningful impact and get better.			"

Its kinda fun building a game studio from scratch. start out as a lone indie dev and become a massive game devolper. The game creation aspect is a little wierd and some times just doesnt make sense. you will be pretty sure you kicked out some thing solid and it will flop. so i wish you had more control on what made your game good other then just pick some topics and just hope for the best.Otherwise if you like sim games its worth grabbing.

												A game in which you create, market, produce, and sell games. Outstanding. There are some mods for this game that make it even better thought as is it is still a really good game. If you catch it on sale for anything than what it is listed as, buy it, you will get your moneys worth out of this game.  It is addictive when you first start and your failures only assist in making you strive for success and your success make you strive for even more. Mod in development adds  multiplayer features, there are several other mods constantly adding more engine tools, and game topics to keep the game from becoming the same all the time. If you think you might be interested in this game, then you will probably be very happy with this purchase.			"

												preface:  In this review, keep in mind that I am following release dates to the US-only releases of products. I am not going to include EU or JP release dates due to this games setting being in the US. With that out of the way, let's get on with the review.-Game Dev Tycoon is a indipendence medium-game developed by Greenheart Games. And let me tell you: It's fun and addictive.Game Dev Tycoon is about ''You'' being a video/PC-Game devloper in the post-1983 crash/Atari Shock and working your way up top all the way up to the year ...2018? I think.-[Let's talk about the story]The story isn't mush to talk about.It begins with the post-'83 crash were computer-games survived the disaster, Nintendo reviving  consoles in late-1985, Sega releasing GENESIS in 1989, SONY releases PS1 in late-1995 and so on.The story is abridged though, so some events have been cut-out... such as Apple in the 80/90s, Linux, SEGA Saturn, all the add-ons for the GENESIS and *Panasonics 3DO*Though the 3DO didn't do well in US and EU and is nothing in comparison to GENESIS and SNES, it deserves recognition in gaming history for selling well in Japan.-[Let's talk about the gameplay]When developing a game, you are presented with three development stages and three pillars for each development stage(total of nine pillars).You adjust the pillars  to what works and what doesn't work. Whether you want to focus a lot on gameplay or focus a little on A.I. or don't focus on the story etc.After all the three development stages are done, you then wait for reviews.If you get very bad reviews, then that's going to give you negative fans and make less money depending on the reviews and if you hyped the game before release.If you get great reviews, then you are going to make a lot of money and have a huge following. journalists and critics will mention your great feat and with recognition you will get offers from different people.Game dev Tycoon has a... sort of.. roguelike feel to it. If you mess up in the beginning and make a wrong decision then you could get a game-over.If you make 1M dollars, you then move to an office and hire more staff and make bigger games.Though I think this is a great gameplay mechanic, I still think there are a couple of ''missed opportunities'' in the gameplay that could have been in the game. Such as:-You can't make a launch title. Or/and getting an offer from SONY or Nintendo for an exclusive title.-You can't put a price on a game. -Why can't you make something viral? like spreading a rumour of a hidden room or a mythical creature or something, like GTA with big foot. Or Mortal Kombat with the blood code on SNES.-Why can't you make 2 games at the same time. one small game an a large game for example.-Why can't you make an expansion pack on a normal game? You can make an Exp. pack, but only on MMOs.-Why can't my character have a background? not all companies starter out as one guy like Bungie. Some starter out as three guys such as Blizzard....and so on. I have a mush bigger list in my head of ''missed opportunities'' with GDT. These are a few example.-[Let's talk about the Graphics]Game Dev Tycoons graphics is hand drawn animation. I like Game Dev. Tycoons graphics.-[Let's talk about the music]For a simulator that's all about developing games, the music in this game isn't really that important. Game Dev Tycoons music is relaxing and kind to your ears.-[Before I give my ''Final Score'', I would like to say something]GDT opened up my point of view of how it looks like when developing a game. Before I played GDT I thought ''Ok... developers keep saying in interviews that the reason they can't make a sequel is because it's NOT that easy'' and I am all like ''well... maybe they're just saying that because they just want to make money and don't really care about the fans''. And after I played GDT, I finally understood what developers were saying about ''It's NOT that easy''.-[Final Score]GDT is a great game... but I feel like there were a lot of missed oppertunities. But it can be forgiven because of the addicive gameplay and for being an indie-game. I didn't like that the story was abridged and your main-character was ''another avarage Joe''. That's why I give GDT a ''great'' 8.5/10 and a ''recommended'' for anybody.I can reccommend game dev. Tycoon to anybody, even casuals. Even If you're not familiar with Simulations. And also, if you have the motivation to learn and such, then GDT is for you.[Here is an idea I have for ''Greenheart Games'' if they ever make a sequel]If Greenheart Games ever make a sequel to GDT or an Exp. Pack. Then I am would like them to add those ''missed opportunities'' that I talked about in the ''gameplay''-section.I would also like the sequel/exp. pack to follow the gaming history more accurately.-...And that's my review of GDT. Peace out and have a good one.			"

												A lot of the reviews for Game Dev Tycoon criticize it for being a blatant rip-off of a popular game on mobile devices - having played both I agree that the game is almost entirely unoriginal.  Does it matter?  I don't think so, should no one else be allowed to make a city simulator because Maxis made SimCity first?  The fact is this game is a lot of fun.PROS:-Good graphics.  Really pretty.  Not going to max out your gpu, but the cartooney style looks nice-Sound.  Its hard to explain but the music and all the little sound effects are really pleasant.  It'll keep you from getting fatigued.-Re-playability.  You might put in say 10 or 20 hours and feel like you have done it all, but like other sims you should be able to come back at a later date and have lots of fun all over again.CONS:-Some of the genre/topics don't work when they should.  Like Werewolf and RPG is a terrible combo - Why?  Ever heard of ""Wolf Among Us?""-The game isn't very random, you could basically play THE EXACT same strategy and turn of events each play through and have the same outcome-The whole game is based on your title's scores.  The scores are based upon your previous scores.  I really don't like this, by the end of the game it becomes harder and harder to get titles earning 10/10 marks.  In other words, to get a second 10/10 game it has to be better than the previous 10/10 game.Overall - this game is really fun and I definitely recommend it to sim fans of any type.			"

												My goodness, I had no idea how hooked to this game I would be when I picked it up.  I purchased Game Dev Tycoon and a handful of other games that were on sale and I ended up trying this one first and did not stop until I had completed it.  This is hands down one of the most addictive games I have ever played, and I really hope there will be a sequel to it. Constantly trying to find the best matches to make the best games, while at the same time being confused when certain combinations did not work.  Not only is the gameplay fun and addictive, but you also get a bit of a nostalgia kick seeing all of the consoles and handhelds released throughout the years while playing through the game.  Crazy to think how much has happened in gaming since it all started.  I highly recommend this game.  While it is a casual game, any one who loves any kind of game should be able to start this up and have a good time playing it.  11/10			"

												Game Dev Tycoon: think you can build the best games?It starts off slow: you're in a garage, with only so many topics open. You churn out game after game to earn your living.Then you get your first big hit. You hire an employee or two. You start to experiment more. And when you realize you're just one number off from the perfect hit, you start to analyze, tweak your formula a little and go ""just one more game"".Admittedly, it's not for everyone. You're going to spend a lot of time watching bubbles, watching charts and watching numbers spin. You'll probably grind for a while, just trying to keep the money flowing. But if you enjoy a strategy game that slowly gets more complicated and clever and makes you wonder how to do just a *little* bit better, here we go.			"

Wish the end game was better, once I can produce monster success I can repeat the formula forever.  However, I'm just wishing the game was longer which I have done before.If you have ever enjoyed anything that starts with Sim or ends with Tycoon, this game will rock your world. "

												Não tem gráficos excelentes, não tem cutscenes nem jogabilidade dignas de registo. É um Tycoon simples. Mas... tão bem estruturado. É uma espécie de história da indústria dos videojogos, desde as primeiras máquinas às consolas e PCs topos de gama da actualidade. O tipo de jogos a desenvolver, a sua temática, o motor de jogo, o tipo de som, história, inteligência artificial, etc, etc... todos os pequenos pormenores acabam por entrar, de uma maneira ou de outra, no jogo. E, claro, há tipos de jogos que combinam com determinado tema e outros que funcionam de forma desastrosa. Não se faz um simulador de música, nem um RPG de corridas de carros. Há que acertar na escolha dos jogos a desenvolver e depois no tempo atribuído às diversas fases do seu desenvolvimento. Envolvente, e interessante, capaz de nos manter agarrados a jogar durante bastante tempo.É um excelente jogo casual, que surpreende pela positiva e entretém durante horas.			"

												The game is really good developed. I bought the game before it was on Steam and was chained to the pc right away to keep playing the game.When I just started the game I used to go bankrupt everytime I started to grow but eventually I got better at the game and how to place the sliders for the different genres. (This was before the Game reports were added that revieled what is good and bad for a game). After a long time I managed to finish the game just to continue to see how much my MMO could make to finally get in the figures that even Bill Gates money looks like a dime.Even though the game is not always a 'correct' simulation of the real world it gives a lot of good information for people like me that want to start his/her own game company. If I could only work as hard as the no-life character you play in the game I wouldn't need to worry about anything anymore.			"

												Game Dev Tycoon is a very unique game. You are in charge of a gaming company that you start in your garage all on your lonesome. After a few good games or one big hit game you will be able to upgrade to an office and hire some employees.  You will have to research new game topics, new engines, and many other things along the way.  Though the game may be hard at times your effort will be rewarded if you work hard and make great games.			"

												I made a few games before going bankrupt, never gaining enough success or money to make it out of my garage. Sounds about right. A++ simulator.			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game.It isn't the most in depth simulation title out there, and it has its fair share of design issues and bugs (which admittedly get better with the patches) but for the most part its a good game. It deserves a much higher metacritic score, as evidenced by the much higher average userscore for the game on metacritic.It's fun, cutesy, and easy to learn to play.I'd recommend that everyone who can, should by this game, if only to support a new start up studio that clearly has talent.

												Simple, addicting, and will give you a lesson on video game history in the process as well as letting you write it's future. Good luck making that 10/10 Masterpiece.			"

												I can say that Game Dev Tycoon has been a favourite for me over the past few days. It is simple to understand and the goals are challenging to leave you attatched to your screen for hours on end to try and get the perfect 4, 10 out of 10 reviews (which I still haven't achieved). It is ongoing and I can't wait for the next Tycoon game instalment.			"
