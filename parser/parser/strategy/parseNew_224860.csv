												Simply disgraceful.Completely ignore this pile of garbage and play Breach & Clear instead for a few bucks more if you like turn based combat. This has nothing to do with either ARMA or tactics of any sorts whatsoever.			"

												Terrible interface, arbitrary mechanics, glitchy engine, dull art design, 2005 era graphics, and a boring campaign.  Yep, it's another a bad port of a bad tablet game.  Just forget this one ever happened.If you really want this kind of game, Breach and Clear did it decently.			"

												It's something that's simple enough for a person who's not familiar with tactical turn based strategy games to use as an introduction, but it's simply lacking in complexity for any person who is a veteran of tactical turn based games.Also, it's just a cheap port of a mobile game, so go figure.If you're a fan of the genre, feel free to skip  over this unless you really want another game to play.  If you're new, it's a decent starting game, but I would still suggest trying to get into a better game like X-COM.			"

												I really wanted to recommend this game, and be a positive review in all the bashing but I just can't, this is a turn based tactical strategy game but you can never count on tactical play, it's only luck. Enemies will spot you from ridiculous spots like from behind three walls or they will spot you coming from behind even if they are looking the other way, and sometimes you will run in front of them and they won't spot you, but other than that I liked the graphics, the animations the sounds, the equipments and the leveling system, the whole gameplay idea is not bad even though in close places sometimes you miss click an action because of bad ports.The story is basically two operations for a total of 10 missions, you can as well play free missions to level up your operators, your shooting is affected by distance and the skill of the operator on this particular gun but what's the point if the main purpose of the game, the 'tactical strategy' part is broken.

												This game could be fun but needs a lot of improvement. The mechanics and content are very limited, and most importantly there are a lot of issues.This game is a badly done smartphone port. The controls are uncomfortable on a computer, and there's issues with the camera. For example, it's sometimes difficult to position the camera properly to see under/around parts of the terrain, such as the bridge in the first mission of the second campaign.There are also several game-breaking bugs that make it hard, if not impossible, to complete missions. I've seen enemies shooting through roofs and even enemies triggering cut scenes and events that only the player is supposed to trigger, thus ruining a long and difficult mission just near the end, and making it impossible to complete the first mission of a campaign.The devs don't seem to respond to bug reports anymore and have apparently left these game-breaking bugs there for the players to deal with.Don't buy this game, unless you like bugs or enjoy spending money on a game that cannot be completed.

												First of all, we all need to remember that this game was actually made for mobile devices and this is one of the reasons why I won't judge it as harshly, I suppose. The question, however, is do I recommend it? As you can see by the big symbol over this ""review"" I do. I do, but to a certain type of people.Firstly, if you are a big (so called ""hardcore"") tactical strategy player ARMA Tactics is not for you. It's simple, easy and fast. But, if you are like me and are quite new to the genre it is a good starting point. As far as graphics go...they're pretty bad for a PC game (again, remember that this is a port of a mobile game) but they get the job done. You don't need insanely good graphics to enjoy this type of game so that's all I'm going to say about that.Gameplay is what we are looking for here. Is it good, you ask. It's...decent, I say. It doesn't require some amazing set of tactician skills. You basically move your squad around, shoot some people, heal if you need to and you will rarely need to heal if you put some thought into it. What I like is that the game gives you good feedback. If there are enemies around you, you see an indication on your screen that shows you whether he's in line of sight, the hit chance percentege and you can click on the bullseye to see where he is. When you finish a mission you get rewarded XP to level up your team's skills and credits to buy different weapons, medkits, grenades and the likes, so there is some progression.Sound is decent, again. The voice acting gets weird sometimes and I'm astounded by how much one of your soldiers sounds like Bear Grylls. Other than that - silenced, unsilenced gunshots, grunts and moans and other battle-related sounds.To sum it all up, it's not exactly a tactical game, more of a ""squad control simulator"" but it's decent for newer tactics gamers like me. I haven't encountered any major bugs but I guess, seeing the other reviews, I might have been lucky so far. So yes, I can recommend it to newer players but if you're a veteran tactical game player stay away from it.			"

												Turn-based tactical game about squad of 4 shooters, engaging in some minor conflicts across the world. It wears an ""Arma"" name, for it was made by the same Bohemia studio, which shipped the whole ""Arma"" games series. As it turns out, in the end it become something like unwanted child, which is not deserving to be left behind, but appears as burden to its creators and developers...I was very surprised when found that game already in my library while I was searching through Steam for something like ""Jagged Alliance"". I can swear I neither heard about that game before, nor that I planned to buy it. I guess it was one of those bundles, where I was totally distracted by one desired game, and others were bought ""just because"". Anyway, the Steam search machine finally highlighted me that addition in my collection, and I decided to investigate.So I've read the info about the game. Majority of the reviews up to this date are negative, but named reasons wasn't enough for me. I decided to give it a shot... Well, now I can say I wasn't enjoyed playing this game myself.What is good about it? First, it looks like modern XCOM Enemy Unknown for many aspects of gameplay, which makes a process of understanding game’s basics a really brief job. In other words, you’ll get by very quickly after the start. Second, it is a very fine usage of Unity engine. Game really looks great, especially when compared to the representatives of the same class, turn-based squad tactical games. And when we are talking about mobile platforms with Tegra technology. But that praise concerns ONLY visual decals part, not the thorough in-game mechanics. For that people of Bohemia really should take some classes before selling to PC players something with that lack of deepness.I feel I’m spending too much time for this project, so, let’s be brief from now on:-	Easy to adopt – considering how little content there are, once you complete one or two missions, you’ll basically see everything that game has. Even if you want a complete, with all achievements in your pocket, it could be done in less than 10 hours, depending from your skill.-	It is 3d game, with quite good visuals – and the fact that almost all of the best squad tactics games are from previous isometric era… well, as previous, it is not a “Pro” point, as those visuals are good only for mobile standards for modern games. At PC they are just tolerable.-	As we are remembering old games of this genre, like Jagged Alliance or Silent Storm, they are so much cooler in every aspect, so much deeper in every given pixel, and so much more capable to capture your time, that I really don’t want to go further with comparisons.-	As of tactical component of Arma Tactics, well, it is quite dim – and all because of non-competing AI. And if we are speaking of realism there… there are very little types (and models) of weapons in the game, and all of them are so short-sighted, that even sentry fellas armed only with sniper rifles – or they will be missing every shot in more than 10 meters! Yeah, guards patrolling with SVD, so natural as life will never be.-	Finally, bugs section. Community full of complaints about something not working properly, but I’ve played the game after two years after its PC release, and was able to make through all game missions without major problems. Well, before the very last one, Damned Dam. There I killed everybody, lined my toy soldiers after the truck, into the exit zone… and nothing! And then I discovered that there are two builds in the game, and I was able to finally finish the game only with “beta” build, because on the major build final cutscene was lost somewhere… Epic fail for Bohemia, though not the first and not the last one, obviously. From other, not so significant issues, I can call unfitted control, where I need to click many times to finally make something happen – like walking close to some object, would that be an enemy or just a crate with pocket money. Irritating, but manageable.Conclusion: while game is not a total mess, it is worth any interest only on the mobile devices. PC port appeared buggy and totally not on the level with the PC games of the same genre. Gold with achievements is attainable, yet I would not be proud with that badge. My mark is 5.56/10.			"

												I purchased this game at the 2013 Xmas sale, but didn't play it right away. The game has since been included in a Bohemia Interactive Humble Weekly Sale, so the game may have gained a number of players since its release.It always saddens me when I have to write a negative critique about a GNU/Linux game (even if it's a proprietary one), but this game was very buggy and really left me with no choice... so here goes it.The first problem I noticed was when tossing a grenade from behind cover. Although the line indicating where the grenade would be thrown looked fine, the grenades would always hit the cover you were behind and you would blow yourself up. By the time I completed the game, I had probably killed my team members with grenades more than the enemy. Needless to say, I didn't use them much.Shortly thereafter, I discovered that I wasn't unlocking any Steam achievements. Some people in the forums indicate that they also have this problem occasionally, but even though I completed the game I never obtained a single achievement. I personally like collecting achievements so I found this particularly frustrating.Completing the first campaign (out of the two included) didn't take very long. After completing the last level of the first campaign, the stats screen appeared (as it normally did at the end of each level) except there was no Continue button. This made sense since it was the last level, and it still had two other buttons - ""Restart"" and ""Main Menu"". Clicking Main Menu did absolutely nothing. I didn't want to restart, and I didn't want to lose my progress, so I did the only thing I could immediately think to try ran the kill command on the game process ID.Unfortunately, that didn't save my progress either. Possibly a SIGQUIT instead of a SIGTERM would have been better, but in any case I had to replay that level from scratch... and when I completed it a second time I had the same issue reappear yet again! This time around I pressed ALT+F4 to close the program, and that command did enable the game to save my progress and unlock the next campaign. Presumably ALT+F4 is the equivalent of a SIGQUIT.A couple of levels later and I came to a mission whereby I was instructed to send two soldiers to one exit on the map, and two to another exit. I tried this many many times, and every time the level would freeze. Not cool. Eventually (searching through the game forums) I discovered that the only way to complete the level was to ignore the mission objectives and just kill everyone on the level. That wasn't hard, but it took time to find some of the enemies hiding and it was certainly not obvious that doing this would have any impact on the game not working.One other problem I noticed throughout the entire game was that sometimes the lines which indicate how far you can move in a turn would not appear. Sometimes they would be completely missing, and other times just part of the lines were missing. This was certainly an annoyance when it occurred, and by the end of the second campaign it had happened a lot.The last annoyance that I'll write about here was that the soldiers would often not do what I wanted them to. If I only wanted them to move a tiny bit, and next to one of the other soldiers, the soldier I was commanding would more often than not heal the nearby soldier without moving at all. In later levels where mortars can take out multiple soldiers in close proximity, it's can be very difficult to select the man you wish to revive. The mouse just didn't seem to do what I wanted it to do when the soldiers were bunched together, which only added to the above frustrations.In summary, this game is seriously buggy. Due to the massive amount of bugs you will certainly encounter, this game is stripped from much of the fun that would normally have been enjoyed. Even if this game was bug-free, this would not have been an amazing game (it doesn't have multiplayer, there's not a lot of depth, the enemies are really stupid, you can easily miss shooting somebody standing right in front of you, etc.). Even on the GNU/Linux operating system, you could likely do better than ARMA Tactics for a turn-based game. eg. Expeditions: Conquistador looks like it could be good, and of course there's always The Battle for Wesnoth[wesnoth.org].The bottom line: Steer clear!			"

												This game unlike other ARMA games is totaly not worth of playing / buying.Game is full of bugs, and graphics are bad and there's still lot of work to do on this game.- Campaings are short and they really don't make any sense- Graphics are bad- Soldiers can get stuck for some reason and you can't do anything else but to restart whole game- In game it says ""Saving""... i wonder where it saves checkpoints cuz you can only restart whole mission and play it from beginning- Accuracy is badly coded i guess.... it says 90% of killing enemy and it totaly misses the target- When it's your turn to move soldiers, enemies can still move if they detect you, BUT if you detect enemies you don't have chance to move your soldiers- In most cases when enemy detects you they will automaticaly fire on you, and they will hit you even through the wall, BUT if your soldiers detect enemies, they rarely shoot at them automaticaly, which is a total blow- Achievements are badly coded... mines in game are being recognized as grenades for some reason, and when you want to kill 2 or more enemies with one greande, you can't even do that, cuz grenade DEALS only up to 50% of damage, and radius is small, and when you actualy manage to do that, it doesn't even count as achievement- Silencers in this game are non-existent, which means you can't even have them, even tho you bought them and applied them.- Enemies can see you sometimes when they have their backs turned on you (i guess some of enemies have eyes on their backs)- Developers obviously never heard of casualties of war, cuz if one of your teammates dies missions will automaticaly fail... ONLY TWO SHORT CAMPAIGNS, BAD STORY, BAD VOICE ACTING, POORLY MADE... NOT WORTH OF 7€, NOT WORTH OF ANY MONEY UNTIL IT'S FIXED!			"

Wait for this game to hit a special of under $10 and buy it.That being said buy it right now at the time of writing this the cost is $8.99 and I think that game even broken is worth it.I do not feel it is worth $14 in a state where I can not complete the game.If you could complete the game I would pay over $30 for it.

												The game is relatively short.  But you can replay it.  I had a great time playing it.  It has a Demo if you want to try it out before you buy it.  Recommended.If you have problems starting the game set the version to developer mode to get it to work.  Right click on game in your steam library and look at the different tabs.  Similar to setting it to how you would set other games to beta mode in the steam profile, only its called developer mode instead of beta mode. I'm hoping they come out with more missions and add ons.			"

												""Let's make a mediocre turn-based tactics game and slap the ArmA brand on it!""That's the game in a nutshell. It has nothing to do with ArmA and it doesn't even remotely offer the depth of an ArmA game.The gameplay mechanics are pretty similiar to the new XCOM. Everyone of your soldiers has two actions per turn. You can move, shoot or use an item, reload your weapon, etc.. You can, of course, use both your actions to move further or take an aimed shot, too.Just like XCOM, it also relies heavy on the use of cover and just like in XCOM there is also high and low cover, high cover of course providing more protection.You also don't need to worry about ammo, as you have unlimited, but you need to reload, when you've emptied your weapons. Items like grenades or explosives have to be bought before a mission from the armory. You can also upgrade your weapons or buy new ones, but be aware that you can only use one weapon at a time. There are only four weapons, btw: an assault rifle, a LMG, a sniper rifle and a shotgun. There are also no sidearms. You do have a knife though, which you can use in close combat.Your team always consists of the same four people. If anyone dies, it's game over and you can restart the mission. None of them is able to climb even the smallest obstacle. If you can't reach a place by walking, you won't get there. Oh, and if you decide to restart a mission, you lose the items you have used. Yes, whatever you have used, be it grenades, medkits or something else, are gone and you need to buy them again, which is utter stupid. If you restart a mission you should get the gear, with which you've started the mission, back.Now let's talk about the AI, shall we? They are incredibly stupid. They love to run out of cover and right at you. Quite often they even shoot with their first action and THEN come closer to you. I've also witnessed them running into cover with their first action and with their second action they ran out of cover again...Also more than once the AI wouldn't react to getting shot. They'd just stand there, doing nothing. They also seem to be deaf as they often don't react to gunshots, even if they should be in hearing range.And the game seems to be quite buggy, too. On one mission I was teleported to the objective, while it was the enemy's turn, which pretty much broke the game, so I had to load the last save, which didn't help, because the game teleported me AGAIN. It did that also a third time, although that time it was actually my turn, which didn't help me much, because I was surrounded by enemies.Another time I healed a character from across the level. And another time one of my grenades landed UNDER the floor, where it exploded and did nothing. And while we're at grenades: it seems sometimes you can't throw them over cover for no apparent reason.I'm not going much into the graphics, as the game is a mobile port, but it looks bad. It's pretty much the same with the sound design. The voice acting is pretty bad and the subtitles often don't match what they're actually saying.The camera is also quite bad.All in all, this is a really bad game. If you really want a TBT game, you're MUCH better off with XCOM. And if you want the, imo, best in the genre, get Jagged Alliance 2. Combined with patch 1.13 this is by far the best TBT game you can get, even though it doesn't look like much nowadays.			"

												Arma Tactics was ported from the smartphone for the PC in 2013. It differs from other Arma titles by being a point and click, turn-based game. You control up to 4 members of a squad who you use to overcome a variety of objectives. Each member has different abilities. Characters can purchase upgrades and level up based on experience points. In all it isn't a bad port, unlike Deus Ex: The Fall which was horrible. Arma Tactics is different but interesting and when played on a smartphone probably is a pretty decent game. As a PC game, it strays so far from the Arma format, the name and the military theme are about all it has in common with the rest of the series. If you are a fan of the Arma series, you might not like Arma Tactics; However, if you enjoy turn-based tactical games, it is probably right up your alley. As a game it is decent and deserves a thumbs up, even if it isn't a game I would personally choose to play.			"

												It starts with funny rag-doll-glitches, broken Steam-Awards, etc.pp.Obvious bugs all over the game (since years!).Also - it feels way too simple (and boring) for such a complex topic.The controls are glitchy (for best result: rather drag&drop than double-click).Graphics are .... cheap?!(And cheap graphics are okay, as long as they are functional. But in this game, it feels like the engine tries to hinder you actively.)Nuff said.So: no, no, no. Thanks, but NO!!!!Breach and Clear does it better, Door Kickers feels better, but back in the days I would prefer Jagged Alliance and XCom.Actually, almost *any* turn-based tactical game does a better job than this one.PS: I have no idea how ""Arma"" made its way into the title.Game-wise this is not related to the classical ARMA in any way.PPS: The action-cam was actually something I liked, but soon this gets boring  too.

												OKaay i will be straight forward. No unbalanced thoughts just straight forward. This game is just wayy to fun for me. The only doubts you will encounter is most of time the options are limited like the can't vault over walls and such and the animations aren't the best their just okay but it's because this was an android game too. Someparts are kind off annoying because sometimes they just miss all the time when shooting and or have weakshots, but thats why you gotta upgrade them. But all in forward this is a great casual game. I will spoil this for fun but the last mission in the first operation everyone is armed with the SVD Sniper rifle. So be prepared unlike me even though i did suceed unprepared.EDITAfter coming back, i forgot that 85% of the time they miss with the 1 shot option, but have a greater chance when you use 2 AP points.

												In this game you command a spec-ops team on a hilarious mission to take down a menacing group of super soldiers with X-ray vision, hearing that would put your best Doberman Pinscher to shame and smart bullets capable of hitting you from off the map, around corners, thru multiple walls and while crouched behind elevated cover. Apparently, these super soldiers are also expert computer hackers. So good, in fact, that they can actually hack into your game and delete your save files. Really crafty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, these super soldiers.Hands down, one of the most broken games on Steam. BI's willingness to sell you this garbage is a pretty good indication of their integrity. Things might be different if there was a note from the developer on the store page that said something like ""Hey guys, this is a PC port of a mobile game and it's really, really broken. We don't have any plans to actually fix it, as you can see, but watching some of the stupid ♥♥♥♥ that happens in this game is still pretty good for a laugh so we think $0.50 is fair.""LMAO! No!			"

VERDICT: A niche combat oriented game.  Simple yet comphrensive mechanics.  With lite roleplay and modest inventory options.  The game engine is solid if unimpressive.  Its an average game but it could have been the base for something greater.  Just a shame really that it wasnt successful enough for the developer to build upon it.  Dont expect it to be the next XCom or Jagged Alliance.  If you want something cheap, short and casual then its perfectly adequate.NOTE: Last four broken achievements have been fixed. (Aug 11, 2015)...01. GENRE: Tactical, squad, turn-based strategy game with lite roleplay elements.02. SETTING: Modern Day/Contemporary generic Middle-Eastern/North Africa.03. STORY/BACKGROUND: Take control of a squad of four army soldiers who must defeat generic terrorists in a variety of missions.04. GAME MODES: Singleplayer only.  Two five mission campaigns of around 1/2h to 3/4h each.  There is also a random mission generator where the team can face different objectives on different maps.05. GAMEPLAY: The Arma Tactics experience can be summed up as being; Ready your team.  Begin next mission. Complete one or more objectives. Keep your squad alive.  Kill or sneak past any enemies encountered.  Receive experience points and credits.  Boost your squads abilities.  Buy equipment, weapons or upgrades.  Rinse and repeat.  Main aspects of gameplay involve movement and firearm based combat.  Supplemental actions add to the tactical play including: throwing grenades, planting mines, healing and reviving fallen comrades.  Inventory customization plays a small yet satisfying part of the game, allowing players to choose a weapon type for each soldier even if its from only four.  An additional four slots per soldier allow add. equipment to be carried, increasing the tactical options available.Mission failure occurs if a team member dies.  The game has a good tutorial if you are unused to this type of game.06. MECHANICS: Core gameplay consist of standard tactical options.  Each soldier has two action points during a turn.  They can move or shoot, stab, heal, throw grenades, revive a dying soldier, plant or detonate claymore mine, take cover, attach silencers or reload ammo.  Line-of-sight adds a much needed layer of tactical playing and an element of stealth as the A.I. always begins unawares.  The steamlined nature of combat is a real draw.  Select soldier, select target, choose shot type (aimed or snap).  It keeps the action flowing.  Soldiers that do not use all their (two) action points have a chance of a interrupt if an enemy attacks in range and in sight.  Any team member who loses all their health can be revived by another member of the team though, this must be done quickly within a time limit or they will expire. XP and credits are awarded for completing missions. XP is used to upgrade skills which affect action success.  These include: 4 weapon skills, tactical movement, medic, grenades, explosive and hand-to-hand combat.Credits can be spent on purchasing weapons other than starting M-16 assualt rifles or upgrading eapons to boost their effectiveness with: larger ammo capacity, telescopic sights and silencers.  In additional consumable items such as: smoke, stun and frag grenades, medical kits, revive syringes, proximity and remote detonate claymores can be purchased to augment the tactical options available to each soldier. 07. A.I: Static with quick response options when an enemy spots a member of your team.  Namely it will usually kamikaze attack but look to flee if fire upon and alone.  As placement of enemies is pre-determined the A.I. doesnt have to be clever. While I would say it is robust it doesnt go far enough to provide a taxing challenge but I doubt it the game was ever designed to do that.08. GRAPHICS: Visually the game is fine.  Graphics are nothing amazing but in keeping with the general setting.  Models especially enemies are a variation on a standard.  Weapons are distinctly drawn.  Maps including furniture and terrain are fine if nothing special.  09. G.U.I/CONTROLS: Overall the G.U.I is fine.  Its standard select, point-and-click fare.  Aspects of combat such as choosing your shot type or performing an action other than shooting (healing, cover, reloading) is oriented around the focal point.  This I like.  Perhaps the worst aspect of the game is the sometimes fiddly nature of selecting the target spot when you move. Sometimes the click doesnt register and it can be annoying as hell.10. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: Basic enviromental noises.  No music in game.11. VOICE ACTING: Okay.  Probably one of the better aspects of the game.  The members of your squad render dialogue at key points in the mission, namely at the start, end and the completion of mission objectives.12. DIFFICULTY: There are no difficulity ratings.  The game is overall is pretty easy for a veteran tactical/strategy gamer. There are a few achievements that require some care and forethought but once the mechanics and the limitations of the A.I are understood, these should not be a problem.  If you are having problems then you can play a few short generated missions to upgrade your skills and buy better equipment or upgrades.13. PLAYTIME: You can complete the campaigns in between 6-10h.  It will take you less time if you do not replay the campaign missions, dont try out some of the random mission to buff your squad or dont aim to complete all the achievements.   My run took 15h but I replayed several campaign missions, played around a dozen randomly generated levels to earn additional xp to buff my team and earn extra credits to spend on equipment and weapon upgrades when I need to replay a mission.14. PROBLEMS: No major issues during my playthrough.  Perhaps the biggest gripe is the G.U.I. when selecting the location to move soldiers.  It can be tricky at the worst of times and cause a mistake to serverely hamper your mission progress.  That said though if you're careful you should be okay.15. ACHIEVEMENTS: The game has achievements but the developer/publisher hasnt setup their store page correctly to show them.  Of the twenty-two two are campaign based, four are objectives based and the others are action-based (kill x soldiers with a weapon, heal team members y times, etc.) 16. DLC: None and there are unlikely to be any.17. FUN FACTOR: There is a fair amount of fun in commanding your squad through each mission.  Squad and inventory/equipment manage is pretty good.  Despite its fairly casual nature I would wager definitely only fans of the genre are going to like it.  If you are drawn here by the 'Arma' in the title, stop.  Dont be.  It really couldnt be more different.  18. CHALLENGE: The game only provides a taxing challenge in the later levels when enemies are deployed in larger numbers and in greater proximity.  Even then it is rather forgiving in that you can restart the game with your squad intact and only equipment used missing from your inventory. There are no other penalties.  If you ever find yourself out of credits to purchase equipment you may need, a few runs on the mission generator will be enough. The final two missions have a nice twist to them. :)19. LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY: Fairly low as despite having a random mission generator, playing and replaying the same missions does eventually get tiresome.  Especially once youve boosted your squads stats to their max. and have enough credits to buy every item, weapon and upgrade there is.20. VALUE FOR MONEY: Not worth it at full price but not far off.  The game is too short and only worth the consideration at 50% or more discount.			"

												I do not quite understand the title of the game, because neither it is ArmA, nor it requires any tactics due to AI being so dumb it basically runs towards your bullets (if it doesn't get stuck in an environment).

												As a mad Fallout Tactics fan I just had to get this. At it's original release it was a little limiting and had a few game breaking bugs which probably leads to it's initial bad wrap. Do not be fooled however, this game has come a long way with updates, and extra campaigns. This is well worth the asking price now if not more so ($8.99 at time of writing). If turn based shooters like Xcom, Jaggard Alliance and Fallout are your thing add this to your library.			"

												Bought this game beause I enjoyed playing XCOM so much.  If you liked XCOM and are wanting more squad focused, turn-based strategy then do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  The game does not flow well at all, no thanks to the poorly designed maps and an interface that leaves much to be desired.  Your men get 2 'action points' per turn.  However each AP is only worth about 5 feet of actual movement, combined with the narrow maps and you are left with your squad inches from each other at all times.  The game has clearly been designed with close combat in mind, but when your ""highly trained"" soldier constantly misses enemies literally 5 feet from him it just comes off as rushed and poorly put together.  Combine that with the terrible voice acting/storyline and the cutscenes where characters talk without moving anything, let alone their mouth, and you are left with a game that is not only unplayable, but not worth playing in the first place.

												You should know that this is actually a port of a mobile game. It's simplified, but it still enjoyable enough. No, it's not Jagged Allience, and it's no where near the full Arma games, but it works. There is a good deal of frustation when it comes to the interface. It's not good about telling you how many AP remain, nor how much you'll spend moving to a given point. More than likely, you'll find yourself moving to places accidentally, ruining whole turns.Don't buy it at full price, but on sale for a buck or two, it's not bad.			"

												This is a game that i'll be playing a lot more when (if) I'll be old. It takes 1 friggin' hour to complete 1 (ONE) mission, and usually by that 1 hour point something bad happens, like suddenly, an ambush of 4 enemies out of nowhere, a sniper that you didn't see yet went past him ten times, the second coming of jesus, and so on. Long story short, you're gonna loose (a lot), and you're gonna have to start all over again right from the beginning of the mission! such fun!But seriously, if you dig games like Gorky 17 and Jagged Alliance, then this is your best bet.

												Could have been good. Could have been the best turn based military tactics game ever if they had maintained the level of content and editing tools of the rest of the Arma series. Honestly what they did is develop a dumbed down and featureless copy of Xcom: Enemy Unknown with a reskin. So what's wrong with it?*Campaign takes about 1-3 hours to beat depending on your abilities or familiarity with tactics games.*You are stuck with your squad of the same 4 soldiers for the entire game. There are no allied NPCs. *No permadeath*Absolutely no customization options outside of choosing which one of 4-5 guns your soldier is going to bring on a mission*Terrible voice acting - as is Arma tradition*Absolute disregard for military accuracy. Which military is this? That camo does not exist. Why would a 4 man fireteam be tasked with ANY of these ridiculous missions? Whats right with this game?*It is literally the ONLY turn based tactics game set in a modern infantry setting. If you're a sucker for turn based tactics, I'm sure there have been worse. If it's on sale and you just can;t help yourself, you wont entirely regret all of it.  "

												Arma Tactics was a mobile game backported to PC, and somehow it is extremely buggy with rage-quit worthy frustrations despite a decent tactical game under the whole thing. it cannot be recommended until the bugs are fixed. Arma Tactics is a turn-based tactical combat game where you command your fireteam of soldiers in combat against terrorists and guerillas and mercenaries in some generic African country full of slums and such. There are two campaigns (each of which are composed of 5 distinct missions, albeit linked) and once you've played through the mission once, it becomes available as a quick battle. The actual tactical battle happens on a full 3D battlefield, with multiple levels of elevation (i.e. you can walk to the roof / upper floor, and in case of bridges or dams, 3 levels of height difference). The buildings can often be walked into with alternate exits, and alternate paths are almost always present, so flanking, when possible, is highly recommended. Your soldiers automatically goes into cover when you send up leaning up against columns, door ledges, K-rails, basically anything that may shield them from bullets. They will still get hit, but will take less damage if they do get hit. However, the drag to move interface means you have to wiggle slightly to get the soldier to lean up against the cover properly, and sometimes, they will simply face the wrong way, and there's nothing you can do about it. Each soldier gets two action points per turn, and moving 5 meters is considered an action, as well as actions like throw grenade, reload, shoot, and so on. Shooting has an additional option, use 1 action for quick shot, or use both actions for aimed shot and higher accuracy. After each mission you can purchase skill points with your accumulated XPs, and if you have credits, you can buy upgrades for your weapons as well as additional weapons such as sniper rifle, combat shotgun, as well as more exotic weapons like remote controlled Claymore mine and regular Claymore trip mine, plus other equipment. Furthermore, credits can also be used to buy upgrades for the weapons, which improves them to all users of that weapon type. And you earn about 500+ credits and about 150 XP if you win a mission.  As the namesake suggests, your need to employ proper infantry tactics such as move and fire, overwatch, proper use of cover, stealth vs. loud, and so on. The problem is there are many different bugs in the game that prevents a full enjoyment. Ragdoll physics are often hilarious as a kill would often find the body started shaking and dancing all over the place, probalby due to some polygonal collision issues, which in turn leads to even more hilariosu results, such as a dead body fying 25 ft into the air and 25 feet sideways, or a wounded soldier managed to shoot me withOUT a rifle (the rifle fell off after that shaking and dancing after a knife hit) Mechanics of attaching / detaching silencer was never properly explained, or that you automatically get silencer if you complete the first campaign. Another point of hilarity is how the smoke from a smoke-grenade is solid enough to bounce off other grenades. I wanted to throw a grenade through the smoke to land at enemy's feet, but my grenade bounced off the smoke... twice. On the other hand, at other times, it won't bounce. A throw that should have bounced off the door instead went THROUGH the door instead, wasting the grenade. These are relatively minor problems though, because there are big ones, such as how the game refused to end a mission even when one guy is standing on top of the exit zone, and thus causing me to lose that mission. The interface also coudl use a bit of help as it's clearly NOT optimized for mouse, and how various things are hidden under lays of menu and clicks. and such. Camera is movable but hard to control when you got to the ""edges"" of the playable level. Sound is rather lame, and voice acting is quite bad. Graphics are quite good All in all, while there seems to be a good game under all these bugs, in its present form it can't be recommended when there are games like XCOM  that does the tactical combat much better.

												I will first start out by saying that I am not a fan of the stratergy genre so that has influence my view on Arma Tactics. Firstly the tutorial is worthless, you end up skipping most of the ""lessons"" by actually testing out what you have learned because the left mouse button also acts as a skip button for some reason. This game is brutally hard, you instantly get a mission fail if one of your guys dies, because as they keep repeating through the whole game ""No one gets left behind"". You are sadly limited to very few medic packs which you use to revive your injuryed party members, so if you loose more than one ally, you basically just need to restart the level as they are very hard to come by. Graphics are not the usual Arma standard, but I wouldn't expect anything different from a stratergy title. Fans of the series and this type of game will probably get some enjoyment out of it, but its not for me.			"

												A big disappointment. I was a fan of both the first ARMA games (played original operation flashpoint and ARMA 1 and 2), and a fan of tactical turn based strategy games, like Jagged Alliance, 7.62 high caliber and Silent Storm. This game will not appeal to fans of either genre, as is not as near as “realistic” as the ARMA series, nor a heavy tactical game. It’s more like casual tactics for the casual gamer. In games like Jagged Alliance you could shoot from different positions (standing, kneeling, prone) and spend AP to aim (a “snapshot” or a “aimed shot”). In this game you don’t have any of that, and can only choose form spending 2 AP or 1 on a shot, but no further aiming gameplay.The story is non existent. It’s just a straight forward army game (maybe the only aspect similar to the original ARMA series) against your random “terrorist”. You cant’ “build” your team, since you can’t choose your solders, and both the experience system (to improve skills) and the weapon system are very limited. Another drawback for me was that you can’t really build “random missions” like in the ARMA series, you can just replay the maps with different goals, but not really design a mission.It might be a good cellphone game, but it’s totally out of league for a PC game.I payed less than 2 dollars for it, since I bought it on sale, and still feel I payed to much. AVOID this game, you are better of buying XCOM or Jagged Alliance.			"

But since it's a Bohemia game, I'll try to be gentle, but of course, no promises for a sh-The story is mediocre. Lets go kill a terrorist. Yay. Modern warfare sterotypical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. No effort was put into it.-The voice acting is terrible for the most part with the exception of one character whose voice nostalgically brings me back to ArmA 2.+An interesting customization system where you can equip your characters with different guns, upgrade those guns, and equip different grenade types to help you as well along with medpacks, morphine, and claymores. HOWEVER...-There is little to nothing to customize your characters with. 3 useless grenade types, Claymores that you'll never get to use, and  4 gun types that are essentially useless since you can dominate the entire game with the base weapons the game gives you without a single upgrade.-The camera angle is terrible. Trying to command units under roofs is insanely frustrating. -Graphical glitches galore. You shoot and enemy and he flies into the air, his body transforming into rubber in the midst of a seizure, only to implode into his hat in mid-air, and stay there...staring at you for the rest of the game. -The sounds are medicore, and the soundtrack is repetitive, and occasionally doesn't even play.-The controls are so bad it actually had me screaming at the game. Clearly designed for a touch-screen smartphone or tablet, playing this game with a mouse and keyboard will have you throwing your mouse at the wall. -The blandest, least in-depth characters I have ever seen.-Too short. And the random mission generator doesn't help unless you really like tedious, boring, glitchy gameplay.-Stealth-based portions of mission that you can instantly fail for no discernable reason considering there are no indicators to help you with stealth.-Unclear mission objectives that will have you scratching your head for a good long time on how to complete them, when you are literally staring at the objective trying to complete it.3/10. A good game to get your friend on april fools day, or your enemies for christmas. I'm sure masochists would love playing this game. I regret that a dollar was ever spent to get me this game from a bundle. Stay. Away.			"

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews - Game 12Arma TacticsPurchase Date: 1/16/2014I picked up Arma Tactics as part of a Humble Bundle with the first 2 Arma games.  I started with Arma - Gold Edition first, then moved to Arma II before trying out Arma Tactics.I'm struggling with why the developers called this game Arma Tactics.  Let's take the first word Arma.  Having played the first 2 Arma games, I assumed this game would have been along the same lines, but I quickly discovered this game has absolutely nothing in common with Arma or Arma II.  I mean I suppose I could say that Arma Tactics has soldiers firing weapons in it, but I am hard pressed to come up with any other similarities.It's just odd because even in the limited time I spent with the first 2 Arma games, it was clear just how much depth was packed into each of these games.  If Arma II represents the deep end of my swimming pool, then Arma Tactics is the top step in the shallow end of the pool as I'm getting out.Which brings me to the word tactics. I imagine this word was picked because you are leading your squad in tactical combat, ordering each of your members around.  I can see where this game is trying to be X-Com, but due to the lack of depth, it doesn't really succeed on any level.I should also mention I wasn't a big fan of the camera.  I wouldn't say the camera is buggy or non-functional.  It's just I felt like I was constantly having to fiddle with the camera in order to get a decent view of my surroundings.I started with the tutorial, which again, compared to the first 2 Arma games was extremely shallow.  It did at least get me started though, covering the basics of how to order my squad around, how to fire at enemies, and it also showed me how to do a takedown at close range.  The tutorial was extremely brief, and my first thought was that the developers just skimped a bit on this part.  But what I fear though is that they actually didn't skimp on the tutorial, it's just there's so little gameplay that needs to be covered.My first mission consists of me and 2 squadmakes on a mission to take out some terrorists who are spread out along the map.  Gameplay takes place in turns as I move my squad around.  Each squad member gets 2 action points which can be spent on movement or a combination of movement and some other kind of action.  There's one exception though to the turn based gameplay, and that if you step into the line of sight of a terrorist as you are moving.  If this happens, the terrorist gets to interrupt you by shooting at you.  This will happen a lot because you don't know where the terrorists are to start with.  So inevitably you'll stumble across a group of them, and they'll likely get a free shot at you in the process.I should mention, getting hit in this game is bad.  You can only take about 3 hits before you are knocked out.  I got a single medkit to start with which means I get one chance to heal one squad member.  Oh, and I did I mention that the mission ends when only one of your squad members dies?Because of this, I quickly found my gameplay turning into what I would describe as Stealth and Error, where I would uncover terrorists, get shot lots of times, then reload with the precognitive knowledge of where they were hiding, and try something new.  I'm pretty sure this isn't the intended way of playing the game.Suffice to say the difficulty is pretty high.  But the difference is, with Arma II, dying just inspired me to try harder.  I spent a good portion on my first hour in Arma II stuck on the first tutorial mission trying to take out an enemy squad.  But dying in this game doesn't feel like a teaching lesson.  It's just an annoyance.Save yourself the trouble and try out a different Arma game instead.			"

												I would recommend this game to people who enjoy tactics games, it has some cool features like customizing your soldiers skills through XP and purchasing new items and weapons with cash in between missions. Also in addition to the campaign you can generate some random missions too to get some extra XP or cash to 'level up' your soldiers. There are some frustrating aspects, like the camera you can rotate and zoom but can't tilt or go top-down. Even though it is a tactics game, there is no grid so movement is a bit less precise. Also you can't name or change the appearance of your soldiers, and you always have the same team of 4. I'd suggest XCOM before this, but it's still a game worth having for tactics fans.			"

												The day I played Arma Tactics for the first time was also the day I played it the last time. Do not be deceived by the low price tag or Arma brand slapped on this game, it is complete and utter garbage. The game is so frustratingly broken that I couldn't even be bothered to try and finish the first level after very few attempts. The moment one enemy notices you the rest come rushing in on your squad and you're pretty much screwed, and don't even bother taking cover because enemies can shoot your soldiers through concrete walls and any other forms of ""cover"" without even trying. I wanted to train my soldiers in hopes of maybe bettering my chances, but sadly the ""randomized"" missions that I was told about in one of the tooltips are only available if you complete the campaign missions. Arma fan, tactical strategy fan or otherwise, stay far away from this game.			"

												This is a surprisingly fun game to play once you learn the controls. The AI is what it is, but for the most part the game is very enjoyable and a bargain for $10 (or less). It is kind of like Full Spectrum Warrior, but has enough of its own personality to make it a worthwhile gaming investment. It is actually quite nice looking in terms of graphics as well, and has one of the best implementations of an in-mission map overlay that I have seen in any video game.			"

												This game is the most broken turn-based ""tactical"" shooter I've seen.  Cover means nothing (you will be shot through it), line of sight means nothing (you will be shot when not in it), range means nothing (you will be shot from miles away while behind cover and out of line of sight), grenade arcs mean nothing (it will bounce off of objects on its way to the destination and then detonate to damage anything within about 6 inches)... you get the picture.  The tutorial gets you all set up for something... and then throws you into the first mission against about a dozen enemies where you have no choice but to engage them in a bottleneck.  Tactically, this sound viable right?  Consider the previous issues and you'll relaize it's an exercise in frustration.It has nothing to do with learning the mechanics.  The mechanics are broken.  There is almost no chance for tactics.  What you end up doing is trying to trick the AI into bumrushing you where you can defend yourself.  Hopefully... but even then you have 3 men against a dozen.  You get overwhlmed.  If anyone dies at any time, it's over.Listen, I'm stubborn.  I gave this game a shot several times.  I have major problems getting past the first mission.  Most people do.  It's that bad, and it never gets better.  Avoid this game.  Do not even buy it on sale for a dollar; it's not worth the aggrivation and the devs shouldn't be rewarded in any way for this garbage.Love tactical games like this?  Try Breach & Clear... for a cheap title, at least that game works. "

A turn based ""shooter"", with the option to change loadouts and upgrade equipment.The only issue is do have with it is that while behind ""cover"" you should not be able to be shot, when in fact you can be. This kinda defeats the point of being behind cover.Its annoying but is something you can live with.			"

												I played for a bit and already noticed some bugs, like when you try to move a soldier somewhere he cannot get to because the path is blocked by other soldiers, the game will not advance (smoke still plays, but the soldier will just be standing there and nothing happens). Also, when you decide to restart a mission you lose your bought gear and points?I got the game from the Humble Bundle and not directly from Steam, but I wouldn't recommend on buying it. If you are a hardcore fan of this genre, try other games (other reviewers name them). If you're more like me, and just want to try out something new, this game COULD be fun for you, if you don't mind the bugs. Cannot say too much about the story at this point, but I actually like the graphics in this game - not too overwhelming but not bad either. Gameplay is quite simple but by no means easy (at least for me). If you already have it or get it as a gift, try it, otherwise you might want to think twice about buying it on Steam.			"

												Modern military squad/turn-based strategy brought to you by people who make great simulation games (especially military ones)! Sounds pretty great right? WRONG. Everything about this game is poorly done. Ahem. For instance, cover doesn't matter, a grenade will stop pretty much immediately as soon as it touches something (You know how bouncing/rolling grenades are actual military and videogame techniques? Not here), AI is incredibly stupid and are perfectly unaware of anything SPRINTING behind them and is totally willing to stand out in the open instead of laying traps or taking cover (which would really be a great idea, because my men are so accurate that the game isn't even close to a challenge when fighting at range), and the UI sucks and results in a mess of missclicks. Still not convinced this game is bad? There is no music, the sound effects are completely uninmpressive, the visuals are just okay, the squad isn't remotely worth listening to, any items you use on a mission have to be bought with credits beforehand (and you have to either grind or be efficient to get them), and worst of all is that amongst only 10 or so premade missions and some badly constructed random missions is that THE GAME HAS NO MULTIPLAYER. And none of this helps how horribly buggy it is too. Frequently my men would stop dead a few paces away from where I told them to go. Locations that were totally accesible were avoided by my men, and areas that you couldn't pass a grenade through they were willing to try. I got shot though walls twice in ten minutes.TL;DR: Everything is ♥♥♥♥♥ily slapped together and it's not even good for a laugh or a quick game with some friends. A game that could have been a great battle of wits has no multiplayer to speak of. Heartbreaking really. 3/10			"

												I got this game when I was able to throw away a few dollars on gambling with games. At the time, it was on sale, 50%-off or so. About $4 or thereabouts. I figured it'd be a nice little addition to my collection of tactical games, and the reviews that were showing were mostly positive, despite the overall rating. Finally got around to playing it and it locked up on me, gave no clear instructions, and defaulted to trying to use my gamepad AND the clunky mouse controls at the SAME TIME. I'm not sure how long I spent, but I was sorely disappointed almost right away. Didn't even finish the tutorial because it locked up an animation and simply sat there. I closed down, checked this page to see what others experienced, and hung my head in shame.I wish I had my $4 back.			"

												Turn-based squad strategy.This game suprised me. Its compareable to XCOM: Enemy Unknown, or Jagged Alliance in terms of mechanics.While its not offering that much variety its still good for about 10 hours of gameplay, and those are very solid. However there are some bugs, the action cam bugged out for me way to often, so i disabled it, which fixed the problems mostly. But be warned, some enemies can see through roofs and shoot through them...A few more different weapons would have been nice, but the way it is you have clearly defined purposes without to much complexity.Its absolutly worth 5$ they want at time of this review, a clear recommendation.'nuff said.

												For the money i paid (1.72) it is good. I got this game in the Bohemia sale. I think it is good for the money i paid, i wouldnt pay any more than three dollars for it, POSITIVE THINGS: High FramerateOkay StorylineGreat Mission SetupsGood Loudout MenuThere arent really any negative things i can say about this game other than it is kind of buggy, and the cinematics are pretty bad. I have played this game for maybe an hour and i would definently play it in the future, I see myself playing when i have no internet connection, i am traveling, or none of my friends are on to play any other game. This game is realistic somewhat, Realism meaning the squad gameplay, you move up with your squad and you can only move one character 10 meters i think that is great because it is a close quarters combat game, and you dont want to move up 50 meters with any one guy (unless you know what you are doing). If there was a way to integrate multiplayer that would be awesome, a 4v4 Deathmatch with no respawns, 8 rounds max that would be amazing. You can communicate with your squad and play as a team overall, or you can be the lone wolf and go snipe on top of a building. each player should get a max of 30 seconds to move, that would be great in my opinion. ANY FPS GAMER WOULD LOVE THIS GAMEOverall i give this game a 8/10 It is great and i love it. Thanks for reading and GAME ON			"

												How can I say this without sounding bitter and like I have a grudge...this game is god-awful. ArmA games are usually glitchy, but in a charming way that makes you chuckle a bit. This game is the exception. I believe they just ported a poor iOS game and added nothing to it. They try and take XCOM and turn it into real military, but it lacks depth, originality, and playability. AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS!			"

												Arma Tactics is a lackluster attempt at a TBS game. The view angles are horrible. The controls are unintuitive. The voice acting is absolutely horrendous. The graphics are acceptable until it zooms into the disorientating 3rd person when you move your guys. The line of sight of your units is ridiculous. You can shoot at enemies 100 feet away but an enemy at the ground floor right against the wall can fire to your guy on the roof. Thankfully I got this from a $1 Humble Bundle, otherwise I would have felt cheated. This is obviously from a know nothing developer or some interns which they slapped the Arma name onto.			"

												I love this game, it's really fun. I think it's in alpha or something because it says ""press Y"" and ""press X"" and displays buttons on an Xbox controller at times, crashes a few times and is kinda buggy so I'm not sure if they're fixing that but I can live with it.This is a tactical turnbased shooter. You can customize your 4 soldiers with one of four weapons; either an assault rifle, a shotgun, a sniper or an LMG, and they all work like you'd expect them to. You get credits after each mission to spend on upgrading the weapons or buying medpacks and grenades and stuff like that for your soldiers.I love this game because it's so tactical, it feels just like playing ArmA except everything is turn-based. You place your marksman on a remote roof overlooking everything, the LMG guy gets into a position with clear view while your assault guys move up and advance on the enemy, and then you just let it rip.Like I said, it's kinda buggy at times, like sometimes it's almost impossible to avoid pressing the melee button even though you're not actually pressing it (the button for melee is at an enemy's feet while you're close to him) and you end up meleeing an enemy even though you didn't want to and you don't have time to get to cover and you get downed. Stuff like that but they may have fixed it, haven't played this in forever.This game is like an 8/10 or a 9/10. Only reason that I haven't played more is because there's a campaign and not a set of randomly generated missions so it's kind of boring to play over and over again, unless you wait a few months before doing it.

												There is definitely some potential in this game - and it's not without some play value. (I spent 11 hours playing it, after all - enough to complete one of the two available story campaigns.)  That said, it feels a bit incomplete...  only one weapon of each type to unlock, only a very basic selection of non-weapon gear, no advancement aside from raising scores on a few basic skills which boil down to ""walking"", ""shooting"", etc.  If there was a bit more depth here, I'd definitely recommend, but as things stand, the poor AI and shaky gameplay make this a thumbs-down.  A few examples:With 2 AP per character per turn, a lot of the tactical decisions involve guesswork.  A few examples of the sort of tactical frustration you'll encounter: ""I guess moving here will give me line of sight to that exposed enemy...  hm, nope, invisible wall blocks my shot.  Guess I'll wait til next turn""""I guess I'll wait here in overwatch so the enemy will come to me, since none of my guys have good LOS...  hm, nope, they shuffled a half step and hit everyone - I guess that low wall wasn't really giving me cover in that direction""It's a shame, because this game is very close to being a great high-value squad tactics game.  A few quick fixes to gameplay, and/or some added content (more campaign levels, advancement options, gear, etc) would make this a definite winner.			"

An unoriginal concept  that was extremely poorly put together. You might say that I should give slack because it's a mobile game. There is one reason that I won't. People paid $10 for this game to play on PC. It should be up to the standards of any PC game (Risk of Rain, an amazing game, is up for the same price), regardless of the origin. It's like saying that an HD remake doesn't have to be in HD. It doesn't make sense to charge $10 for this.			"

Friendlies can spot enemies from a mile long. Is that behaviour equal to enemies AI? You never know. This is a funny fact: A guy in house roof can spot you INSIDE THAT house (bionic vision). That's nothing comparing to the fact that they can hit you indeed.A friendly kill gives experience to the wrong guy. Enemies giving you their back can spot you. But, not always...This ... how should I call it? this intention of algorithms trying to produce an entertainment is a complete fail.To remain clear: boring, full of bugs, poor sound, horrible AI, stupid voice acting, NO AMBIENCE AT ALL.Don't you ever think of buying this ... whatever.

The levelling is tedious, and it does not make that big a difference. A weapon skill at 25 gives you like 5% more chances to hit. The number generator is also odd, I've just missed twice in a row on a 85% chance to hit...Maybe, with 2 or 3 additionnal campaigns, it might become an interesting game.

Clunky user interface combined with broken aspects (soldiers shooting each other w/o line of sight) I mean just plain TERRIBLE!! For those of you who need more explanation ... please ... waste your money on this stinker and play it ... it wont take long to convince you much better than I ever could.			"

												Summary: Arma Tactics is a turn-based close-combat strategy game, where the player takes control of a four-member Special Forces team. There are no given strategies, rails to move on, or paths to follow; it‘s up to the player to decide how he will play through both the story-driven missions and generated missions with randomized objectives. Whether using stealth or a more direct approach, players will need to use their strategic thinking and use both basic and advanced weaponry while facing many different opponents - ranging from unorganized local militia to smart and skilled mercenaries.Metascore: 47/100 (5 Critics)In my opinion: A game of Arma that is not Arma.User-Score: 4.8/10			"

												This is a mobile device turn based tactical game port. From a top down perspective, the player points and clicks to move, position, and direct the fire of each of the four men in his team as they engage dozens of poor AI enemies. While units must reload, ammunition reserves are infinite.Arma Tactics has five weapons : Knife, M4 rifle carbine, M249 automatic rifle, M1014 shotgun, and M110 sniper rifle. Weapons and items must be purchased with money gained from points obtained in missions. This is unrealistic for a team level state military unit (especially when purchases are restricted to a small portion of G.I. weaponry). Purchase points and purchased items used during a mission are not restored if the mission is restarted. The cover system isn't well developed or significant.It's not like other ARMAs and it isn't very tactical.There's no reason to purchase this overall inferior game for PC if one already has Jagged Alliance, Xcom, or Fallout tactics.

												I'm still going to give this game some more chance.. may change to positive review later. But for now, kind of annoyed / bored by it, with less than an hour in. Played the tutorial, which is fine. The voice acting tries a little too hard and is kind of annoying. Would rather there be no story than an annoying one. The camera controls also end up being annoying, when you're dragging your soldier's footpath, the camera doesn't automatically follow toward your destination, so you have to stop, move the camera, then try again. I gave it another try recently and played the first mission. Turns out, if one of your guys dies, and you don't have anyone to stabilize him, then game over. No permadeath allowed. Pfft. Annoyed.

												Would not be such a bad game, if it didnt carry the ArmA title but as it does you kind of expect a game that works and can manage the gun mechanics. unfortutunaly however it feels clumsey half arsed and badly made. the controls are uncomfortable, the animations are basic, you get a total of 4 guns and a few 'items' and the spotting mechanic does not seem to work at all. If you want a good turn based game then try Xcom or Zenonaughts, something less sci fi then try any of the  jagged allience games (very good games with very similar style play maybe even the same engine with the newer ones but with more far more customisation, and rng, not the online one... shudders.)ArmA tactics 3/10.

												Spending just a bit of time with ARMA Tactics, I had high hopes as I love tactical turn-based strat games. Regrettably, this game turned out to be a serious letdown with no reward.The premise is you control a tactical ops team of 4 soldiers, doing various missions in the middle-east.....yep pretty generic set piece.After completing the tutorial, it seemed like it was going to be fairly solid in terms of gameplay, but this quickly transitioned to the first level being massive and extremely challenging (set on default difficulty). After 30min and struggling with bugs and poor input for the soliders, I lost 1 solider and lost the game. Quite frankly it was a rage quit at that point.The game is need of serious balancing, and another pass at controls. Too many options overlap just mouse-clicking which in turn creates incidents of mis-set actions, which 'could' have been mitigated with an undo option....but nope.I appreciate the genre they tackled here, but it's a game that just doesn't come together sadly.

												Despite moments of brilliance, this game is exceptionally buggy.Generally, ARMA tactics is a decent, but limited, turn-based tactics game.  The turn system, action points, and interrupt systems are all pretty standard but well implemented.  The level designs are OK and the graphics aren't bad either.  Unfortunately, all of this is rendered moot by an avalanche of bugs that make the game nearly unplayable.  Little things like:1)  The ""Continue"" button (which should continue your game from the last mission you were on) on the Main Menu doesn't work and typically just hangs the program.2)  Building a custom mission and selecting ""Random"" for the map type always results in the first map (African Town I) being chosen.3)  Custom mission type ""Terrorist Hunt"" results in the terrorist you are hunting LITERALLY DISAPPEARING OFF THE MAP, making it impossible to complete the mission.4)  Multiple bugs in campaign missions making them impossible to complete without replaying repeatedly and hoping not to encounter the bug.5)  Weapon modeling is nearly non-existent.  While the sniper rifle has a longer range and appears to crit more often, M-4s and SAWs do about the same damage at about the same range... with no suppress function for the SAW.Bottom line:  at $9 it is OK, but extremely frustrating.  Suggest X-COM or one of the Jagged Alliance sequels instead			"

There are no achievements in the game even though it says there are some there, you cannot earn any of the achievements listed at all, I dunno why, but probably because the games bugged too much… If you really want to play this game, just get yourself CheatEngine or GameConqueror and look for the HEX Data for Credits to max it out just so you can purchace XP, Weapons and Skill upgrades to play through the game with fair chance of survival to beat the game. I don't normally condone cheating in games, but this is plenty worth cheating your way through this game since there's nothing significant to get out of playing it, and its only Single Player game anyway.

Your soldiers are supposed to be badass tactical dudes but their range of actions and abilities is very limited, while poorly trained militias hardly ever seem to miss a shot. This is on top of a very confusing map and a rather poor camera system. Overall not recommended even on sale, it's just not fun.			"

												This game is not quite as bad as other reviews would make it seem... At its base it's actually a fairly nifty tactics thing, and I didn't encounter any bugs playing on Windows, other than an irritating problem where the correspondence between zoom and whether I looked inside or outside a building was off. The unfortunate part is it's obviously ported from a tablet, and uses captive audience mechanics; you have to buy your equipment and level your characters to proficiency using currency generated in-game. You don't really start out with a squad that makes the campaign winnable. I would actually recommend it for anyone with scads of free time... were it not for the price. You can find an ungracious time-sinkhole for less than $9 (in fact, it's fairly common practice now to give the sinkhole away for free and simply sell ladders).			"

												Unfortunatly I wasn't able to get very far into this game due to the bugs present in the game, and the poor interface. This appears to be a quickly put together clone of the wildly popular, and good, game XCOM Enemy Unknown. However, this is also a poorly done port of a mobile game which explains the terrible interface for a PC, and likely the number of bugs.Turn-based games are my favorite kind of game. But this one was just too poorly implemented for me to even play it very long.			"

												I am a big fan of tactical rpgs and took a particular liking to X-Com, so I thought this might be cool as well.  It really didn't bring any depth to combat that I could find.  To make matters worse, it had a terrible user interface.  Camera angles made it hard to even move around the map.  Several times I tried to sneak attack an enemy but the game insisted on moving me right in front of them instead.  Movement for a single AP (which would allow you to still attack on your turn) was painfully short, so I spent most of the time sprinting and just dealing with enemies when they showed up.Overall, I didn't find much to make this game worth playing.  Just play through X-Com again if you really need to scratch that itch.			"

												Arma Tactics is a very basic turn based strategy game where you command a small squad of men. Similiar to XCOM, Jagged Alliance 2, or stuff like that.Its okay its the core design of a possibly good and deep game here but the only problem its not deep. If you play the first mission the rest are basically the same thing over and over. There are only 3 weapons, LMB, AR, and Sniper rifle, and affording the sniper is a pain in the butt because grenades and medkits. You can upgrade your squad members but you need to exit to the main menu then go back into the game. Its idiotic and on top of that the upgrades don't make a huge diffrence so its like why bother? And unless you explore the menu you would probably never know you could even upgrade them.Its extremely basic and would be great as a pick up and play...mobile...game....on android....iOShttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARMA_TacticsWELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW. Thats what it is. Unfortunately its a game thats main focus was a mobile market. So pick up and play was what they wanted. And since most people don't want a hardcore deep game while on the train or waiting room its fairly basic like solitaire or checkers. So if I had played this on a mobile setting I would have probably enjoyed it though I find it strange that it has no PSVita port or WiiU or even a home console version.The AI is nothing special and will just throw men at you most the time so its relatively easy. The only challenge comes from when your men keep missing over and over or when AI just thrown at you en masse to the point it just makes you lose man after man because you simply can't handle the amount its throwing at you.Its not bad but theres just not much content here. Thers nothing really to say about it I guess. They could have gone buckwild and added a metric done of content like in Arma 2 comparatively.But what is bad I have noticed is that sometimes enemies can shoot you through walls or ceilings which is just plain bullcrap. Aswell at one point I was detected while trying to do a stealth mission and a squad mate got wounded when shot through a window. Except it was one of those type of windows game designers put in a map or area to fill up space and you cant see through because the glass is blocked with newspapers or some crap. In any other game you would expect that window to be basically just a painting on the wall in terms of gameplay. But instead the AI can see and shoot through it but you cant! Shooting through walls gets really annoying but this is just idiotic.  Sometimes grenades will hit something in the air you can't seen and not go where you want them to at all, and much more annoyingly your well trained and well armed American soldeirs will miss a shot directly in front of them while Jihadis mess them up in all kinds of Mujah ways. This randomness can really drain you from wanting to play the game along with casually enraging you. So to sum this up, its just okay. Not worth much more than $5 if you want to play it on a stationary system but a worthy diversion if you want to blow 20 to 30 minutes waiting for something. But if you want something more deep than a very bare bones TBS there are better games for you such as Expeditions: Conquistador or either of the ones mentioned at the start. If you have a mobile device I would atleast consider buying this game along with GTA Vice City and Max Payne 1 (both on Android market).Its really not that fun though unless you play it in short spurts to waste time.

												The game is nice and relatively interesting, but extremely short. It looks more like demo to normal game than normal game. All together there are just about 9 missions and that's all. Few maps, rapidly raised difficulty. Compare to average game lenght of other titles - I just not enough. Not like 'give me more', just like 10 minutes movie  in cinema you drive to view, expecting 2hr of something. Not 10 minutes.			"

												Arma Tactics is a turn-based close-combat strategy game, where you take control of a four-member Special Forces team. There are no given strategies, rails to move on, or paths to follow; it‘s up to you to decide how you will play through both the story-driven missions and generated missions with randomized objectives. Whether using stealth or a more direct approach, you will need to use your strategic thinking and use both basic and advanced weaponry while facing many different opponents - ranging from unorganized local militia to smart and skilled mercenaries.With highly replayable missions, achievements, weapons to unlock and two single-player campaigns, Arma Tactics offers many hours of intense ever-changing action.

												I have Arma Tactics on Steam and iOS. I really enjoy the game, however, if you're looking for something with typical Arma graphics and gameplay, this is definitely not it. If you're hoping for an overhead turn-based game, this is exactly it, and it functions quite well with decent graphics and effects to go with it. Arma 3 players may be disappointed though. I happen to enjoy turn based games like this.			"

												Not well optimized (panning, zooming, scrolling etc all stutter and lag), mobile/touch interfaced that wasn't overhauled for PC, poor controls and combat lacking depth.I played this on Android and it was decent enough, but just the bad optimization of the game is hindering me from playing any further. Compared to XCOM, this has almost zero depth, but the actual gameplay itself to me is fine (if you're not overly nitpicky). It is a good starting point for people new to tactical squad-based TBS games. Alas, this is an uninspired PC port of a decent Android game. Thankfully I got it for only $1 in the Humble Bundle.			"

												This a mobile port of a pseudo-game with impossibly effortless game mechanics, useless camera, infuriating gameplay and demented voice acting completely lacking in talent or even tone. The graphics are so awful that I almost broke down after realising that outside of a humble bundle, you can buy this game for £5.99. You can buy so much for £5.99, including paper clips, and those would be more fun (and practical) than this useless game.

												On the second mission, the game encourages you to ""stealth,"" but it's not a possibility. Because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI, the game actually encourages you to just sit while the enemy walks into you, so that you can use the interrupt mechanic to kill everyone that walks into line of sight. The interrupt mechanic works when you have a soldier with a leftover energy spots an enemy. The camera is annoying, as it automatically readjusts to the default zoom every time an action is completed. The walking mechanic seems inconsistent, as you can click once, the game will mark the click with a red arrow, and then you can click that spot again to walk there, in some cases. The distance you can walk never shows up when you want it, only after the game has automatically selected which character is active.Hiding behind cover seems to have no effect on your chance of being hit.How you are supposed to interact with things is not explained. In the second mission, the game tells you to disable a satellite, but it doesn't tell you how to do it. Having all teammates around it doesn't work. Clicking the a character to look for an action doesn't work. Throwing 2 grenades at it doesn't work.Purchased for less than a dollar, would not buy again. Not worth time, even if free.			"

												Arma znana jest z serii gier wojennych, które idą pod nurt najpopularniejszych serii traktujących o tej samej tematyce - zamiast filmowości, wybuchów i miliona skryptów dostajemy realistyczny symulator pola walki. Żadnego prowadzenia za rączkę po Jedynej Słusznej Drodze do celu, żadnej nadmuchanej pompatyczności i co najważniejsze - nie jesteśmy karmieni kolejną częścią (różniącą się tylko podtytułem) każdego roku, natomiast numerek przy tytule zapowiada prawdziwe zmiany, nie map pack czy dodatkową kampanię. Tym razem wraz z podtytułem ""tactics"" Arma przenosi nas na zupełnie inny poziom - kilka metrów w górę, gdyż z takiej perspektywy przyjdzie nam teraz oglądać działania wojenne w trakcie rozgrywki.  Z tabletu na PCArma Tactics już jakiś czas temu zadebiutowała na urządzeniach przenośnych i zdążyła zyskać bardzo dobre opinie i noty, gdyż taktyczna strategia wojenna okazała się być strzałem w dziesiątkę. Sterowanie na ekranie dotykowym było świetnie wykonane - intuicyjne i wygodne, bez dodatkowych udziwnień i niepotrzebnych opcji, wszystko znajdowało się dokładnie tam, gdzie być powinno. Gra idealna na szybką akcję w trakcie podróży pociągiem czy w poczekalni u lekarza.Produkcję przeniesiono teraz z urządzeń mobilnych na większe platformy. Niedużo gier jest w stanie przeżyć ten proces i nadal reprezentować sobą coś solidnego i grywalnego, choć oczywiście zdarzają się pewne wyjątki. Czy Arma Tactics do nich należy? Ocenimy to w tej właśnie recenzji.Poznaj drużynęPod naszą komendę dostajemy drużynę czterech żołnierzy. Każdy z nich prezentuje się inaczej nie tylko z twarzy, lecz również za sprawą własnego arsenału i zestawu umiejętności, które w menu głównym możemy ulepszać za zdobyte kredyty (te znajdujemy w skrzynkach w trakcie misji i za przejście misji). Nie mamy możliwości kreowania własnego żołnierza, a śmierć któregokolwiek z nich w trakcie misji kończy się niepowodzeniem.  Rozwijanie żołnierzy jest miłym dodatkiem do gry, jednak prezentuje się dosyć biednie - ot, podnieść można współczynnik posługiwania się karabinami, ładunkami wybuchowymi itd. O specjalnych perkach czy innych zdolnościach możemy zapomnieć. Ale wiadomo - dzisiaj każda produkcja musi, po prostu MUSI mieć jakikolwiek system rozwoju bohaterów, więc twórcy mogli sobie tanim kosztem odhaczyć tenże element. Tyle dobrego, że nie okrzyknęli gry taktycznym RPG. Zdolności przekładają się w trakcie rozgrywki na celność i zadawane obrażenia.Nasi bohaterowie starają się nas przekonać, że są prawdziwymi i wiarygodnymi postaciami, które miałyby prawo istnieć w realnym świecie. Rozmawiają między sobą, zarzucają sztywnymi dowcipami (których bym nie zauważył, gdyby nie kąśliwe uwagi towarzyszy: ""nie zwracaj na niego uwagi, zawsze próbuje być taki dowcipny"") i próbują włożyć w swój głos jakiekolwiek emocje. Niestety dialogi napisane są bez polotu, na siłę. Aktorzy grają natomiast tak, jakby chcieli swoim kunsztem dopasować się do kiepskich dialogów i całość ostatecznie wypada beznadziejnie - na tyle, beznadziejnie, że śledzenie fabuły, dodanej raczej na ""odczep się"" tak samo jak rozwój bohaterów, staje się męczące. Tak więc do naszych podopiecznych przyzwyczaić się ciężko, nie wspominając o tym, żeby ich polubić czy wspominać po przejściu gry. Wręcz przeciwnie - szybko zaczęli mnie denerwować i czasem miałem nadzieję, że przelatująca kula urwie któremuś z nich język i dzięki niej zamilknie na wieki.Oprawa Audio-WizualnaArma zawsze prezentowała bardzo wysoki poziom, jeśli chodzi o grafikę. Trzecia część potrafiła zachwycić pięknymi widokami i szczegółowością modeli, czego jednak spodziewać się po konwersji z Androida? Mimo że twórcy, tak jak obiecali, dodali wyższej rozdzielczości tekstury i ulepszone cieniowanie, Arma Tactics z oprawą nadal jest daleko w tyle za dzisiejszymi produkcjami. Tekstury, którymi obłożono elementy w grze, choć rzeczywiście lepsze niż na tabletach, są rozmazane i brzydkie. Latające kule zobrazowane zostały jako żółte paski migające gdzieś obok postaci i czasami w ogóle ich nie widać.  Przerywniki filmowe zostały zrealizowane na tym samym silniku co sama gra, więc też nie porażają, szczególnie gdy dodamy do tego wspomniany wcześniej ""kunszt"" aktorski i fakt, że postaci nie ruszają ustami podczas dialogów - totalny oldschool. Pochwalić jednak muszę animację postaci. Ich sposób poruszania się, pozycje przybierane przy osłonach i podczas strzelania wyglądają naprawdę realistycznie i mimo kiepskawej grafiki cieszą oko oraz nadają klimatu - czujemy, że prowadzimy wyszkolonych żołnierzy, nie bandę kretynów, jak wynikałoby z tego, co i jak mówią.Dźwięki, poza grą aktorską, są zrealizowane bardzo dobrze. Broń terkocze jak powinna, piasek pod butami chrzęści, a w tle gra pasująca do akcji muzyka.Z dotyku na mysz i klawiaturęSterowanie zostało przeniesione w całkiem niezły sposób, jednak nie obyło się bez zgrzytów. Tak jak prowadzenie postaci nie sprawia żadnego problemu i odbywa się intuicyjnie, tak kamera już potrafi napsuć trochę krwi. Zupełnie niepotrzebnie z lewej i prawej strony ekranu zostawiono wielkie strzałki pozwalające obracać kamerę - są od tego przecież przyciski na klawiaturze i prawy przycisk myszki. Strzałki te natomiast sprawiały, że miałem cały czas wrażenie, jakbym grał na tablecie. Wbrew logice kamery nie da się przesuwać, wjeżdżając kursorem w krawędź ekranu - można obraz przesuwać jedynie wsadem. Możecie powiedzieć, że czepiam się na siłę, jednak co rusz nadziewałem się na nieprzemyślane sterowanie kamerą i traciłem wczucie się w świat gry, musząc sobie przypominać ""klawiszologię"". Taktyczna ArmaI tak dochodzimy powoli do końca i odpowiedzi na pytanie - czy Arma Tactics została przeniesiona z tabletów na PC w sposób udany, czy może twórcy zupełnie spartolili sprawę? Odpowiedź jest gdzieś pomiędzy. Choć graficznie została daleko w tyle, fabuła jest nieciekawa i strasznie krótka, postaci denerwujące, a sterowanie kamerą kompletnie nieudane, sama rozgrywka naprawdę cieszy i jest przyjemna, idealna na nudne wieczory, kiedy zmęczyliśmy się już graniem w wielkie tytuły i mamy ochotę wprowadzić do rozgrywki odrobinę taktyki. Jeśli ktoś nie ma tabletu czy smartfona - polecam. W innym wypadku radzę zapoznać się z wersją na tablety, która wyszła o niebo lepiej i nie ma sensownej konkurencji.Plusy•	Przyjemna na nudne wieczoryMinusy•	Sterowanie kamerą•	Grafika•	Fabuła•	Długość			"

												While looking for another tactic game, I've bought this in a bundle (if I'm not mistaken). Cut to the chase: Avoid it! Reasons:1. How come you can't move the camera freely? You can drag it, but you can't rotate!2. Your AP at first missions are very limited, so your full range movements are to be thought carefully, since you won't be able to act if you move your full range (and that means heal or defend yourself). Not good for a first experience.3. Those controls! The heck!! The icons show over the characters and you can easily miss the command. That means, if you intend to shoot or heal, and miss, you're done.4. First mission, 3 guys, very limited inventory (your items are counted as individuals, not per type), against up to 7 that clearly can move farther AND still shoot at you! Pretty unbalanced and aggresive, to be the first mission.5. You can't see your enemies at first glance (which enforces you to explore the map), and that's good... Well, if you could move and act, that is.6. It's not clear when the turn is finished, nor when a character's phase is done (you just find yourself unable to do anything, then you're asked for your next character).			"

You shouldn't expect next gen graphics from it, also gameplay is far more important than graphics. I enjoyed playing this game on the highest difficulty available, it was a pretty nice challenge.The only con is lack of missions, there's like 12 missions in the game, each one last 30 mins or so if you execute it perfectly. Also there's quite a few little bugs here and there, one is game breaking.			"

Niestety dialogi napisane są bez polotu, na siłę. Aktorzy grają natomiast tak, jakby chcieli swoim kunsztem dopasować się do kiepskich dialogów i całość ostatecznie wypada beznadziejnie - na tyle, beznadziejnie, że śledzenie fabuły, dodanej raczej na ""odczep się"" tak samo jak rozwój bohaterów, staje się męczące. Tak więc do naszych podopiecznych przyzwyczaić się ciężko, nie wspominając o tym, żeby ich polubić czy wspominać po przejściu gry. Wręcz przeciwnie - szybko zaczęli mnie denerwować i czasem miałem nadzieję, że przelatująca kula urwie któremuś z nich język i dzięki niej zamilknie na wieki.Oprawa Audio-WizualnaArma zawsze prezentowała bardzo wysoki poziom, jeśli chodzi o grafikę. Trzecia część potrafiła zachwycić pięknymi widokami i szczegółowością modeli, czego jednak spodziewać się po konwersji z Androida? Mimo że twórcy, tak jak obiecali, dodali wyższej rozdzielczości tekstury i ulepszone cieniowanie, Arma Tactics z oprawą nadal jest daleko w tyle za dzisiejszymi produkcjami. Tekstury, którymi obłożono elementy w grze, choć rzeczywiście lepsze niż na tabletach, są rozmazane i brzydkie. Latające kule zobrazowane zostały jako żółte paski migające gdzieś obok postaci i czasami w ogóle ich nie widać.  Przerywniki filmowe zostały zrealizowane na tym samym silniku co sama gra, więc też nie porażają, szczególnie gdy dodamy do tego wspomniany wcześniej ""kunszt"" aktorski i fakt, że postaci nie ruszają ustami podczas dialogów - totalny oldschool. Pochwalić jednak muszę animację postaci. Ich sposób poruszania się, pozycje przybierane przy osłonach i podczas strzelania wyglądają naprawdę realistycznie i mimo kiepskawej grafiki cieszą oko oraz nadają klimatu - czujemy, że prowadzimy wyszkolonych żołnierzy, nie bandę kretynów, jak wynikałoby z tego, co i jak mówią.Dźwięki, poza grą aktorską, są zrealizowane bardzo dobrze. Broń terkocze jak powinna, piasek pod butami chrzęści, a w tle gra pasująca do akcji muzyka.Z dotyku na mysz i klawiaturęSterowanie zostało przeniesione w całkiem niezły sposób, jednak nie obyło się bez zgrzytów. Tak jak prowadzenie postaci nie sprawia żadnego problemu i odbywa się intuicyjnie, tak kamera już potrafi napsuć trochę krwi. Zupełnie niepotrzebnie z lewej i prawej strony ekranu zostawiono wielkie strzałki pozwalające obracać kamerę - są od tego przecież przyciski na klawiaturze i prawy przycisk myszki. Strzałki te natomiast sprawiały, że miałem cały czas wrażenie, jakbym grał na tablecie. Wbrew logice kamery nie da się przesuwać, wjeżdżając kursorem w krawędź ekranu - można obraz przesuwać jedynie wsadem. Możecie powiedzieć, że czepiam się na siłę, jednak co rusz nadziewałem się na nieprzemyślane sterowanie kamerą i traciłem wczucie się w świat gry, musząc sobie przypominać ""klawiszologię"". Taktyczna ArmaI tak dochodzimy powoli do końca i odpowiedzi na pytanie - czy Arma Tactics została przeniesiona z tabletów na PC w sposób udany, czy może twórcy zupełnie spartolili sprawę? Odpowiedź jest gdzieś pomiędzy. Choć graficznie została daleko w tyle, fabuła jest nieciekawa i strasznie krótka, postaci denerwujące, a sterowanie kamerą kompletnie nieudane, sama rozgrywka naprawdę cieszy i jest przyjemna, idealna na nudne wieczory, kiedy zmęczyliśmy się już graniem w wielkie tytuły i mamy ochotę wprowadzić do rozgrywki odrobinę taktyki. Jeśli ktoś nie ma tabletu czy smartfona - polecam. W innym wypadku radzę zapoznać się z wersją na tablety, która wyszła o niebo lepiej i nie ma sensownej konkurencji.Plusy•	Przyjemna na nudne wieczoryMinusy•	Sterowanie kamerą•	Grafika•	Fabuła•	Długość			"

												This crap really ruined the brand of ARMA. Trust me, this, totally SUCKS!Bugs are everywhere, u can see no font after entering this♥♥♥♥♥♥ In my 0.3 h on this crap, i'v spent only 5min indeed, 0.5min took a glimpse into this♥♥♥♥♥♥ 4.5min sit here writing this review. Any way, the only good thing of it is the trading card, ONLY is what i mean.my suggestion: even as an ARMA fan as me, dont buy it for yourself. IF U HATE SOMEONE, DO SENT A COPY OF THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥TO HIM.       XD			"

												On the second mission, the game encourages you to ""stealth,"" but it's not a possibility. Because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI, the game actually encourages you to just sit while the enemy walks into you, so that you can use the interrupt mechanic to kill everyone that walks into line of sight. The interrupt mechanic works when you have a soldier with a leftover energy spots an enemy. The camera is annoying, as it automatically readjusts to the default zoom every time an action is completed. The walking mechanic seems inconsistent, as you can click once, the game will mark the click with a red arrow, and then you can click that spot again to walk there, in some cases. The distance you can walk never shows up when you want it, only after the game has automatically selected which character is active.Hiding behind cover seems to have no effect on your chance of being hit.How you are supposed to interact with things is not explained. In the second mission, the game tells you to disable a satellite, but it doesn't tell you how to do it. Having all teammates around it doesn't work. Clicking the a character to look for an action doesn't work. Throwing 2 grenades at it doesn't work.Purchased for less than a dollar, would not buy again. Not worth time, even if free.			"

												While looking for another tactic game, I've bought this in a bundle (if I'm not mistaken). Cut to the chase: Avoid it! Reasons:1. How come you can't move the camera freely? You can drag it, but you can't rotate!2. Your AP at first missions are very limited, so your full range movements are to be thought carefully, since you won't be able to act if you move your full range (and that means heal or defend yourself). Not good for a first experience.3. Those controls! The heck!! The icons show over the characters and you can easily miss the command. That means, if you intend to shoot or heal, and miss, you're done.4. First mission, 3 guys, very limited inventory (your items are counted as individuals, not per type), against up to 7 that clearly can move farther AND still shoot at you! Pretty unbalanced and aggresive, to be the first mission.5. You can't see your enemies at first glance (which enforces you to explore the map), and that's good... Well, if you could move and act, that is.6. It's not clear when the turn is finished, nor when a character's phase is done (you just find yourself unable to do anything, then you're asked for your next character).			"

												Well, this game starts off really bad. There are severe bugs that need to be dealt with, for example: in the tutorial (medpack part). This may throw you down a lot, but once you somehow manage to overcome it, this game is actually... pretty boring. Yes, it is a tactics and turn based game, but it offers so little in return, it's actually mediocre.The gameplay is average, you can do the typical, but not any more, it's always the same. The levels are really unbalanced, there are parts where it's impossible to pass and parts where you wonder what you are actually doing. It can get tedious, very tedious at times, and the only way to get past it is to farm abilities or points to allocate to your squad, which is really tiring.Once you get a decent setup, you can actually get to one of the last missions. To be blown up by very bad calibrated mortars and shredded to pieces in a 1 hit kill. "

												Arma Tactics is a nice little overhead game that can help you develop some tactical skill for shooters that are tactical, unlike Call of Duty and the like. If you buy games for their dazzling graphics, you may not want this game. However, if I was a critic, I'd give it an 82/100. Points for low price and enjoyable gameplay. Detractions for weak graphics, and a few bugs/glitches (player is out of sight but can still be shot by the enemy and vice versa).			"

												This game is hard to play. I don't mean the game is hard, I mean the camera controls, the user interface and so forth. Also the writing is terrible. To be fair, I played the tutorial and 5 mins of a mission, but there wasen't much good going on.			"

												Simplistic, buggy, and clearly slapped together by the devs on lunch breaks while they were working on other stuff. Tactically, I'd call it a poor man's XCOM. However, that would be a tremendous insult to XCOM. (And the poor.)Skip this one.			"

												While it appears to be an acceptable tactical title, the game constantly crashes at random, making it completely unplayable. The demo worked fine but the full game presents this issue on the same computer on the very same day I played the demo. Too bad.			"
