												Dawn of War continues its epic conquest with Winter Assault. Fixing most of the unbalances of the original. Winter Assault even brings an additional kick by adding the Imperial Guard (my favorite team). Story:The campaign offers two stories, the Forces of Order and the Campaign of Disorder. The Forces of Order has five missions and that switches between the Eldar and Imperial Guard. Unlike your traditional strategy campaign both the campaigns allow you to manipulate the story. On the fourth mission you can change the campaign by deciding which team makes it too the end. This is similar for the Campaign of Disorder, where you play as the Orcs and Chaos Marines. The campaign is rather fun and delves into the issue of the fallen Imperator Class Imperial Titan. If you played 40,000k Space Marine you know have seen the Titan before and that it is known as a ultimate weapon. Each team has a different objective, but they all revolve around getting to the same final location. Interestingly, there are four endings there is one “correct” ending which the story picks up and continues with in Dark Crusade (do not read the next secion if you do not want any clues to the games campaign) the Eldar Ending. In the next game ""Dark Crusade"" the story continues where the Eldar left off, this is not obvious but notable from how the games dynamic is set up in the strategic map campaign.Additions:The new team is the Imperial Guard. If you are unfamiliar with the series they essentially represent, in my opinion, a futuristic style army based around communist Russia. The army is initially based on sheer numbers and they even have units which execute soldiers in order to scare other units and make them hold the line. The game shows the Imperial Guardsmen surrounded by snow, which as we know is a strong environmental factor in Russia. Thus this team to me is like playing as the Russians. Similar to the orcs they fight in numbers, but unlike the orcs the strategies for the Imperial Guard early in the game lies in pairing up squads appropriately with commander units and working with your hero squad. While later the Imperial guard shift and play like other teams by using a few strong unit squads rather than keeping the weaker Imperial Guardsmen. Multiplayer:If you want to play online with friends I would recommend getting Dawn of War: Dark Crusade instead. As Dark Crusade fixes most of the glitches and unbalances of Dawn of War Winter Assault. These are not really game-breaking, but can be noticeable. Plus Dark Crusade offers the benefit of adding two new teams. One of which is featured in the Winter Assault campaign. If you haven’t played the first Dawn of War then skip the next section:My major gripe about this game is that the story of Gabriel Angelos is not continued. Luckily for all those wondering the story of Gabriel Angelos and the reviving the Daemon of Khorne is covered in Dawn of War II: Retribution.Results:I loved this game and all the installments so much I repurchased them all on steam. Despite that I still have all the discs, in functional condition, right next to me. Although it looks like there are more Pros than Cons this game is a good game, and definitely a worthy installment to the epic Dawn of War saga.Pros:+More balanced than the first game+Campaign introduces new elements to the story by allowing you to choose the ending. +A whole new team (the Imperial Guard)+Missions are rather interesting and the campaign is not too long.+Economic, Base building, and macro unit management+Fantastic story and campaign (which is very rare in a strategy game)+Amazing teams which each play completely differently.+Fast paced gameplay which requires expansion to acquire resource nodes (but those nodes do not run out like in most games)+Unit customization allows you to create squads for specific tasks+Fantastic computer AI that puts you to your witsCons:-My game glitched after the third mission of the Campaign of Disorder where I could not load any of my saves (I tried validating the files and it replaced the lost files yet still I could not load any of my saves. Then I tried to reinstall the game, but still to no avail).-The third mission for the Campaign of Disorder is rather cumbersome as you have to retrieve Imperial Guardsmen from one side of the map to the other. This would be fine if there was something along the way to keep you occupied, but reality is by the time you've got to this step the map is already baron as you killed everything else.-The game can still not be played with a second monitor. If you have two monitors and you move the cursor to the edge of your monitor that is adjacent to your extended monitor then the cursor leaves the game and causes it to minimize. It’s as if the game is permanently in windowed mode.-The movement AI can be annoying causing units to spread out rather than clump together. This is fine expect when you want to ambush an enemy and one unit gets too close because it decided to go too far from the rest of the group.			"

And, unlike the first one, the campaigns here let you play as all the other races: The artillery-heavy Imperial Guard, the Ork hordes, the psychotic Chaos Legions, and the sneaky Eldar. The missions can be really difficult at times, but everything here is at least just as good, if not better, than what was in the main game.Have funs!			"

												The Winter Assault expansion is a great addition to Warhammer: 40,000: Dawn of War.  The dual campaign allows players to take the role of either Order or Chaos and fight on either side of the war taking place with a fully fleshed out story.  If this alone wasn't enough, you also have the option toward the end of each campaign of furthering the goals of one of the two factions inside of your original choice.  As such, there are four endings to the campaign available.For the most part, it's more of the same of the original Dawn of War that most of us seem to have loved.  If you enjoyed the vanilla game, it's definitely worth picking up.			"

												An expansion pack to the original Dawn Of War, this features many races to play as. There are two campaigns, the Forces Of Order and the Campaign Of Disorder. The gameplay rules are pretty much the same as the first DoW, and as the title says, you are always facing down winter in the different snow capped battlefields you fight on. Players who want to know the full story of the DoW series in order should play this after they play the original DoW, because what happens in this version connects with other games in the DoW series (not telling which one, you have to find out yourself!). Good game.			"

However, i had a tough time with the campaigns, mainly the ""order"" campaign. There are small bugs here and there, but nothing that will ruin your game experience.

												Dawn Of War Winter Assault is the first addition to the Dawn Of War series, this being so, it is a little rough around the edges, but as the first Dawn Of War game was great, this one is good aswell. I will admit this is probably my least favorite of all the Dawn Of War games. I cant really put my finger on why this is so, it just is. That being said though Winter Assault is still a pretty great entry in the series, You will have many hours of campaign play, with multiple factions and endings as well as fun multiplayer (if you have someone to play). If you are looking for an RTS series or are just a fan of Warhammer 40k, I have got to say I recommend the Dawn Of War series!			"

												The armies of Order and Disorder have descended on the frozen planet of Lorn V. A World Class Titan was found buried in the ice and the armies of men and horrors of Chaos scramble to get their hands on it. The stage is set for the Winter Assault of Lorn V.The first expansion of the first Dawn of War adds the Imperial Guardsmen as a playable faction. The Guard sets itself apart with massive disposable numbers and cheap buildings, set off against strong armour units and many special leader units. It is a special mix that requires a new and vastly different approach to master. The expansion comes with two seperate campaigns. One where you play as the forces of Order, to protect the planet and to keep the titan from falling in the hands of Chaos. While on the other side you can play as the Orcs and forces of Chaos to claim this weapon to rule the universe. The campaigns are entertaining and change up the formula just enough to keep the interesting, but it does suffer from occasional jumps in difficulty that can ruin your fun severely.As with the original, the expansive multiplayer mode is still in place with all the modes availible to whoever seeks to indulge him/herself in this field, but with Dark Crusade and Soulstorm widely availible it seems futile to linger in this slightly dated expansion. Still, the campaign merits a run, if just for the hilarious antics of Orcs and Chaos.			"

												NOTE: I have not played multiplayer online, please take that into account. My review covers the single player campaign only.As the first expansion to the critically-aclaimed Dawn of War, Winter Assault focuses mainly on the Imperial Guard. There are however two campaigns: an Order campaign (featuring interplay between Imperial Guard and Eldar), and a Disorder campaign (featuring interplay between Chaos and Orks). I particularly enjoyed the switching between factions to accomplish your goals within a given mission.There are two guides I would suggest following, however, do not use these online in multiplayer! You will be taking a risk.All credit for respective guides and files goes to the OP:

												This expansion was ok for quick fun but the briefness of each campaign left me wishing for more. I thought the Imperial Guard were easily the most interesting (I wish they'd had an entire game), while the Eldar were borderline boring. There were a few intesting missions, but because the 2 campaigns share a few maps the experience feels a little too similar to be completely satisfying. Recommended if you're looking for quick fun and enjoy WH40K ...but not a must play.			"

												The first expansion pack released for WH40K Dawn of War 1 that was developed by Relic Entertainment in 2005, Winter Assault adds on to what made the core game successful to start with with two new campaigns and a new faction from the Imperium of Man:  The mass infantry-throwing, artillery-heavy Imperial Guard.   -Story:  Taking place during/after the last game on the iceball of a planet called Lorne V, the player is tasked with aiding General Sturn and his regiment of Imperial Guardsman reclaim a Warlord Titan:  A giant mecha spawned of forgotten technology that the Imperium hopes to recover and mass produce in their war against their enemies (read:  Everyone not Imperium).  The task proves much more difficult than it sounds, as war-loving orks and blood-thirsty forces of chaos stand in the way.  For the first time in its day, Winter Assault allows the player to choose between two separate campaigns, where they choose to play as the forces of order (Imperial Guard and Eldar) or the forces of disorder (Chaos and Orks).  Unlike most games where alliances remain permanent however, players can (or should I say, are forced to) determine which of these sides ultimately win because in Warhammer 40K there is no peace, there is only war.  Unlike the first game in Dawn of War I, there are multiple endings (4 actually) that depend on the player's choices.  Great for adding a bit of replay value, and while the story isn't spectacular, it's not bad by any means.  Score: 4/5-Gameplay:  Nothing much has changed between Dawn of War and Winter Assault, save for the addition of new maps and a new faction in its entirety:  The Imperial Guard.  While the Imperial Guard had some units featured in the first game's campaign, Winter Assault focuses greatly adds upon them by granting the Imperial Guard faction a vast increase in infantry units and artillery, with the most noteable addition being the powerful, bullet-soaking brick of a tank called the Baneblade.  The fact that the Imperial Guard infantry can travel between their buildings adds for some new tactics, combined with their additional units all help flesh out the faction.  Despite its focus on the IG, none of the other factions are completely left out, as they each gain additional units, some with new abilities to mix things up a bit.  It might not seem like a lot of additions, but for the casual and dedicated WH40K fan it's enough to keep things interesting.  Score: 4/5-Graphics:  Because Winter Assault and Dawn of War were built from the same engine, not much has been done with graphical improvements.  This isn't a bad thing however, as consistency is something to expect in any expansion pack or DLC.  The frigid atmosphere of Lorne V further adds to the sense of bleakness that the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40K is known for, as it creates the impression that even the weather is out to kill you.  The ice and snow also creates an interesting contrast to draw more attention to the scorch marks, blood stains, and general scenes of death and destruction that make WH40K what it is.  So while there might nto be anything new, the old adage ""If it isn't broken, don't fix it"" works in this case.  Score:  4.25/5-Sound:  While Winter Assault recycles many of the same tracks and sound effects from Dawn of War, it does add new music and lines.  The masculine choir added to the orchestral soundtrack fits both the mood of the Imperial Guard and the frozen environment they're in, and some of the lines delivered by the commanders of each faction are pretty memorable.   Much like the situation with the graphics, there wasn't a lot added to the sound aspect of the game, but what was added works very well.  Score:  4.25/5-Replayability:  As said earlier, the fact that Winter Assault features two campaigns with a total of four different possible endings adds to the replay value of this game.  The maps from the original Dawn of War are also included in the multiplayer aspect of the game, and the Imperial Guard faction offers a new challenge for those looking to try a different faction in multiplayer.  While Winter Assault's multiplayer might have seen some form of population back in its heyday, online matches are practically unheard of save for games between friends.  Still, the amount of replayability for this game in comparison to is predecessor is an improvement, albeit a marginal one.  Score:  3.75/5-Overall:  Winter Assault is a worthy continuation of the Dawn of War games with some worthwhile new content.  With subtle changes to the game's mechanics and more than one campaign, Relic Entertainment adds enough to satisfy most fans while avoiding any major changes.  Those expecting a massive amount of additions will be somewhat underwhelmed, but not disappointed.  Overall, I'd recommend getting this game during a sale if you need something to pass the time, it's worth it.  Overall Score: 20.25/25 or  81%			"

I have played Disorder for 5.5h(I don't plan to play Order in near future but I will play it sometime in the future)-2 new armies are added to the arsenal(but you can play only one of them)-The game is not forgotten but it needs no updatesCONS-The textures for models are somehow messed up and all the colors are smudged(not the whole model, but a part of it)-The community is almost dead-The Multiplayer is almost dead, went three times to find matches but there were 2 people in the Lobby and they were probably IdleI rate it 8/10.

												TL;DR:Winter Assault is a passable expansion to a great game. It adds some unique experiences and mechanics to the gameplay and forces players to try out the different armies available, adding some variety to the single-player campaign. The massive difficulty spikes add some excitement and challenge to the experience, but some frustration as well. Unfortunately, even though the total number of missions across the two campaigns is the same as it was in the original Dawn of War, Winter Assault's single-player game feels short by comparison. All in all, I didn't love it, but I still had fun and it was still worth playing.Read the Full review here: http://dagondogs.com/2016/01/20/dawn-of-war-winter-assault-review/ "

												If you've played Dawn of War 1 then you're basically paying for one more added faction and an extra unit for every other faction. And this is a good thing because the campaign is better than ever with multiple choices and you get to play as both order/disorder fighting for a powerful artifact throughout the story.Much of the game is still the same as the original except you'll be getting used to the mob tactics backed up by powerful armour of the Imperial Guard along with all their secondary commanders such as commissars, priests and psykers all with a unique ability that help all the small meatshield soldiers push through almost any obstacle. Personally my most favourite faction to play as out the rest and all their units are very well voice acted. If you're wanting to get this game to play as the Imperial Guard or other factions though to test out their new units, move along and grab Dark Crusade or Soulstorm instead. This game does bring in a few new things but nothing to really jump out the chair for but if you love the games for their campaign then this is worth the money.			"

												Darn good campaign. It has 2 campaigns between the ""Good"" guys and the ""Bad"" guys, and 4 endings between the 4 factions: Eldar, Imperial Guard, Ork, and Chaos. Not much to say about the story. Kinda basic, but it's the gameplay that sucks you in, and the Ork dialogue is absolutely classic and hilarious. Bottom line, good for a full playthrough, but overall it's an addition on top of an already great game. Better than Soulstorm, not as good as Dark Crusade.7/10			"

												So Figured I'd write something more than ""this Xpac sucks!""1. The campaign is just... bad - The split story is not only bad, but the overall plot definitely feels thrown together. I know they were going for ""play thing other than spess mahrines!"" but common....2. Everything this does, the other expansions do way better - The Necron expansion is probably the best of the three, but you can basically skip this xpac3. Its short - Like.... way short. I think I finished this xpac in a couple hours playing Chaos, but hated it so much I didn't even try with the Imp Guard.This is coming from a 40k fan.... I love 40k, and while the tabletop was ruined by 6th and overpriced models (personal opinion) I still love the setting and story, so will continue to support it with the games. That said, this Xpac is definitely not worth your time if you have the GOTY edition; skip ahead to soulstorm or the other one, your not missing much here.			"

												Winter Assault often feels like the Cataclysm to Dawn of War's Homeworld; it did something different, focussed on a different faction, and aside from a few characteristics, has been ignored by the rest of the franchise.I still didn't know much about the Warhammer 40,000 universe around when Winter Assault came out. I wasn't familiar with the lore (was I even aware that there was a lore?), and I was only just starting to appreciate the different factions. It was Winter Assault, however, that cemented how much I hated the Eldar, not just because of their over-complicated gameplay, but also their arrogance and condescension. Kudos to Games Workshop for giving me another reason for hating Elf-type races, aside from their general drippiness and flouncy-flouncy ways.So, Winter Assault is an expansion to the original Dawn of War game, requiring the original to be installed at the same time. It adds a new playable faction, the Imperial Guard (in addition to the original Space Marine, Chaos Space Marine, Eldar and Ork factions), and adds a new unit to each faction.Unlike every other game in Dawn of War, there are no Blood Ravens here, not even as a cameo. There are two (distinct) campaigns, one from the side of ""Order"" (Imperial Guard and Eldar), and ""Chaos"" (Chaos Space Marines and Orks), with endings for each of the four factions, depending on whom you focus on in the final mission. There's a cameo by the Ultramarines, and there's also a sneak peek at one of the factions that they added in one of the subsequent games.Winter Assault added two characters who would return to the series, Farseer Taldeer (who'd show up in Dark Crusade, and then would get a mention in Dawn of War 2 Retribution), and Gorgutz (who'd show up in the rest of the Dawn of War games, and is due to rejoin the cast along with Taldeer in Dawn of War 3). Sadly, General Sturnn never returns to the series, even though I felt that he was the best character out of everyone. His Chaos Space Marine counterpart, Crull, however not only gets a mention in the next game, he also gets to tour the galaxy atop Gorgutz's pointy stick.Crull, by the way, is probably amongst the worst Chaos Lords in the series, and undoubtedly leads the worst band of World Eaters in the galaxy. I'll bet they only made him a World Eater so that they would have an excuse to show off the new Khorne Beserkers, but really, they could have added any band of Chaos Undivided.Lore nitpicking aside, Winter Assault is a lot lighter and fluffier than the original's campaign. There are a lot more set-pieces in the missions to showcase the various abilities of the units (especially for the Imperial Guard). I think Relic wanted a Starcraft beating tournament-style RTS, shame they couldn't get the game balance quite right.Overall, if you're going to play the original game (and why wouldn't you), I'd add Winter Assault to the mix. It's a good campaign that's overshadowed by the first and third games, and wasn't horrible enough to get Soulstorm's (bad) publicity.			"

												-Winter Assault is set on Lorn V, where the forces of Order and Disorder fight amongst themselves over the power of an ancient Imperial weapon. It's the first expansion to the original Dawn of War, adding the Imperial Guard as a playable faction. The campaign, as well, offers far more options.-Two seperate campaigns this time, both with two endings. It allows you, in the end, to pick the faction of your choice. It gives more incentive for you to go back and play through it again to see what would happen if you chose a different side.-There are a few missions, however, that make me never want to play it again. There is a good amount of fair challenge in the game, but (particularly in the Chaos campaign) you are sometimes forced to go through very repititive tasks to finish a mission. That, and some missions are actually timed, making balancing base building and combat a nuisance. More than once I failed a mission without even realizing what had happened. In the final mission of the Chaos campaign, just as I was delivering the final blow, the mission failed. I never found out why, but I do know that I had the upper hand in the battle.-Situations like this happened far too often.-That said, there is fun to be had with this. The story is intriguing, as each faction seems to be using each other, and the Disorder campaign has some enjoyable dialogue between the Orks and Chaos. It's not a groundbreaking story, of course, but the conflict itself well thought out. If anything, it sets up the events for the next game.-If you really enjoy Dawn of War, you'll probably be interested in this. Chances are, you already received this in a bundle. Is it worth trying out? Sure. Is it a game I would recommend? No.-It's far from perfect and requires a lot of patience, but it's not a bad game. However, I would say that I only enjoyed specific parts of it. While the branching paths are a nice addition, I don't have the energy to go back and witness the other endings.-I enjoy Dawn of War, but the tedious activities in this campaign were more frustrating than fun. I'd give it a pass and just move onto Dark Crusade.			"

												Played this game back in the day. One the best RTS games, many reviewers say. Only thing is, this game's engine is the same one from Warcraft 3. And some unit animations are just copy pasted. Also, if you listen carefully, many of the voice actors from Warcraft 3 are present in this game too. Other than that, the game is good and a lot of fun especially with friends. "

												This game is a lot like the original Dawn of War in terms of gameplay. However the campaign is awful. It's only five missions long. You can play as Order (Imperial Guard and Eldar) or Disorder (Orcs and Chaos).Order campaign has a bunch of sections where you control an Imperial Guard base. I personally hate Imperial Guard. They seem really underpowered and weak. And the Eldar parts are basically hero missions. Disorder campaign has a really annoying 3rd mission.Both campaigns are essentially the same story/content wise with only some differences which I mentioned. Both sides have a really confusing 4th mission where you have to switch back and forth between the two races. The transition is very choppy and annoying.			"

												Ok i just came from classic dow and the main difference iv seen is that there is a change from hard counters to soft counters which has changed up the game completely it changes the game a lot.  The standard 1v1 games that would result in a mass infantry battle in classic to more of a tech game in wa which allow more use/variety of all units choices at use and wa made the change to anti vehicle unit type haveing the own individual counter example(horrors/fire dragons) makeing life alot simpler but giveing the unit type a individual role. Imperial guard were a good adition to the game whcih added much to the game adding new units/building and style of play giveing a player that like to turtle or play defenceive and liked to use vehicles a race to play.The AI current on steam  was  was quite challengeing on insane it does cheat but knows how to change its unit choices and  always keeps the same eco always and haveing more troops then i did so it gave me a challenge in learning to be able to beat it if i what'd to play something more fair i could always just lower the difficulty. As it quite difficult/expensive/complicated to build an advanced ai that can do many example builds/tactic/micro was not bad in my oppinion.My only drawbacks was with the campaign did not tie into the classic campaign as i would have liked it left my questions unanswered and was not as fun. it need to be worked on more still for its time when this game was realeased it was decent but its not something i what to play over and over again as it was not that interesting. More maps is always good adding some more stratigic map and colourful maps with more objects so they do look quite interesting and change up the game a  bit. It did give a different spin on rts then classic but unlike classic  were i enjoy the game straight away and was fun from get go. My experience of wa was not super great mainly because  the ai was terrible when i started playing and there were not enough players so it was not as great as it could have been but i find the new Ai difficulty is a challenge to win it forces you to learn the game prelonging the game give me a challenge in improveing my play. -multiplayer i give 7/10 i could have spent more time on it if there were players.-single player a average 5/10 not as great as the predecessor.

												Dawn of War Winter Assault adds in 2 new races you get to play as from the Dawn of War franchise. The campaigns are very linear and scripted so not sure if campaign mode is good for you. There are lots of mods for Winter Assault  some of which even today are still being updated. To be honest you could skip this one and go after Dark Crusade to enjoy the strategic map campaign and have lots more fun + get all the races from Winter Assault. However if you want to play the campaign for the story then get this.			"

												I didn't really get to play this game long enough to use the Imperial Guard in a combat scenario, but all I can say just playing their tatorial, the Imperial Gaurd is the Military Faction I've always wanted to be.  What stoped me from keeping this game was that I've been told about ""Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War Soulstorm so I took a look at it & I found out that there's more races to fight in the other one.  That's really the only reason why I refunded this keep this game.   But over all, this game is great it gives you the information how the Imperial Guard Military forces work, I can't wait to be these guys in combat in the next one I'll get.  I haven't even got to lagitamently use them for combat, but the Imperial Guard forces, I know right from smack dab these guys are my kind of military.  :DReason I LOVE being the I.G. Military:Have you ever played Command & Conquer 3: Tiberiam Wars?- Well if you have they remind me of the G.D.I., they remind me of them in a way.  11/10Except for the fact that unlike the G.D.I. the Imperial Guard soldier's leaders exicute their own soldier(s) to regain their morale. *facepalm* 11/10 Earth's forces doesn't approve.- For those of you have NOT then I'll tell you what the G.D.I. is:First off as we all know that the Imperial Guard Military is made up of all humans from all different planets joined together as one whole giant military empire uniting all human races as one.  As for the G.D.I. ""the Global Defense Initiative"" are KIND OF like the I.G. but a (*much smaller scale*) they're basicly the futuristic United Nations is a simple way to put it.  So other than that I like the Imperial Guard forces because of their diversity in Dawn of War. Unlike the Space Marines, Eldar, Orks, Chaos Space Marines & four other military forces, the Imperial Guard troops are just ordinary men asked to fight the most fearful & most terrifying overpowred empires that humaity could ever imagine.ONE rule I'm setting myelf:If my guys want to fall back cuase those terrifying powerful races are crushing these guys, I don't blame them if they need to retreat, I'll show those cruel Imperial Guard generals that my units won't need them & their brutality to my favorite soldiers to optain victory on those battlefields.  I have full confidence in their courage to be successful on the battlefields, God speed to my favorite military force in Dawn of War.40,000/10 I recommend getting this game to be the Imperial Guard Military.and Dawn of War Soulstorm.please rate if you like my review.  :D			"

												Unit pathing and level design are awful. It is a downgrade from original Dawn of War. Campaigns are short, but abnormally difficult in the middle. You are oddly limitted on resources in some parts while trying to deal with huge numbers of enemies.This, combined with annoying unit pathing being annoyingly unresponsive, makes for a very unfun experience. The units were difficult to control in the middle of a battle and would refuse to move where I wanted them to move unless I put them in the passive stance, and then they would struggle to actually move where I ordered. This was not true in the original Dawn of War game. Units would respond much better in the original. Idk how it gets worse with the expansion, but it did. I want to like this, but I cannot due to the frustrating design.			"

												Download a torrent of this game. I don't know whose fault it is (nor do I really care), but this Steam version is swarming with gamebreaking bugs. I actually had to let go of the Orks ending (Disorder campaign, mission 4, Orks) because the game would actually corrupt previous saves while playing (and every time I'd load the game - either the Orks' resources were set to 20, or the Ultramarine convoy would simply disappear, therefre removing the greatest challenge of the level, being the time limit, and ruining the experience). DoW and the Order campaign of this game were fine, but these bugs make me uninstall this expanssion feeling cheated and terribly annoyed. I've checked the forums, these bugs have been ravaging players for over 3 years and nobody who's supposed to care (that being their job) seems to even try to offer any assistance. I'm sorry I've ever spent money on this.			"

												I rate Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War: Winter Assualt 2/5. Bad.While the multiplayer aspect of this game is pretty much the same as in any other Dawn of War game (except this add-on appears to be the first to have allowed you to play as the Imperial Guard, which is a nice, though not entirely well done addition) the single player campaigns (there are 2, each of which have 2 different endings depending on which individual faction you decide you support the most) are not well done at all. The single player campaigns do not play much like normal skirmish matches but instead require you to complete very specific objectives. This would be all well and good were it not for the fact that, (at least in the good-guy's ""Order"" campaign I tried to play) the campaign (and your units) are hampered by bugs and design mistakes which make the whole experience enormously frustrating. Too frustrating for me to want to complete anyhow, not when there are so many other, clearly better games out there.Good things:+There are 2 single player campaigns, each of which feature 2 factions resulting in a grand total of 4 possible endings.Middling things:+/-You can play as the Imperial Guard (but you can also do that more effectively in the Dark Crusade add-on). The numbers of imperial guard units which you control is still not numerous enough to be canonical. The battles still don't feel extremely epic (despite the nice ambient battle sounds in some missions). In the overarching context of Warhammer 40k seems very, very strange to be able to simply teleport in replacement imperial guardsmen as squads become depleted (and this also feels strange for most other factions as well). Why not just teleport everyone who's available all at once and flood the battlefield with soldiers like the Imperial Guard would actually want to do? +/- Which ending you get apparently depends on a particular choice you make toward the end of teach campaign and which campaign you chose from the outset.+/- The graphics, sound and music quality are, for the most part, the same quality as in the original Dawn of War Game.Bad Things:-You usually have to build up the numbers of your force during the course of each battle. This is yet another game which resorts to the tired and true (and completely unrealistic) Command and Conquer styled game mechanic of getting buildings, building the force and attacking with what you've built. I'm honestly getting truly sick of seeing this completely unrealistic game mechanic. All RTS games do not need to be this way but most of them are exactly this way and usually implement it in a manner which makes little sense (as we see here in Winter Assault). If the imperial Guard is really so massive they should be able to bring their own pre-built tanks and such along with them (etc.) and they should have already landed a whole bunch of them during the initial planetary invasion (and the same is true for most other factions) Only the Eldar and the Necrons, perhaps, should be using the ""build-your-army"" mechanic that all factions must use in these games, and even then that side of things should be handled automatically for the most part.-Units will automatically engage enemy units whenever they are in range. Once engaged units will absolutely refuse to retreat or tactically withdraw even if they are engaged against a clearly stronger force. Given the manner in which the main campaign missions of winter Assault are setup, where you continually have fewer forces than your enemies, this (bug? oversight? design error?) problem causes the game to become severely (and needlessly) frustrating. The elite units of the Eldar should be disciplined enough to withdraw when ordered. The non-elite Imperial Guard units should actively run away from such confrontations (unless a commissar is present) but your imperial Guard (being the elite Cadians I guess) will never, ever run away even when they clearly should do so and (unlike the cadians) will ignore any orders to do so. This frustrating problem effectively breaks the game for me, particularly when there are so many other, better games out there to play.-The space marines still look cute and cuddly.			"

Positives* It is a better than average game. Buy on sale, not at full price.* As an RTS fan I can say that this game has an interesting take on the subject and is fun; that being said I've never played multiplayer, so my review is based on single player only. * The single player campaign I felt was decent, not the best. I feel that the missions took too long in order to properly enjoy the story.Negatives* Single player campaign missions took too long in most cases, and made it difficult to become fully engaged into the story. Thus the story became not enjoyable.* The characters didn't grab my attention as much compared to the Dawn of War 2. The story was simple, with obvious twists; and didn't teach enough about the Warhammer Universe or history to really get me into that world. That being said I did enjoy Gabriel Angelos, but he wasn't in the expansions!* By comparison, I'd rather spend an hour listening to a documentary about the imperium of man, and the empire, than spending an hour on a single mission.* No steam achievements.ResultDoW 1 and DLC = 6/10.If you must play this game, buy it on sale and not at full price. I also highly recommend Dawn of War 2 instead; although base building is removed, I feel it is the superior game for its story.Additional NoteSeems people don't like my review, please inform me why in the comments, thank you.

Note: This review used to be ""Not Recommended"" because there was a keygen issue which kept many people, myself included, locked out of multiplayer if we wanted to play as certain races. Relic has resolved the issue - I have not tested this myself but it appears to have worked for the community. As such, the new review reflects this change. Won't speak for multiplayer because I don't play it, but it does appear to work now. Game will be easy or hard depending on your skill level and the faction you play against. Here's why - Combat boils down to two different kinds - melee and ranged. Most factions will in general prefer one over the other, the exception being the Space Marines who are Jacks-of-all-trades. As such, if one faction prefers one kind they will naturally be weak at another. For example, I prefer the Imperial Guard, who use ranged units almost exclusively. As such, if I can't keep, say, the Orcs at a distance, my men in their weak armor will get chewed up and spat out. If I can hold them back however, the enemy will find themselves unable to survive the continual barrage of artillery, autocannon fire, lascannon volleys, and tank shells :D the key, for the IG, is to keep them away. It works differently for each faction. Know your strengths and weaknesses and the day can be yours!Campaign is also great - it's seen as one of the best in the series too. If you're new to Warhammer entirely, you might like the first Dawn of War's campaign better - it introduces a number of the races to you quite nicely and the story is fully of mystery for the first half. If you're not new to the 40k universe, then you'll probably find Winter Assault's campaign the most gratifying. 40,000/10 would pit a supertank against a Squigoth again			"

Pros:+ Solid storyline+ Four different endings+ Bug-free+ Classic RTS Gameplay+ Several different, balanced factions+ Great multiplayer/matchmaking+ Adds the Imperial Guard as a playable race!Cons:- Game is a bit short; single-player campaign lasts roughly 20 hours- Campaign gets repetitive; multiple endings require playing the same maps over and over againOverall: The first expansion to the Dawn of War game.  It introduces a new playable race, and gives a more branching storyline.  The RTS gameplay is still great, and all the factions are still balanced against one another.  It's still the same game at its core, and the imperial guard are a blast to play if you like tanks... and who doesn't like tanks?Bottom Line: If you liked Dawn of War, you'll like this game.  By itself, it's still a solid RTS worth playing.			"

												If you enjoyed any of the other DoW 1 titles you'll enjoy this game. Disappointing to only have one new playable race added since the original, but enjoyable nonetheless. I personally preferred Dark Crusade or Soulstorm, but this has the advantage of a set of single player campaign missions which were pretty entertaining, unlike DC or Ss which basically had a set of skirmishes in a persistant overworld. Still, good game when released and still enjoyable now.			"

												Warhammer 40k Dawn of War: is an amazing RTS game with a fun single player campaign, my play time in this game wont reflect the time i have spent in this game as this is a re-purchese on steam from owning the game on disk meny years back.Although i love this game, because of its age, this game is really only worth owning if you have a friend to play it against online at this point.I recommend this game to people who love Warhammer games, or RTS fans with a friend to play it with.8/10			"

												Expansion to the original Dawn of War (I) Title which offers one new Race, the Imperial Guard, which offers more variety in Multiplayer Skirmishes. Small fine-tuning adjustments to gameplay. Campaign innovated from a single linear Story to Two juxta-posed Campaigns - Order & Disorder, with the player controlling the Races ajacent to each supposed moral standing. Best experienced when having the previous Dawn Of War (I) title to maximize Multiplayer capability (allows players to use races introduced to the original Title).			"

												Similar to the first game, this one has 2 campaigns: one with the space marine and one with the chaos and orc side.I only tried the bad side since i already played the space marines in the first game. It's not horrible, but after playing the successive games of dawn of war like dark crusade and soulstorm, this one has become stale fast.I guess from an historical perspective, to learn more about the warhammer universe you might want to play this game.I didn't try the single maps, too busy with the successive titles to waste my time here further.

You CAN play it without the base game or any other expansion, but dont expect extremely varied battles.Also, in my opinion, the game is great just because it is one of the few 40k games to feature playable Imperial Guard.""Maybe if we throw more men at them they will drown in all the blood...""                                                                            -A Guard Commander "

												The story mode is quite enjoyable pitting the Imperial Guard, Space Marines (just a little bit) and Eldar against the Orks and and the forces of Chaos. The story mode is split into 2 main segments, one focusing on the Imperial Guard and Eldar, the other being focused on the Orks and Chaos. The second to last missions have two endings each. Depending on what faction is used to win the second to last mission sets who is going to be used for the last mission (This can be altered by loading up the second to last missions and using the other factions. The missions are quite long and sometimes require the use of many different tactics to complete. The last mission itself is enjoyable for another reason that I will not spoil.This expansion added a few new units to the game outside of the Imperial guard e.g. Chaplains for the Space Marines.And of course there is the new faction, the Imperial Guard. The IG are weak as infantry, requiring large amounts to be effective, but do have the balancing of their forces by having a very strong set of vehicles. They utilise the Basilisk (the only real long range unit in the game), The Leman Russ (A fairly strong main battle tank) and a few others. All of the units in the Imperial Guard are completely overshadowed by its magnum opus, the Baneblade. The Baneblade is the most powerful unit in the entire game with its ridiculously high health and major firepower. The Baneblade is the only unit that can easily go toe-to-toe with an entire army, take out there base and then return home without taking too much damage.Although all the units are available in the later expansion (that do not require the original game or any other expansions, I would recommend buying this expansion aswell, even if it is just for the story mode.

												This is a rare example of how RTS's were still unique and every faction had strenghts and weaknesses that players needed to learn to achieve their hard earned victories. To this day I say that this game is still just as fun as it was when it first came out			"

												In my opinion, the weakest of the series of DoW1 games, but still good.Campaign is kinda fun, but really short.And the only new race you get is Imperial Guard.The often overlooked aspect of this game though is that it adds a ton of new multiplayer maps, most of which are my favorites.  And not JUST because they're all snow-themed.			"

												The story mode is quite enjoyable pitting the Imperial Guard, Space Marines (just a little bit) and Eldar against the Orks and and the forces of Chaos. The story mode is split into 2 main segments, one focusing on the Imperial Guard and Eldar, the other being focused on the Orks and Chaos. The second to last missions have two endings each. Depending on what faction is used to win the second to last mission sets who is going to be used for the last mission (This can be altered by loading up the second to last missions and using the other factions. The missions are quite long and sometimes require the use of many different tactics to complete. The last mission itself is enjoyable for another reason that I will not spoil.This expansion added a few new units to the game outside of the Imperial guard e.g. Chaplains for the Space Marines.And of course there is the new faction, the Imperial Guard. The IG are weak as infantry, requiring large amounts to be effective, but do have the balancing of their forces by having a very strong set of vehicles. They utilise the Basilisk (the only real long range unit in the game), The Leman Russ (A fairly strong main battle tank) and a few others. All of the units in the Imperial Guard are completely overshadowed by its magnum opus, the Baneblade. The Baneblade is the most powerful unit in the entire game with its ridiculously high health and major firepower. The Baneblade is the only unit that can easily go toe-to-toe with an entire army, take out there base and then return home without taking too much damage.Although all the units are available in the later expansion (that do not require the original game or any other expansions, I would recommend buying this expansion aswell, even if it is just for the story mode.

												While I cannot speak for the multiplayer - the Imperial Guard are so weak and gimped that it is simply no fun to play the campaign at all. This game doesnt hold a candle to its other expansions.			"

												Please see my review about the main game. This expansion adds some units and possibly structures. The main change is the addition of the human ""Imperial Guard."" The Imperial Guard is my personal favorite faction. 4 out of 5 Stars. (Again, see my review of the ""Game of the Year"" edition.			"

												A must have for any RTS player who likes building army's with basebuilding, this time u can even paint and logo your own army and banners.The resource collection and economy works different, u capture 3 diffrent type of points, most are requisition points, one power and one relic is all u need. most armys will get lets say their main income from requisition points except the necrons as far as i know, for them, power is the main income.power works different as well, it also works as income, so the more u build or the more power points u take the more income of '' power '' u get.u spend requisition and power on buildings and units / expanding units and on upgrades.and the last one, relic points are one for each player in the map, capturing this will grand access to lets say the superweapon unit and the elite units of your army.all points can be defended by building outpost on them and upgrading them, except power points, u need to build around them to defend them.so that is basicly how it works and its more easy then it sounds really.there are tons of races, units and buildings and tons of upgrades, when u think u are done and upgrade your main, everything has upgrades again.painting your own army and giving them logo's and creating your own banner is also unique to dawn of war.every race plays different in building and in army.all the expansions and the original have great campaings two of them have a risk like campaign map with some ingame cinematics.9/10 cant with for dawn of war 3 wich will come out this year.

												Evidently, Dawn of War had a lot of roads it could take with expanding upon their success with the base game. For a first crack at it, they did some pretty interesting things. The Imperial Guard is a fun new race to play whose game mechanics give a nobility and ingenuity to the legions of ordinary men who die in the thousands just to capture mere yards of ground. On the flip side, the Chaos and Orks of the Disorder campaign (most notably fan favorite Warboss Gorgutz) add replayabilty and variety. It also lets you try multiple races to get a better feel of which one suits your playstyle.9/10			"
