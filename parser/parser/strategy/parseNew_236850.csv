												A rather complex grand strategy game, you pick a country to control starting from the year 1444 all the way to 1821. There isn't any fixed objective to aim for: it's  a good idea to try to get the achievements offered (such as world domination), as most are a real challenge to earn. Each country is divided into provinces, allowing movement of you armies from one to another in real time - nothing here is turn based. Battles aren't controlled by you, as in total war: you make your army walk onto the same province as an opposing army, and the battle outcome is decided in part by random dice rolls, and in part by factors you can influence, such as generals, terrain, morale of troops. The same can be said for naval battles, where different types of ships behave differently depending on what sea province you are fighting in, if they are in the open ocean, or in a closed sea (such as the Mediterranean). Diplomacy is fairly well fleshed out, countries can have a number of different governments, such as feudal monarchies or merchant republics, all that give different bonuses and maluses, and some (such as republics) offer the possibility to choose what type of leader you want, so as to give you more of a certain type of monarch points. You can offer alliances, royal marriages, support rebels, create false claims on provinces you don't own to give you a ""casus belli"" (a reason to go to war) among other things, the list is really really huge.Monarch points are a ""limiting factor"" in the game, you have 3 different types of monarch points (Administrative, Diplomatic, Military), each that serve different purposes. For example, military points can be spent to buy a new general, or to treat a province harshly if rebels are likely to rise up there. (As of the Art of War update, rebel mechanics have changes slightly. Instead of each province possibly spawning rebels depending on a percentage, now each rebel faction has a counter that goes up or down depending on your country's stability and province modifiers, such as nationalism, culture or religion. Once the counter reaches 100%, multiple stacks of rebels spawn). Other points can be used to change your capital, annex vassals, gain provinces in peace deals, create buildings and much more. The gain of monarch points depend on your ruler, that can give from 0 points each to 6 point each month. By spending some of your income, you can also hire advisors, that can add to your monthly monarch points income, and grant you some nationwide bonuses. Trade is also a large factor in the game, you have merchants and you can choose to send them to various trade nodes, and you can choose if you want them to try and collect money from that node with a malus, or to send the money that you collect upstream, to a different node where you can collect from. Having colonies and trade agreements with other countries helps your trade income, while being embargoed reduces your trade in nodes that the country embargoing you controls. As of the ""Common Sense"" update eu4 has a revamped fortress mechanic, given out for free. Now fortresses are placed in various provinces in your country (you can also choose to build them once you have the money), and they exert a ""zone of control"". Provinces without forts on them are very easy to conquer while in war, while provinces with fortresses on them have to be seiged or assaulted to fall under the attackers control. Forts now block enemy units from advancing, allowing the defending nation to have some space to reorganize and prepare defences, while the attacking nation has to carefully choose how and where to attack so as to lose the least amount of troops. Unoccupied forts also have a ""zone of control"": If you conquer a province next to a fort, but leave the fort to itself, the fort will free any occupied neighbouring province while at war. I love these changes, especially if you play a large nation, as it adds a whole extra layer of strategy to how you build up you nation's provinces.Paradox has created a lot of DLC for this game, but with each DLC comes a vast amount of free content as well, so it might be advisable to buy the base game before buying DLC, so as to see what you think about the game before commiting too much. If you choose to play online with a friend that owns the DLCs, even without owining the DLCs yourself, the game activates them, so its possible to try them out before you buy. It would also be a good idea to try and watch a tutorial beforehand (Arumba on youtube comes to mind), as the game doesn't do a great job of explaining all it has to offer. It's a very time-consuming, and occasionaly frustrating game, but I found that the more I played it, the more I enjoyed it: I'm constantly learning new things I can use to my adantage, and the game is becoming more satisfying due to that.

												Sadly due to the rapidly globalized economy and world we live in, exploiting indigenous populations is not nearly as easy nor profitable as it used to be. But thanks to the fine people at Paradox Interactive, I can unleash the inner beast that resides within all white European christians and do my part for humanity. Once I get bored from ousting the filthy Turkomans from Constantinople (not giving it back to Byzantium because ♥♥♥♥ orthodoxy Pope #1 forever get rekt bearded priests) I can turn my furious and just gaze across the atlantic and kill lots of savages (not my fault those filthy natives were living on Burgundian Florida). Soon the whole world will be swathed in burgundian colors, or all thats actually worth ruling (not ruling africa because africa and lots of zulu rebellions plus mosquitos).This game is best played with a warm cup of Folger's coffee in your hands, so you can actually smell the oppression while you relive the greatest period of time of all time. The period when white people discovered the world, and decided they didnt like it.			"

												Never thought that a strategy game would be the most thrilling gaming experience I have.But scrupulous, hour long planning and carefully forging alliances and marriages, while keeping an eye on which direction rival countries are sending their diplomats to, because one wrong move can turn your plans to dust, is much more addictive than you might think. The relief you feel, after a long term plan of yours is finally set into successful motion, is not describable.One of the few games where careful planning and thinking is actually rewarded. No simple rock-paper-scissors battles like in other strategy games. Even though my enemy may have the bigger and more advanced army, I might have won the war through logistics already. Everything that needs to be said about this game, has actually been said already, but I just can't pass on the chance to show my appreciation for it. I'm +90hrs in, and I'm still finding new ways to play this game, everytime I start it up. It's complex, deep and rewards the player that thinks on a larger scale. One of the best purchases I made in years.			"

												After playing Civilization 5 for quite a long time, I have started to become interested in a deeper gameplay with deeper political consequences, better religions, and more interesting colonize mechanics I couldn't do in Civilization. Of course there are plenty of mods to extend the gameplay for Civilization, but a new game, where everything is new, is fresh and exciting.So let’s shall begin with topics I want to ""review"".Music Most of the times are peaceful songs whistling in the background, but the music dynamically changes when going to war with another country, which is trying to boost the morale of the player, which usually works. The weird part about the peaceful songs are, that they are somewhat forgettable, but will stick to your head so that you may find yourself whistling a tune of a melody a week later.DLC’s There are many... Way too many DLC's that did come out for this game.Luckily they are usually units getting a better design, for 2€ each so you are not missing out on too much. The ones which are more expensive have definitely more going on. For example the ""new"" DLC ""Conquest of Paradise"" enhances the colonization mechanics which were, at the beginning of the game, a bit lackluster, but more on that later.Countries The country’s themselves are from the year 1444 to 1821, the interesting part about them is, that you are absolutely free to choose which date you are going to start, that means you can play against revolutionary French as Austria or play as Portugal to colonize the new world.AI The AI has a certain points of intelligence made out of preference, there are militaristic, diplomatic, passive and colonizing leaders for each country with their accurate ruler of that time. That is, until you start playing and the heirs will be completely different than actual history of course. The human player gets treated just like an AI to other AI's, if you conquer they will hate you, if you don't have any alliances they are going to attack you, that's why there's that certain point of risk of alliances with the AI, which can make your AI ally to an enemy faster than you might think. Just never trust them too much...Ideas The idea system is a way to put more of your own preference into the country that you are playing, there are currently 71 unique idea groups for specific country’s, 18 group ideas for country regions (like Italy) and 8 possible slots for your own idea groups to choose which consist of another 7 ideas. That sounds like a lot, and it certainly was a pain for the creators, but it was well worth it. It gives most of the countries just their own specialty. But I'm not going to go into that sort of stuff.Colonization The new made colonization concept is a simple but innovative one. Get exploration ideas, Colonize more than 5 provinces in a certain region and a colonial vassal gets created. The colonial vassal is just like another country, but he has to pay taxes and can't attack you. You can control these taxes on your own, but never set these taxations too high, because you know what happened with the USA and Great Britain at that time. Independence wars definitely can get a strain on you, if you know that you have to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to fight a war.There are certainly way more things I could try talking about, but I just want to bore the casuals and try to keep the strategic fans interested, especially the fighting mechanics and monarch points, but I don't want to tell you everything. There is that certain interest I wanted to awake in some people, so that they are going to try this game for themselves, and not get ultimately bored because I just told them everything of the game.For most of the people the Price is going to be the main issue with this game, 40€ certainly is quite a lot in the steam shop, but that's why special sales exist. If it's getting 50% off I can definitely recommend it.The game managed to keep my interest for other 265 Hours now, and hasn't even bored me a bit so far.It's probably a game what you are going to get in touch and love it, or try it and hate it.I hope I managed to get some peoples interest, and if you are still reading this, thanks for reading my first proper review. It means quite a lot to me.MfG Artjom "

												Decide to go hard mode for first game and play as the Huron Native American tribe.Start date is 1444.Things go well for first 150 years.Conquer and assimilate other tribes into federation.Feels wrong but i know i have to do it or else I'll be too weak when the Europeans arrive to fk everything up.Iroquois, Shawnee, Machican all fall to me.Spainish colony shows up in southern Texas.""No biggie"" I think ""that's really far from my borders."" (Ohio and the Great Lakes regions)I finally get colonists and start gaining territory for myself.Begin exploitation of natives even more backward than me.Feels so wrong, but i know i have to do it or else I'll be too weak when the Europeans start really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥everything up.France colonizes Northeast, Netherlands colonizes Middle States, Britain colonizes the South.I manage to Westernize, so gaining new technology costs like 200 points and not 2000.Choose not to become Catholic, and keep the Totemist ways of my ancestorsWage war against Netherlands with newly gained musket infantry while they're at war with Austria back in Europe.Still have weaker troops, despite having 30k more men in each engagement.Tens of thousands of proud Huron die to make menial gains.Manage to besiege every settlement in the New Netherlands colony, but Brandenburg shows up and saves their♥♥♥♥♥Hastily make pay a ton of money for a peace treaty. (I'm surprisingly rich, since I control nearly all trade in Ohio River)Realize about 50000 men died for nothing and shed a single tear.Time passes - 1680sFrench expand north from Louisiana, Spain has all of Texas and California, Vinland wins independence war from Norway and becomes Canada.I gain an alliance with Great Britain since we both hate French.France declares war against Britain cause they want Puerto Rico.We beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them, and Britain negotiates it so I get a province on the Louisiana-Huron border (thx GB)Things are looking good for Huron, since with my superpower buddy Britain, I wont get fked up by Europeans.Win a war against Canada, but again tens of thousands die to kill a few thousand Canadians since im still behind in tech.Time passes - 1780sCanada declares war to get back that province i previously took.""No biggie,"" I think ""I beat them once, I can beat them again.""Realize theyre in an alliance with France.Moments later I get a message telling me Great Britain has dishonored our alliance and wont be helping me.Realize I'm alone in a war against two technologically superior opponents who dramatically outnumber me.Can only watch in horror as the French and Canadians ravage my country.Shed a single tear and realize this is what my people did to the natives in real life.Cry in guilt.10/10  This game taught me more about Imperialism and why it was a terrible terrible thing than my high school and college history classes combined, and made me relate to minorities more than any bleeding heart activist ever could.its all a prank guys			"

												There is a button in EUIV that allows you to ""change culture"" in a province. It costs Diplomatic power based on how deeply rooted the culture is in that province, and once it is completed you will have instilled your nation's primary culture in the province. The game tells you that the benefits of having your nation's culture in all of your provinces include higher taxes received from your citizens, and lower risk of revolts. So, of course you click the button. Who wouldn't want that?What you may not realize is that by clicking that button, you are not introducing the local people to your nation's way of life. You are systematically wiping that culture off the map. You begin the slaughter of an entire people.Genocide is literally a click away. And you, as a leader, don't even give it a second thought. That is the kind of power you experience firsthand in this game.10/10 would destroy an entire people and their way of life again.			"

												Whilst some companies face a period of decadence and incompetence, Paradox Interactive is showing everyone else that real time grand strategy games are a commitment of theirs. Edifying a refined formula that will make you delve countless hours, you’ll be faced with many challenges, such as conducting successful military campaigns, achieving diplomatic brilliance, backstabbing your enemies and even your allies, mastering perfidious intrigue, spreading your influence, dealing with religious strife, provincial management, colonial affairs, reforming your state, all is within your reach, can you carry your legacy throughout the sands of time?Needless to say the game is a technical marble with many years of support ahead, the gameplay is both complex and very addicting so much that you’ll want to change your daily routines to quench your thirst for this illustrious nectar, if you have good ear then you’ll fall in love with the memorable soundtracks Andreas Waldetoft crafted.If you are willing to take your time and learn the many complex mechanics this game possesses, forgive the occasional lag and the confusing interface that needs improvement, you’ll be selling yourself to one of the most enjoyable experiences ever!9.5/10			"

												Ah yes, Europa Universalis IV, what is there to say about this game that hasn't already been said? History becomes your plaything as you choose among any country that existed in the year 1444 and until 1821, not just in Europe in spite of what the name suggests, but also in Asia, Africa and the Americas. You can play as one of the big boys or you can opt to play as a smaller country and try to carve out an empire as you tangle with the big fish. Be advised that the game has a steep learning curve. Even I, in spite of my several hundreds of hours of playing this game, still do not fully understand certain aspects. The game just keeps throwing new things into your face, and considering how often Paradox releases expansion packs and update patches, the game will continue to have enough stuff to interest you for a long time to come. Whether you're an achievement hunter, a master strategist or just a casual with an interest in history, this game has something to offer you if you're willing to invest the time to learn it. The choices you can make in this game are nearly limitless; create the world's largest land-based empire or rule the seas (or both). Control the flow of trade, or ignore it and focus on the production of goods in your lands (or both). Colonize the Americas, or play as a Native American tribe and crush the colonialists. Conquer India as a European power, or conquer Europe as an Indian power. Wage holy war against the heathens and heretics of the world, or leave them be. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. If you feel really daring you can do some truly ludicrous stuff. Play as an islamic Papal State, or create a Catholic Arabian empire. Or relocate your country to another part of the world entirely (Portugal in India, Norway in Canada, Ireland in New York, Georgia in Georgia, if you can imagine it, it is probably possible).  In Europa Universalis IV you are a painter and the entire world is your canvas. So go on, and paint the world your color.			"

												In Europa Universalis IV you play a powerful sorcerer that acts as the ""guiding hand"" for the nation.  The spells you cast draw on three mana pools: Paper Mana, Bird Mana, and Sword Mana.  Bird mana is used to make peace deals, genocide cultures, and stop your people from whining about war weariness.  Paper mana, in combination with a gold sacrifice, can be used to cast construction spells, in addition to making a province you gained two years ago a core part of your nation somehow.  Sword mana is used for enchanting rebel factions to keep them in line.  You generate mana for these pools by sucking the life essence from your monarch and his cabinet of advisors.  Be careful, though, as the ones that generate the most mana tend to die rather quickly.  You'll frequently see your 6/4/5 monarch die by age 30.You'll notice that most of the spells are involved with either war or keeping your people from whining about war.  Don't worry, that's by design.  There's nothing to do if you aren't at war.10/10 it's okay			"

												One of the best games I played. Europa Universalis IV is meant for thousands of hour of play time and the amount of replayability available is incredible. You could just add thousands of hours into just by the vanllia version but no it doesn't stop there.There is even a bigger mod community in Europa Universalis IV then the predecessor (Europa Unversalis III) so be prepared to play until the next Europa Universalis game.+ all the expansions they could make for Europa Universalis IV will be even a better game then now.My rating 10/10I would advise you to buy it if you're into Strategy and history and *What if scenarios*Edit: A new expansion is coming out called Conquest Of Pardise which will give us more land to and more native tribes to conquer + A new system will be input for when you conquer or when you are colonising. New nations will appear for example if you are playing as England when you are colonising Mexico English Mexico will appear. + New colonial countries will be enable to reble against you if there liberty is high enough and if they have all the requirements they might be able to form the USA or Mexico+ You will have a option to randomize North American and South American as a option which is very strange for Paradox because they usually try and make everything historically accurate but it's a nice twist for players that are sick of the same old continent of North American and South American			"

												Iam sorry Paradox, but i have to write this now. I realy like Europa Universalis IV, as i played now over 1600 Hours. You can have fun with these games, spend hour after hour with it. I also played Multiplayers in a bigger scale for over two years. I will not say the game is bad or not worth a bit of money...but there is a big argument against this game, or i would say against the DLC-Policy of Paradox. It is just insane how this is managed. Just take a look at the numbers...Steam tells me all DLC cost more than 230€ now. Okay lets say half of that is stuff you dont need, content packs etc...still 130€ plus the game for 40€. Iam no new player and played from the first years on and bought everything when it came out. But do you even know how stupid it is if you have friends just starting the game and telling them which DLC they need and stuff? They release a new DLC every few months with a few new things. Often they are good and iam very exited. But the are not everytime worth all the money. And they must be making alot of money thinking about the price. And i know...they say we put out new DLC to get some money to further develop the game and the game will get new content as long as the people buy the DLCs. Okay, that may sound good at first. But how do other game studios manage their stuff? Do they need to get out new DLC every few months for 20-30€(DLC+Contentpack)? NO. And that is almost the price of the whole game. And a DLC might bring some new stuff but not half of the game. So it is just too expensive.But it does not stop there. Iam a real Paradox-Freak you could say. I play almost all their big titles, Victoria, Crusader Kings, Stellaris, City Skylines, Hearts of Iron...you name it, i played hundreds of hours. And almost everywhere it is the same b*llsh*t!!! I want to play some Crusader Kings? Have to buy 2-3 DLCs to be on the newest Version. Stellaris the same. HoI4 the same. Skylines the same. What is that? I was so hyped about Stellaris. And the game was only half done, felt hollow and now they probably want to go the EU4 way and fix it over the years with tons of DLC. I just cant stand it anymore. After these many years iam frustrated and angry. I dont want to support this any longer. And what i hate the most about it, that maybe in a few months, i have some money, theres a sale and i will buys this freakin DLC anyway. BUT I HATE THEIR POLICY! AND I STILL WANT TO PLAY THAT STUFF! THEY GOT ME AND THEY USE ME! Combining all their game i probably payed them over 1000€ already. *Put a bad word here*!But they could do it differently. Why not bring out REAL DLC or a decent Add-On. Or Victoria 3. Where the hell is Victoria 3? Victoria was the best game they made in my opinion. But whatever. Someday Paradox will see that their way is the wrong way. Many people i know think the same. They are ruining these great games.tl;dr:If you are looking for an advice...the game is fun and you will probably like it. But Paradox has a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC-Policy. After a few years you will hate them, just like me.EDIT (from Commentsection 07.04.2017):I like the game and i have fun. Iam only using this review as the only form of protest i have besides not buying the DLC.I hope it has an impact, but iam not sure.Iam happy to see, that they have bigger Bundles now that combine different DLCs.So the packages are bigger now. That is a step in the right direction.I think this was partly done because people like me, who love the game, complain and are not brainwashed like the fanboys. Just because a game is very good, that does not mean you cant say something critical about it.I will give a positive review when iam happy with the the way the next DLCs will be.			"

												EU4 is simply the best strategy game ever made.Prior to putting over 1000 hour in EU4 I was a hardcore Civilization player. All Civ games (1-5) were a day 1 purchase for me, putting in hundreds of hours in each game. After a friend introdued me to EU4, I realized how much more a strategy game could be, and how EU4 makes games like Civilization feel obsolete. The amount of options can be overwhelming for new players, but the satisfaction of mastering the system and understanding why things happen is much more gratifying.An important factor everyone sees when they hear about EU4 is the amount of DLC / expansions the game has. So i figure i'll point out what's useful.All of the unit packs are entirely optional, but the larger DLCs range from game changing to near pointless (depending on your choice of country)Group A - Must have, game changing.1. Art of War - The single most important DLC, transfer seiges and more peace deals options. Every war is different if you have this DLC.2. Common Sense - This DLC is to peace-time as Art of War is to War-time. Develop your provinces, more government and subject options. National Focus. Group B - Noticeable, not 100% necessary1. El Dorado - If custom nations is huge point for you, this could be moved to Group A (I'd aruge the game gives plenty of options, but custom nations are super fun too!) Colonization is made much better and randomised world.2. Wealth of Nations -  Trade companies, National Focus ( if you don't have Common Sense), Privateers, Extra Religion Options3. Rights of Man - Great Power options, improves the late game.4. The Cossacks - Estates, Horde UnityGroup C - Rarely impactful but still can change the game under certain conditions.1.  Mare Nostrum - Sailors, Espionage2. Conquest of Paradise - Getting to play as a Colonial Nation3. Res Publica - The netherlands and Poland DLCI undertand how people play the game can change which DLCs are important to them, so everyone wont agree with this list, but for a new player this is what i would recommend.The game and DLCs go on sale often, no strategy fan will regret the purchase.

												Guys, this DLC policy has to stop. $27.99 for the newest expansion and the content pack? Does anyone think there is enough being released with these packs to justify the price? More to the point, why does Paradox think is a good price? I would bet they'd get far more sales from a $10 expansion and a $5 content pack.Right now with the current sale it would cost a new player nearly $160 to buy the game and everything they've released alongside the game. Without the sale the price is well over $200. Abhorrent. Even worse, the base game costs less than what they want for many of the packs at the moment: $9.99 for EU4, and $13 for the Rights of Man expansion. Now compare the fact that the base game costs $40 without a sale and they want $28 for the newest content. Nearly 75% of the asking price for the main game, for the tenth ""expansion.""I love Paradox's strategy games, they're some of the most played games in my library - but I can't support this anymore. And you shouldn't either. If all of us said enough was enough, they would have to listen. We are their consumer base, our purchasing power counts.			"

												Europa Universalis IV is the best game I've played throughout my whole life.Pros:-If you like History, this game is going to be your new way of understanding history and it will develop your comprehension of the exterior world. -You will learn a lot about the history of nations and civilizations in this game, especially about the European History.-If you have ever thought that you knew what a strategy game is, this game will change your way of thinking about strategy games in Pc platforms.-This game is beyond a classic, its originality is what strengthens its superiority as an historical game. You will feel challenged many times throughout the game.-You will have immense empires yet you will feel weak, you will own only a small town yet you will feel strong-You will start to question the essence of power in history throughout this game whether it is military, trade, diplomacy, administration, navy, technology, religion or any other concept.-There are nearly infinite scenarios that you can come up with, but you will see that the game will converge to a certain point where today's strong nations yield a hefty source of power, and the game allows you to interfere into history by enabling you to come up with an alternative one; if you are capable of it.-You will never be satisfied with what you have done so far in the game, because there is always going to be another way of doing things right-The game is evolving, and it is hard to keep up with the pace of changes in the hardcoded AI strategies, the AI is as powerful as if it is cheating. Forget about the insane bots in fps games, these bots will crush you so bad you will want to delete this game.-Some recent minor changes in the structure of the game mechanics is disabling you to overexpand quickly, if you are a player that has aggressive strategies, you will have a hard time playing this game; it is a game that requires patience.Cons:-The Pope is never reasonable.-The Holy Roman Emperor is always demanding. And he just marries consorts.-Turks don't care about anyone, they just right click on you and declare war and suddenly you find yourself preparing for higher technology to flee to Mars.-Franks always start the matches 1-0 ahead.-Italians never unify, they just build lots of ships and play a monopoly game of trade.-You can ignore the Commonwealth region as if it is a huge grassland with lots of horses-The horses are selected through a breeding process, therefore they tend to be old and experienced and legitimate.-Russians love to colonize frozen land, they just love to make the circumnavigation through land.-Spaniards enjoy discovering poor natives. But they are good catholics.-The British is unpredictable as usual. Lots of ships and pride all over the world, attention to the Royal Navy though, just kite around it. They are so Royal they will never split so you can always escape from those 500 ships somehow.-The Dutch is the Pandora Box of the EuIV.-The German Princes are angry.-Plus they like upsetting the pope.-The Scandinavians butcher each other for 500 years.-No one know what happens in India.-Same stands for China.-Same stands for Middle Asia.-Same stands for inner Africa.-Ulm has joined a coalition against us.WORRISOME!Overall, I recommend this game; even though how try-hard it might get, it is still challenging and fun.

												I love the game but I hate the ever rising cost if you want to play with expansions.  I would have given it a thumbs up but the DLC cost is getting stupid.  It's hard not to be lured in by the DLC as without buying it, you get a nagging feeling that your game is now incomplete, but it's getting beyond insane to try to keep up with the costs of playing.  I have other paradox games and it's the same thing, DLC DLC DLC.  I'm actually starting to miss being frustrated with my NES and constantly blowing into the cartridges to get them to work simply because a game had to be complete before being released as a ROM.  It had to be bug free or it didn't sell once word of mouth got out.  Sure the games were simpler but I do recall actually having fun playing them.  Now it's getting to the point that they are simply becoming increasingly expensive timekillers.  I wish there was a mixed button instead of just an up or downvote as I would click mixed at this point.  I want to click a thumbs up kinda, but every DLC that comes along just emphasizes,more and more, to me that the game just wasn't finished at launch.			"

												This game is a hell of a lot better than Civilization. I've been playing it for... I don't know how long, a few weeks. From the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep, eating between wars, literally dreaming about my kingdom and after about 200 hours playing I haven't got tired of it yet.But perhaps you'd like to hear a story. Maybe a tale of woe, of blood and vengeance...Austria, 1653. IronMan mode.My King was yet another re*ard in a long line of mentally challenged Habsburgs. Administration was difficult, for he didn't know how to count from 0 to 10 by the age of 46. Pen and paper were alien artifacts for this man, who considered burping after a meal with international envoys a diplomatic act. I was proud once, when I learned he loved guns. And forever ashamed when I found out he couldn't fathom how to work a trigger. He became a General as soon as he turned 15 and then, for the first time, he was good at something... no, I'm  kidding, he was terrible. I'm sure his kind mother put that one star over his head. She didn't fool anyone. Well... no one but the king himself, of course... silly kid...So, as a good christian overlord, I was patient-- and spent 30 years trying to kill him, spearheading the ""special"" monarch into the most challenging battles. Soon I started to fear he had been blessed with immortality to compensate for his almighty uselessness. The damned French on my western border had a 6/4/6 sadist on their throne. My neighbor's lawn was greener than mine. I was desperate.Hence came the time when I, the Holy Roman Emperor, accidentally enacted a cursed reform that wouldn't allow me to wage war against the Empire's members anymore, bringing my struggle towards unifying the HRE almost to a halt. But I had hope in my heart, for if no tragedy happened and I managed to keep peace, the 170 years left to play should be enough for me to gather 150 Imperial Autorithy points to fulfill my objective. I had 3 provinces left under foreign rule waiting for the taking and that should guarantee my success-- so I demanded what was rightfully mine.I went to war against my oldest friend and ally, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Again. They were so scared that even with their half-russian-size territory they didn't put up a fight-- literally not one, while I went on rampaging through their territory. I needed one more point for them to accept my peace offer and return the Empire's provinces when it happened...They sent forth a 62 regiments army against me, a 3 star general leading it. They didn't stand a chance against my 130 invading regiments, of course, which was about half my army at that time. But they were brave, and chose to forfeit their lives for the sake of their homeland. So a massive battle began-- and it unraveled quickly. The fight went on for less than a month when... my f****** s** of a b**** piece of s*** excuse for a King died in it. Yeah, sure, I was euphoric for a moment. But no, it turns out those weren't good news because...With his demise I lost the elections to be the next Emperor-- for the first time, mind you-- so I didn't get the 10 Imperial Authority bonus. A few days (or seconds) later, after the previously mentioned battle was won and so was the war, the Empire's territories were proudly returned by me. And then I learned you can only gain Authority if you are the current Emperor. The new guy at the office, the Holy chairman of the ancient Roman Empire, the 15 year old King of a useless single-province kingdom, laughed at me. I felt it, I swear. I'll remember that moment until the day I die... possibly even longer than that...So after about 10 minutes screaming at my computer and one more hour cursing inside my head, I recovered my sanity once again, kept it cool, and decided to wipe the Holy Roman Empire from the face of the Earth. I'm halfway there, but the more than a million rebel soldiers spawning everywhere across my kingdom are delaying my war efforts. Still, I shall have my vengeance. Sorry, I had to put that out there. A 15 year old Saxe-Lauenburgian kid as the Holy Emperor... what a joke. I'll give him his first shave with a flying cannonball.EDIT:With inhuman effort and, of course, the help of God himself (thank you, Pope) I reverted my situation and finally managed to unify the HRE. Now, in 1753, from the edges of a long-gone Hungary to the borders of Spain, Europe is under my rule.But you wonder: ""Why does that matter?"" And I tell you: because it means if I had been born in 1444 there would have been no World War I, this review would be written in Deutsche (or maybe I would have brought latin back, who knows?), and my grandson¹³² would rule Earth. Knowing that, I can finally sleep in peace. I feel my entire life had a meaning, and now a whole new purpose... to play Castile next. (After becoming a junior partner in a Personal Union under Spain, winning my independence alone against them and England, vassalizing the Ottomans and succumbing to a Civil War caused by the sudden, premature death of my first independent king made me give up on returning my westernized Byzantium to it's former glory-- by the 17th century again, obviously the worst hundred of years in human history)			"

												Listen to a person who loved this game and played it for over 1200 hours so far... This game is really amazing BUT... Paradox's DLC policy has ruined it because it continues updating a game which was perfect right from the start. Now the DLC policy consists of giving a free patch along with a new DLC almost every two months, forcing us to invest more and more money to have a complete game, because THE FREE PATCH BREAKS THE GAME AND MAKES IT UNPLAYABLE IN SOME AREAS OR TOTALLY BREAKS SOME MECHANICS UNLESS YOU BUY THE DLC COMING WITH IT wich costs 15 to 20 Euros. I'm really getting sick of this since the developers announced that they ""have a lot of ideas"" for at least the upcoming two years and they want to release more DLCs"". Really, I spent around 40 Euros simply to buy the game with 3 DLCs and I am truly convinced that it was not worth it. 20 Euros for a DLC that adds so few content is really a shame and I hope that the developers will make a step back selling those DLCs for 5 Euros (I'm not saying free, because I want to evaluate their job, but 20 or 15 Euros are seriously an insult) because they are doing a scam towards the people who are trying to have the complete game that they like and played a lot.

												I have written this review to negate some of the unfair reviews that give this game a negative score. I do admit the last couple of dlcs have been lackluster (Mare Nostrum, and The Cossacks specifically), however if the dlcs are not giving enough content for their price do not buy it. It is your choice if you decided to pay fifteen dollars for a lackluster dlc and the opinon of the dlc should not be the determination for the base game's score. There are many excellent expanions released for eu4, that in my opinon would negate any negativity from the last two expansions .The base game in itself is a game that I would reccomend playing. I have played many hours in vanilla itself. The game is a grand strategey with much more depth than games like the civ series. You play a nation of your choosing, and attempt to do as best as you can with it. Some nations are easier than other due to this game being based on history ( France is stronger than a Native American nation). The game is like a puzzle, many hours will be spent figuring out alliances, truces, aggressive expansion opinon modifiers, religion to be able to conquer the world without destroying yourself in the process. There are national ideas and events which make many nations unique in their playstyle, and there are idea groups which you unlock which give you various bonuses that can further specalize your nation. One thing that is amazing about this game is whenever something happens that could ruin my game it is always my fault, and it is something that you can learn from and choose to never make the same mistake again.The DLC is one thing that is essential to review, there are a lot of dlc for this game. Don't judge the game on the the price of every dlc combined, many DLC are just cosmetic and music addition packs. There are a few dlcs that are expansions to the game ( Res Publica, Wealth of Nations, Conquest of Paradise, Art of War, and Common Sense) which in my opinon are all essential and worth every penny spent on them. If you are scared of the hefty base price of these dlc combined, don't be scared as they frequently go for sale up to 75% off, so you can get all these expansions for less than 10 dollars if you wait for good sales. If you wait long enough the recent dlc (Cossacks and Mare Nostrum) will probably be given huge sales as well.I would not reccomend this game who are looking for quick fun, this is a game you sit down for hours at a time to plan and fail, and then restart the game over, and then fail but do a little better, then fail fail fail, and then you may finally perfect your game and do way better. A single playthrough can take around two weeks to get through, while it may take a lot of time it is really satisfying when all goes to plan and you acheive your goals. I would reccomend this to people who enjoyed civ games but are unsatisfied by the lack of depth or strategey in those games, I would reccomend this to people to have enjoyed playing Risk. In fact I reccomend this to most people I have met.tl:drA lot of reviews are being unfairly negative about this game to their opinon that the recent two expansions are overpriced for the content they delivir (I share this sentiment). However this game has a lot of other expansions that are really good that balance this out. The vanilla game is in itself really good. Don't expect a fast game, or something that you can just pick up and play I have played around 700 hours and am considered a intermediate player. While a bit diffcult to start it is an amazingly satisfying game when your plans come to fruitation. 10/10			"

												Just as a warning, I own every DLC (Costs a lot of $$$ but this studio deserves the support) and have played this game pretty extensively.Europa Universalis IV is a game focused around war, trade, and exploration.  What it really excels in is war, the other two 'focuses' of the game have been improved over time, but the game still revolves around war.  This wouldn't be a problem if with every patch they wouldn't make conquest more tedious.  From the 1.7 to the 1.8 patch (Art of War, released in November 2014), conquest was made much, much easier, and completing World Conquests (A particular feat, being the only independent nation left in the world) was made much easier.  From there, Paradox has been adding roadblock after roadblock to conquest.  This is okay, though.  If conquest was as easy as point and click, and no thought has to be put into it, then this game wouldn't be such an engaging, addicting, and fun experience.This game's learning curve is interesting.  I can't remember much of my early experience but you're given a complex yet simple interface, tooltips that don't mean much (which has been helped with some semi-recent patches), tutorials that also don't help much, and, of course, the shock of ""What am I supposed to do?  Is there a goal?""  The answer to those questions is both simple and intimidating, and it slaps you in the face rather abruptly.  It depends.  You do whatever it is you like, there is a score system but it doesn't really mean much.  That means that short of being in 1st place at the end of the game (which is rather easy for most nations), there is no goal.  You take control of your nation, you embody it.  That nation is you.  It took me about 4-6 hours to understand how to play the game, and another ~100 to 'git good'.  I stopped improving as a player (much) at about 1500 hours.In short, this game is about entering the renaissance, takes a huge time investment, is super fun, and hard to learn.10/10 -IGN.			"

												I will expand my review as someone found it probably unclear, i really loved this game from the 500+ hours of gaming you can see it, it is one of the most complex strategy games ever created.The huge issue here is the policy of the software house that developed it after the realease that i personally consider nothing less than criminal.When they realease a major dlc (expansions) the add new interesting mechanichs in the game, this would be perfect if at the same time they didn't brake some basic mechanics of the base game without that dlc. A perfect example of that is territory developement, if you don't have the dlc you cannot develop buildings in a country, which is a function of the base game that you could use before the dlc, and therefore i already bought with the basic game. That is nothing less than a theft.At the moment this can be a wonderfull game, but only if you are ready to spend 100€/$ on expansions dlc after buing the 50€ broken basic one.			"

												It’s taken me a while to wrap my head around what I now believe to be the reality that Europa Universalis IV is not a strategy game. It is an exquisitely detailed and complex simulator. Certainly you apply strategy to it to be successful within the simulation, but the point of the game is not to win. It is to explore possibilities, only a limited number of which are actually owned or even impacted by you. The smaller your nation or sphere of influence, the smaller impact you have on the world simulation.As a result, you can find yourself often just letting the history of the game take its course for a while without making any meaningful decision. It’s a game where you often drop a stone in the water and watch for the ripples. Yes, the game has an unbelievable number of systems, but you need to approach it from a context almost like playing with sliders to see what happens as opposed to making winning or losing moves. When you see that, you’re able to begin to unlock what the system is trying to show you.The easiest way to feel like you’ve failed at a game like EUIV is to play it like a traditional strategy game. The more you force your own ideas about external goals onto the game, the more challenging and resistant the game becomes, which, to be fair, is a fairly accurate representation of history as well. There’s a reason guys like Napoleon, Hitler or Alexander never win in the long run, and it’s because the more you impart your own will of domination on the world, the harder it becomes to maintain, control and stabilize.This game never lies to you, but it allows you to lie to yourself all the time. You can fool yourself, as so many tyrannical leaders have before, that you have amassed supreme power and that your ascension is a destiny and foregone conclusion, only to find yourself torn down low almost at once. It’s an illusion fostered by so many strategy games that came before. The difference is, in other games, the bigger you are, the bigger your base of power from which to exert domination. In EUIV, being bigger makes you strong, but potentially fragile, unstable and absolutely a target. "

												I generally like this game but there´s something♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off and prevents me from buying future titles of this franchise. The DLC policy is simply impertinent. Not only are the costs greatly exaggerated, the game is also forcing you to buy certain DLCs. There are some gamebreaking mechanics in the game which only get fixed by DLCs. Example?: You want to conquer a province. You get a claim on it. You declare war with your allies. Allies take the wanted province. Now you can not cede this claimed province to you during the peace talks because your allies have occupied it (aka you were not fast enough) unless you have The Art of War DLC.You are also unable to improve your economy which is a turn off for every smaller country. Your development level is fixed for the entire game... unless you have Common Sense DLC.			"

												Yes, the game is fun. Yes, all the screenshots look all cool and exciting.Now scroll down.Yes, that is $250 of DLC. Now, a lot of that is just pointless unit and music packs, so let's say you only want the important gameplay-changing stuff: Rights of Man, Conquest of Paradise, Art of War, El Dorado, Common Sense, The Cossacks, Mare Nostrum, Res Publica, and Wealth of Nations.  That's $135 worth of DLC.			"

												At first, they made a few DLCs, and with every new DLC they also put out a free patch, and the really important features were included in the free patch, not in the DLC, so ""everything was fine"". In the meanwhile, they made cosmetic and historical content DLCs for the more passionate players, and even though anyone who enjoys the game would also enjoy those things, they still did not impair core gameplay, so ""everything was fine"".Then, they started making fundamental gameplay changes and delivered core new game features with the DLC, and the patches that accompanied the DLCs were merely balance tweaks and were made with the new DLC in mind. So now core gameplay features are behind a DLC paywall, plus whether you have said DLC or not, you get the game version which is balanced around the DLC, so you're screwed anyway. They did it once, and anyway they go on sale often, so ""everything was fine"". By when they had done it five times, you either gave in every time and paid for the new DLC, or by then the amount of core gameplay elements that you were locked out of by the DLC paywall was so big, and the balance of the game so focused around that, that you found yourself with a broken game you  couldn't effectively play anymore. A game that you loved, but now held hostage by around 150€ of DLCs. Blackmail much?You used to be different Paradox. I guess getting bigger has changed you for worse. Too bad.Edit: guys don't get this review in a wrong way: I still play the game and I still did buy most of the DLCs when they were on a 66%-75% sale. The problem is that Paradox used to be different and now they have become very unfriendly to their loyal fan base. It's not just the ludicrous amounts of DLCs and the shift from delivering core game elements via free patches to locking them behind a paywall. If you've ever been on their forums you know they have zero interest in the community feedback, just like you know there are bugs that have been present since day one of this game and haven't been fixed, and so on.My negative recommendation is for possible new players: if you're new to Paradox games I suggest you do not get into them at their current state. Currently they are a huge money sink, and a source of frustration due to bad game design decisions made ignoring community feedback and huge bugs left unfixed.			"

												In this game there are these things called 'blobs'. Some blobs grow big, others dissapear, but, overall, seeing the blobs fight is fun. You control a blob of a certain color, and lead it to absorb all other blobs in the process. There is this 'blue blob' called France, that, when eaten, is the greatest feeling one can get. The more blobs you eat, the more still living blobs will go against you, feeding you in the process. All blobs have advantages and disadvantages, unless if your an American blob, then you're just ♥♥♥♥ed.10/10			"

												Hello Gamers! PET here and I'm here to recommend you  Europa Universalis IV.EUIV is a Grand Strategy Game. That means it's pretty hard to pick up. It's something pretty unique. You start as early as 1444 and you can play with any country in the world. Yes, you head that right. ANY country in the world! The game also does not give you a purpose which makes the game a bit difficult. Some people find it hard to play a game when you don't know exactly what to do.So this is the thing. You pick any country in the world and you do whatever you want. You can pick Portugal and try to colonize South America. Hell, you might go directly for North America. Or hell, you can even start a war with Catalunia (later Spain). No one is telling you what path to follow and this is what makes this game amazing.Really, it's a complex game so I recommend for you to check my video & tutorial down below. I guarantee that after you watch that video you will be able to pick up EUIV and you will not regret this!Full video review & tutorial here:

												Dev keeps making the game worse. Locks features that should be free updates behind paywalls for rediculous prices and now is adding mechanics purely to punish the player for attempting to do well. They are on a crusade to stop the conquests of an elite few and instead turn the game into a snooze fest for the average player. They are completely out of touch with their player base at this point and I am incredibly disapointed in the latest few ""additions."" This was once easily my favorite game and now I weep at the sad thing it is becomming.This is coming from someone with over 1.5k hours played and 115 plus achievements with all the DLC. Get it on sale, but prepare to be disapointed by Johann (who should be fired for how horrible they mismanage) and the ""improvements"" they add to the game all for the low low price of $100.			"

So all the newcomers have to sell their houses and live in a carton box to be able to play this game with every DLC and keep up with the upcoming ""expansions"". (I may exaggerate a little, but you get what I'm saying, right ?)It would all be fine if the quality of the game and the DLC were as high as the price. But we still swim in the ocean of bugs.

												A steep steep learning curve, but so so much replayability and engaging gameplay to be had. Incredible depth and the game is continously supported and updated by Paradox.The only real knock on the game, is that there's no real victory condition to aim for, just an end date and the game is very free form, in that you essentially have to choose what you want to try and achieve in each playthrough. But there are a lot of steam achievements that can provide inspiration for interesting game ideas.Do note that by now there's a lot of DLC out, and buying it all at full price in one batch is a daunting prospect I'd imagine. But there are quite frequent sales (every couple of months) of 66%/75% discounts on most of the DLC. By now they really should permanently discount some of the older DLC and the base game.			"

												After this long playing Europa Universalis 4 what do I have to say about it?It has too much DLC.The game is in an ever evolving state because the developers keep working on it to create new DLC.  And while this is good, expanding on weak points and increasing players' options.  It also detracts from the game by forcing players to upgrade every so many months.  It is like a game you purchased for full price coming with a subscription that if you don't keep up with your game will start getting screwy.This screwiness comes from the half-availability of aspects of each DLC, making it so that there are things you cannot do without the requisite DLC, but the game fully expects you to be doing.Aside from that ever expanding problem is the tutorial, which does not keep up with the DLC.  A new player is royally porked by the tutorial as it is largely wrong and often broken.I have enjoyed it, a lot.  The game is not bad by any stretch.  But the way the DLC has gone I have become increasingly displeased with Paradox as a company and more and more I am content to just not buy anymore of these monday to friday DLC for this monkey financing games.  I will not be getting Hearts of Iron 4 until it is complete in its development cycle because of the way DLC has been handled by CK2 and EU4.Deep, rich strategy combined with deep gouging DLC...  I would skip it until you are getting the Complete pack with everything included.  Unless you are a 100% gung-ho grand strategy fan it is just not worth keeping up with the Cardassians.			"

												If you're into strategy, history, domination, diplomacy, and 4x's in general, then there's a lot to like about Europa Universalis IV.  It starts in 1444 and goes all the way to 1821, following the proto-country you pick through an almost 400 year history.  There are over 100 Nations to choose from, among other formable ones once the proper conditions are met; such as Prussia, Egypt, and the Netherlands to name but a few.The game is in real time, not turn-based, but you are able to pause the game to issue orders and deal with your affairs, or slow the game speed down to settings 1 or 2 (of 5, 5 basically being as fast as your computer can handle).  You build your armies and determine its makeup (out of Soliders, Cavalry, and Artillery) and this affects how battles will go.  A lot of Nations have special bonuses to certain things (like Poland gets a bonus to its Cavalry), which also affects the outcomes of battles; which are based on dice rolls (sort of like Risk) which are greatly affected by the general you have leading the army.It is a complicated game with a great deal to learn (it makes Civilization seem arcadey), but if strategy, simulation, and history are your thing, it's easily worth the time investment and should provide countless hours of fun and content (it's on Steam Workshop and there are a ton of mods for it, not to mention Paradox often releases expansions and extra DLC artwork for it as well).  The game can also feel very fresh based on what part of the world you're playing in and as what Nation, as strategies will vary wildly depending on that.It's very easy to recommend this game to fans of the genre.

												Great strategy game, so much depth and replayability. I'd love to give it a thumbs up for that, but unfortunately, I can't. I don't know why everyone lets Paradox get away with how they price their DLC, but it's ridiculous at this point. If you want all the DLC you are looking at upwards of $200, upwards of $100 for the main expansions. They have the ebook common sense by Thomas Paine listed on here for $1.99, something you can get for free anywhere on the internet, they literally just copied and pasted the book in, they at least have the decency to say it is in the public domain.There are so many skins and music DLC's that could really be combined into one pack each for $10-20, instead of god knows what it costs to buy it individually. I'd actually be willing to pay that. The same goes for the DLC, they could probably combine two of them and charge the same price, that might be somewhat more reasonable. I'd love to play with the main expansion DLC's, i just cannot justify paying over $100. This game is desperately in need of some bundles or DLC pricing revision. Who is buying this stuff I don't know, but they've got money to throw away, I can tell you that. So I'd love to tell you about how great the game is and why you should get it, but I cannot recommend it because of the blatant and greedy DLC gouging. I don't want this to be the norm, and it shouldn't be. I like hearts of iron too, but I know it will be the same story with that. I like to get the full experience, but I won't be duped into paying that much, and it honestly has me thinking about quitting Paradox games all together. Reasonably priced main game, amazing grand strategy to get you hooked, and then truckloads of overpriced DLC to milk the cash out of you.It is a good game though. That's why it sucks so much to see them spoil it by doing this kind of crap.			"

												After being a long time fan of this series, I am dissapointed in the new direction they are taking with this product. The goal now, is to simply monetize every single aspect of this game, and make it unplayable unless you buy all the DLCs... This is unnaceptable Paradox.For example, they patched the core 'vanilla' version of EU IV, to add a 'region development level' feature to the game. However, you cannot actually raise the development level of a region, unless you buy another dlc called ""Common Sense""... Really!?! Why are you forcing this feature onto the vanilla version, if you need a dlc to fully play it? Pardon the pun, but it makes no sense.Paradox is essentially going back, and making a game you bought in the past, unplayable. It's sad how how patches meant to fix bugs, and add positive features to a game, is now purposefully breaking it so you have to pay more money to fix it.To quote Game of Thrones, SHAME!			"

												I love the Europa Universalis games, i have played since Eu1 and it's been a blast. EUIV is better than the previous games in the series but it have been broken by greed. Eu3 had 4 pretty good expansions if i remember correctly and they gave you a good amount of game for the money you invested. In IV Paradox said ♥♥♥♥ it and started to milk us with dlc's that is not only way to expensive but also very weak in terms of content.Not only that, but your game is de facto broken if you do not pay their ransom(for dlc's) and that is a almost criminal, do you not have any shame in you? Why is it that when i have bought a game i'm punished until i buy a handful of sort of crappy mini additions? It used to  be that an expansion was a expansion, something one could buy and get so much more as an upgrade to the original game! An expansion did not break the original game and force you to spend money to fix it. I used to love you guys. You were reasonable and had a focus on getting as much quality into your products as you could with the small resources/manpower you had at hand. But somewhere on the way you became corrupted by the idea of milking your consumers wallets dry. Because of this i cannot leave a good review on this game nor can i recommend anyone to buy it in its current state. I will not buy any more of your games until you stop doing this to your fans and to yourself. The whole situation makes me sad actually, you used to be the best.Eu IV is a awesome game (if you buy a ♥♥♥♥tondidedelie worth of dlc's, to get it playable) and it brings endless fun. A solid 10/10 (provided you own all addons). (this is my second ever review, am i doing it right?)			"

												Another awesome game from paradox! A great improvement from EU3. But CK2 is still my favourite!Amazing game that really makes Civilization 5 look kind of boring in comparison.I'm a big fan of strategy games but have always found it hard to find that special sense of satisfaction towards the end game. Many times conquering or in other ways dominating the world can be a repetitive and somewhat boring process. The Europa Universalis-series have been one out of a very few games delivering and with the latest version the team over at Paradox has made it easier than ever for new players to jump in. That said, this isn't a game for the casual player and the amount of information clearly surpasses games like Civilization. But for me, who don't mind some learning, planning and strategic thinking, it's as close to a PC-game blessing as is possible. The satisfaction of transforming an insignificant little European country in nowadays Germany or Italy into the worlds most powerful nation is immense.			"

												One of the best Grand Strategy games I have ever played. Warning: there is a lot here, it is super complex, and it will take time to learn all the different systems. However, it is well worth the time.The only complaint that I would have is that, true to its name, Europa Universalis is heavily Euro-centric, to the point of game mechanics that stunt and even cripple non-European nations. I understand why they did it, but I think a better way could have been found.On the other hand, if the Eurocentricity of the game concerns you, you can always go to the Steam Workshop - I am amazed at how open the devs have made the game; almost anything can be modded or tweaked to however you want it.

												I love this game, its my most played game on Steam, but as of the Common Sense DLC/Update I no longer feel like playing it. So with this DLC coming out you have 2 new options in regards to the building system. You can be limited to having 1-6 buildings (varies depending on province) per province, with no way of leveling up the provinces to put more buildings in. This means, that at a certain point in the game, when more that 6 buildings become available, you will not be able to do ANYTHING unless you pay $15 (USA) to unlock the development feature. This honestly pisses me off because it should be in the core game to begin with, but instead they make you pay for an essential feature. Apparently it slipped by the devs minds that this game is getting very ""pay to win"" because without the DLC the game is trash, honestly. The DLC is bug fixes and♥♥♥♥♥♥that should have been in the core game, but locked behind a paywall.

												Pro's: - Perhaps not as deep or intricate as its predecessor (at least from what I've heard), but certainly more captivating and immersive than the vast majority of strategy games on the market. - Excellent replay value if you're willing to stray from your tried and true strategies and set interesting goals for yourself.- Updated relatively often.- Tons of fun with friends.- Great for acquainting yourself with basic geography.- Sandbox style makes it a history enthusiast's best friend for ""What If?"" scenarios.- Custom nation designer with the El Dorado DLC makes it even more replayable.- Feels like you are truly managing an empire, unlike some other titles which shall not be named that focus way too heavily on military and not nearly enough on diplomacy or the economy (you fools!).Con's:- Some nations are lacking in flavour, though you can't blame Paradox for not being able to flesh out every single one of them.- AI drops the ball fairly often, but it's honestly no worse than you'd find in any other strategy game. The human brain is OP.- DLC is a little expensive, but worth the investment most of the time.- If you're a fan of Total War or similar games, the military aspect of the game will not appeal to you. Combat is simply numbers on the map, rolls of the die, and various modifiers (it is much more complex than that, but I'll let you read up on that in your spare time).Verdict - 9.5/10 Would blob again. It's the most played game in my Steam library.			"

Posted: November 23, 2016
												I originally wrote an EU4 over 2 years ago, but I feel like a new review is appropriate since ive played it much more since then. The following is the original review, but edited to account for changes since version 1.7 when I originally played it, to version 1.18 it is on now. Additions are in bold, subtractions/edits are with strikethrough.""I'm sure everyone has at one point had that power fantasy of wanting to be some supreme ruler of a country, whether that means you are a kind and benevolent, or a cruel-hearted demon of a ruler is a different story (Rulers now actually have personalities now, so you can have a cruel or kind leader which is appropriate). Well with Europa Universalis IV (EU4), you can be either of them if you so desire. In fact, it is more than just that, much much more, with expanding your borders, and crushing your enemies, the game comes alive to the player in numerous ways.Well the first, and most obvious way is the aforementioned power fantasy fulfillment. Play as any sovereign nation state, and see the rise (and possibly fall) of your empire over a span of over 350 years. Play a diplomatic, a heavily military game, or a trade heavy game, and begin to cut out your own little slice of the world. Play upon alliances, and take down common threats, then come back and backstab your previous allies when you want their land. Customise how your nation focuses it's tech, and use that to push your nation's strengths to new limits, allowing you to potentially be an empire worth fearing. Turn a backwater into a thriving metapolis the envy of the world, be the origin of the the world's greatest advances in civilization and guide history in the direction you desire.This does not come at the expense of player accessability although. The game falls into that simple mantra of easy to learn, hard to master. With its relatively simple and watered down mechanics (compared to the other paradox strategy games of course), it provides great depth with a minimum of actual work in any one area. Within a few hours, you will understand how to run your nation (probably through trial and error, but still useful), and even if you fail, it is not the end. One lost battle or war is no reason to quit, besides lost troops or land, there is always room to come back and defeat those who beat you. The game is not cruel, it is fair to the player.Except in one area I have noticed. The game has a problem with making the AI cheat, and when I say cheat, I mean really cheat. No fog of war, more manpower, no loan penalties, more money, a lot less aggressive expansion penalties, and war happy. So you will find them declaring war out of the blue, just because they feel like it, even if you far outmatch them in some cases. This is very notable with one nation, France. France is, without a doubt, the most powerful nation in the game, with the highest concentration of high wealth provinces, and with excellent starting armies, generals, manpower, and position. In addition to unique french events, and traditions, france is an absolute powerhouse in the early, mid, and late game unless you can form a more powerful nation and can manage to crush them. AI, outside a few minor things the AI can't properly assess (fog of war, and naval attrition), doesn't cheat. Some nation positions and minor differences in regional troop types can give vastly different outcomes in terms of things such as war.EU4 really excells in many areas and mechanics, two of which are it's ideas system and war system. Ideas are essentially specialisations for your nation you can take over time, and will guide your nation state's direction of how it approaches the world. It can give you a vastly better military, or be geared to making you more money to just buy friends (or troops from other nations to fight for you). It makes every nation feel and play uniquely in their situation, so it is never boring playing as two different nations and using the same ""build order"". War is also incredibly in depth, with dozens of small factors and things that can be used to optimised fighting and tweaking troop's fighting ability. It is incredibly easy to understand, but as ive said before, takes a while to master all the intricate details that influence how well troops fight. The satisfaction of setting up a perfect situation, executing that military plan, and crushing your opponent into the ground, is second to none. Despite that major gripe, it is does not detract from the positives that EU4 has. Seeing your nation which you have been through hundreds of years of war and technological advances, slowly  grow larger in most cases grow in influence, as well as the social changes that happen over one of the most important parts of human history, is very satisfying to see. But after all that, it is sad to say goodbye to your nation which you, in some cases, raised from infancy all the way to adulthood. But in the end, that is something that must happen, and there will always be other nations you can rule over to perpetrate the cycle anew.See more reviews by following this group - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JSJaRG ""			"

												As it stands right now, this game is broken unless you buy Common Sense (which the devs seem to be lacking as of late). I love this game, it is quite frankly my favorite game, or more accurate ""was"" my favorite. Core features gutted from a previous version that worked wonderfully, was fun to play, and allowed you to challenge yourself now is less useful then a cat. Want to build buildings? Good luck, that lovely city that is your capital can hold 3 buildings! Six if you're super luck (major, major, major if). Want to get more manpower? Good luck with that, you can't spend those lovely Monarch Points on anything but technology, coring, annexing, stomping on rebels, or ideas. If you thought you had overflowing amounts of Monarch points previously, you've seen nothing yet!In all seriousness though, they've managed to take a favorite game of mine, and ruin it. Also, to those who say, ""oh, hey, you have the DLC!"", I do to test and see what major changes it did bring. Spoilers, nothing. All it added, and I wish I was kidding, was the ability to improve provinces WHICH WAS ALREADY A PART OF THE CORE GAME. No, I'm not joking, and I very, very rarely use capslock, but that's it. They basically broke their game, hid a key feature that was already present in the game previously behind a paywall, and then gave a big middle finger to their audience.			"

												Europa Univesalis IV is a game about managing a country through the time period from 1444 to 1821. Of course, that's like saying Half-Life 2 is a game about walking from Point A to Point B: technically true, but not very enlightening. Managing countries in EU IV is a very involved process, involving juggling over a dozen interconnected systems.The most important facet of nation-managing in EU IV is warfare. War allows you to expand your country and provides the most interesting and in-depth part of the game. Planning and executing a masterful plan of war, fighting and winning several wars simultaneously, or outwitting and outfighting a significantly larger opponent provides a thrill few things can match.The economic side of your country cannot be neglected, however, lest your ability to wage war be seriously hampered. The trade system can be quite complicated, but mastering it will provide you with money beyond your wildest dreams, not to mention your enemies' ability to compete.Make no mistake, this is not a simple game; I was a good forty hours in before feeling like I had a firm grasp on the majority of the systems. Study of the game is richly rewarded, though—I have over 700 hours in it at the moment and anticipate hundreds more. The wiki provides a lot of guidance, and the community is always willing to provide help and advice. Check it out if you're interested; if you're ready to take your strategy gaming to the next level, grand strategy games may be for you.			"

												The game is good, but 130 $ of paid updates makes it impossible for me to recommend this game. Here is how the Paradox marketing scheme works : 1 - Release a vanilla game that is as stripped down as possible2 - Release major features of the game in a series of 20$ paid updates (and call them ''DLC'') 3 - End up with a game that costs 44 $ and a ''DLC'' list that amounts to 245 $ 4 - Enjoy the profits			"

The DLCS are great, El Dorado has given me so much enjoyment from the game. I have owned it for a short amount of time but I already have about 100 hours on it, to be brief, is this game annoying: yes, is the game fun: It's complicated but it is very fun if you have the time to learn the rules. Is the game sometimes a ♥♥♥♥ING WAITING GAME: 100 TIMES YES! But it'll provide you with hours of joy, I know people who have played this for over 1,000 hours, it's worth the $40.00, trust me.			"

												I've loved Paradox games since HOI2, putting god knows how many hours into them.  Even when the launch product is kinda bad (ie every game except CK2), Paradox patches/expands them up to a great state.  Hell, Victoria 2 just got a new patch a few months ago, and that game is 6 years old!Problem is, starting with CK2, success went to Paradox's head.  First, they moved their new games to Steam exclusivity.  Then Johann and Frederik saw how much money they were making, then looked at how much money Clash of Clans was making, and realized just how dumb their prior business model was--and how dumb Supercell was at the same time.  ""Why should people buy a game once, or be given it for free, when they can be made to buy it forever and ever and ever?Welcome to DLC hell guys, where the DLC NEVER STOPS COMING!			"

												Take a fairly solid grand strategy game, filled to the brim with unique mechanics and indepth ricing strategies to get the highest score as fast as possible. The game has a steep learning curve, but learning it is rewarding. You never feel cheated; every loss in battle is on you and every wrong move is your fault.Now, take that same grand strat, but remove the more selective unique mechanics and lock them behind a paywall. Remove the ""cheese"" strats that reflected knowledge of the games inner mechanics by means of arbitrary checks that only serve to prevent any ricing at all. Keep the learning curve, but make it far less steep and remove any reward for learning at all. Make sure the player feels cheated on the sole principal that they rolled a lower number than their opponent when it came to their battles and hit them with a random -1 stability every twenty-or-so years. You now have Europa Universalis IV.At one point, I had abandoned this game and forgotten why I did so. 2016 Summer Sale rolls around, and I find numerous DLCs on my wishlist to be about five bucks a piece, even if they were 66% off. After dropping twenty seven dollars on features that should be in the base game, I open a Pandora's Box that I forgot I had closed for good reason.My first wall came to enabling Ironman Mode, an option in the game that allows achievements. The mode would refuse to allow me any achievements, claiming that I was running mods or playing with an altered savestate (neither of which were true). The only fix I found after searching through Paradox Forum posts involved manually deleting all files, reinstalling all files, and verifying that all files are accounted for, as the game would occasionally choose checksums that it did not ""like"". Whatever; I fixed that problem eventually. Maybe finally I could play my game.My second issue is pretty nitpicky, I have to admit. The fact that the game will remove a current instance and relaunch the game if the player presses the ""Main Menu"" button is nothing short of annoying. To my understanding, Paradox implemented this feature to save time for those who crashed regularly from clicking the previously mentioned button instead of actually fixing the problem at hand--the fact that there are people crashing because they press a button. This fix is lazy and something of maybe an indie developer's method, not a professional company such as Paradox.My next complaint is about something that nearly everyone complains about: game balance. Historically speaking, France and England and the like completely dominated the time period, leaving other nations in the dust. In other Paradox games, such as Crusader Kings 2, the player can throw history out the window and make some sort of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized nation of Viking Muslims and declare Jihad on Charlemagne if they're lucky. This is not true for EUIV in the slightest, as the game regularly limits the activities of One Province Minors and smaller nations and even grants bonuses to the ""Lucky Nations"" of the time period. It's fairly annoying, because if you even try to play a minor nation next to one of the grand blobs of history, you will most likely die if you do not form an alliance (based on RNG if they like you or not) immediately.Over time, Paradox has also had the need to add arbitrary and outright stupid features to make the game more difficult that usually don't make any sense while ignoring features that need to be fixed. Shattered Retreat, for example, will still lead your army from one end of North America to the other instead of to a safe province away from the enemy. It's also unavoidable; a Shattered Retreat will always happen unless if there are no troops to fortify or if the troops have no morale left. Instead of maybe fixing this feature, they add other unnecessary blockades to play, such as the argument between states and territories and the god-forsaken diceroll mechanic that sweeps early game with an arbitrary fist. It's also good to see that the player can lose a single battle in war and lose the well-being of their nation to fortify only four-thousand men, but the AI can throw about their manpower willy-nilly and recuit mercs with practically no repurcussions because they literally don't care about anything else but removing the player.I tried to like this game. I really did. I just can't bring myself to play it past all the lazy mechanics and excuses that are already in play.EDIT: 4/22/17This♥♥♥♥♥♥is just getting laughable now.Recent patches, for some awful reason, have turned the AI ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥; a commonplace occurence, for example, is for an army of about 12k to ram their skulls into a 40k Ottoman doomstack. Johan pumps out more DLC than actual balance patches, and the achievments have turned from challenges to either straight-up exploits or what I can only assume is the result of a ""Random Cheevo Button"" that operates in the following fashion:Play as [COUNTRY] and [DLC FEATURE] before [YEAR]I really don't know why I play this game--maybe it's because Stellaris isn't too fixed up yet and HoI is too short--though I can assure you that they will follow the same path as EU4, the path of cash-grabbing $200 from your wallet to even play the full game. There is no reason a game should cost about as much as my uni enrollment deposit.			"

												Europa Universalis IV is a grand strategy game that provides unparralled levels of control over a nation. In most strategy games of this scope, say the Civilization or Empire series, you have control an economy dictated by resourses collection and expenditure and diplomacy that involves little more than trade deals and defensive pacts. What makes EU4 the grandest of all the strategy games is the depth of control you are given in virtually every aspect of gameplay.If you like trading, you can get to the nitty gritty of trade steering, production management, and manipulating node control to yield far more money than otherwise possible. Perhaps you just like to smash stuff with a massive army; you can even tactically manage your fighting armies through precisely timed reinforcements or through careful manipulation of combat width. The level of diplomacy available is exemplar as well, allowing for everything from royal marriages, to trade embargoes, to papal excommunication, to building spy networks and destroying an enemy's reputation.The bottom line of EU4 is that it is what you make it. Everything is there - everything. So this can be a game of world conquest or it can be a game of financial domination or it can be a game of influence and family. There are so many possible play styles and nations to mix and match that the 500+ hours I have logged have only scratched the surface of what is possible in this game.Not only is EU4 my favorite of grand strategy games, it is one that has brought many bonds into my life. As with most games like this, EU4 comes with a community.			"

												If you are interested in history/geography/economics and that sweet sense of accomplisment, then look no further! There simply isn't any alternative to what Europa Universalis IV offers.However, beware of the leaning curve. My story began back in 2013, I read about it somewhere and was so hyped and the moment it came out in local game store, I bought it. It is worth mentioning that this was my first Paradox Interactive game and that I really had no clue what to expect. So I installed it, chose Teutonic Order for my first playthrough (guess knights seemed cool enough), and got destroyed by Poland. So I restarted it several more times to no avail. It really felt like I was playing with Microsoft Excel compared to Total War games I have been actively playing before. So I chose France then as it was highlighted as a beginner nation, and I failed miserably again. After that I rage quit and uninstalled the game.It wasn't until year later that I installed the game again and decided to actually do my best to understand the basics. And I started as Castille which greatly helped me learn a thing or two about EU4. Ever since then, I am an avid fan of this game, it's by far the best strategy game there is, in my opinion.Pros:1. You get to pick any country which existed during this period and that includes a vast amount of countries. I guess the most obvious choice is to start with your own country if it exists and try to bring it to its greatest historical extent.2. You pick your own goals. There really is not predefined goal. Sure if you start as Byzantium, you are bound to face Ottomans or if you are one of Irish nations, England is not going to make your life easy. But what I mean is that there is a vast array of choices you can make in this game and change the history. Make Ottomans convert to Christianity, conquer all of Russia as let's say The Golden Horde, become the biggest colonizator as Songhai etc. Anything is really possible.3. Achievements. Unlike most of other new games, this game has some quite tricky achievements. And they give you a sense of direction should you not make your own goal. Also that way, you are being encouraged to learn about new countries by playing them - you might find your favorite this way. Some are ridiculously hard and might require several restarts but that feeling when you manage not only to survive as Tabaristan but to from into formidable Persia and challenge Ottomans, priceless. I managed to pull few tough ones but my favorite is definitely A Kaiser not just in name.4. This argument is direclty linked to the previous one. You should get this game for HRE mechanics, if for nothing else. I have always disregarded these features until few months ago when I decided to try to unify Holy Roman Empire which I did. Now simply put, you feel like you are in Game of Thrones itself,  that vibe is incredible. There are so many ways you can lose but once you push through the reforms, you are pretty much unstoppable.5. Always learning something new. There is always a room for improvement and this game greatly depicts that.6. Soundtrack. It is awesome. However I have to say Sabaton is beyond awesome. When The Lion From The North song popps up, you know it's time to wage a war. Honestly, I found out about Sabaton from this game and even managed to go to concert this month, so I am very grateful.Cons:1. The game has too many DLCs. Now I am not bringing that argument, it is too expensive etc. With enough waiting  you can get it for a good price, just like anything on steam. What I mean is that the game has been greatly changed. In its current state it resembles little to its original vanilla form. 2. It keeps adding more complexity which in my opinion greatly limits your options of expanding, especially as OPM or any small nation. If you miss DLCs you are still affected by new game mechanics but have no way of influencing them back.3. It is too Eurocentric. Granted, its name is Europa and I am European myself but there simply aren't enough reasons to play or be remotely interested in Asia for example, whereas in Europe, many countries get unique events. I understand this will change with the upcoming expansion Mandate of Heaven, so I guess that problem will be adressed.So all in all, you can find this game fequently on sale, try it out and if you get past few dozen of hours, you are in for an endless entertainment.

												I used to play hours on this game, from 9pm to 4am straight, yes that was how fun it was back then. Paradox has apparently followed suit and adopted ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practices (*AHEM* EA *AHEM* CA *AHEM UBISOFT *AHEM*), you know what I'm talking about. The Common Sense DLC and update basically made this game barebones, now I had to mod the game (e.g. Complete Colonial Control, Extended Timeline, etc.) to actually have fun. When the Art of War DLC and update came out I was actually OK with it, because it didn't ♥♥♥♥ up the game at all. Updates are supposed to improve the game, NOT TO SLAP YOUR CUSTOMERS IN THE FACE WHILST STRIPPING THE GAME OF CONTENT AND BASICALLY ASKING 'HEY! YOU! BUY OUR NEW DLC!"".Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing Christ, Paradox is greedy now, don't get me wrong, this game is amazing. A benchmark for grand strategy, but until these shady business practices stop, I advise you NOT to buy this game at its current state.Paradox Interactive please listen to your customers, don't be greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... it's trully a sad that gaming as come to this...

Some of the DLC really adds to the game, but most of it not so much, only talking main DLC not cut out cosmetic BS (have and will never buy any of that).People were♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about Chaos (7,5 Euro) being cut out of TWW, and rightfully so, yet they accept Paradox charging twice the worth of almost every DLC for EU4. Some of which you can barely play the game without in the long run since the AI have the benefits of the DLC, ""Common sense"" (another 15 Euro) province dev feature anyone? It is insane we consumers allow this.Should boycott Paradox, but game is way too entertaining and addictive -.-			"

												Not for everyone. The learning curve looks a bit like Mount Everest, especially with the DLC.DLC you need to access all the depth of the game: Art of War, Common Sense.Wealth of Nations and The Cossacks add a few more nice but optional features, and it can wait until you're tested the waters and seen if you like the game. Everything else you can ignore until you're hooked, then it becomes like crack and you'll want everything.Give it a try if you're into strategy, it's worth it.			"

												EU4 is an advanced level grand strategy game loosely based on the board game. The game is played in real time but with the ability to pause at any time and the need to pause often it often has the feel of a turn based game. There is no first person view like in Total War games and this is not an entry level strategy game like CIV5. So if your looking for eye candy, cool action scenes or a game that you can easily get into and learn you will not find it here. That being said EU4 has an easier learning curve than most of their games and that's due to it's top notch informative and slick UI. Information is easy to find and the Wiki is kept updated by it's devoted fanbase.The difficulty levels can be changed in the settings but difficulty if mostly based on what starting country you choose. Also, the AI is well done and will give you headaches so expect a harsh learning curve. Patience and learning from your mistakes will be needed but once you get going you will fall in love for months if not years.This is not a world conquest type game. Sure it can be done but that's for the elitists and die hards and is not what the game is built for. EU4 is a sandbox historical simulator of sorts. Historical events and themes influence playthroughs enriching the gaming experience for history buffs. This is a game where you set your own goals and make your own path. Don't expect the game to tell you where or what to do because it won't. Paradox is a good Swedish company that is always putting out free updates and patches but on the flip side their major updates and expansions can be rough around the edges filled with bugs which can drive players mad. That being said they are very good at patching and improving their games. It just requires some patience from us beta testers err I mean gamers occasionally.If you're a board game enthusiast, history buff and/or just wanting to step up to a more challenging but rewarding grand strategy game than I highly recommend EU4. Check out the free demo to get a taste.			"

												If you were to ask me if I would recommend this game a year ago, I would wholeheartedly say yes. However, the game in its current state is abysmal.The devs continue to punish the player for what the AI lacks. Instead of improving the AI in order to make the game more interesting, Paradox continues to introduce handicaps into the game; handicaps that make it no longer fun and and introduces more and more micromanagement aspects into the game.EU4 has changed from an interesting and fun alternate history game into a chore.Complaints that I have:- The AI is never affected by money or monarch power problems- Because the AI is never affected by money or monarch power problems, their ability to stay in a war is stupid good. The AI ran out of manpower? No problem, just buy more and more mercenaries- The AI is too dumb to effectively wage war against players? No problem, just give them arbitrary bonuses against the player- Small AI nations are able to field way too many troops; an example of this is Burgundy's vassal swarm providing them with nearly 20,000 troops- Estates are pointless and useless micromanagement features that don't make the game more indepth or fun- The amount of aggressive expansion you can earn for taking a province in Western Europe is ridiculous and it's even worse if it's a province that's in the HRE- Truce timers take way too long. Basically, if you go to war with a nation, you're not going to be able to go to war with them again for another ten years at least- Rebels pop up CONSTANTLY if you take a province from another country it's not even a question of ""if"" anymore but a question of ""when"". In order to prevent rebels from popping up, you have to sink monarch points into preventing rebels, slowing you down.It's like playing Monopoly with only one dice while everyone else gets to use two. It's not impossible and it's not the worst thing in the world, but why would anyone find that fun?			"

												So, time to write a review. I own all gameplay DLCs so your experience might be a little different if you only own the core game. So, what exactly is Europa Universalis 4? It is a game where you are playing a nation on its path between 1444 and 1821. Your goal is to make the nation prosper through conquest, colonisation, technological advancement and diplomaty. Each game is different, depending which ""nation"" you play. If you start as the Duchy of Anhalt (central Germany) you won't be colonising and as a Mongol Horde your diplomats will only be used to declare wars and demand land at the end of them. You can play anyone, from a random indian Tribe in Oregon to a Japanese Warlord.The game has no story mode because you write your own. You want to restore the Roman Empire from the brink of destruction? Than that's your story. You want to crush everything under the boots of your Prussian infantry while struggeling against the Austrian crown for hegamony over Germany? Go for it. You want to defend cristianity by driving the Saracens from the Holy Land and reinstate the Kingdom of Heaven? You want to recreate Leif Eriksons jorneys and start a Norwegian colony in Canada? You want to rule a Japanese Empire spanning from California to Capetown? You see, the posibilities are nearly endless. And if you think you are not creative enough to come up with something to callange yourself there are always 185 official Achievments to get. Their difficulty varies from ""press a button"" to ""it's only here to find new exploits and impossible without much cheese"".Now be warned, it takes more time to learn this game than most other games and below 200 hours you are considered new. This game is not hard to play well but to do some crazy stuff like form Germany as Mayor of the Free City of Frankfurt you will need practise and patience. You will always find new stuff. A single playthrough takes at least 10 hours, 20-30 is more realistic. This game is somewhat historical and if you want to you can force things to happen similar to history. There are a couple ways the devs made sure that at least some historical accuracy is in place. But consider that your actions have a lot of influence on the way the events unfold. If you backstab Austria they won't be able to keep the Ottomans in check and you doomed Eastern Europe. So get ready to fight the Turks to drive them out of Poland or they will come for you next. Now about the DLCs. Yes, they are expensive. However, you can get everything for 60 bucks on sale and that's around the price of an AAA game which offers 30 hours of gameplay. Or simply play Multiplayer because only the Host needs to own the DLCs. So let's sum it up:Positive:- Offers hundreds, if not thousands of hours of entertainment. I have clocked 768 hours and not even played 10% of all possible nations.- Stable (I had maybe 2 non mod ralated crashes within 768 hours)- No big bugs- Increadible mod support. There are total conversion mods, from Game of Thrones to Witcher and of course a lot of gameplay enchancements.- The devs listen to the playerbase and communicate a lot. There are weekly dev diaries. - There's still a lot of content (free and paid) coming.Neutral:- Could use a little more visualisationNegative:- High initial price (with all DLCs)- Takes away all your time and it's suddenly 1am.

												Europa suffers from two main problems:1) The core mechanics of the game have been constantly changing since release and there seems to be no end in sight. This makes it very difficult for someone to pick up the game again after a prolonged break, at which point either your save is broken, or you are penalized for not having access to the latest DLC.2) There is something decidedly ""unfun"" about the game's challenge. Your victories feel hollow over beating braindead AI, and your defeats feel cheap due to rubbish coding behind the AI to compensate for its idiocy.I had my fun in the honeymoon period when the game was fresh and new. But the allure is gone now and the game does the opposite of what a good game should be doing: Europa puts me in a bad mood.			"

An indepth rewriting of history, which like the Civilization left you clinging to just turn the tide of battle before you finally went to bed in the early hours.However recent changes  have in the words of some ""but critical content behind a paywall"". Unless you buy the Common Sense DLC developing your empire (kind of critical) is not an option. I won't buy it because a lot of the other gameplay changes are simply irritating or downright annoying.			"

If past games are any indicator Paradox will continue to create expansions and free content patches for several years...  and they actually listen to their customers.  Much of what goes into these games is shaped by feedback from both beta testers and suggestions from regular customers and message board users.This game is incredibly fun, and purchasing it also helps support one of the strongest independent voices in gaming.

The game has lots of content and visual DLC yes, but you could just play 1000hours with the base game and buy each DLC one by one, each change the game a bit so you could be entertained for another few hundred hours each time:-) Even if you play a lot of time, in every playthrough you will figure out new things and say ""oh hell, in my next game i need do it this way"":D			"

												To put it simply, the DLC's ruined the game. The last good DLC released was easily El Dorado, and afterwards they completely revamped the game, which was not needed once so ever. I will admit, the seige system in Common Sense is great, since thats the only part you dont have to pay 20 bucks to get. For me, to be forced to buy a 20 dollar dlc, to ""develop"" provinces, when the AI can already do that by themselves? Thats not difficulty, thats called being greedy.If you want a Grand Strategy game, get Crusader Kings 2, now thats a gem, not plagued by the 8 headless DLC horsemen. Well, it is, but atleast then I can safely say that I dont feel like a slavic pig dog while playing it.			"

You're not just expanding the empire, you will shape whatever policies rules this empire yourself, and will round up hundreds of individual decisions that will have influence on your country.You'll also find yourself having strange outbursts of extremely prejudiced hatred against dice and cosmic phenomena.9/10, There are gaps and holes, but they aren't severe, just annoying. The game is, rounded up, quite fantastic and worth your money if you love strategy.			"

												Europa Universalis is a Grand Strategy Game. We have to stress and underline the Grand, this game is really Grand in terms of content. Addictive is another adjective to describe EU4.First of all: this game has not a learning curve, but rather a learning walls. Once you fell down climbing the first one, there are more walls to climb to entirely understand this game in its complexicity. So if you know that you will give up after a couple of tries, because you get easily frustrated DO NOT BUY this game. If you think you can deal with frustration, love complex strategy games and then buy this game.To describe it briefly: You control in this game a nation, which you either lead to its glory or doom. Or you just survive. This is your job. How do you do this? You conquer provinces, construct buildings, draft armies, build ships, send them into battle. You will fight wars against neighbours and rivals and crush them or get crushed. The game has multiple ways of playing, you can play peaceful nations or be a warmonger.If you are able to pass the 20 hours of beginner's frustration, read a couple of guides and the wiki, try to understand the game - you are in for hours of great fun and enjoyment. The game is actually not difficult. Just complex. Have fun!			"

												Europa Universalis 4 is an extremely entertaining real time strategy game, similar to all the others released by Paradox Interactive. In the game, one is able to create armies and navies, invade and conquer your neighbors, and colonize the world. It has no real end goal, however world domination is nice. With a felxible starting date of anywhere between 1453 and 1800, there are centuries of history to play through, as historical countries, even though keeping to their set history is up to you. Europa Universalis 4 provides a platform to do the impossible, to conquer Europe as China, to maintain colonies accross the world, to destroy the largest empires, to invade Russia in the winter.However, Europa Universalis 4 is a game riddled with challenge. It is not easy, and players hoping to start off as the tiniest nation they see are almost certainly going to have a difficult road ahead of them if they wish to succeed. There are also other nations like France, Austria, Portugal, and Castille if you are in the mood for an evening of steamrolling the weak nations and conquering the world in one fell swoop. Micromanagement is also a crucial aspect to gameplay, and it can pose to be difficult, but also rewarding, to fully manage an economy, organize military forces, mitigate crises, and handle diplomacy. However this amount of micromanagement provides a sense of immersion into the game, and allows a greater sense of pride in tasks like maintaining a surplus and such.Europa Universalis IV is a great game for strategy gamers, who have no doubt at least heard of other Paradox titles, but for those looking for a walk in the park as they see every nation fall to them may not be able to enjoy the game.

												(This is a fairly long review that i've recently rewritten. I'll try to give a fairly comprehensive look at why you should or shouldn't buy this game.)I've played this game for almost 1000 hours at the time I'm rewriting this review, so i think i can be a pretty good judge. I originally didn't reccomend this game (and still don't) to the broad gaming audience, and that's for a multitude of reasons. Cons:This game is nearly impossible to get into by yourself. It's really difficult to learn how to play this game, let alone play it well. If you're not already coming from a strategy game background, you most likely will never put the time into learning this game. The only way that i originally got into it, was from being harrassed by a close friend of mine to play it with him because he wanted someone else to play it with. I've since done the same thing to many of my friends, and that's the only way I know of people personally learning to play it.Secondly, a lot of the game's essential features and improvements are marketed as DLC. I don't have a problem with supporting Paradox in developing new features for a game I really love, but they don't see how hard it is to come into the game with what I'm fairly certain is 100's of dollars of DLC at this point. Granted a lot of these are harmless texture packs for certain countries units, or new music. However, some of the patches with new DLC made vanilla Europa basically unplayable, such as the common sense DLC (ironically). When i started playing this game, there was only one major DLC released, so it was a lot easier to pay the extra 15 bucks or so on the back of my friend's promise that is was worth it.My third major gripe with the game is that Paradox doesn't seem very willing to take the community's suggestions on game features and or balance. There are a lot of things in the game that the EU4 community doesn't like currently in the game. A quick example is the coalition mechanic. There's a general consensus that this mechanic needs to be either reworked or completely removed until they can think of a sensible way of implementing it. Another is a very disproportianate amount, and the quality of most rebellions. There's no reason that there should be 27 thousand seperatist rebels spawned from a small nation i just took over that had a standing army of 8 thousand. How did some rebel leader manage to persuede more people into joining their force than their actual nation had when they existed? Let alone the fact they can afford 6 artillery regiments. There's many examples of things like this and I've looked on every forum I could find and couldn't even find a response from any Paradox employee. Really frustrating and honestly kind of stupid considering they're essentially alienating a large portion of their small niche audience for no apparent reason?Pros:Getting past all of the cons, this game is helplessly addicting and entertaining. I'd never become bored of forming a large empire out of a small county. The expansion and total control of your country is really amazing and something I haven't seen from another game before. It's given me nearly one thousand hours of enjoyment and it really doesn't feel like that will stop anytime soon.Tldr: I can't reccommend this game to everyone. But if you can somehow manage to get past the steep learning curve, frustrating developer methods, and expensive pricetag, this game could provide you with a lot of fun.			"

												Relive your ancestors lives, from subjugating natives to murdering the Pope in his own home, from meeting people who tan differently than  you and alienating them  for it, to starting a civil rebellion in  any country (yes,  even your own)... Ohh and dont forget, this game pulls no punches. It subtly bashes religion, color, and nationallity.  Yes, don't expect to live long if you're a  docile, passive native. Europeans eat  that like subsidized kfc in N'Orleans. It's called Europa  for a reason!			"

												I'm tired of all these DLCs and their inflated prices. The content added often brings new depth to the game, but frequently has features that we shouldn't have to pay for. I'm looking at you Nation designer! Also you dirty unit and music packs should be ashamed of yourselves for existing! If you look at other game companies, they often give comparable content for free as an update. At the very base of it, I'm sick of all this piece meal DLC. I can understand expansions increasing the longevity of the game, but seriously The Cossack’s cost is 50% of the price of the base game. And don't you lie to me and say that any of these expansions add enough content to justify their price. Most of these are just slight mechanic tweaks, not anything ""expansive"". It’s sad when mods offer more content then official expansions and also happen to be free. I love the concept of a game developing after its release, but don’t make me pay for every slight tweak. Also don't talk to me about steam sales, the most recent releases only get 35% off. For “The Cossacks”, that's roughly 7 dollars off still leaving me roughly $13 dollar left to pay, whoopee do. By the time, we get a substantial ""deal"" on any DLC, it's often way down the line and Paradox has already churned out another one. All of this means two plainly disappointing facts. You'll pay considerably to have a complete and current content version of any Paradox game and that when a new game releases it's evident you're only getting a tiny proportion of the eventual game. However, I know that nothing will change as long as people keep apathetically buying the product. And so this 'just another ranting guy on the internet' is going to reach into his wallet, pull out his credit card and buy the next ""grand"" expansion for EU4 because oh well, right?UPDATE 4/10/16:With the release of Mare Nostrum, It's evident that Pardox Interactive is trying to milk their games in increasing fashion. This is pitiful and doesn't show well for the future of Hearts of Irons 4, Stellaris and their other franchises. These are good quality games being subjected to obnoxious pay walls. Paradox makes base games that are just good enough to entice people to buy multitudes of DLC fillers which in the end ruins consumer enjoyment. Paradox knows what it's doing and all of their comunity streams and involvements are distractions to make us buy into a friendly exterior and therein be consoled into buying their products. The only action I'd want them to take is in their DLC practices. If you're going to sell us the game piece by piece then at least make it more worthwhile. Combine the cosmetic and music packs into their corresponding  main DLC expanision then lower the prices to $9.99 and lower. You may think you'll lose far too much profit this way or that your efforts are underrepresented at such prices, but you'll have both a greater purchasing base and a longer lasting franchise to milk if you do this. If the reason prices are so high is because not enough people are buying the product then this solution would solve that problem in the long term. If you have merely caluclated that you can sell at these unreasonable prices and still make a hefty profit then whoever made that decision should be fired. Our else, your company will be crushed under the boot of companies like Sega, who specifically has turned CA and Relic Entertainment into DLC producing Cash Cows that take all the heat.Your CEO has stated you're undergoing the IPO process, therefore you'll be an option for buyout within a year or two. The gaming industry is full of puppeted developers straddled by larger publishing corporations that use them as proxy moneymakers without taking any real accountablity. You're on a path that will be your undoing; please become something better, Paradox, not something so pitiful and so often seen with developers.P.S. 5/28/16:Europa Universalis 4 has become a convoluted piece of crap that is hardly playable. It stifles the player every step of the way and fumbles on offering a challeging and engaging experience. Paradox is becoming a disappointment, if they aren't already.			"

												This game transform me into a child over and over again, repeatedly pushing my history and geography sweet spots. I played Svea Rike 1 through 3 when I was a kid. The game that led Paradox Interactive to being the dominant Grand-Strategy masterminds they are today. I grew up and changed course - I found it much more hilarious to run people over in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas or explore Black Mesa in Half-Life again. Deep down though, I am Strategy. Put me in any war in any time and I would DIE horribly day 1, but put me in front of Europa Universalis IV, remove France and I will crush my foes with never seen ruthlessness. The ground trembles as every great nation falls beneath my feet and.. gotta pee brb.Europa Universalis IV deliver near unlimited sandbox strategy gameplay during the time period 1444-1819. Covering the times where the nations of Earth changed the most, whether that be through violent colonization or peaceful spread of a religion. Pick any nation out of hundreds and start your great adventure. In the beginning your ""great adventure"" will end within a few years with your entire great empire crumbled under whatever pathetic nation is next to you. The learning curve seem Immensely steep when you start up the game for the first time. Getting into Grand Strategy might be the Hardest thing I have ever done. It's easy to just don't play it. That's what I did, for 2 years. Scrolling past it in the Library list, mentally putting a check-mark over it, telling yourself ""I will play this soon™, no rush"", as I have with So many great games.Once that learning curve is mastered though - A miracle, an eye-opener and a mind-blower appears, tearing apart your very Existence as a human being. ""I want to play the Iroquois and colonize Americas centuries before the Europeans come"". ""I want to play Navarra and conquer entire Europe"". ""I want to play Brunei and unify Indonesia, colonize Australia and dominate the seas"". I had some insane ideas, sadly the first attempts didn't succeed, but I just restarted and tried over and over again until it succeed. Looking up guides and let's plays helped a lot. I always try to stay ""pure"" when I play a new game, not looking up information in case it will ruin the experience. A stupid rule.I will say though, that this game is not for Everyone, you have to; like history and alternative history, have a lot of spare time, be obsessed with painting as much of the map in your color. Being a real-time/turn-based strategy fan might not be enough to enjoy grand strategy. Although Europa Universalis IV is in real-time, you don't build any barracks and train individual units, workers or collect any resources as fast as possible to outplay your opponent. Europa Universalis is relatively historically correct which means it's unfair. Whatever France, Ottomans or Ming wants and it will happen. Luckily the game gives you the tools to change that. It comes down to choosing a path out of Military, Diplomacy or Trade and arguably; Religion. Combine whichever is necessary to end the infidels.Europa Universalis IV will offer many late nights and work daydreams for the ones who meet the criteria and are ready to climb the stairs. Many hours will be spent on what, at the time might feel like a waste but you will emerge as a glorious EmperorNote: There are a bunch of DLC's that add, not only new nations but also very improved gameplay mechanics that changes the game in a big way. The latest DLC's have received some negative critique regarding the lack of content compared to what is expected. Personally I think this game has given me enough for what I paid. "

												I did not buy this game as it was just released, but far later. For a reasonable price i could get EU4 with the following DLCs: Women in History, Wealth of Nations, Res Puplica, Conquest of paradise, Art of war. These DLCs makes a game with a lot of strategic options, and a fun gameplay when you play the game in version 1.11.4. Thanks to steams ""Beta"" tab in the properties of the game it is possible to play this version and disregard everything Paradox has made since. In ironman mode in the game it is still possible to get the achivements that existed at the time 1.11.4 was released.By reverting the game to the old version i have played many hours and never needed to rush to finish the games i was playing. It has been fun, and slightly educational. If you play this game, you will learn something about history in the period 1444-1821, and you will learn a lot of geography while having fun.And this game is fun for anyone who can appreciate the management of a nation. The strategic choises you make regarding allies, expansion, religion, technology and the tactical deployment of your armies have such huge impact on your game, that you get to understand the importance of almost every desicion you make.For me, i quikly startet playing in Ironman mode. This means that the game saves often, and you cannot revert any decisions you make. You have to live with the consequences of your actions. This has given a lot of retrys, but when you start a game, hunting an achivement, and you succeed, the feeling is simply great. Especially if it was a hard one.I have found this game very fun and very rewarding, and i like the ironmode idear: Bear the consequences of your actions. And this applies to the consequences you couldn't have predicted as well :) It is a usefull lesson thats apllicable to real life as well.			"

												I've never been a fan of Paradox's DLC Policy, doubt I ever will. I truely enjoyed the game during it's initial release, in-fact I enjoyed it so much I continued to pick up some of the early DLCs, but the new trend of lacklustre and overpriced DLCs has seriously been a turn off for me. Conclusion: It is a great game. The biggest problem is that to truly enjoy the game to its fullest you need to spend an absurd amount of money on extremely overpriced DLC.  "

												I used to love this game. It was and arguably still is one of the best games in the Grand Strategy genre. But the DLCs killed the whole thing. First, the price of each new expansion is getting above any reasonable amount for a bunch of not that much meaningful/flavorful features. Don't get me wrong, some of the expansions are great, but lots of them feel like something that should be in the base game in the first place, or not at all.  But that would be fine, nobody forces you to buy DLCs, right?Wrong.The DLC policy of Paradox is absolutely horrendous - once it's launched, you get the DLC installed automatically with a patch of base game and the AI countries are using the benefits of DLCs for themselves (the most striking example is the province development in Common Sense), and unless you pay, you are forced to compete with enemy that has a massively unfair advantage. It is a blatant cash grab and because of that, I won't be buing any more of Paradox's DLCs or new games (even though I was hyped for HoI 4 like anyone else), unless they clean their act or at least release a complete edition... although then there's the risk that it will be like the EU III Complete edition all over again.

												Awhile back me and a few freinds started a game of eu4 multiplayer which we played every sunday. We began the game at 1444 and each player picked a nation. I chose tunis a small north african nation with a plan to unite africa and take southern europe by storm. Nikoli and tim decided to pair up as crimea and the golden horde with ambitions to take over muscovy before they formed russia. Patrick picked denmark, and daniel went for orissa a city state on the eastern coast of india. 3 months later the year is 1586 and the world is a very different place. As tunis i have taken control of all of northern and central africa. I also have several colonies in brazil and have succeded in subjugating the tip of italy. However my economy is in bad shape due to spain portugual and great britains repeated invasion attempts. To my east is the ottomans a massive all powerfull sunni nation who have succeded in taking a large chunk of eastern europe. Relations are tense and the only thing preventing war is my alliance with the timurids a technolgically backward horde that controls vast swathes of asia minor and india. Nikoli and tim made the mistake early on of attacking russia in the winter :D. The war lasted 15 years and nearly bankrupted both crimea and the golden horde. However they scraped a win and over the next hundred years fought off the ottomans and the united commonwealth of poland and lithuania on multiple occasions. Despite succesfully reforming his goverment and westernising nikoli's crimea was eventually overrun and he switched to play as the shogunate of japan. Tim's golden horde succesfully managed to take over the remnants of muscovy and he remains a major power in the region. Patrick managed to unite scandinavia into an empire, but grew bored and switched to playing as the papal state in italy. He is not very happy that my tunis now controls half of the peninsula and persistently declares holy wars against me :/. Daniel isolated from the rest of us has become one of the dominant powers in india and is currently colonising the spice islands. We have become very invested in this game and my dream of taking over southern europe still burns strong. Buy this game, convince all your freinds to buy this game and embark on an epic simulation of over 400 years of the worlds history.			"

A strategy gem! - 10/10Introduction:Europa Universalis IV has deserved the right to be called a 'grand strategy game'. It doesn't need fancy graphics and extreme 3D battles, it's all up to your imagination. All you need to be a true conqueror of the world is your brain. It all comes down to tactics and knowledge. Once you got into it EUIV will drag you into parallel existence for a very long time where you can write your own history...maybe you will dominate the world...or maybe you will get crushed because you became to greedy.Pro:You can easily waste hundreds of hours playing this game without getting bored (duration of one game if you play it from the earliest date until the end: 15-30 hours)High replayability: Every nation is different and has it's pros and cons. No game will be the same.Strategy with depth: You have to take care of loads of stuff in your realm, plan ahead, adjust everything to suddenly changed situations and watch your friends, enemies, rivals and coalitions closely to prevent the development of bad situations and to turn it into an advantage over your enemies.World design looks greatChange the true history and write your ownChallenging AI (mostly)...so you don't need other players to have funMultiplayer via Steamworks: I haven't played it with strangers yet but it's so much fun to play with some friends. Make plans together to dominate the world or plot against each other or just backstab your mate in the darkest hour to make profit. Everything is possible. Your friends don't need all the DLC. Every player has access to the DLC of the host. Nice feature!Ironman mode: No mods, vanilla game settings, no manual save option, only 1 autosave slot -> this mode is the mode if you're looking for the real fun. You have to think twice before you decide important decisions because you always have to live with the outcome. This prevents you from doing stuff too careless and forces you to use your brain more. Every success will be so much sweeter.Loads of challenging achievements (only achievable in Ironman mode)Steam Workshop support: There are some pretty good mods available. Neutral:Steep learning curve: You will forget where your head is in your first 5-10 hours if you haven't played a title from 'Paradox' before because there is so much to take care of, but once you have learned the core mechanics you will have a blast! You will even learn new stuff after 100 hours of gameplay. This keeps the game interesting. It is absolutely worth the effort but if you are a impatient person...this game won't be your cup of tea.DLC politic: It's a bit controversial in the community. The main DLC from Paradox are always worth the money but there are several cosmetical packs with new unit skins or music for a few bucks. Some people are arguing that the cosmetical stuff is cut out of the main DLC to milk more money, but Paradox is saying that they're cut out to lower the price of the main DLC because not everyone needs or wants them. Those who want them, can purchase them separately while other people don't have to pay for a feature they don't need. I like it the way it is. I buy the cosmetical stuff when I like it and while it's on sale. Some extra support for the devs. You won't miss something big if you don't have them.Contra:German translation: It's a mess. All games from Paradox have a messed up german translation. Missing lines, completely wrong words...simply awful. It isn't a big deal for me because I can understand english and play it with english language but there are people out there which have a problem with it. I guess the translation for other languages aren't much better. Paradox should definitely hire some proper translators or doublecheck the translation with beta tester.Conclusion:It's a 'must-have' for every strategy lover. Absolutely worth the full price. If you can get it while it's on sale: what are you waiting for? It's a steal. Buy it. The world, your vassals and your army are waiting for you.10/10 (it's 2016...and it's still  a gem.)----------------------~ Do you want to add something to the review or do you want to share your opinion? Feel free to make a comment. "

												This is one of those games that you just can't stop playing once you get into it. Fair warning, there is a decent learning curve for beginners (one of my friends never put the time in to learn how to play because it was a bit overwhelming at first glance). Once you get the hang of the basic gameplay you will most likely learn to love the game. I especially recommend this game to those who love history as this game is all about historical events and it gives you the ability to rewrite history according to your will. One of the best parts about the game is how every single playthrough is different. The A.I., for all the hate it gets, does seem to do a good job in my opinion of being unpredictable. It's pretty much impossible for two playthroughs to be exactly the same based on the scope of the game (how many countries there are) and the adaptiveness of the A.I. Something that I think goes overlooked when discussing this game is the sheer amount of options the player gets when playing. For example, when starting a game, you get to choose any counrty that you want! It seems like a small thing, but how many games really give you that sort of option. Usually I feel like games restrict the creativity of the player, but EU4 really allows the player to do basically whatever they want. To top it all off, the modding community is great and even though it's been out for years now, they are still updating the game and you can easily find a multiplayer game to join if you want. Overall, one of my top 5 games of all time! I can't recommend EU4 enough.			"

												This game used to be fantastic. How the system worked is that although there was an abundance of DLC, every time a new DLC was released you would also get a free patch to go along with it that usually added something substantial to the game. Now? With the recent release of the DLC ""Common Sense"", the ability to develop provinces  was released. However, if you didn't buy the DLC, you will be unable to do it while literally every other nation in the game will be able to develop their provinces and eventually become stronger than you. Its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t pay to win feature. Would not recommend unless you like shelling over cash over and over just to play correctly.			"

There is no argument about that.But this DLC policy has to stop, so that's why I will join the protesters and will not recommend this game to new players. It's just too expensive, even with 75% discounts. No game is worth that much of money. Paradox should look up to CD Projekt and learn what is good DLC policy.Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that DLCs are not good. Bad thing about this is when they release some DLC, they put firewalls on main game, you can't do a lot of stuff without DLCs, which should be possible in base game.

												The game was awesome. (Apart form the dlc etc issues mentioned in almost every comment...)But with every patch they made it more ""realistic"", ie harder to conquer Europe when starting with a one province minor nation. By now loads of things just depend on luck (even when only playing republics to avoid all the no-heir and regency random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t). Example: start as Venice, do well. Hungary gets the random event which gives them a 100 army tradition general. They decide to attack me. I have 150% percent the men and higher military tech, bait them to attack me in the mountains across a river in Salzburg. The other general has 6 shock, mine has 0. I get completely destroyed. Definitely realistic, there have been Generals like that.Buy the game and watch the AI succeed with completely random non-sense strategies. Have fun.			"

												This is a game I really enjoyed. The various timelines(in the bookmarks) are respresented mostly accurately, and it is a good strategy game. You can be Ireland spreading the green-ness to the entire world, or be Byzantium and take back all the former Roman territories. And the mechanics are vastly improved over how they were in EU3. Not dumbed down, but instead made easier for people to use and for new people to figure out. I give this game a 10/10.			"

												I really enjoyed this game until about a year ago but after the recent events I honestly cannot recommend it anymore.What went wrong?Imho, two big things.Firstly, the DLC money schemeAnd secondly, the constant ""updating"" and changing of the game's mechanics.I bought EU4 with the first 4(?) expansions when it was on sale and have really played the hell out of it ( I think it shows). But when new DLCs come out every couple of months and each DLC is about 15 to 20 € then you seriously start to wonder wether you really need those.But that's not really your decision at all.The problem here is that the last couple of DLCs completely changed how the game is played. From little aesthetic changes to changes to core mechanics, the game as it is now is very much different to how it started out. You can argue about the necessity or usefulness of all the new mechanics, but the implementation is terrible.And the changes affect the AI regardless wether you bought the DLCs. So even though you didn't buy that DLC and can't use X yourself, the AI can and will use X (and likely have another advatage because of it).All those changes and all those ""updates"" also mean you have to start a new campaign because save games will most likely not be compatible.(Yes, you can roll back your version number but then you couldn't use your mods anymore - they update as well)It's sad to see this great game become just a way to milk the players.Paradox should stop mucking about with EU4 and simply start with EU5.And instead of all those AI boni, maybe try and just make the AI smarter.I wouldn't buy it anymore, and the way Paradox handles EU4 you shouldn't either.

												Hello Steam Community.Well... what can I say about this game that has not been said a hundred times already? Other than its worth its purchase on how you see it. Firstly to start this review, this game will take your way of strategy in managing a country in a good diplomatic and expanding style. It is not the Crusader Kings 2, but that is not necessary a bad thing, quite the opposite in some ways. If you want to play a game that focuses on managing a country through pretty much basic but a variety of ways which focus around diplomacy, colonies and expanding. This is the game to get.Pro Aspects about the game:The Game by itself with its historical starts and able to play pretty much almost over hundreds of different nations from start to finish with many having their own ideas and historical events coming up is just fantastic. This game does show that if you make certain decisions that would have happened in real history it affects your game in the long run. Also its fun to learn about a little history about nations in a game without having to read a book about them at the same time.Another apart from being very addictive is to make you focus rather on brute force but rather using deception strategies when managing your country. Ironically when playing later on with smaller nations I had more enjoyment in making them survive in the shadow of bigger powers and then during the end making them into large empires of their own with the former enemies now in fear. You get a sense of feeling like a proper leader focusing on expansion.Cons about the game:This might be just a little pick of some stuff but firstly the tutorial to get into the game does not really support fresh gamers to a new strategy style of game. But this is not fully a bad thing since Paradox games usually are kinda daunting to get into so, if you want to play this game (Which I still recommend strongly you try it out) Look online for guides for this is a very meaty and large in content in game. So be prepared to have moments of mass confusion though over time this comes in practise.Over a large amount of time if not managed properly your save data will pile up and start eating up your storage so if you have limited storage be sure to remove saves you don't want to keep. At one point I managed to aquire over 45 Gb of storage from just saves alone. Then again if this is taking the date of hundreds of nations and yours as well then I'm not surprised.Also this game is not a game to focus around and command armies or navies around the world in the battles so don't expect the game to focus around that which is not really a bad thing but should not be mistaken for being so.Conclusion:Although this game is daunting to take in at first and can be difficult in managing countries even on Iron Man Mode which makes you have 1 save on the go, this is for me as a strategy lover my most played, appreciated, loved and enjoyed game I've ever played. If you are a strategy player, this deserves a place in your game library or at the very least for you to try out the demo now and take a nation in a historical way, or change the world map forever.

												Where do I begin? Maps and Menus IV is the best game for the map and menu enthusiast. It's got 27 unique maps and even more unique menus. In fact, almost every month you'll get a brand new menu. There are even some menus that turn into MORE MENUS! This is no joke people, they really delivered on the Maps and Menus. But, despite the name, the unsung hero of Maps and Menus IV are Numbers. There's two main kinds of numbers, green numbers and red numbers. Protip: You want more green numbers than red numbers. Sometimes, but rarely, you'll run into yellow numbers. But it's not enough to touch on. This game is perfect for:-Cartographers-Menu Enthusiast-Numbers people-Armchair Generals-Doing light to heavy chores-Watching TV-Wasting time you could be using to devlope yourself into the person your granddad always wanted-My granddad-Doing your math homework-Finding a prom date-Finding a prom date your granddad approves of-Why doesn't my granddad appreciate the things I do?-I try so hard-Nothing I do pleases him10/10 Would play for the rest of my life			"

Never pay the full price for these dlc because they barely add anything.			"

												tl;dr: Every two months a free patch is going to come out that will break your game if you don't buy another 17-21$ DLCI'd LOVE to give this game a positive score.But once common sense came out the development team added new ""features"" that pretty much made the game unplayable unless you shell out more money for the dlc to unlock essential features. All the dlc that adds features (Did I say add? I mean unlock, all the dlc buttons are in the base game, just greyed out) add up to a staggering 95$ (Canadian).Don't get me wrong, some of these dlc are actually good, Conquest of Paradise, Art of war, and El dorado for example, as they only locked out non-essential features(mostly) But almost everything since Common Sense is litteral cancer.

												I have played every EU game since the first, and I still can't love them.  It feels like you are playing against the game mechanics instead of the AI.  The rules are excessively fussy, and new rules are made up for different countries, religions, cultures, etc.  It comes across as band-aids on top of band-aids, rather than a rich system of detail.And rebellions are just ridiculous: massive armies just spring into existence while it would take you ages to create the same thing.  I get that they want to model that enormous alien empires face disruption, but the mechanics are still heavy handed and violate the intricate rules that the designers themselves made up.			"

												After playing Hearts of Iron, Victoria, and Crusader Kings, EU4 probably has the least and most to offer. In terms of things to do, this game definitely has the other 3 trumped. EU4 doesn't have the specialization and complexity of the other 3 games though, that's for sure. The pros of this game are that it's easy to get into, there's a ton of stuff to do, and you are given a lot more leeway to play how you want. Overall, this game has the most ""sandboxy"" feeling out of all Paradox's grand strategy games. If you are coming from like Civilization or something then this game is a great addition to your collection. If you have played Paradox's previous games, EU4 is by no means a pushover as some would suggest. I highly recommend it, as you are given a lot more freedom to do what you want than other GS games.

												AMAzing game Really suggest buying it if you are into Grand Strategy games. You have the ability to play AS ANY nation IN THE WORLD from Nov. 11 1444 all the way to Jan. 2 1821. That is a very long time. From this you can play history as your way the way you want and the way you see it. There are some problems with the game such as nations blobbing out of control but if you like the whole idea of nation conquest and nation building Then I HIGhly suggest this game although the learning curve is very steep once you get into it you will not stop playing it.

Like your friends probably don't know what Mogadishu is the capital of, or what countries border Laos, or whether or not Bolivia is landlocked. Also you can play out all sorts of interesting nationalistic roleplaying, because sometimes you just want to identify as the Spanish Inquisition.			"

												I have never reviewed a game prior to this, but can't help have a bit of a moan about Paradox.Whilst I love this game and most of the genre, HOI, Crusader Kings and the EU series.The engine is much the same as previous versions of the game. I am not asking Paradox to to reinvent the wheel every time they release a new version, and whilst a real effort is made to improve the game at each iteration, not only do you have to pay full price for each game, despite owning previous ones, you are expected to buy the DLC just to make the game work the way it should have in the first place.I checked today, during a sale where there is a 66% reduction in the cost of DLC, it would still cost me an additional £63.00 to get it all and I already have 23 DLC's, bringing what I have spent on the game to well over £140, that's insane. Without the sale it would have cost £189.00 what the **** Paradox. People complain about the likes of WOT or Stronghold Kingdoms being pay to play games, but at the very least they are honest.Whilst I really enjoy this kind of strategy and Paradox are streets ahead in this type of game, I just can't recommend it because of the all the DLC that's required to make it complete.

												EU4 was a very nice game that has suffered from continuous DLC development that changes the base game. The breaking point for me was when developing your provinces, an integral part of base gameplay, was reworked and put behind a paywall wih the DLC ""Common Sense.""  With the AI retaining the ability to develop its provinces normally, only the player's country remains a medieval backwater, unless you pay for the privilege. After hundreds of hours already in the game, it left a sour feeling to be asked to pay money to retain features that had already been present. The level of chrome and updates the game has received since release are alright if you own the DLC, but largely to the detriment of players who own only the base game.			"

												I love this game.  It is BY FAR my favorite game in my entire library.  However, in its current state, is unplayable.  Paradox Ineractive, as usual, have broken the game with the most DLC.  At the moment, several features are DLC-exclusive and make the game virtually unplayable.  If you decided to get the game, simply beta back to an older date.  The older date, however, is not the current game.  Take me back in time 3 weeks, and I would recommend the life out of this game.  Now?  Not a chance.  Sure, the game is great and all in past versions, but the past versions of the game IS NOT the current game.  You might as well call beta Kerbal Space Program the actual game while you're at it.			"

												I would like to thank paradox entertainment for butchering their perfect game. where at initial release the player had all the freedom they liked from previous releases (1 and 2 were easely modified by texteditor) and the great graphical improvements from 3 adding the workshop for modders at 4, now thanks to DLC and updates completley stale.if you like playing history games by following literal history, then this game is for you. if you think of purchasing an empire building game with depth and freedom in how you like to play it, save your money and leave this game where it is.adding MANDETORY colonial nations was their first mistake (had it been optional, no complaints community wide).Continuesly updating petty changes was their second and probalbly biggest mistake, as with each update the modders had to either update their mod for every small change in the defines file, or completley start from scratch again, killing the joy of modding the game all together. Like me the fun was over after the 100th time i had to open the defines.ini file to rechange a few lines because with each graphical update, or other changes outside the defines file it would be back to its original vanilla self after each (frequent) update. crashing the game upon reload of a save each and every time.So i stoped playing for a while, then when a few months later i think of giving the game another try, i find it in an even worse state then before. To find half the games mechanics have disapeared and the core itself extremeley unstable. i'm running the latest ATI video card, 16 GIGs of ram and have a quadcore 3.2GHZ that runs like an Octacore, but the game runs like i'm back playing on an old PC from the '90s. Browsing the DLC's i find each and every part i miss in the core as a DLC.its just  a darn shame in my opinion, as it was a perfect game to play and enjoy when it was released, bugs and all.			"

												There is a reason EU4 is one of the highest rated games on Steam.If someone were to ask me ""what are some all time best games someone should own?""I would say:- EU4- Mount and Blade Warband- XCOM (new versions or old you choose)EU4 is *NOT* a 4X, because to be honest most 4X are not really 4X, they are like 2.5-3X at most.  IN EU4 you have to manage every aspect of your empire, administrative development, economy and trade, military progress, religion, and diplomatic relations.  As opposed to many other games you have to actually use diplomacy because the AI is too strong and you cannot just make enemies with everyone and eat them.   First off, if you did that you'd get a massive coalition and secondly, your country would implode from being at war too much and ceding too much land too quickly.EU4 is a constant struggle against the AI especially if you challenge yourself and choose a nation that isn't historically powerful.  That is the best way to play EU4 in my opinion - choose a goal and try to achieve it.  Want to make The Hansa a thriving and powerful European nation in 1821?  Want to expand the Papal State to own half of Europe by 1821 and shout ""God WILLS IT!"" a lot?  Want to play a Native American tribe or the Aztecs and stop Europeans from gaining dominance in the new world?  You can do all these things and play them out in what I would consider by far the most accurate and representative game out there.  EU4's interface is daunting at first, no doubt, but later you realize that it is that level of detail that makes things play out more similarly to real life.  Your people will get upset if you're at war too long, your allies might not go with you into every war, some people wont ally you because they just dont like you or your religion or whatever, some wars you lose even though you have 2x their troops but they have better troops and more tactics, if you spend all your administrative power ceding provinces from enemies you'll fall behind in administrative tech and you'll also gain corruption in you nation.  All these interactive elements form a platform for empire building that is hands down the closest to reality out there.EU4 is not a 4X, it is in the truest form of the word a simulation of real world empire building.10/10 in my book.

												This is an excellent game. It has the potential to expand your knowledge of, or even develop an interest in, the subject of history - It is a series unparalleled in the genre of Grand Strategy and In the earlier versions of the game, I would have recommended it to anyoneHowever, I can only in good conscience recommend this game to people who have enough money to buy all of the DLC, or at the very least, has a good friend who they can play multiplayer with who buys all the DLC. The game is not able to stand on its own merits without this. The way the DLC model in this game works is that they expand content, change systems and do other rehauls of systems; and charge money for it. That makes sense, they rehaul a system so they ought to get paid right? Well, sure, unless they take content away from the player that they originally to repackage it and sell it off to consumers, as was the case in most of the ""new features"" in common sense. It's a disgrace.I've had bugs occur in previous patches which were caused by not owning the DLCs; and even if you do not own the DLC, the AI (i.e. every single other nation in the game) does, which means the AI develops an unfair advantage over you in many cases.Also, in the case of one of their DLCs, an ebook, they were literally selling Thomas Paine's Common Sense (which, by the way, is in the public domain and hence free for anyone to download online.) - It's hard not to characterise Paradox as money hungry with actions such as these.And unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, this series is unparralleled. I want so much to love this game, and I often do, but it leaves a really poor taste in my mouth when they do such things as these, and they have no incentive to stop doing the things they are doing because suckers like myself still buy the damned DLC, and they have no competition in this field.

												If you're reading this, I'm assuming that you're a white European male. Every now and then, you think back to the good ol' days, back when we could subjugate native populations and assert our dominance over other races, and no one would bat an eye. Because the only people who we allowed to have an opinion were our own kind, and they were doing the same as us. The good days.Nowadays, the new trends include libtard bullpoo like ""tolerance"", ""native reservations"", and ""remorse"". No empires left. Your guaranteed dominance over most of the world's population is dependent on your merits as a human being, not your bloodline. This game lets you live the aforementioned good times. If you want to create a mediterranean merchant empire, forcing smaller nations into poverty, be my ♥♥♥♥ing guest friend. Do you want to crush the native traditions of the New World with guns and swords, supplanting a proud culture with your own? Go for it, famalammer. Even if you're a damn commie liberal, play as the Cherokee, and conquer Europe, or the entire world, becoming worse than the monsters that you sought to destroy.Are you female? Wrong, no women on the internet. But if you identify as one, take advantage of the free (The one free DLC, Paradox holding true to what can be accomplished in their game. Good on you lads!) DLC, Women in History. Fight the patriarchy with OP events detailing the escapades of women in history, as the name would suggest.TL;DR, wholesome and tolerant fun for the whole family.			"

Do you have what it takes to change history? Most games difficulty can be judged by the percentage of players who have completed the achievements. In Europa Universalis 4 around 14% have completed the basic ones. So this game is very hard and there's a reason to why, but more on this later. It doesn't take very long to get in to because the tutorials are great! Europa Universalis 4 is very complex in a Paradox Interactive way. But I find it very challenging and rewarding at the same time. What I like the most is the diplomacy and the forging of alliances. Everything falls into place when war breaks out, then you will either regret or cherish the alliances you've made. So you have to be on your toes and pay attention to the world around you, not only in order to accomplish your goals, but to strike when other nations fall apart. Suing for peace is another thing I like, where the options are based on how well the war is going, or went if you completely destroyed your enemy. The AI use these options too, with various outcome. The trade system in Europa Universalis 4 is complex but well worth taking a closer look at and understand well because it generates the money for your nation. There are details and other brilliant things worth mentioning too, but I'll leave them for you to find. Europa Universalis 4 doesn't tell you what to do so you have to challenge yourself with your own goals. There are missions and decisions where the game asks you to do things. Like ""Build fort in province x"", ""Increase reputation with nation x"" as examples of missions. These missions rewards you with different things which helps your nation. The decisions can be ""Form empire from x"", which gives your nation a boost in certain areas during a set date. But you don't have to do these. If you don't like missions you can chose them and then cancel them, the decisions you don't care about you just ignore. So there's nothing stopping you making your own history. The history and current progress of the world is written in a ledger, which is quite interesting. The ledger is a very useful tool and probably worth a review on its own. There are events, historical and generic. The historical events are the only thing which force you to do things ""as they were"". Unfortunately I hate the generic ones.I've read that they're meant to give the player something to do and balance things, but for me they are just frustrating and just there to work against you. For example, there's one where your heir falls ill. you can either spend money to send for a physician or not spending money(or ducats as they're called). The ""spend money"" option gives the heir 50% chance of dying. The other where you don't spend money a 75% chance. I always chose the 50% option, spend money and EVERY time the heir dies! Other generic things happen depending on different things, even though they shouldn't happen they do happen and always in the most inappropriate time and some are bound to happen sooner or later. So these generic events gives me a ""love, hate relation"" to this game. The Iron man-mode which you have to be in to get the achievements I guess I can cope with in the long run. In Iron man-mode you only have one save game and the game saves every month and overwrites that save game every time. Which results in two things. 1: The game progress very slowly as you wait for the save file to be written 70% of the time you play. 2: Things which happen, either your own wrong doing or the generic events are irreversible. So if you do a mistake or are screwed by an event, you have to start all over, from 1444. Having someone nearby who can comfort you and give you advice does help to overcome these things. If you are unsure, wait for it to come on sale, because this game is great and a ""must buy"" for everyone who love strategy games.			"

Filled with politics, plots and backstabbing, you can roleplay your nation in an epic simulation of the renaissance era. Play with Friends or play alone, you'll spend plenty of hours attempting to master the game. If grand strategy is your genre of choice then I highly recommend you try Europa Universalis IV.			"

Yet as time went on it got worse and worse, and more and more difficult. Even on normal the AI recive unfair advantages such as mysteriously and rapidly counting up liberty desire for no apperent reason and having infinate manpower (not 100% sure on this but me and my frined played multiple games where for a solid 5 years nations kept sending 20 non-merc stacks for entire wars) which honestly makes the game almost unplayable. In it's current state and beyond (unless Paradox decides to stop being DLC ♥♥♥♥♥s and/or fix their game) I cannot reccomend this game which I used to find so enjoyable.			"

												I would have recomend this game at some point in the past , especailly given that i've spent over a thousand hours in it , but its more obvious than ever that paradox dosen't care about making games anymore and would rather just cut them all into a million  pieces and sell you each piece individually at a premium. They're doing what EA did to the Sims 3 , sell you the framework for the game at 50 or 60 dollars , and then have all of this overmarked DLC which should have been in the base game.EU III just havd 4 expansions that came out once a year, but At the time of writing there are 6 ""major"" DLCs that have come out in the nearly 2 years since its relase . Now we're at the point where paradox did a complete overhall of the province system that was in the base game , but locked parts of the new updated system behind a paywall.You are now paying for an update of what was the base game at launch.If you want to get into Europa Universalis buy EU III. However don't buy it on steam , EU III complete here dosen't have Napoleon's Ambition and In Nomine. "

												If you are mildly interested in geography, religion, history and world politics as well as a strategist this is the game for you.In this game you will experience various sorts of historical phenomenons between the years of 1444, the onset of the Ottoman Empire, and 1821, with the fall of the Holy Roman Empire.Colonisation, Intrigue, war, expansion, trade and diplomacy is just a small portion of what the game has to offer. The list of things to do in this game would be far to long to cover in this review. But i can assure you that the game handles each part very well. Of course there are always some things that needs to be polished but nothing major at all.If you are new to the genre, dont be discouraged of the complexity this game has to offer. New players will have an easy time understanding the basics from the very well made tutorial which covers all the things you need to know to play the game. From there you´ll learn most of the mechanics by just reading and screwing around with the different map modes, numbers, logs, etc.For those of you who like to maximize your gameplay to the smallest detail I definetly recommend this game aswell. You can improve your military stats to the an amazingly precise degree and micromanage your production with buldings as well as events. When you get good enough at the game there is alot of intresting and immersive achievements. The price tag is definetly worthy to be 40 €. There are hundred upon hundred hours to be found in this game. If this is a bit to expencive for you as is steam sales are definetly something to consider purchasing.			"

												One of the best strategy games on the market now! Europa Universalis IV is just fantastic and very addictive! You can choose any country that existed between 1444 to 1821 and play it. From a native tribe in North America to a great european power! If you choose for example Portugal or Spain you can probably be the first to set sail to the New World. If you choose France or England that are in the 100 Years War at the at the start. You can also choose one of the small german states/nations and try to overthrow Austria and become the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire or play as a daimyo and unite Japan!You have many decisions to make along the long way between 1444 to 1821. For example as England or Scotland you can form Great Britain after some objectives are made, as Castile you can form Spain. There also other formable countries for example The Polish Commonwealth, Germany, Hindustan, Holy Roman Empire, Ireland, Prussia, the Netherlands, Russia and lots more!In the upcoming DLC Conquest of Paradise there will be new native tribes, When you conquer or colonise a certain amount of land new nations will be formed, for example if you play as Spain and you have coquered all of the Aztecs, Mayas and Zapotecs the game will form a colony nation called New Spain, that will become a vassal.Paradox made a good job on this and the community is also very good! 9/10			"

												I have played this game for over 900 hours, because the older versions of the game looked rather promising. Then with every consecutive DLC and ""free"" update I started losing faith. Now I will just have to say that this game is unplayable, for several reasons:Rather than improving and fixing the AI to suit the game, they do the exact opposite. They made a horrible, mostly useless AI and started designing the game around it. This results in a game that, inevitably, will feel less like a simulator of history between 1444 and 1821, and more like just a bunch of blobs around your blob that you have to fight. It is in no way different from RTS games at this point, except somewhat bigger and semi turn-based. Even for people who do not particularly care about history, this is still dreadful, because the AI is no longer in any way enjoyable. In older versions of the game you could actually see the Holy Roman Empire being made from time to time, but now the bots are such debiles that there is no way you are going to see that, ever.Paradox Interactive are a bunch of kikes who know incredibly well that they virtually own the grand strategy market. Initially it did indeed look like PI was caring about designing an interesting game and the first DLC was kind of alright. Did not take too long to see the trend, though. They know very well that nobody will be making any similar game any time soon. Practically they force loyal consumers to pay for overpriced garbage that does not add anything, because, as already said, they know they have nowhere else to go. There are no high-budget non-Paradox grand strategy games. Below is a list explaining exactly how little all of the DLC does in comparison to the price you are paying for it.However, before I start, here is something you really need to know: DLC is just a cancerous term that has been made, sort of like a political euphemism, to start pushing through human vitriol that can be literally anything and charge for at the price of literally any arbitrary amount. The term ""expansion packs"" did not exactly cut it for multi-billion dollar corporations like Electronic Arts and Paradox (the publisher) who wished to sell garbage to the consumer. However, that is not to say all DLC can be horrible. The DLC for EU4 is cancer, though. Why is it cancer? Because it does not introduce any new game mechanics to the game. It merely disguises itself as unlocking new mechanics, but in reality the game mechanics are already offered for free, but these work only for the bots. All the DLC does is enables these features to work for you, the player, as well. That is why every Paradox Interactive employee needs to land under a speeding bus on a highway. Anyway, here it is: Common Sense - Costs 12 dollars. What does it do? They like to make big lists of features for every DLC, but this is the only significant change you will feel at all: being able to improve development in provinces, add inferior static bonuses to your Protestant nation and being able to support the independence of junior union partners or colonies. Mind you that none of these mechanics are advanced. You will work these out in five minutes. This is at the top of the list because of the fact that you are paying Paradox Interactive 12 dollars for having to pay a horrendously large sum of monarch points for a meagre improvement in your provinces. The most important part is that the bot can do this even if you do not have the DLC. Art of War - Costs a little over 12 dollars. What does it do? It allows your ships to carry allies. Does this have any use outside of multiplayer (i.e. for allied bots?) You guessed it. No! Not at all. Okay, but what about being able to designate objectives in enemy/occupied provinces? No, it doesn't work. None of these features work, because the AI is broken. Paradox Interactive is a subsidiary of one of the largest companies in Sweden and apparently also the least competent one, full of hissy hipsters who revolt at the sight of game criticism. More on that below. It also adds a Thirty Years' War mechanic, which really is the least enjoyable event in the entire game. Oh, and by the way, you can finally make templates of armies/navies so, when you grow to become a huge nation with one million manpower, you do not have the go through the tedium of building a new army from scratch after losing someone in a battle. Why should I pay 12 dollars for such an extremely basic feature you would expect in a grand strategy game to begin with? Oh, because Paradox, and apparently we need millions more to pay for all of our five active employees (50% of population of Sweden). Not to mention, this does not work either, lol. If the landscape you draft your men from has any strait, this seemingly bugless (""What could go wrong?"") feature fails to recruit men in a logical manner. Seriously, wow. Great job. El Dorado - Costs 12 dollars. What does it do? Apparently gold fleets or something. Then some exploration of the Seven Lost Wonders. Then the basic feature, that should have been there to begin with, of automatic exploration. I hope you are starting to see the trend of how you have to pay 12 dollars for very, very basic and barebones GUI features you would expect from a multi-billion dollar company and publisher's grand strategy video game. Oh, and you can make a custom nation. That is probably the only thing worth paying for at all, since there indeed seems to have gone some effort into making this somewhat interesting. The values seem to all be balanced. This is the only compliment Paradox is going to get from me. Naturally, though, this is nowhere near enough to keep me interested, let alone forgive for the greed of those subhumans and senseless game design. Cossacks - I am not going to buy this because at this point it really is directly insulting not just my own, but everyone's intelligence. They want you to pay for knowing what provinces your allies and enemies are interested in. The moment I saw this, I was, like, do they think we are Down's children or something? Why should I pay 15 dollars (used to be 20 dollars, mind you) for something so simple, something I would expect to see in a grand strategy game to begin with? When you go into a grand strategy game about Europe between 1444 and 1821, you expect all the drama that was going on. You expect to be able to interact with other nations' conclaves and heads of state in an engaging way. This was never in the game, but I had some faith in Paradox and expected this to be like that eventually. However, this dream is shattered and I have been conned by charlatans that simply do not deserve anyone's time, and, most importantly, money. I hope every single one of these debiles drowns in burning petrol.There are other DLCs, but they will only redundantly reinforce my points above. Basically, do not buy them. Stay away from this game. If you do not give any money to these people, you are enabling candidates who might rise up to fame and, in an ideal scenario, come up with superior alternatives to Europea Universalis, Crusader Kings and whatever other filth Paradox pumps out. Do everyone, especially humanity, a favour and do not buy this game or any of its ""content"".As for the developers themselves: in update 1.10, they introduced a feature that makes, essentially, no sense from both a video game and human perspective. Basically, when you go to war with someone, they have military access through every single nation that gives military access to you. Yes. Not the enemy. You. Let us not improve the AI and make them stop going to wars they geographically cannot possibly win, no, let us just add a feature that makes literally no sense at all. You have to be mentally ill, seriously. Screw Paradox. I wish there wasn't a character limit on this.			"

												It feels like after every update, the developers are further and further breaking the game. Just like Microsoft is doing with Skype (seriously what the hell?). Common Sense locks out people who don't have it, so I have several friends who cannot play the full game unless me or another person who has the DLC hosts a multiplayer game so they can enjoy the full game. Utterly ridiculous. I have long enjoyed the game, but I have occasionally disagreed with the changes throughout the game's development. The Fort system is ludicrous because the AI ignores the forts and goes right past to destroy your army while you cannot get past their forts. The AI also will destroy you utterly after being an ally for a long period for no reason other than, ""Well, I suddenly want all your land, dear ally! Sorry!""Then there's also playing moderate to small sized countries where every country around you will hate you and declare six simultaneous wars on you and destroy you before you can even do anything. I attempted a Venice playthrough three times. Hungary, Milan, Austria, Ottomans, Serbia, Bosnia, and Mamluks all declare war on you nearly simultaneously each time. Once I gotten close to destroying both the Mamluk and Ottoman navy as well as taking the Pelopponese, but then you have the issue of NO ONE wanting to ally you. Not even France and every nation dogpiling on you until there's nothing left. So, in this scenario after nearly defeating the Ottomans I am reduced to nothing and Ottomans kills everyone else. Great work everyone! Oh and more recently Ottomans have been able to ally Bohemia and Aragon with regularity. Is this an intended change to AI behavior? I do not know, but it's rather silly! Similar story with an Oman playthrough. Yemen, Haasa, Hejaz all ally and kill everyone else. Yemen gets allied to Adal who takes Somalia and Mamluks as well. Everyone else is allied against you and there's nothing you can do about it! No one will ally you and the AI make it a certainly that they will crush you for what appears to simply be existing as a player country.I haven't had any major issues since before Common Sense, but it has just been getting more aggravating. Even colonizing is stupid because even if you are a strong country, they will all revolt simultaneously every twenty years, which makes owning them not worth it unless they deliver gold builllion every few months. So, that's yet another feature that isn't fun anymore. I hope AI behavior, colonial nation behavior, development regarding people who don't own Common Sense, and the fort system being cheated by AI is fixed at some point. Otherwise, I'll just be waiting for Stellaris I suppose.			"

												Update: I bit the bullet and bought all 8 major DLCs save Rights of Man, for the cheapest I could find them, using a combination of ""3rd party"" keys and the Steam Winter Sale, and it still totaled $58.Europa Universalis IV is a paywall labyrinth which is so inticing I wandered in and got lost.If you want a highly detailed personal account of EU4's gameplay, here:Good game, I enjoyed it.If you are only bothering to read a negative game review because you know there's going to be an enjoyable rant about something, then read on.I, like so many before me, cannot fathom nor begin to condone the marketing practices that Paradox has undertaken. The DLC content for the game totals to  four times  the price of the base game. As of this writing, six members of the myriad of supposedly ""extra content"" are considered ""expansions."" These expansions, as most will say, are less about adding more content to the game and more about bothering to finish off the content that's already there. In more commonly accepted practices, this is reffered to as a ""patch."" The buisness model of Paradox, essentially, is to charge you $40 to play a demo version of the game, and then charge you an additional  $135  to play the full game. All the while forcing another $40-$50 dollars of miscellania down your throat.EU4 is a good strategy game.EU4 is not $225 worth of a good strategy game.			"

												This is the only game I've ever written a review for. This game makes Civ 5 seem like clicker heroes. It's fun, it's  addicting. Dlc regulary goes on sale, and they regulary update game. I cannot recomend this game highly enought to people who truly love stragetdy and history games. When I got a virus on my laptop and I wanted to play this game, I would go to my library and install steam then install this game (2 hours of install) just so I could play as brandenburg for 5 hours until the library closed.

												Easily the best game I have ever played. I've sank 3000+ hours of my life into this game, and do not regret any of it. The paradox team has very actively updated, and improved this game since launch, and the state it is in now is glorious. It is an extremely complex game upon initial playing, but the learning curve is much better than it used to be, and the tooltips in game are incredibly detailed. I've had friends who have never played ask me if it is anything like the Civilization series, and the best response I have to that is Civilization is the equivelant of playing with legos as a child, where as EU4 is like building your dream house to live in. There really is no good comparison though, as the only way they are alike IMO is that both are nation builder games.Eu4 is not for everyone of course, but if you even think you might have an interest in it, chances are you will love it.I recomend a Brandenburg playthrough, and a muscovy playthrough at some point.As for a good nation to get your feet under you, and learn the game, Ottomans is definitely the easiest, and I doubt anyone would argue that. France is another great nation for learning the game in every aspect, and Spain is awesome for learning a well rounded game with a focus on colonizing. Playing any nation in Japan is a blast, but you'll want to have a firm understanding of the game before trying that. The modding community is incredible, and some of the mods out there are like getting a whole new game for free. There are mods to simplify the game, and ease the burdens of monotonous tasks, as well as mods to make the game more complicated, realistic, historical, and difficult if that's your thing. The initial purchase of $39.99 is a fair price, the only bad thing is if you do buy it there is a great deal of DLC that is very important, but not needed to play the game. I believe all of the DLC is absolutely worth the money, but I can see how initimdating it would be to try and buy them all now.			"

												You stand, shoulder-to-shoulder, with your fellow men in arms. Behind you, a long line strechting 200 meters of deadly artillery, the very same your enemy on the other side of the hills have too. You know their power, their speed. You stand near the flanks, and you see allied cavalry near you. You will be facing theirs, but you have prepared your bayonette just for this occassion - their renowned cavalry is no match for you.Trumpets. Your general enters. In the sky, a large golden star hovers over him to tell everyone in the field, he's got a pretty okay shock and fire modifier, but he can't shut up about that capped out mobility. Yeah, that'll help this fight.""Dear god.."", do you hear your close friend whisper to your ear. ""They have full offensive ideas"". You take a gulp, but don't worry, you have 5% extra morale because of some prayer books they forced in your hands. Surely, they will bring you the tide of war.In the distance, you see their line. Their big blue flag with three golden symbols wave in the sky: France. A general swoothes through the sky on a unicorn that is both artillery and a shock bonus sets aflame half the field. Three huge, imposing, intimidating golden stars blind half the regiments on both sides. 6/6/6/6. ""Great"", your friend whispers.Not all is lost. Just before you prepare for the final charge, out of the heavens fall two massive dies. The blue dice bounces around a few times, until it magically rolls onto an 8. You can beat that.Your rusty ol' red die shambles around, fighting the urge to even roll.1.Your 20k men is stack whiped in 2 days. GG.EU4: A game of rolls, no white peace, you win or you lose.			"

												This is the best game ever made. Seriously.Its a good strategy game and all, but it really has improved my life in other ways. For example, I now have superhuman knowledge of trivial points in world history that will never come in handy ever. Every time i blink i see a map of continental Europe burnt into my retinas. I'm pretty sure that I have become racist towards various cultures and religions. Especially the French.Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ them.Also stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥happens all the time. You've been looking at central Europe for a few hours. You pan the map to the west and notice that Haiti now owns half of America. You declare a war to claim ONE PROVINCE and before you know it the whole damn world is fighting against itself in every single continent.You feed your ally provinces from your wars and laugh manically as you watch their kingdom crumble to 200 stacks of rebels.The game seriously plays down all the opression and ethnic cleansing that goes on. It makes it seem that all you're doing by hitting that convert button is changing a few percentage values, but deep down inside you know whats really going on. When you hit the harsh treatment button to lower your peasant revolt risk, you don't realize that your soldiers are storming into peasants homes and executing them just for having an opinion on how to better their lives.I mean, i didn't even notice that all of my african provinces were producing slaves until i got an event that abolished slavery. The only reason i even cared about that was because it made my monthly income go down...Don't even think about trying to be a tolerant, peace loving society. Either all the countries next to you will kill you, or the boredom will kill you, because there is literally nothing to do in this game besides wage war and find new ways to ♥♥♥♥ the common man in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.It really opened my eyes to how terrible white people are.Overall 10/10 best opression simulator. So good, it desensitizes you to make you think just like how a near omnipotent aristocrat in the age of discovery would. "

												Used to Love this game. But after coming back and downloading a couple more DLC's I cannot say I am liking the game anymore. It is one fail after the another. 1. Aggressive expansion-Burned several times. So even being extra careful and checking current Agg expansion with neighbors before I do another peace agreement, see that I should be ok, but no, everyone on the map goes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Keep in mind the same thing does not happen to France or Austria.2. Austria is now freaking insane, the programmerfs do not want the player to blob the map, so they make the big country AI's blob and get away with it. This steals the fun out of the game. Look I do not play this game the way you demand I play it I guess. If you are going to hit players this hard, say so. Dont take our money then force to invest time into multiple failed games. 3. Cant block straits with your navy now. WTF not? Again you should tell returning players in one screen what you have changed since so and so patch in order to screw over the player.So insummary if you start small, and try to expand at a rate that will allow you to compete with Austria or France in say 200 years, the game bends you over and flushes 8 to 15 hours of game play down the toilet. You got alot of money out of me for this game, grats. Not another dime.			"

												After I had first downloaded and installed I spent 9 hours playing until I realised it was 1am in the morning.... This game covers the period  1444 to 1821. It's more accessable to get into compared to Eu2 and Eu3 that i've played bringing improvements to the UI and other gameplay additions. Not that there's anything wrong with those titles in the series far from it as i would particuly recomend Eu3 with all the expansions. I keep meaning to play Eu3 again for comparisons sake after getting this but I'm playing Eu4 too much so far to have the time to do that. Eu4 is far from being a shallow game either.One thing that might be an issue is the amount of dlc availiable for this game. In short you don't need any of it as there is plenty of content in the main game to be getting on with. This dlc comes in the form of expansions, flavour packs (music and events) and  various sprite packs. Of which only the various expansions are really worth your immediate attention. Art of War and Common Sense are the two most recomended ones to look at first. I only got those two as they were on sale when I got the base game but I could have easily have waited until the next sale. Paradox release a patch along side the release of an expansion that includes features that compliment and enhance the game alongsidee each released expansion. So the game has improved since it was first released. eg the way the spread on institutions  spread technology was released in the patch alngside the Rights of Man DLC.Important to note that in nultiplayer whoever hosts the game the players all have access to the hosts dlc in that particular game. So perhaps a way you can try what these dlc expansions are like before you may want to buy them for single player use? "

												Paradox has changed, had it been a year ago i would have recomended it but now theyre including ui improvments in dlc. Releasing dlc that should have been bundled together and general money shilling.The game itself is GREAT absolutely a work of art but i cannot support its business practises anymore.			"

Masterpiece  Europa Universalis IV,Sometimes if you play at Ironman mod it makes you really angry but game is awesome.It has a really good gameplay.You can expand with only making marriages or you can expand with wars but you can't take a lot of provinces from enemy,if you take you will have really big aggressive expansion and Coalition will attack you. There is lots of mechanics on diplomacy,wars...The game is really fun.If you are thinking of buying this game or not,just buy it.And if you can buy DLC's too. "

												It is a great game. The biggest problem is that to truly enjoy the game to its fullest you need to spend an absurd amount of money on extremely overpriced DLC. Simply put: the DLC does not offer enough content in each one to justify their price. Look at Rights of Man for example, it really only adds like 2 somewhat ""big"" features and about 4 or so other very small features.. and it costs 20 dollars. Insane.Only buy the DLC on sale.Also, still waiting for that apology Paradox.			"

												Like many of Paradox's other games, Europa Universalis IV is a grand strategy game taking place in real history, in the real world. The game starts in 1444 and ends in 1821. You can play as any country in the world, including the Cherokee in North America, Brandenburg in Holy Roman Empire, the steppe horde of the Oirats, the Delhian Indians, the sub-saharran Songhayans, or even the native indonesians. As a European, you colonize and dominate the world, while as an Asian, African or Native American, you fight to resist the imperialism from taking your homeland. Game mechanics include colonization, diplomacy, exploration, westernization, reformation, technological advancement, and, of course, warfare. It is a bit simplistic and quite random, but the game is extraordinarily fun and every game is different from the last.			"

												I wish I could still recommend this game-as it was one of my all-time favorites-but, unfortunately, this game's developers have systematically made this a less interesting, less dynamic, and altogether less fun over the course of several patches. There are many positive reviews here, and they were all earned-before the game's most recent patch. Instead of a dynamic empire-building game, you are left with a game that will, quite literally, severely punish every step taken in that direction. In addition, while Paradox is usually a first-class company regarding DLC practices, the most recent patch to this game renders is a hollow experience without buying the accompanying DLC, Common Sense-same basic practice seen with the Total War Series. While this is a first for Paradox, it is shameful and should be called out for what it is.If you do buy the game, make sure to play it on an older patch. The developer's determination to make the game, frankly, slow and dull is hard to understand, but should be avoided if you decide to purchase. You need only google a bit to see people's concerns about this becoming a glorified waiting game.Bottom line: Developers took this game in terrible direction, despite concerns among the community about doing so, and now we have that is less interesting (and buggy, for the moment) as a result. Do yourself a favor and buy Crusader Kings II instead. Unlike EU IV, the developers have only added to the player's options and that game's versatility, rather than turning it into the waiting game that EU IV has become. You will not regret buying CK 2, but there is every chance that you will find EU IV plain boring in it's current state. I hate to leave a review like this, as this game was just great, but the slow decline due to design philosophy to slow down expansion and every other aspect in the game, and the shameful DLC tactics on display with the Common Sense DLC, render this game unworthy of a positive review at the moment.

												Don't get me wrong by the ""Not recommended ""- the game is very good and fun- that's why I got over 1000 hours playing.Also the game devs are really... nice and caring... they give us a properly bugged update around each 3-5 months, that improves maybe 1 issue no one really cares about, constatntly avoiding big issues (*cough cough* forts system *cough cough*) and when the developers have a nice mood they  also add few working free features. And do you know what the best part is? A great DLC adding literally nothing but additions that make the update playable- for a crazy cheap prize of 15$.But that's not all- the developers work hard all night to add content packs of new textures- just for 5$ each!!And if it's a lucky day, we also get an E-Book about the DLC!!!Now srsrly- if you're going to buy this game look really well what the DLCs actually add before purchasing (look only at big expansions, the E-Books and content packs are crap the desperate devs try to sell)- do it at the game wiki site, since on Steam the devs write what the whole patch added. Go on untill the DLC you find really stupid already and stop. Play on the latest version you can (the patch that came together with the last DLC bought) and enjoy- don't try to catch up with all the DLCs unless you can actually pay a lot for gaming and don't care wasting 15$ on crap.The moment the devs will release normal DLCs or reduce the costs to ~5$ or less- I will change it to ""recommended"" again.

												With its two year anniversary nearly upon us, I felt I should write a review of what is perhaps my favorite game. With a setting that begins at the tail end of the 'Hundred Years War' and continuing on past the final defeat of Napoleon, Europa Universalis IV offers players the chance to take the helm of any country that existed in that 377 year period and bring honours and glory to your realm. You can play as a great land power such as Austria, Prussia, France, or Russia, or try your hand and carving out a vast colonial empire with the Spanish, Dutch, or British. You can begin in the far east, and attempt to fight the tide of European colonial adventures into your lands, or play as an American Indian tribe and unite your neighbouring tribes into a powerful confederacy to halt the Europeans in their march westward. I cannot stress this enough, EUIV is MASSIVE and will provide you with hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of enjoyable gameplay. You will experience the dawn of gunpower, the Dash and Glory of Musket and Horse, founding and expanding colonies in the furthest regions possible. You will gain provinces, and you will lose them, but it is always possible to come back from the darkest defeat and restore the glory rightly owed to your nation!EUIV has brought out several major DLC's that add major game play improvements and additional content that genuinely allow the game to grow into a fantastic piece of art. From interesting and challenging colonial mechanics to giving the player the opportunity to create a trade empire, and from improving the combat mechanics to making religion play the major role it did in the period, the EUIV team has consistently updated the game released in 2013 to keep it challenging and in line with what the people who play the game want it to be. Some people may balk at the DLC structure in use, however with each paid DLC released the developers provide a free content pack. I think the major DLC's worth purchasing, but should you not want to do so you can rest easy knowing that you will still get free updates. In short, put on your Tricorne, mount your horse, and prepare to fight for your God, your King, and your Country!			"

												After nearly 2000h of gameplay, here's my review:EU IV is my first game in this genre and I just wanted to test it back in time, with not thinking that I ever spend so much time on and in this game.This game has a really great advantage:It never gets boring due to new (and awesome!) DLCs + a great Community.You need a little time to understand the whole game mechanics if you are new (like me) to this series. But it pays off, because for other game's you need much time like for the story. Here you make your own story. The mechanics are deep and get deeper with every (major) DLC.I'm sorry I can't compare it with other grand strategy video games, but I think it's safe to say that EU IV stands out from the crowd. The amount of possibilities which country you play, how you play it (defensive or aggressiv, both has disadvantages), the time period you play it and with 'El Dorado' the customization is fantastic and so much you can't even describe it with a few sentences.So in conclusion: Even for new and non-specialist this game should be an option. It has a great replay-value, a nice community and a growing 'supply' of DLCs.Edit:Hit the 3k hours and it's still good. The newest DLC's gets more customization and the replay-factor is going through the roof.			"

Want to build a highly developed nation without events? 15$ DLC, want to expand your nation and be technologically advanced? Pick one. The new coring costs and diplo annex costs are very high to the point you quickly fall behind in tech. There's more detailed reviews but in essence the new dlc and patch made the game even slower paced, and much more limited therefore i cannot recommend this game.			"

												This game. This game is the grandest of all the grand strategy games existing today. This review could easily be considered as a comparison between the two games Civilization V and Europa Universalis IV.tl;dr: This a great game, I recommend you buy it.To compare it to the game ""Civilization V"", Europa Universalis IV focuses on more complexity with expansion and conquest, as well as more resources to limit your aggression. The strategy in Europa Universalis IV is much deeper. The historical connection is stronger. The AI is better. Civ 5 however lets you play over a very long time period. It lets you take over the entire world and stomp on the AI. It is easier to learn and master so requires less patience and persistence.The DLC & PricesIn Europa Universalis IV, the DLC is not mandatory but is fun to play with. I don't recommend buying it unless you have money to throw around.Whereas in Civilization V, major DLC is mandatory for gameplay, and is considered an essential for any hardcore Civ player.To summarize this with math; discluding sales, Europa Universalis IV gives more content for its price and more gameplay as well.  $39.99 (Game)+$9.99 + $14.99 + $4.99 (Optional, Non-mandatory DLCs)=$70.00 Total Civilization V alone isn't much fun to play, and is also pricy however it has fairly pricy DLCs to add to the game.  $29.99 (Game)+$29.99 (BNW) +$19.99 (G&K) +$4.99x5 (Per other Civilization)=$80 Min. -- $100.00 TotalI also often see the two games on sale, so I recommend snagging them up for cheap. I got Europa Universalis IV for $14.99 and DLC for $19.99, only spending about 35 dollars.In summary, I like them both. EUIV as a historical grand strategy game and Civ 5 as a build, expand, and conquer arcade strategy game. Now many people will usually choose one and stick to one game. Those differences determine whether you prefer / favor either of the two games. But in my opinion, if you have the money, you're better off buying Europa Universalis IV.			"

												Let me start off by saying I love the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game. The amount of time me and other players have spent playing this game is a testament to how great it is, with many players that I have played multiplayer with currently sitting on 2-3k hours. In the beggining major patches were very spaced apart, but they were rich in fun and meaningful content, and so was all the DLC. However as Europa progressed Paradox has started releasing patches and DLC with a much higher frequency but a much lower quality. New major game mechanics are added in what feels like a monthly basis, which would be great if they weren't absolute garbage. I mean let's be honest, everyone hates the States/Territories system, the Sailor system is nearly arbitrary, the new intrigue system is alright but changing it had no real effect on the game, nobody knows what Revanchism is, and the list goes on an on. If they kept releasing amazing DLC like the Art of War I would bend over with my credit card in between my cheeks, but unfortunately thats not the case. At this point I think Paradox has given up on the game, and is flooding the market with DLC to make as much profit as possible. The patches clearly lack effort and desire to please those who still enjoy this game, and it makes me sad to leave a negative review on something thats kept me entertained for as long as this has. This is a negative review, because I hate what Europa has become, however it used to be a great game. I can only currently enjoy it by playing multiplayer, which makes some of the patches bearable because the competition is inherently fun, or by rolling back to an older version of the game.  If Grand Strategy is your cup of tea, then I would storngly suggest waiting untill this is on sale, then buying it alongside some of the major DLC, and rolling back to around patch 1.14 or so. But I cannot reccomend buying this game at full price, or playing on patch 1.17 .			"

												The most accessible Paradox grand-strategy game to date. That doesn't make any of the game mechanics any less complicated. Once you understand the game, like all good strategy game, EU4 will eat up any spare time you give it.You can play as any nation/culture in the world from the 1400's to the 1800's. The two main routes to endgame success is early&aggressive Colonialism (Portugal and maybe England) or Continental Europe land domination (Austria and maybe France).Succession feels watered down from the hilarious chaos of Crusader Kings 2. You still might be able to get a free nation if you are clever & lucky. The upside is the complex and detailed technology tree. The various nations also have their own micro buffs.Recommended you only buy EU4 and the major DLC (CoP & WoN) on sale.			"

Posted: June 1, 2016
												My original review (which i've now deleted) had this game down for what it was, back then- without doubt the greatest and most fun grand strategy game of all time.  However, that has all changed since and after the release of the inappropriately-named ""Common Sense"" DLC, which also involved one of the greatest frauds by a developer against gamers in business and PC history.  When a game takes out a core mechanic that you have already paid for when buying the game, then CHARGES you via DLC for using it's less-than-perfect replacement, then you've been done over.     - Effectively, everytime Paradox releases DLC, you are forced into buying it to make the game playable and balanced again. Province development is a great example of this. When simple patches are released as DLC, over and over again, that you need to shell out more and more money for (even though you've loyally bought all there overpriced wee texture and unit packs over the years), then you've been done over.    - The whole EU4 collection will now set you back an astonishing and completely indefensible £165. When working systems are replaced by half-baked and often totally illogical mechanics that make no sense at all, then you've been done over. A great example of my last point is the ""zone of control"" farce that forts now exert. Although a garrisoned fort/castle has never in human history stopped an army from simply ignoring it and walking round it to its destination, it could've been an interesting mechanic, had Paradox spent more than ten minutes implementing it. As it turns out, in EU4, since the Common Sense forced-DLC, a tiny fort 400 miles to the south can stop a full army moving 10 miles to the north, even if said fort is under seige by a second army. I've even seen an army having to loop round from the east Chinese coast, all the way to the Hungarian Steppes and back again, just to move one province (or about 50miles) north. It is the most appalling and ridiculous inclusion any game has ever had. Furthermore, just about EVERYTHING that\'s been added requires monarch points to some degree. This in itself wouldn't be a problem. But Paradox didn't actually increase the number of monarch points you generate each month to compensate for everything that now needs them. So you're left unable to do half the things you want/need to do.The game has also been made harder and harder as time has gone on, with player choice being nerfed with every DLC. This in turn leads to lots and lots of time where you are left doing nothing, just waiting, with the game speed turned up. Any change that reduces ""stuff to do"" in a game can only be bad. Enormously crippling Over-Extension mechanics, which have been ramped up with each passing patch, has put paid to any ideas you may have had of creating a sprawling Empire-style nation. You simply won't have the monarch points to do it. So the alternative is to create a One-province nation, which, believe me, is no fun at all, as you spend 90% of the game at the highest speed level, waiting for something interesting to happen.Don\'t get me wrong, i enjoy a challenge, but not one that gets artificially added with each passing patch and reduces my ""up-time"". The result of all this is that half the achievements are now completely beyond being achievable (unless you use a cheat engine or similar, which deats the purpose).But for me, by far the saddest thing about the horrible direction this once-great game has taken, is the effect it has had on public opinion about Paradox. Paradox were (once) a much-loved developer who enjoyed a lot of goodwill internationally from gamers. Now, they are close to being reviled world-wide by all of PCdom. Their bizarre decisions to change things that were working fine and locking off absolutely key mechanics behind more and more ridiculous paywalls has relegated them into the same leagues as EA and co. I just cannot take them seriously anymore, and this seems to be a stance i share with many, many others. It is a great shame then, that, being a proud owner of half a dozen different Paradox strategy games, EU4 will sadly be my last. I will not be taken for a mug anymore by a company who have lost their way in every way imaginable, and have managed to alienate themselves from the gaming world.If you want to play this game, then do so, but roll it back to the patch before Common Sense, and switch off auto-updating. That way, you can enjoy what it once was, and not the money-swindling and unbalanced monster it has sadly become.			"

												Overall 5/10I’ve been playing Europa Universalis since its early days, a long long time ago. It’s been a joyride for the most part, its peak with EUII. Now, the best bit about this history simulator (a much more suitable definition than 4X or simply strategy game) was the huge amount of historical events thrown at you through time. Historical characters, wars, religious events, economic, trade and administration advances. You could actually learn a lot about history of unknown and mostly forgotten countries. Most of that is now gone, substituted by an easier “mission” system that allows you to pick and choose what your country is going to be. Sure the game is still fun, but it has become a lot more generic, losing that “grounded in history” feel it used to have in earlier versions, while the game engine is pretty much still the same old one.So, is this a good game per se? Yes it is. Would I recommend it? No, as it is a huge step back from previous releases.PROS:-	The whole world is up for grabs, and there’s almost infinite replayability-	The UI is nice and easy-	The game has depth and width as most Paradox games doCONS-	35 DLCs and counting, seriously?? Considering most of the DLCs are utterly useless (most add songs (!!!) or tiny graphical improvements or ebooks (!!!!)). Some are meant to be meaningful (like Art of War, Wealth of Nations) but these cost 20USD a piece and add very little content.-	The updating policy is ridiculous and offensive: sure, patches are “free” but updating the game without getting the latest DLC (which you’d dearly pay for) the game becomes very unbalanced and clunky.-	Getting the game and all the DCL’s at full price costs more than 200 USD (two hundred) for a game that runs on a 15 years old engine. I got the game on a huge sale with several DLCs and still I regret spending about 25 USD for it.-	The historical flavour, with the tons of events that were there in previous versions is gone, making it another faceless 4X strategy game.

												I loved this game at release and unfortunately it's only gone downhill from there.Almost every time there is a new release you have to relearn how to be successful at the game. Ridiculous amount of overpriced DLC. Some of the features you enjoyed are now in DLC you have to buy to return your game to the way you used to play it.I got tired of having to continuously look for player made mods to fix whatever new ""feature"" was added by Paradox whether I wanted it or not.Basically, this game went from one of my all time favorite games that I was recommending to everyone I knew.....to a game I'll probably never play again and that I warn people away from.Game at start-10/10Game now-2/10 "

												Europa Universalis IV is undeniably very good. There are many historical events, the possibilities are immense and replayability. I take great pleasure to rewrite history.In EU4, you get to to control the destiny of a country and play with it in a sandbox. You want to play France and conquer Germany? You can! You want to play Poland and become a colonial power? Its gonna be hard, but you can. You want to be the Ottoman sultan and colonize the North America? Post a screenshot, that's gonna be awesome :)If you pay a little extra on the side, you get a CK2 to EUIV converter, allowing you to export your favourite kingdom from CK2 to EUIV and continue its legacy.

												I haven't put much time into the game so my opinion may be worthless, but I love this game either way. When I first bought it, I had gotten the EUIV Collection since I had thought the game was done pushing out DLC and had bundled everything in to a neat little box. I was horribly disappointed to learn a few months later that another DLC had came out, then another after that, and another, and another. It's more like I'm paying for an episode from a Telltale game instead of an actual full DLC.To quote a fellow player and reviewer-""...unless you want to spend hundreds of dollars and pay a monthly tax to unbrick the game when they lock another core feature behind the 347th overpriced DLC don't buy it.Paradox makes good games, and then they unmake them.""

												I used to love this game, but with the addition of the newest DLC (common sense) I do no longer enjoy it. From what I've understood from various forums and blogs, there are a number of features that are now included in the vanilla game that you can't alter without the DLC, and those features happen to be incredibly important for improving your land. So either get the game including common sense, or don't get it at all.And this leads to the conclusion that the vanilla game is not something that I recommend, since it is ruined. And it used to be an incredible game.			"

												This game series is the best strategy series ever made. I've played most turnbased strategy games (and a number of real-time), and used litterally months of gametime on the Civ-series alone. And months played time on Heroes of M&M etc. This is better!It's more complex, have far greater replay-value than any other strategy game I've com across, and the not-really-turnbased-not-really-real-time concept is perfect. Even most of the DLC's are good.Why NOT recommended then?1) It's fast becoming one of the worst DLC exploiting games. (2nd only to their own CKII wich is litteraly insane!)2) Every time there's a DLC, the game without the DLC also changes (mapchanges, interactionchanges etc.), and often makes it real hard to play decent without the DLC. So you either get a worse gaming-experience or have to pay up more.3) If you like to play for acheivement, save yourself hours of anger-management treatment and don't ever touch this game. Example: You try several times to get one of the hard acheivements, and then in 4th try its there. You start as a minor Irish county and manage to outsmart England and are close to conquering the British Isles. You've got 30 hours playtime on this campaign, and in just a few more the achievement is there. You save and go to bed. You start the game next morning and load it ready for the sweet victory. Only problem is there's an update. You begin to sweat, knowing this might be a horrible gaming-day. You get into the game, and see that the game isn't under saved games. In horror you click on ""load outdated savegames"", and load your game. It seems fine. Phew! The day is your! The time is now! You finish conquering the isles! BUT? Theres no ach-pop-up?!? You can't see anywhere that anything is wrong, but the minor bug-fixing-update that morning, changed your savefile enough that achs doesn't count from it.... When this happens for the 3rd time, and you write Paradox if theres anything to be done about it, you recieve something along the lines of you could either (*haha*) just start over, stop playing the game (since we allrdy got your money), or simply just go f... yourself...A year later the bitterness is a distant memory, and the thrill of those sweet moment when a really hard ach is achieved begs you back. You even buy one or two of the DLC's thats come in between. The first few easy-mode games go (too) well, and you go Iron-man-mode (the setting needed for achs) and get one of the new easy or medium achs. You start one of those ""play-for-weeks"" campaigns for a hard achievement, and when closing in on it: there's a minor bug-fixing-update. The horror. The bitterness. The promise of never to give Paradox a dime again... Untill a year later, when the bitterness is a distant memory.....This cicle has repeated itself untill im closing in on 1600 hours gameplay (and thats only on number 4 in the series).So if you're willing to pay for every DLC they come with, to the point where they might as well have subscribtion, and you don't care for achievements, or getting save-games ruined (also non-ach games) every few months, and want a game you can play again and again and again and forever, this is the game you want. If you havn't allrdy been tricked into giving one of the gaming companies that gives absolutely 0 f...s about their costumers money - save it (and your frustrations) for those deserving it :)			"

												EU4 is a great grand strategy game and has vastly improved since release. Paradox Interactive regularly adds new free content along with every dlc they make and the dlc adds some great features that are worth the price. EU4 is very fun once your into it but it takes quite a bit of learning to get into it and one of its faults is the tutorials lack of help when it comes to learning the game. If you are interested in this game and haven't played a Paradox Interactive grand strategy game I would highly reccomend watching some people play it on Youtube since it really helps you learn the game better. This game does a great job of allowing to conquer the world however you want with any country in the game. Yet world conquest isn't the only way to win as you can focus on a colonial trade power, unifying the Holy Roman Empire, or many different ways to play. Highly recommended game if you enjoy grand strategy games and if you have a remote interest go watch it on Youtube to find out more about it.			"

												Change history the way you see fit. Unlike most games of its kind, Europa doesn't focus only on world domination. Your nation can easily prosper from trade, technology, religion, or any number of factors. The diplomacy is something to be admired, considering it stops you from being a warmongering menace to the world. If you really want to conquer the world, expect complete resistance and harsh penalties for doing so. Even if this game was barebones and lacked good content (which it doesn't), it comes with Workshop. As with any Workshop game, there's endless possibilities on how you can modify your game to your heart's content. With easy-to-use multiplayer connection, play with your friends for just as long as you'd play alone. If the price is stopping you from buying this game, don't let it. If you love strategy, this will be one of your best purchases on Steam.			"

												EUROPA UNIVERSALIS IV - THE NEW BAR FOR GRAND STRATEGY GAMES.Fun, enganging, meaningful, accessible. These are words I use to describe Europa Universalis IV. Europa Universalis IV (EUIV for short) is the newst Paradox Grand Strategy game, and unsurprisingly, the fourth main game in the Europa Universalis series. In this game you control any nation from the earliest start date of  November 11th, 1444 to rhe latest starte date of January 1st, 1820. In addition there are plenty of historical scenario start dates for you to choose from.Europa Universalis IV is the easiest Paradox Grand Strategy game to get into. The graphics are wonderful. This is the first Paradox Strategy title I actually can play with the terrain map mode on because it looks so great. The models for units are done well, and the world comes alive as you see units moving across the map and the world go from winter to spring.  In addition, the artwork for the game looks great. From the dilemma pieces to the pictures of great leaders during the loading screens the artists did a fantastic job.The music is beautiful as well. From the intial loading screen the title song starts to play, and generally as the song comes to a lovely apex the map of Europe unfolds in front of your eyes in a wonderful fashion. It is a really breathtaking experience. The music is well done and makes you feel like you really are running a nation of the time period covered in game.As well, the mechanics are deep yet simple. For example, diplomacy has had an overhaul since EUIII. Now instead of having ""Diplomat Points"" you have diplomats who can only do one thing at a time. You could be improving relations with one nation, while brokering for peace with another, but those are your two diplomats and you can't delcare war on a third nation until one of the other diplomats is freed up. All of the people that can be used in game have changed to that system from the ""Person Point"" system of EUIII.Another overhaul the game has received are the Administrative, Military, and Diplomatic points. You get a set number of these each month based upon your rulers skills, your advisors, and the base amount your nation makes. These points are used to do a variety of actions, tech up, unlock new ideas, increase stability, deal with dilemmas, in addition to a variety of other actions.EUIV is an easy game to get into, and a hard one to stop playing. It is easy to sink hours into this title without ever looking back. I easily give EUIV a coveted 10/10 rating. I have really enjoyed my time so far with EUIV and can not wait to see what the future brings.			"

Product received for free
												As already said in a lot of quality reviews here, the economic model of the game is a joke. Did you bought the base game (40 €, not exactly cheap) or even better, the ""Extreme edition"" (4 DLCs for a mere 5 more euros (a great deal right ?)Then ♥♥♥♥ you.   The base game is barren and quite limited and you need those 20 € DLCs to stay relevant against the broken logic of the game rules and the ability of the AI to well, be a broken AI relying on too many cheap bonuses to offer any challenge and nothing else.   And still, this would be nothing if the devs were not actually taking out mechanics with each patch, ""enhance"" them and then release the updated gameplay feature behind a paywall. (The patches only implement very basic things and are obviously just there to prepare way for the next DLC. Speaking of them, the devs are most of the time ignoring their fanbase and tend to actually reduce the possibility of metagaming instead of actually fixing things up (i.e. Fixing an exploit used to circumvent a broken mechanic but not fixing said mechanic, letting you, the player forced to face an obviousy unfair mechanic)If this was 2014 I would fiercely recommend the game, but in-between, It went from awesome to baleful because of poor management, and of the devs ego and greedyness.Sad.

												I'm changing my review slightly to better fit with my thoughts, especially considering the most recent DLCs/patches in this.This game I really and truly feel was balanced specifically for people who like to break systems, or who enjoy a more balanced gameplay experience (I.E multiplayer). EUIII in comparison I felt, while rather easy (which was not a problem to me, but I do know people for whom it was) in its ease allowed for a lot of fun and ahistorical scenarios, EUIV's dedication to its idea of 'balance,' where every country has this strength and this weakness and every country is forced into these very historical highways that do not allow for fun deviations without missing out on a -massive- power advantage by strictly following history I just don't find fun.There are also problems like the military aspect, especially early game, being the realm of the larger powers. You essentially know whether you have won or lost a war before it even begins, as if you don't have a major power on your side, or you yourself aren't, you're screwed. Even if they don't start out the war with one on their side, the scales are tipped in the defenders favor in a conflict to an insane degree. You can ally up with people and call them into defensive wars mid war. You can have people intercede on your behalf for a white peace without even giving two ♥♥♥♥♥ about your country.All of this means that trying to turn someone like Poland or even a relatively decent power like Venice into a world hegemony is ridiculously difficult as your manpower issues and your forced historical focus keeps you, ironically enough, from doing some things that may have in fact happened historically that just don't fit the narrative of the country according to Paradox.If you want a strategy game thats a challenge with some decent window trimming of the time period I think EUIV will do you fine. If you want a game that properly dedicates itself to allowing you the freedom to make a country and mold it in this time period according to your weird kingly whims, EUIII is still the much better product IMO.

												If the AI has an ally it will act in a super intelligent fashion. If you ally to the same country they suddenly become morons. I launched a war with Leinster and Burgundy as Allies while Desmond was Allied with Scotland. Scotland and Desmond fought as one giant stack while my allies were intentionally coded to leave provinces before cappingUsed to like the game company. Doubt I will buy any more from them. The Allies = You Lose code is really poor game design.			"

												This game has had so much potential but it has failed to become the great game I thought it should be. This is because of a few things. 1) Balance2) DLC3) Stupid leave game system4) Botched alliance and favour system5) CoalitionsFirst of all the balance, this game has the entire world for you to play as but most of time will be in europe. Why? Well faster gameplay stronger units on average as well as more and bigger events than anywhere else. This leads to the balance complaint. First of all if Castille decides to it can easily conquer most of Northern Africa then inherit Aragon and possible Naples very early game. Meaning they can quickly expand into Italy and lower parts of Africa. This then leads to the alliances complaint as it is entirely possible for Castille to have both Austria and France as allies meaning the main defence for Africa (Ottoman Empire) is not going to last very long especially with Poland and Lithuania glaring at them as well. A united India would struggle to push back a European power as well. The DLC in this game while it did come out very slowly and only the host needs it is a gauling ammount. Another complaint with this is the unbalancing that Common Sense originally brought with it which if not purchased allowed the AI to develop their provinces making them much better while you couldn't without the DLC. The alliance system in the Cossacks was a step in the right direction for curbing the use of powerful nations for rapid expansion but it does not seem to have an option for 'I am attacking your rival, please help me curb their power', which I have found it to be rather annoying. Some of the features do feel like they should have been in the base game anyway such as the ability to swap occupations which came with the art of war DLC.More of an annoyance than an actual complaint but the game shuts down briefly and reloads if you quit the game you were in. At least it is a step forward from the previous method of locking you out of multiplayer if you were going to go play with a friend. The alliance system as mentioned before does need some work still. This because you can have all the powerful nations in the same area all allied with each other which basically means game over. I have seen this with Scandanavia - France - Commonwealth which was proberly the most annoying, Russia - Ottomans - Austria - Papal State, this one was daft. Britain - Austria - Castille - Aragon, is a more recent one I have seen. I would say this makes it interesting but they will quickly become immortal and just keep expanding everywhere. The coalition system, now this is a huge pain. Largely because the AI never seem to get them. I have seen France take over huge portions of land in Germany in single wars and not have any back lash for it. Normally it is measured through development but since it is Germany the average values are quite high and can easily cause a coalition. I have taken 3 provinces and caused a world war to kick off over it.  "

												Base gameThe best, most in-depth strategy game I have ever played, but due to changes in some patches and the actual price of the game I have to give a thumbs down for it.The base game is very limited if you do not have the DLC and want to play the latest patch. So the actual cost of the game is 134,93€ plus Mare Nostrum 14,99€ if you want it. However I would recommend to revert back to patch 1.15.1 with all the DLC up till Mare Nostrum installed. That was the most fun I have ever had with the game. It was more in-depth than ever before, there was finally meaningful content between the wars, estates are a nice addition, the development and building of provinces is great.A lot of people praise Paradox for their DLC policy, because of the ""extensive"" free content with all major DLC and the ability to roll back to previous patches. But for a game like this the ability to roll back to previous patches is mandatory as play troughs, at least for me, easily last for 50+ even I have never played through the entire timeline from 1444 to 1820. These long games would not be an issue, but most major patches brake previous saves and as I play on Ironman (1 save & 1 backup only) I would never be able to finish any campaigns if I would live a normal life outside of the game and I would play other games than this. Most major patches such as Common Sense and now Mare Nostrum introduce new major features or change existing core features in such a way that you either become handicapped if you want to play the current version without the DLC or also the AI is handicapped to make the game fair, but it feels like you are playing in the Paralympics while the normal Olympics would be constantly dangled in front of your face as a reminder to buy the DLC. In Common Sense this feature was the province development which locked the amount of buildings you could construct in each province. This meant that if you didn´t buy the DLC and wanted to survive any wars as a small nation the majority of your buildings were forts which crippled your economy.Even though I very much enjoy the game as it is in 1.15.1 I would not say that it is worth 134,93€ unless you have nowhere better to spend that kind of money. On sale the price might be reasonable or if you find the game somewhere else for less. Fanboys will give a thumbs down for any negative reviews, but I am just stating the negative sides of the game, because most reviews seem to only focus on parsing the game and the developers.Mare NostrumAs a Finn I find the cultural changes related to my culture group absolutely idiotic. Karelian is now part of the Russian culture group, Finnis are now Nordic, Estonian is part of the Baltic culture group and Finno-Ugric culture group is now just Ugric.This would be the same as making the whole Scandinavian culture group part of Germanic and renaming the mess to German.I cannot see any reason to make these terrible changes as the cultures were accurate before. I would like to know who was the idiot who came up with this idea and why it was allowed in the game.As a Finn I simply cannot recommend this patch as the cultural inaccuracy is appalling.Feelings right after Common Sense. I was not happy.The game is♥♥♥♥♥♥because of Common Sense.If you buy the game you should downgrade it to Art of War or Eldorado.  This used to be my favorite game but Common Sense broke the whole thing and sucked all the enjoyment out of it. It changed core gameplay features and made it so that you have a severe handicap if you do not own the DLC. Paradox why u do this to us?ConclusionBuy the game and all major DLC until Mare Nostrum on !SALE!, roll back to patch 1.15.1 and prepare for the best historical grand strategy game you have ever played.

I requested a refund after the tutorial.

The constant updates and changes to mechanics constantly keep the game fresh and feeling new. There is always more to learn and master. If you enjoy nation building, conquest, expansion and politics, then you will find endless enjoyment in this game.			"

												I bought it because i wanted to have a ""hardcore strategy"" game which i can play for weeks/months/years. And i will never regret spending 40 bucks on it. At first you think "" oh♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ what am i even supposed to do ? "". You will fail, you will start a couple of new games on easy, even with bonuses but when you start to get used to the game, you will never stop playing it. No campaign is like the one you've played before, even if you play as the same country ! After winning your first battles/wars you will feel like a wargod in human form, and this feeling never stops. I hardly recommend to play it in Ironmanmode, simply because you need to think about what you're doing. If you do something wrong, you have to live with the consequences.			"

												It has been a long, long time since I got this genuinely excited about a game. It even got to the point where friends and acquaintances were remarking that maybe I should calm down when I talked about it. The last time I got this riled up about a game I was playing Shogun: Total War for the first time.Europa Universalis is a game that really took my by surprise. Yes, that was pretty much due to my ignorance of the series. But I feel like I discovered a masterpiece. Everything within the game just gels so well together it creates the grandest of experiences on so large and so long a scale no game can really match it in what it has set out to do. No game even really can try to match since they all focus on victory. Europa focuses on playing the game, its focuses on riding the waves of history through both its high points and its low points. Can you survive the ebb and flow of time? If you are so inclined you can find my full review of the game over at my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/05/europa-universalis-iv.html.

												This game is fun for those who like to conquer, except in one minor area where the enemy AI will avoid your attacks at all cost when they know it will lose. While this can be overcome using crazy strategies, I oftened just cheated and owned the game's failed mechanic in this one crucial area.Aside from that, I was deeply satisfied in my hungry to conquer Europe, the Middle East and most of Africa. Being able to 'role play' as a certain country was intriguing and gave me new insights on the history behind the Holy Roman Empire, the Ottomans, and Italy. France be damned. ;)			"

												A crap ton of expensive DLC.People will tell you that you still get free updates, but all the updates really are are teasers showing you features you can't use until you buy the latest DLC. Every update also adds balance changes which revolve around you having the latest DLC, so you get punished for trying to play the latest version without the latest DLC.Another thing people will tell you is that you can just roll back to an earlier version, but that means you forfeit three years worth of bug fixes, meaning that you're stuck playing a broken game.That being said the game is still good, but if you can't get the expansions then just stick with EU3.Verdict: Don't buy this unless you have an additional 300 bucks to blow on it, unless you can aquire the DLC by some 'other means', in which case this is a great game.

												Very timeconsuming fun. It's very easy to lose yourself trying to build up the Irish empire only to find out it's 5 in the morning and you haven't eaten in 12 hours. The gameplay is pretty fun although somewhat repetative. A ton of replayability, though it is lacking in the early game if, like me, you like to try out a ton of different nations before deciding. There are fun events, though it can be lacking here as well. There is a lack in general events that happens for everynation, with the exeption of different crises or the recurring nobles wanting stuff. There is also a lack in variety in regard to government and administrative rule, although this might be fixed with the next DLC, Wealth of nations. The grand strategy aspect is although perfect in this title and if you like the feeling of ruling an empire of any kind, this is clearly the game for you.			"

												GREAT GAME but do NOT buy it YET.Wait for developers stop messing with updates. Then buy the game in pack with all working DLCs. And it still should work on Linux. (I plan to change my vote then.)I decided to write this warning after todays update that broke access to existing savegames and disabled some DLCs. True story - check forums. I am not angry as I lost only 25 hrs of playing and I have just few DLCs. But I feel pity for people who lost hundreds of hours and spent a lot of money on the game.BTW: suggested downgrade to old version seems not to be a perfect solution. My downgraded game just crashes.Before you astroturfers decide blowing some s2t on me be aware that I am fan of Paradox games since the very first EU.			"

												It is with pain in my heart I hit the ""do not recommend"" button. I absolutely love this game, but the most recent update broke it. The default base game is no longer playable. The new technology system introduced in 1.18 practically depends on having the Common Sense DLC. Without it, you can wait hundreds of years to get the institutions spreading to your location if you happen to be outside of Europe. DLCs used to be cool addons that were really nice to have, but you didnt _need_ them to have a functional game. But with the advent of Common Sense, ever more ""essential"" features are in the DLC, and now with 1.18 the base game is just unplayable without it. I understand that Paradox needs to earn money somehow, and the development poored into this game is definitely laudable. But to advertize the game as something that can be played by itself? That's just pure deception at this point. New players will have to shelf out €100+ to get it to a workable state.  "

 Extremely addicting, extremely fun, but with a hefty price. While not on sale the game and all of the core DLC will currently run you 154.91 USD and much, much more if you decide to pick up all of the additional content packs. That being said, I’m going to give you my opinion of the DLC system they’ve chosen for this game.  If you want an opinion on just the game, you will not find that here, go read someone elses review for that, however, this is still an important read as the game is worthless without the DLC. New Content:  The game has grown significantly since it’s release, the game is much, much better and more complex than it was then.  This is part of the reason that the game has been kept so alive as well, if you’re finally getting bored of the game, they drop new features on you and you feel like you’re playing through a whole new experience.  Yet, there is a con to this, and that is when you're going for achievements, there's many that because of the changes to the game are much more difficult to unlock than they were before. Free Content:  Every DLC, free content in a patch is dropped alongside it.  This one SHOULD be an argument for the DLC rather than against, but sadly it cannot be.  While you are locked out of DLC features, the AI in your game is not, adding a disadvantage and annoyance to the game.  On top of that, sometimes features are essentailly replaced with a new paid feature, meaing sometimes you are essentially locked out of the ability to do things that you could before. Content Packs:  This part is pretty BS, so when they drop a DLC instead of dropping the content packs as part of the DLC, they charge you separately at a pretty large price, now this isn’t as bull as the Total War franchise as this does not lock you out of playing as any countries and this stuff is a hundred percent aesthetic.  Also, you can download mods to do the same exact thing as the content packs, replacing the look of troops, portraits or adding new music. DLC In Multiplayer:  This feature is great, when you are in a multiplayer game only the host has to own the DLC and then everyone playing in that lobby has access to it.  This means that if you have any friends with all the DLC and plan to play with them, you only need to purchase the base game and that’s it. Still Getting A Bang For Your Buck:  As you’ll see looking through these reviews, lots of people have hundreds or thousands of hours in the game, so even after spending 154.91 USD you still come out positive in a dollar per hour system. Constantly On Sale:  The base game and dlc all go on sale very often, so I’d recommend picking them up then, you can easily cut that 154.91 USD into about 50 USD, however, this still does not excuse the game, as when a new DLC drops you have to wait months if you want to pick it up at a discounted price.I highly recommend this game, especially if you have friends who are into it.  The DLC model is BS, but not enough for me to NOT recommend this game, it does not ruin the game like Total War’s DLC does.			"

												Often produce rushed and overpriced DLC. Milk their communtiy for every penny. This is not just this game, but ever game by Paradox. They produce quality games and have a near monopoly on the historical grand strategy market, but my God, they are the greediest scum of the Earth, worse than the producers of Call of Duty and all of those other AAA games. Worse than EA with their DLCs, as they mass produce them and include things that should be in the base game, and they overprice the living hell out of the DLCs, doing ""pre-purchase"" ""upgrade pack"" items, truly disappointing. Not worth funding.			"

												I have sunk far too many hours into this game for this to be a negative review. That's not to say there are no negatives to this game.First I'd like to state that this game is developed by one of my more favorite game studios: Paradox Development. Paradox makes games such as Crusader Kings 2, Victoria 2, and Hearts of Iron 3 (and soon 4). If you've heard of any of those games and enjoyed them, then I'd strongly recommend looking into this game.The game is an Empire Builder simulation/strategy game. You take on the role of one of the numerous nations that existed in the year 1444 all the way to the napoleon era of 1821, and lead them to glorious world conquest.You are not limited to the boundaries of history, because one you hit start the game starts diverting from history. You can play as England who starts in a war against France in the later stages of the Hundred Years War. Defy history and win it, usurping the French throne and merging England and France into one massive European super power. Unify the Holy Roman Empire into one single entity; no longer burdened by the decentralized german states and stand strong against any potential French emperor. Play as the Byzantines, last of the Roman Empire; stand strong against the Turkish aggressors and see them fall to your tactical genius.That's not to say you are limited to Europe. Nay, the WHOLE WORLD is yours to conquer. From the Aztects in the Americas in the west; to the Chinese and Japanese empires in the east and everything inbetween (Starting from west americas going east in case you thought you were clever and started in the americas and went west directly to Japan).As your nation develops you unlock technologies and ideas which increase your potential in both War and Peace. You discover new forms of governing, such as Absolute Monarchy, to a Constitutional Democracy.The game features a fairly decent trade system, where as goods are produced and streamed down several important trade nodes such as Alexandria and Ragusa to ""End Nodes"" where trade can no longer be pushed down to another node, such as Venice, or Seville. While I much more prefered the Centers of Trade that Europa Universalis 3 had, this will have to suffice.As your game progresses you will get events that will add that more dynamic gameplay so that each playthrough won't be the same. But beware the sky, for when comets fly, the peasants cry, and as much as you try, your stability will die. *cough cough* Anything can happen. You can be in the middle of a bad war, and suddenly the people rally for the war, supplying more manpower and reducing the war exhaust your nation is suffering. Now your newely invigorated nation is ready to reclaim the war. Or you can be suffering a bad economy and a random noble dies, heirless his wealth is inherited by your crown which you can use to pay for improvements that will help you out of this economic pit.In case you are wondering, religion also plays an important role in this game. The Evangelical movement does happen, and you will have to content with heretics and heathens. Religions include the Christian branches such as Catholicism, Protestantism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and the Reformed Church (aka Calvinism). The Islamic branches of Sunni, Shia, and Ibadi. Indian Hinduism, Chinese Confucianism, Japanese Shintoism, and Tibetan Buddhism. I'm sure I missed a few.The Papacy is alive and waiting for your influence.My most favorite parts of this game are the religions and cultures. I love taking the underdog and expanding it to greatness. Did you ever thing Albania would rule the Mediterranean? Or just how far west the Eastern Orthodoxy could spread? That aside, I love some of their diplomatic features, such as Personal Unions in Europe. Essentially one nation's ruler comes in to rule another nation as well, effectivally ruling two nations, or the newely implemented Military Marches (a kind of vassal). There is so much depth to this game and I would highly recommend it.If that wasn't enough, try playing with friends in Multi-player, start a friendly rivalry, or perhaps you want to work together to split the world down the middle.Still not enough? How about the vast amount of mods that are availible because of the active community behind this game. Some overhaul the game to a completely new era, such as back in Alexander the Great's time, or the founding of Rome, or all the way to the present. Some just expand on the base game, adding features only a mod could get away with.If that's not enough, then I have to say the Paradox is among the few Professional Game Developers that actually listen to their consumers. They aren't burdened by companies such as Activision or EA which means that more care is given to it. They are constantly adding new features for free and as DLC.Just as a warning, if you are freaking out about all the DLC. ALL OF THEM are completely OPTIONAL. Pick and choose what you want. There's no reason to buy DLC for areas of the game you don't play in as often. Buy them over time, all at once, or not at all; it's not mandatory. Though if there was one DLC I'd recommend, it would definitely be Art of War.Cheers!			"

												Europa Universalis, whether III or now IV, is my favorite game by a longshot. It's a lot to get into, as it is dauntingly complex, but it is worth it and there are a lot of Let's Plays on YouTube that are great entertainment. One thing, though, which I will admit to people looking to buying it--the Wealth of Nations expansion isn't that spectacular. Honestly, I don't think I've taken advantage of any of its features. But I'm sure there are people who have.			"

												It's difficult to say whether I'd recommend EUIV as it is now or not- especially since I see more of its faults than its good points. Fortunately, as with a lot of Paradox titles, recent updates have been increasingly making the game better than what it originally was. While some changes have been poorly received and needed adjustment later (Paradox's newfound popularity has also come with a much larger number of people only familiar with EUIV and CK2 giving feedback upon yonder forums.) Paradox seems to have found a direction that properly takes (good) player feedback into account, without relying upon it too heavily.It's not quite the game I wanted it to be, with some mechanics changes simplifying the game in a negative way (restoring stability with the push of a button when you have sufficient points is far too simple.) and other EUIII mechanics remaining that are only hurting the current state of the game. (Missions are terribly outdated things which can hardly be said to function in the current state of the game.)Despite all this, it's still a very fun, easy to play game. Perhaps with some more updates (and a few mods...) I'll be able to say EUIV is a masterpiece of a grand strategy game.			"

												I know this game has plenty of fans.  It has incredibly complicated diplomatic and military dynamics that undoubtedly give an intesnely realistic experience to what is fundamentally a war game (think risk on steroids).  If you're willing to invest many, many hours of complete and utter failure in an attempt to learn the intricacies of the game, you'll surely enjoy it.  Unlike every other strategy game I've played there is truly no ""learning"" mode.  There's no option to dial down the difficulty level while you figure out game play.  It's trial by fire, and I hate to admit I spent so many hours on this more out of determination to figure out how not to get crushed than any sense of fun.			"

My hope is that another company comes along with decent and fair DLC policies that will force Paradox to change their greedy ways.  Making a profit is completely valid, but gouging customers with stupid DLC policies is just wrong.Over 30 bucks for an expansion if you want the complete experience...

												Well, where to begin... It's a rather complicated task to explain what this game is to somebody, who never touched any other Paradox Grand Strategy game. It's probably better to begin with most popular tags:- Grand Strategy : Grand - for there's whole world to play with ( both explored and uncolonized ) - several hundreds of provinces with their cultures, taxes, production, trade power, etc. Strategy - well, because it is one. It's Real Time Strategy, pausable by hitting space or by tinkering ""smart pause"" options - game will automatically pause when specified by you or default ""trigger"" events fire (like another country declaring war on you, etc).- Historic : Game covers time period from 1444 to 1821, possibility to start playing any day between. Default ""timemarks"", offered to player are rather historically accurate, with actual leaders in charge of their nations, pre-existing alliances and other diplomatic relations, etc. Amount of research done by Paradox is impressive. But once you start your game and unpause it, weirdest stuff can happen, like AI-controlled Poland taking over Europe, lol.- Simulation : Game engine takes into consideration MASSIVE amount of data and processes it simultaneously ( diplomacy, economics, religion, stability, rebels, trade, research, national ideas, terrain, army commander skill, etc,etc ). What is pleasantly surprising, and frankly - shocking - is how despite having so much information to work with, player is saved from micromanagement by smart UI design ( which only is getting better with updates ). You don't have to babysit every province or army (unless there is serious battle nearing, in which case it's only natural to pay more attention to your soldiers, lol), observe multiple tradenodes or dig into complicated UI for some basic info. Everything you need can be accessed by 1-2 LMB clicks, and UI itself can be easily configured to suit your needs. Gameplay is actually relaxing, once you understand basic concepts.- Sandbox : Because nothing restrict your moves and imagination by handicapping you. You just start a new game, pick a nation ( btw, you can pick ANY nation on map - from giants like France to smallest african tribes) and voila - you are completely free in your actions. IMO best example for this would be playing as Irish lord : you can go ""classic"" way of forming Kingdom of Ireland first, Great Britain - later, or pull off crazy stunts like rushing exploration national ideas, exploring and colonizing Americas way before other European nations and moving your capital there.There is some kind of ""missions"" which you can go after - but nothing MAKES you complete them. They are mostly aimed at ""historically accurate"" playthroughs for those new to that nation\EU4 and are there to hold hands of newbs who are usually shocked by lack of any kind of ""corridor"" they are used to.For those who want to compare EU4 to other games: - Crusader Kings 2 : EU4 is overall more complicated, mostly centered on country simulation instead of that semi-RPG gameplay of CK2. Leaders here are placeholders with 3 basic stats, and you don't get attached to them like you do in CK2 (I still remember my afro-Tzar Putiata of Russia from my 2013 playthrough, lol)- Total War series : It's RTS, less graphooney and combat is calculated in the background, and player has no way to influence the outcome, other than deciding initial army composition, hiring high-skill commander, choosing battles wisely and rushing additional armies into provinces, where battle occurs.It may seem dumb at first, but there are a LOT of charming underwater stones that you HAVE to consider : different optimal army composition that depends on tech group of your nation, your current military technology level, etc; picking right terrain to fight on - countless options.All in all:PROS- Everything stated in ""tags"" part- Huge replayability- Huge amount of content to discover and learn.- Fair DLC policy : they are well worth the money, big part of them gets patched into game for free for everyone else, multiplayer game host can be the only one with all DLCs - game counts everyone who connected as if they had same DLCs as host has.- Almost bugless (unless new DLCs\patches are introduced - even those are fixed pretty quick)- ModsCONS- Tutorial is... lacking. But paradox strategies are well know for that, so it might turn into a feature one day, lol. Seriously, read the wiki or watch letsplays. Learning curve is steep.- It's sometimes hard to establish a good multiplayer game with pub strangers - most are leaving pretty quickly.P.S If you need any guidance on this game - feel free to add me and ask questionsUPDATE 25.11.16Still a solid thumb's up - every DLC they introduced added something significant and fun to play with. This game is as lively as it was on release, and aged really well into fall 2016.			"

												My experience with the Europa Universalis franchise:I started playing Europa Universalis since the 1st version (dam im old -_-') when a friend lend me his copy way before this was on steam (heck, i didnt even know steam back then). The game was basic, but the idea was mindblowing at the time. So when EU2 came out, after i had like 1000h of EU1, i bought the game. There where no major changes, just a tweek here and there on the game mechanics and its AI, but the rendering was still the same. Anyway +3000h coloniziing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out the new world as Portugal (and yes, in the first 2 versions i kinda only played Portugal, well, cuz im portuguese and i just love our history, and guess what, i now study history at the university). Anyway, back in 2007 i read online (on my pc, no smarphones back then) that EU3 was coming out soon, and that looked freaking awsome, for the the 1st time a 3D rendering and huge improvement to the AI, so i was counting the minutes and bought my copy the day it was released in FNAC at the Colombo shopping centre in Lisbon. Oh boy did i waste my life on this game. It wasnt yet needed to have a steam account to play it. Just when i thought it couldnt get any better, EU4 came out. I bought it again, and on CD (but yes i already had steam cuz i played a lot of Football manager, hence i created an account). Anyway, i play mostly offline so im pretty much sure i got over 4000h of this game, but meh, whos counting. I confess that was only in late 2013 that i found out this had an huge multiplayer community (holy ♥♥♥♥ yeah i was living under a rock). So i divide my time now between multiplayer and single player sessions. I love both. A quick overview of the game:In sum, EU4 is a game where you get the world map begining in 1444 spwaning till 1821 (i.e. kinda since the fall of Constantinople till the Liberal turmoil in Europe.) You got all countries that existed in 1444 and each countries with they historical provinces. The countries's borders change depending on the date you choose to start playing and new countries may or not appear on such date in time depending if it did exist or not, and are all historically correct. Then just pick a country and start managing all matters of state, economy, territorial, diplomacy, army, navy, etc. The game mechanic may seem difficult at start but trust me it will grow easy on you. The AI on this game is awsome idc what the haters say, single player at hard level will challange you a lot. The multiplayer mode its all fun specially if you in a lobby with 60 players i.e. 60 countries. If you want to play Portugal, Castille or England and colonize the world and go to Africa, India and Indonesia and build a massive trade empire, do it. If you want to play Austria and form the HRE, do it. If you want France and blob everyone, do it. If you want to play Brandenburg and form Prussia, do it. Theres arround 200 countries, and you can play them all. The sky is the limit with Europa Universalis 4.Warning:Dont play this game without all the DLCs. The game grew like 100000% since its vanilla. Ill keep paying gladly for the DLCs, cuz i prefer to have an active game being developed then having a new game being released every 2 years with little improvement.9.5/10			"

												   Quite possibly my favorite strategy game of all time. You pick a nation from any time between the 15th century to the 19th and play as them, making allies, fighting wars, discovering the Americas, whatever you choose. Although it sacrifices some of the complexity of it's older sibling, Crusader Kings II, it manages to improve gameplay all across the board, at the heart of which is the flexible negotiations, where you can not only choose what to win or lose when settling a peace depending on who has been winning the war, but you can also negotiate separate truces with any secondary members of the war, letting them go easy to weaken your main enemy or crushing them one by one and making them rue the day they ever dared challenge you. And the best part? There is a free demo.			"

I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't like to have the ability to actually control battles that occur like in Total War, but this is far more detailed when it comes to governing and economics. If you are someone who likes sliders, micromanagement and, of course, world-domination, then this is the game for you!			"

What is pleasantly surprising, and frankly - shocking - is how despite having so much information to work with, player is saved from micromanagement by smart UI design ( which only is getting better with updates ). You don't have to babysit every province or army (unless there is serious battle nearing, in which case it's only natural to pay more attention to your soldiers, lol), observe multiple tradenodes or dig into complicated UI for some basic info. Everything you need can be accessed by 1-2 LMB clicks, and UI itself can be easily configured to suit your needs. Gameplay is actually relaxing, once you understand basic concepts.- Sandbox : Because nothing restrict your moves and imagination by handicapping you. You just start a new game, pick a nation ( btw, you can pick ANY nation on map - from giants like France to smallest african tribes) and voila - you are completely free in your actions. IMO best example for this would be playing as Irish lord : you can go ""classic"" way of forming Kingdom of Ireland first, Great Britain - later, or pull off crazy stunts like rushing exploration national ideas, exploring and colonizing Americas way before other European nations and moving your capital there.There is some kind of ""missions"" which you can go after - but nothing MAKES you complete them. They are mostly aimed at ""historically accurate"" playthroughs for those new to that nation\EU4 and are there to hold hands of newbs who are usually shocked by lack of any kind of ""corridor"" they are used to.For those who want to compare EU4 to other games: - Crusader Kings 2 : EU4 is overall more complicated, mostly centered on country simulation instead of that semi-RPG gameplay of CK2. Leaders here are placeholders with 3 basic stats, and you don't get attached to them like you do in CK2 (I still remember my afro-Tzar Putiata of Russia from my 2013 playthrough, lol)- Total War series : It's RTS, less graphooney and combat is calculated in the background, and player has no way to influence the outcome, other than deciding initial army composition, hiring high-skill commander, choosing battles wisely and rushing additional armies into provinces, where battle occurs.It may seem dumb at first, but there are a LOT of charming underwater stones that you HAVE to consider : different optimal army composition that depends on tech group of your nation, your current military technology level, etc; picking right terrain to fight on - countless options.All in all:PROS- Everything stated in ""tags"" part- Huge replayability- Huge amount of content to discover and learn.- Fair DLC policy : they are well worth the money, big part of them gets patched into game for free for everyone else, multiplayer game host can be the only one with all DLCs - game counts everyone who connected as if they had same DLCs as host has.- Almost bugless (unless new DLCs\patches are introduced - even those are fixed pretty quick)- ModsCONS- Tutorial is... lacking. But paradox strategies are well know for that, so it might turn into a feature one day, lol. Seriously, read the wiki or watch letsplays. Learning curve is steep.- It's sometimes hard to establish a good multiplayer game with pub strangers - most are leaving pretty quickly.P.S If you need any guidance on this game - feel free to add me and ask questionsUPDATE 25.11.16Still a solid thumb's up - every DLC they introduced added something significant and fun to play with. This game is as lively as it was on release, and aged really well into fall 2016.			"

												   Quite possibly my favorite strategy game of all time. You pick a nation from any time between the 15th century to the 19th and play as them, making allies, fighting wars, discovering the Americas, whatever you choose. Although it sacrifices some of the complexity of it's older sibling, Crusader Kings II, it manages to improve gameplay all across the board, at the heart of which is the flexible negotiations, where you can not only choose what to win or lose when settling a peace depending on who has been winning the war, but you can also negotiate separate truces with any secondary members of the war, letting them go easy to weaken your main enemy or crushing them one by one and making them rue the day they ever dared challenge you. And the best part? There is a free demo.			"

												You are the King/Queen/Parician/Doge/Empoerer/Empress/Chief/Sultan of any nation that existed as a soveign state inbetween the years of 1444-1821. Be it the Ottoman Empire, or the start of the Austrian Empire, the world is in your hands the moment you start off. There are no limits to potential ambitions and goals, and achievements give you some good starting(and also very hard) goals for you to try out in your spare time. Restore the Roman Empire from the remnants of the once great Byzantines, barely holding onto Constantinople itself. Restore Danish Hegemony over the Baltic by defeating Sweden. Create an Albanian empire in the Balkans. Form an Iroquious Confederacy controlling all of Eastern North America. Unite Japan and take the pacific as your birthright.There are no limits to the possabilities this game brings to the table if you like history, or just strategy gameplay in general. Managing a global empire is no easy task, however. Colonies will want freedom, trade companies will exploit the native population, and soon... Perhaps even a revolution from the inside of your own capital?Pros:- Massive replayability with hundreds of potential nations.- Most of earth at your grasp.- Many potential routes to take, from conquest to diplomacy to trade.- Theres a gothic nation in the Crimea, CONQUER THE WORLD AS THE LAST GOTHIC PEOPLE!- Actually good multiplayer support.- EXTREAMLY GOOD MODDING COMMUNITY!Cons:- Steep heftly learning curve that can take hours, sometimes day to get through.- No one wants to hear about you conquering Russia as the goths.- Sweden is not overpowered.

												Before you read this review you should know that it is written by a ""seasoned"" player, and that the changes I mention here as bad, wont be noticeable by new players. Also this is more of a review of patch  1.13.0.0 I loved this game. I really did.Because once upon a time I could have fun conquering the world, making huge trade-based empires.No more.Now all I get is patch (as if it fixes♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1.13.0.0, which just ruins the game and everything it used to be.The patch adds:  Forts! And their ""zone of control"". First of all the AI doesnt give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about your forts, just wading right through them, when you, as a player, have to traverse half of ♥♥♥♥ing Europe to get to the province next door. ( Zone of control is also broken by military access. Which is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid !!!)  Development! Taking out the building system of old, and replacing it with broken♥♥♥♥♥development system, that you can't ♥♥♥♥ing use unless you buy the ridiculously overpriced DLC, ironically named Common Sense...  Manpower revamped! Now your pretty little manpower pool will deplete even faster! This is actually okay and maybe even balancing, but not when you lose 10.000 manpower sieging one ♥♥♥♥ing fort, to simply realise that the army you've now been persuing for 2 ♥♥♥♥ing years is not reachable. Not after this fort even.  Because the AI just built another adjacent fort while you were sieging the original one.	   Forcing you to siege this one too. ARE YOU KIDDING ME PARADOX  So much overpriced DLC essentially ruining what use to be your perfect game.EUIV has for me, become more of a rage quit simulator than a grand strategy game. I hope that I'll be able to play it consistently in the future, without getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed by cheating AI.I would rate this patch  1/10. Sorry for long post but no ♥♥♥♥ing potato here. "

												EU4 has turned out to be the best strategy game I have ever played.  Just a warning, the learning curve is massive.  If you think Sim City or Civilization is difficult to learn, you should not play EU4.  The game is not much in the way of graphical showcasing, but it makes up for that with the thousands of real-time modifiers happening in the world.  Strategy really matters in this game and there is a very active forum & wiki community to help figure out what you might not notice (did i metion thousands of modifiers?).  The developers are also active in the community and have been releasing DLCs and patches to evolve the game as the player base becomes more 'intellegent'.  The Multiplayer community can be hit or miss, since it takes a lot of dedication and time to get a game to the finish of 1821. The game is inifinitely more fun in multiplayer since the AI is predictable after a while.			"

												I have loved EU IV, but I find it a chore to keep up to date - staying engaged with the community and playing on the same version carries a very high price tag.It's impossible to recommend this game to anyone who has not already picked it up, and as time goes by, PDS has been delivering complexity rather than depth on DLC with prices that exceed the cost of the base game. For anyone considering this purchase, be prepared for a difficult and expensive learning phase, which you may not find very satisfying if you've not been around for the long journey since release.

												Mixed feeling about this one. Great mix between strategy game and politics but it's borderline unplayable unless you bought most of the expansion pack. If you bought this vanilla, set it to the older versions because some of the contents are locked in DLCs. In the older versions most of the time these will happen, Austria will dominate the central europe while being a♥♥♥♥♥♥to other HRE members with no repercussions, Netherlands will keep failing to form, Burgundy will always get inherited, England will always lose the 100 years war.NOTE:The developer's DLCs practices are also detestable. They gave us ""free updates"" but in reality they are just going to break the game unless you ""fix"" it by buying the new expansion pack. Oh and by the way the expansion pack doesn't come with units and/or music you have to buy them separately.			"

												This game used to be good. Since release, Paradox have unleashed a torrent of DLC's and by this point I'd say you're missing out on a good chunk of the game if you haven't paid for most of them. The online system was great and a massive improvement over EUIII but then they cocked it up and instead of fixing it, you now have to restart your game like the old days whenever you exit to menu from a session. About the worst thing they've done is simply sapping the fun out of the experience. With every patch the developers basically throw out a big middle finger to the community and make the game more tedious to play. Blobbing is fun. Gamey mechanics are fun. Whacky situations are fun. Paradox doesn't seem to understand this because every update makes this game more tedious and streamlined than it already was.TL;DR - Paradox is doing their level best to make EUIV feel less and less like a video game despite the fact that is exactly what it is.

												Today I loaded up one of my old favorite games, Europa Universalis, I played for a while, realizing I can no longer build an actual empire, I am forced to crawl like a ♥♥♥♥ing snail while a single developed province (120 for undeveloped) costs 250 admin points (with dlc of course its required). I read online about it and the head AI developer Wiz said this, ""To expound on my reply from yesterday, coring costs have gone up somewhere around 40% compared to 1.11 (more for dipannexation) because we wanted to create some more interesting dynamics where conquering everything around you was not necessarily always the best option.""I don't know what planet you come from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but this is a WORLD CONQUERING game, nobody plays this game for it's rich backstory or to have fun ruling a little baby nation, the entire point of the ♥♥♥♥ing game is to conquer.""It is still both possible and rewarding to expand, particularly if you take the right ideas, put money into advisors and use a mix of conquest and diploannexing. As Milan, I was able to unify most of Italy (more than twice starting development of France) in under a century without any core cost reduction, and could easily have done so faster. Growth is slower but it's certainly not 'blobbing now pointless'.""That's funny because Milan just so happens to get these ideas.+10% Infantry combat ability+1 Diplomatic relations−10% Idea cost−10% Development cost−25% Mercenary maintenance−5% Technology cost−10% Stability cost modifier+20% National manpower modifierThat's right folks, if you want to conquer you have to select nations that give you reduced technology cost, better soldiers, AND administrative ideas.It really pisses me off that they keep ruining what was once a perfect game, the game in it's current form is garbage and if you want to play it, do yourself a favor and roll back a few patches.OLD REVIEW Shameless moneywhoring is now a common thing in today's video game industry.And just because I previously PU'd Paradox does not make them unsusceptible to retribution for their crimes.Common Sense It's an omen! -1 stability.

												Without a doubt the best game I've ever played. I didn't know how good gaming could be until I bought EU4. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the absolute highest I'd rank this game at least a 15. Yes. It's that good.It has by far the steepest learning curve of any video game I've ever played, or any cognitive task I've ever done for that matter. I've played about 730 hours and I'm still learning new things about the game each time I play. So I'd recommend downloading the free Demo first to make sure you like it. The first 150 - 200 hours were a stressful process of learning the most basic game mechanics. From 200 - 650 hours I knew my way around the game enough to earn achievements if everything went well. After 650 hours I feel like I really started to know my way around the game.			"

												I don't usually feel the need to write a negative review, but after looking at the long list of dlcs on these games I'd like to vent on this one.....well, Paradox generally actually.I love historical games, love strategy games.  I've read endless praise about all of Paradox's games since the first EU.  As a result I have bought countless Paradox titles and played them for tens of hours trying to get what people like about them.  I still don't get it.  I find all the titles very similar...a map, lots of statistics, arcane calculations to simulate real events which never exceed the excitement of watching a slideshow.I understand different people like different kinds of games and I wouldn't feel the need to share my opinion normally.  But when I see the appalling dlc policy of drip feeding their fans tiny upgrades for premium prices I think I should warn others, so they don't end up wasting their money like I did.  If I want to play their games again I'm confrionted with 100s of dollars of 'essential' dlcs that make me feel that I only possess a demo of the game.  The early games were sensibly priced and worth the time investment.  These latest rip off installments should be avoided by all but the die-hard Paradox fans.			"

												This is a great game, but if you want to have the best experience, have all the latest patches, actual improvements to the game, you need all these expansions...Come on Paradox, everyone needs money to survive, right? We don't wanna pay worthless DLC's just to make the game play a little better. The base game? I got tired of it after 250+ hours on this game. Every Paradox game gets boring eventually.The base game is just getting worse and worse. I think an Expansion means expanding a game, not just that, but improving the game with patches just to make the base game worse for those who cannot afford all expansions. (They all cost more than the game itself!)Not to mention that ALL the DLC's cost 250 euro. Frightening. Absolutely.Not to mention yet again that most of these mechanics from the expansions must be also implemented in the base game,  also obviously the patches. i.e, the estate mechanism. Paywalls just to catch on with the game is a joke. Enjoy beating up France as Ulm.			"

												One of the leaders of Grand Strategy Games genre. You must guide your nation of choice to world dominance through conquest, diplomacy and colonization. Controls are pleasantly abstracted - for example, when you dicover a new kind of military unit, you can upgrade all your armies with 1 click. There's little to none micro managment, you can devise your sophisticated plot and relax in your chair as you can setup a full scale invasion with just a few clicks. Game is visually appealing, though, in my opinion, EU would look better with 2D graphics (instead of full 3d).There's only one thing that i really dislike about this game - the combat resolution. It has very sophisticated algorithm with dozens of parameters. It's very vague and as a player you have absolutely no idea what the hell is happening unless you invest an ~hour of researching on the internets.All in all EU4 is one of the top games in its genre. It's equally good for people who love Grand Strategies and as an entry point for people who are curious about the genre and want to try it. 9/10 would buy to rule the world.			"

												Madly addictive, interesting and intricate. Infuriating at the same time, when larger kingdoms wipe out your army in an instant and then without restraint lay seige to your whole country. This dispair is offset by the complete joy of colonizing new lands and investing in more and more advanced societies and technology. A great insight into the time of it's setting. Promising to be far less frustrating when the 'Art of War' expansion comes out. Should be less instances of your supposed allies, sitting there watching you get demolished by your enemies before being defeated themselves...Visuals/Audio 3/5Optimisation/Quality 4/5Replayability 5/5Value for Money 3/5Immersion/Fun 4/5OVERALL 4/5			"

												Taking what Europa Universalis III did right and making it better, EUIV has become an intense struggle to build a vast empire in any area across Earth. Want to construct a grand African nation to fight off potenital European colonizers? How about founding a vast Venetian trade empire, capable of supplying arms to rebels of your enemies? Want to restore the Roman Empire to its former glory and repair the schism of the church? Perhaps you're interesting in colonizing and exploiting the Americas as much as possible? Maybe there's a chance of China forming a large army and marching on their enemies in India and Europe?Then do it.That's how intricate and complex (or simple, if you like it that way) this game can get. If you like Grand Strategy games and have an interest in history, this game is for you. No doubt about it.			"

If you own both games and have the CK2-EU4 converter, you can now lead your empire for almost a millennium!Back in EU4, you can once again choose from hundreds of historical nations around the world.  From the start, you will work to lead your country through history.  You can begin in the New World and try to fight off the European invaders, try to unite Japan or keep the Ottoman empire from falling apart.  This grand strategy game is a must if you enjoy trying to change the course of history. "

												While I definitely wouldn't reccomend this when it was released, it's actually a good game now. Unfortunately, Paradox are money grabbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and you need DLC for it to be enjoyable, so I would only buy this when it's on sale. Here's some opinions on different aspects of the game:Warfare: The AI is way too eagre to take attrition. I'm talking about 20k soldiers sitting on a fort which needs 6k to cap. I'm talking about 30k sitting on their 25k supply capital. The AI loves to sit around doing ♥♥♥♥ all while their army dies. Now, it's been about 2 and a half weeks since the last DLC, so I'd expect the game to be pretty playable right now, but you can observe your allies being utterly useful a lot of the time. You may think this doesn't matter if you're reading this review a while in the future, but just be warned that when Paradox releases a DLC, the game is usually broken and will be quite buggy for weeks.Economy and Colonisation: The whole ""trade flow"" thing is great, and helps bring more meaning to colonisation through bringing tons of American and Asian goods to European markets for sweet sweet ducats. However, it also limits your expansion to specific regions, which makes the game slightly railroady when it comes to colonisation, if you care about being cash-efficient. Playing Spain or Portugal? North America is completely pointless to colonize, at least in terms of trade. You're trying to colonize as somebody who didn't historically colonize, perhaps someone in North Germany? You can colonize Canada and that's pretty much it. Really though, trade flow should be less restrictive. Especially when you consider the way treasure fleets work - if Spain colonized, let's say, Canada, and found gold there, would it be impossible for them to transport that gold back to Spain? No. But is it impossible in game? Yes.Monarch Points: Until Common Sense, monarch points, or 'mana' was my biggest issue with the game. Now that you can create buildings without it, I'm less inclined to curse Johan's name for this stupid concept. However, it's still needlessly restrictive. Why should inventing technology and assaulting a fort use the same resource? Why should I not be able to offer a peace treaty, simply because I hired a new Admiral? Come on Paradox, out with the Führer mana, in with some more common sense.Despite all this, it's still a really fun game. If you're interested in building an empire, or rewriting history, I would reccomend this, but only if it's on sale.			"

												This Game is Great, it is one of the best strategy games ever.There is just this one thing... They make an update about every month (or so) and it always completely destroys the game. It makes the game completely unplayable after that and you almost have to buy the latest DLC cause otherwise it is just completely unplayable... and they are not cheap...In addition to that, an update ALWAYS brakes your saved games and you have to stard a new one. If you put 50h gameplay into that it is all just gone, just wasted time. If you almost reached and (almost) impossible Achievement it is really annoying, because it was all for nothing.This could be a really nice game and the updates are the only thing that are not good, but this makes the game so annoying cause you notice that you wasted another 50h or so to a save game that is not playable any longer... and it just ♥♥♥♥es me up			"

I can now say after playing 80 hours, EU4 is just as fun as EU3 and is so much easier to learn.

I highly reccommend this game to anybody who likes strategy games just be warned, If you're a Total War fan or a Civ fan those games will never be the same after playing EU4.EDIT: Those 80 hours were only spent playing as three different factions (western countries at that).

												My first experience of Europa Universalis IV was a mixed experience. I bought the game on the advice of a friend, and played a multiplayer game with him. I picked the Ottoman Empire -- as the game recommended -- and proceeded to build what I thought was a decent empire primarily through militarism. I swept through eastern Europe and western Asia with ease and controlled everything from the east of Poland to the west of India.As the game progressed, however, I began to lose control of my land to the newly formed Russia and to Poland. It turned out that, because I hadn't understood the game, I hadn't kept my military tech up to date or westernized. I love depth in games, but the frustration of losing large parts of my empire before the game's end because of a misunderstanding of priorities put me off, and I shelved the game for a while.Later on, in one of my periods of watching a lot of ""Let's Play"" videos, I found someone playing Europa Universalis IV and began to understand the things I had done wrong. I ended up watching the entire (40-odd part) Let's Play and learning a lot about the game, which gave me an itch to pick it back up and try it again. I'm glad I did. This game is incredible.The war system is one of the most well-designed that I have ever seen. Generals give bonuses based on their statistics, based on whether you're attacking or defending. The system requires a good balance of infantry, cavalry and artillery to get the best out of your conflicts. You have to move your troops in reasonably sized platoons to avoid attrition losses in hostile terrain.Wars have to be justified, either based on a(n often fabricated) claim to the territory being invaded, religious differences, trade disputes or a myriad of other reasons. You'll want to forge strategic alliances in order to take down common foes, but be wary of making your future adversaries too powerful, as they will often decide when they share a border with you to do the same to you as the two of you just did to your common foe.The leader system is one of the weaker points. Research is highly dependent on your leader, and quite often you'll go through a period of intense frustration as your king dies leaving behind an heir who contributes little or nothing to the progress of the country. I'm not sure why the leader (which is entirely random) has such a great influence on research, which I would imagine has far more to do with scholars than with kings.Religion and trade have great influence, which is an accurate reflection of the time period. The trade system is very detailed, and even after 200 hours in the game, I'm still learning new things about how best to run my trade routes. From dealing with pirates, to controlling ports, to the decision between free trade and protectionism, trade is a highly important and complex part of the game.You can improve your territories with all kinds of different buildings and defenses, each of which provide strategic bonuses but cost points which could otherwise be spent on technological increases. There is a fine balance to be had between improving your nation's administrative, diplomatic & military tech levels and trying to meet the other needs of the nation i.e. improvements, adequate defense and diplomacy.I have conquered southeast Asia as Korea, run a global trading & colonial empire as Venice, conquered Western Europe as Pomerania and successfully defended south America from the paleskinned invaders as the Aztecs. There are so many playstyles and options in EUIV, every game plays differently (though France always becomes a behemoth if you let them). Yes, the DLC is expensive, but you will get literally hundreds of hours of gameplay out of the game when you add it.If I have one major issue with the game, it's when I imagine how many people play a game like I did, and then put the game down for good. Paradox should put some serious research into how to improve the learning curve of the game, because it would dramatically improve player retention and help a lot of people to experience a brilliant game. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy games, and is prepared to put in the time to learn its deep and intricate systems.			"

												Nope nope. Great game, but it has not any sense to play it on steam ;). There are patches made for DLC-full game, that are changing rules of game, so if you don't have money when they want, the game will be incoplete, SI will have dlc bonuses (you don't till you buy it) and so on. All dlc's now are together at price of 250e+. And DLC are really small, and some of them are just thievery(unit packs for 5e or really bad metal music (wtf)). I think that in 2025 there will be complete edition, and then it becomes playable on original edition.

												I used to love paradox and its games however  the latest  patch made it so that now ther are severe limits on what and where you can play  due to the develpoment mechanic that nerfs building and taxes etc for non EU nations unless you buy the latest DLC with the develpment mechanic. You could say that now the once complete vanilla is not complete then combine this with the high price of the game and its expansions and I find myself no longer able to reommened this game,			"

												A really fun and rich idea for a game ruined by extremely over-priced DLC that gates off most of the gameplay features any ethical company would include in their games as updates.It seems to me like all Paradox do is re-hash their games and peg on as many features as they can as DLC to milk grand strategy fans for all they can.Don't bother unless you have several hundred dollars to sink on the DLC as well. The base game is boring and very limited in scope.Oh yeah and the AI cheats which makes most wars frustrating instead of challenging.			"

												While the game has given me several hundred hours of enjoyment, and it still has the fun of taking a one provence minor and making them the most feared power in the world, I wouldn't recommend this game. Lots of small annoying changes from EU3, like the monarch points system and inabilty to control the advisors you get, make the game feel very irritating to someone familiar with older Paradox grand strategy games. I would whole heartedly recommened EU3 or CK2 over this game, at least in its vanilla state, for more enjoyable times. Also the multiplayer while adding at interesting human element to the game, can tend to move VERY slowly as you are forced to play on a slow speed and there is much less mirco, or small things, that need to be done in this game.

												This is a really fun grand strategy game. I played the first two games in the series, they were good. (Until patch 1.08 wrecked EU II, ""Because of multiplayer, we are going to ..."" RUIN THE GAME!)Anyway, this is a lot of fun. However, there are a few things about the game that are frustrating:The Game Punishes Good PlaySeriously. The better you do in the game the more harsh the events are. Trying to save 500 coins to construct a neat building? When you get to 400 an Event will hit you taking away 300. Win a war in the early game and get 16 points of Prestige? You WILL get an Event taking away 10 of them. ALWAYS. EVERY EARLY WAR. EVERY GAME. There are other Bad events as well.  These events are so HARSH it makes the game frustrating. The Good events seem far minimal in what you get. When you actually get a decent event.Weird AlliancesLike France allying with Ottomans so Turkish armies are running around near Paris. Really? WEIRD. InstitutionsThese make technology gains harder, but the Ottomans and the AI never seem to have problems getting the advances. I played Burgundy in a game, and I had two Institutions START in my country and I was still last to embrace them. They are alright but wow, what a money sink.ScoreI wish they would just delete this. Some countries always get a lot of points for score, such as France and Ottomans. Other countries have a really hard time to get score. For example, one of the ways to get score points is to have a large Navy. Really? How do land-locked nations compete? In EVERY game, France and especially the Ottomanss run away with the points, forcing the player to attack both countires just to knock them down. This is plain DUMB.Junky Kings Will Not DieThey live until 70 when you have a really good heir. I hate this.AchievementsYou cannot get them unless you play on ironman. Stupid. Also, many of the achievements are just plain silly.Recruiting LeadersSo, you invest in an Idea to increase Army Tradition? Your Army Traditino is 40+? When you recruit a General you eill still get one with 2 pips (lousy leaders). Meanwhile, with almost no Army Tradition, the AI gets leaders with 10+ pips. I HATE RANDOM ROLLS FOR THIS!Decimal PlacesI really wish they would change everything to whole numbers.I still like the game but I seriously hope Paradox redesigns some of these issues.			"

Posted: April 8, 2016
												I love the game. In my opinion the game is one of the best strategy games of all time.Gameplaywise it is quite unique. I still can't recommend buying it...____________________________________________ DLC:Yes, I know that this is a review for the base game. However I think it is important to know about dlc and dlc-politics before buying a game.  important note:	Till now  8 major dlcs have been released for the game. Those dlcs are usually accompanied by a patch, which brings changes for everyone. But if u want to have access to all possible gameplay elements, if you dont want to stumble accross something like 'need to own XXX dlc to YYY', if you want the game to feel truly complete, you will have to buy atleast those (debatable). All other dlcs solely add new music and unit modells to the game, which do NOT influence gameplay. See eu4wiki for details.Allthough the release of a new dlc every few months means that the game gets more content,it has its downsides besides the need of cash: Bugs and unbalance. Usually every major dlc brings new gameplay mechanics or radical changes. With them bugs come; the new mechanics are rarely balanced. Therefore one or two hotfixes follow every patch. Which can give you the feeling of having bought something incomplete or not fully tested. Savegames. Whenever (or mostly) new dlc is released you will have to take special actions, if you want to continue a game and not start over again. You probably will have to do this before starting the game, otherwise your savefiles will be corrupted and your savegames will be lost. It will NOT matter, if you buy the new dlc or not, because the patch that accompanies the dlc will break the savefiles. A single run in this game takes many hours, therefore this is very important to know. features. Be aware that features added in dlc, may later be changed, moved to available for all or even completely removed.____________________________________________ What kind of game it is? The game itself is a sandboxy grand strategy wargame set between 1444 and 1821. Your job is to take over the role of the ruler/rulers of one of the countless nations of that time period and lead said nation to glory. Besides 'glory' there is no fixed goal. You choose your own goal. You can play as Spain and explore and conquer the (or a random (dlc required)) new world. You can play as China and colonize America or conquer Asia. You can play as Austria and reform the Holy Roman Empire into one state. In case you are good enough, you can even conquer the whole world. The choice is yours! pro:  overall deep and interessting gameplay nearly infinite amounts of content and not completeable game (or atleast thousads of hours) sandbox game interessting period contra:  very difficult to learn for new players gameplay mechanics are not always explained in the game and tooltips are often misleading or wrong ai gets bonuses (more diplomats, more money, ...) ai sometimes behaves unforseeable or just weird (allies may 'betray' you without any warning) bugs stay around for a long time while constantly new bugs turn up and others get fixed savegames get corrupted by patches/are incompatible with new patches multiplayer (unstable). Many players seem to have problems with connection in mp. luck based. For example there are random events throughout the game. While many of them add flavor to certain nations, they are all random and you can get screwed by them. Battles partly include luck. The Gameplay is considerable poorer in times of peace. Which is a problem, because bad luck (for example with events) can force you to stay at peace for a long time.(Dlc can be viewed as good or bad based on what I wrote before.)At this moment I have played the game for nearly 1000 hours and will most likely still play it for hundreds of hours. Like I said in the beginning I love it. I bought all of the major dlc at or close to realease, except the latest (Mare Nostrum, out 3 days, I will probably buy it at some point). Which means I spent about 140€. At this point, after almost 2 and a half year, this game feels like an early access title.That feeling and the sum led me to the insight that i can NOT recommend buying the game, allthough I love it and buying dlc now or at sale would be way cheaper. Sure it is possible to enjoy the base game, but it will feel incomplete.There is literally no other game where I could tolerate said things.			"

												At the behest of a friend, I decided to pick up Europa Universalis IV. I had never played it and did not know anything about the game when I grabbed it as part of a humble bundle deal. I assumed from the title, as well as the cover photo's of the game, it would be much like Civilization or Tropico, with a historical slant. What I found is, Europa Universalis IV has much more in common with Crusader Kings. You build up your territories, similar to the way you would in Civ, but you are given the opportunity to micro-manage your country, down to the last detail of what religion they will be. The array of starting countries is not limited to Europe and Asia, you can even start out as a Native American tribe in the yet to be discovered, ""New World"". Europa Universalis IV, can be unforgiving to the novice, and it can easily be turned into a numbers game, so it may not be for everyone. Having tried it even though it is not my typical genre, I enjoyed it and might give it another shot some time. Until then I can only say, if this sounds like the type of game you enjoy, then you should really like Europa Universalis IV.			"

												I would love to be able to play an actual updated version of this game. However I really dislike Paradox's handling of there game prices. If they had a similar approach as Civ5 does, actually making there game affordable for most people, they would get a lot more sales. I would not drop over 100$ for a game starting out, trying to play vanilla is also discouraging as its old, outdated and sucks compared to what recent gameplays are. This goes for Crusader Kings 2 and Hearts of Iron 3... would love to get into them, but they are not worth over 100$.			"

												I won't comment many negative things Paradox has been done as they are already covered by others. Before my main point I'll just say that music is worse than in EU III. There are several really epic songs but that's it compared to EU III which almost whole OST is fantastic. There is absurd rebel mechanics!!! If you don't play Ironman (say good bye to achievements), they are managable like everything else as you can reload. Do you play Ironman? F#ck this s#it! - rebels are the strongest faction in game- one province spawn rebel army as big as your (you have 5+ provinces)- and their leader is always Napoleon reborn- and if they are in mountain, even the twice bigger army can't defeat them- what is completely outrages is they don't suffer from the lack of man power!!! WTF?!- they spawn with perfect morale and their maintance is 0 gold!- for the most factions in the game, it's the game over when it happenLet me describe how it works in the real game. I played as Bavaria, crushed 7k army of Salzburg and annexed it. Several years later revolt happened and now they have almost twice bigger army (12k) with insane leader which you can't beat even with 22k army (I even payed 10k mercs just to see how much absurdity goes)! WTF?! It's even more absurd in the New World!EditReformationTypical Protestant propaganda interpretation of history. I'll add more but how the f#ck Reformed can have +2 heretic tolerance? Calvin, Knox, Puritans and iconoclasm just to name few were everything opposite of it.NO REFORMATION IN FRANCE!!! W*F?! Not a single province in France is converted by Protestants or Reformed so no religious war => France is unstopable. AIAI is disgusting. Only good friendly AI is France, they know how to fight and will actually help you in the war. NEVER play in Ironman mode because there is no back! No achievements? They can be easily unlocked by SAM. I mean there is no shame in doing this. Shame on Paradox when your ""allies"" are those who completely ruin your game and you can't reload so you have to abandon your 30+ hours save. Who needs enemies when you have AI friends. SuccessionCan I play a game where my heir doesn't die in hunting accident when my ruler is 60+ years old and that happen at least once in 100 years so I lose my dinasty?Poland-Lithuania CommonwealthIt's just disgusting how much OP is and it's completely ahistorical! Those historicaly dirty poor provinces in Ruthenia are one of the most developed in the game WTF joke is this.Unlawful territoryHere comes another brain dead mechanics brought by Paradox. You annex HRE province and emperor demands to give it back to previous owner. I can accept that. What I can't is that you declare war on H.R. emperor Austria, you completely destroy him and his allies (100% occupation, they have 0 manpower and troops, lost every possible battle, WE is 20 and rebels are poping out left and right), he cedes one province to you and the next day he demands province back and when you refuse, province get 10 years negative unlawful territory modifier. WTF is this brain dead logic?			"

Definitely something to recommend to younger people, considering it's so easy to get in to the game. No explaining or tutorial required. Conquering the world has never been more relaxing or satisfying, no rage quits guaranteed! This is all made possible because of the intuitive nature of the game.

												If you're like me, a history fanatic with tons of time to kill after the finals, your'e gonna love this game so much that all that you do is playing all day with your breakfast and dinner. It runs pretty well on early 2011 model of MacBook Pro but it occasionally jumps out and I don't know why. The scattered retreat feature is totally ridiculous but besides that it's good. The graphics is one of the best in the games of the same genre, and the music is truly masterpiece. The game mechanics is the most simple one among it's Paradox Brothers so don't be afraid by those overwhelming texts. Personally I learned some Latin with Global geography out of this game and since it doesn't have Chinese version, I feel my English skills have also been blessed. If you're planing to buy some games in Christmas, this game is an ideal choice. And if you're gonna play it, just remember don't invade Russia in winter, or fight Sweden with the same size of army--you need to triple your army and let all of your soldiers tell their mothers that they love them, in both cases.

												This was my first strategy game. When I first started, it was all so confusing. I stared at menus blankly, watched youtube tutorials, played through in-game tutorials. Could this really be the most accessible strategy game Paradox has to offer? Yes; and it's also one of the best expreinces I have ever had in my gaming life. I've spent entire days playing, watching the years go by. How am I going to deal with France? Should I ally Austria? THERE IS NO WAY I'M GETTING INVOLVED IN THAT WAR SCREW YOU AUSTRIA *declines call to arms*. These are some the burning questions I've asked and loud statements I've shouted during my time playing EU4. I played my first game as France. Easiest country in the game bar none. I got better. I played as Venice. Got better. Soon it wasn't about ""winning"" or even doing well, it was about proving to myself that it could be done. Can I form the Netherlands as little Friseland. Yes, I can. Can I beat back the Ottomans as Byzantium? NO, NOT THAT. But through each failure I learned. Through each success I learned. I learned about the time period, I learned how to strategize, I learned how to accept defeat, I learned the joys of winning an impossible war, and I learned that I loved strategy games. Thank you Paradox, and thank you Europa, for teaching me.			"

												EU4 is a very interesting game. I mean, sure, it may take some trial and error to develop an understanding of the game mechanics, but once you can grasp the basic gameplay components, this game is really, really enjoyable, especially when playing with other people. The multiplayer aspect of things makes the longevity of this game that much brighter, since you can make deals and forge alliances with countries that would otherwise never be interested in what you have to say. Even without human interaction, it's an enjoyable experience to stretch your brain to find the logical course of action to increase your influence and power.This game also puts the Grand in Grand Strategy Gaming. The fact that you can play as literally any country in the world is simply mindboggling. Not only that, but you have complete control over every aspect of your country: finances, advisors, military affairs, trade policies and embargoes, royal marriages, claims on other monarchs' thrones, fabricating claims and supporting rebels in rival countries, establishing colonies in Africa, Asia and the Americas...the list is endless. This is also a great example of ""great power, great responsibility"", too, since you have to make every action count in order to avoid setbacks for your nation. Want to go to war? You should look at who that nation's allies are, how powerful they are, how close they are and how many troops they can afford to send. Good foresight can help win this game for any strategist, whether they are rookies or veterans.And another thing, ""winning"" the game. What is ""winning"" the game? Is it establishing diplomatic ties with major powers to bolster your nation's security? Is it colonizing all of South/North America and ousting any foreign competition? Is it taking over all of your main rivals by force and establishing local superiority? That's just it, though: although the game can stretch from 1444 to 1821, the game doesn't always have to be that long. You decide when you've won at any time by setting goals for yourself. It doesn't always have to be about world domination or anything that intensive. You could consider yourself the victor within 50 years if you so desire. Playing as France, I completely wiped out and took over Great Britain through military dominance over England, and vassalizing and diplomatically annexing Scotland and the Irish factions. I then took over the Austrian lands ceded from Burgundy early on, and had them weak enough that they couldn't take me down. At that point, I declared myself the victor, because there wasn't much more I could do besides world domination, steamrolling through Europe and travelling to the Americas, Asia and Africa.Every game is so unique, too; you will never have a game play the same, year-by-year or even day-by-day. That also makes the experience so fresh every single time, and that sense of uncertainty really forces you to take a step back and wait, see what happens first. If everything works out in your favor, that's great. If not, there's still a chance that you will end up with that stroke of luck in maybe five years, or fifty years. Who knows?I would give this game a 9/10, because it's absolutely amazing for what it is, and the epic gameplay mechanics can easily make up for those frustrating moments in your game, or for lag or disconnections in multiplayer, and even then, that's not a very common occurrence (well, the disconnections, anyway). This game is very deserving of a $40 pricetag, and if that's a little too steep, you can always get a good taste of the game from the demo. Hell, I would be willing to pay twice as much if it offered Twitch live streaming integration. But, that's just my own opinion. I can leave you now to try this out on your own.			"

												I spend countless hours clicking away and obsessively checking stats and number crunching to optimize my performance in every possible facet of this game.  Since I started playing this game, I have had no social interaction outside of work, I have skipped at least three meals a week, I haven't cleaned or maintained my home, hell, I'd probably crap my pants if I didn't play on a laptop.  Suffice to say, this game has irrevocably made my life worse since I have discovered it; and that is why it is the best strategy gaame on the market and I don't want a single second back. 10/10, add it to your cart now!

												This game scratched an itch that I didn't know I had. Fantastic game. However, be prepared for a very steep learning curve that includes reading the wiki, watching youtube ""let's play's"", and much trial and error. Also, if you are like me, you'll want to buy all the big and little dlc that they release for the game. If you can afford it, it is worth it. If I divide the total cost of the game by my total hours played, EU4's value is apparent.In conclusion, the positives outweigh the negatives. This is a wholly engrossing and satisfying experience.

												If you're like me, a history fanatic with tons of time to kill after the finals, your'e gonna love this game so much that all that you do is playing all day with your breakfast and dinner. It runs pretty well on early 2011 model of MacBook Pro but it occasionally jumps out and I don't know why. The scattered retreat feature is totally ridiculous but besides that it's good. The graphics is one of the best in the games of the same genre, and the music is truly masterpiece. The game mechanics is the most simple one among it's Paradox Brothers so don't be afraid by those overwhelming texts. Personally I learned some Latin with Global geography out of this game and since it doesn't have Chinese version, I feel my English skills have also been blessed. If you're planing to buy some games in Christmas, this game is an ideal choice. And if you're gonna play it, just remember don't invade Russia in winter, or fight Sweden with the same size of army--you need to triple your army and let all of your soldiers tell their mothers that they love them, in both cases.

												Europa Universalis IV gives the player an immensely fast-paced, low learning curve gameplay experience. Have you every wanted to know what it felt like to be Napoleon, Willem van Oranje or Mary, Queen of Scots? Then this is the game for you! Definitely something to recommend to younger people, considering it's so easy to get in to the game. No explaining or tutorial required. Conquering the world has never been more relaxing or satisfying, no rage quits guaranteed! This is all made possible because of the intuitive nature of the game. Everything just makes sense, it's amazing! What are you waiting for? Play a game of EU4!			"

												This was my first expedition into EU territory, and let me tell you that all the dials, buttons, modifiers and events are rather overwhelming at first. However the game comes with fairly good tutorials but I'd say the two best ways to learn how to fully play EU4 is to watch someone on Youtube like Enter Elysium and to start your first game as a large nation like England or Castille (Spain).To be honest I have played this game for quite a while and still haven't got a full grasp on some of the little details, but I  love playing EU4. It is a notoriously hard game in Iron man mode where you have to live with your decisions and the random number generated events that can help you or kill you, most cases it doesn't help. But don't let me put you off because it is so rewarding when a gamble pays big dividends. Some day I would like to play as a one or two province minor and survive however that is a long way away but I can still dream.Seriously good game if you like your grand strategy really grand!			"

												This game is an extremely good game once you get use to it. I highly recommend that you do the tutorials first, the game can be very confusing and complex, time is essential to succeeding and creating your empire. With over 100 hours of playing, I'm still not the best at the game, it takes time to finally figure things out. So I only recommend this if you're willing to be confused for a while until you learn the basics and than the complex stuff.In my opinion, there are a few countries I would recommend you playing as if you're a newbie depending on what your goal is.If your goal is to make a lot of money, then I would suggest either Venice or The Hansa, or any other merchant republic country. Venice & The Hansa have access to some of the best trade nodes in the game, giving you a reasonable amount of income, but also their ideas I believe do help a lot. (Don't quote me on it, haven't played as em, just heard about em)If your goal is to create a military empire, I would suggest France for the most part, due to their traditional ideas, and the fact that they have a brilliant army at the start of the game. Giving you an advantage over your rivals and enemies, but time is your enemy, as France has some powerful countries as rivals, such as Austria, Burgundy and sometimes Castile.Overall, a brilliant game with great mod support. There are some things I wish were there, just to make it much better.			"

												Serious review.Man this game is perfect. the level of detail and research put into this glorious masterpeice is gigantic.review:You can pick any nation/american tribe you wish from 1444-1821 rule them from different aspects such as diplomacy millitarily and adminstrativly and instead of being a king in this game. instead you ARE the country with kings growing frombecoming heirs and heirs growing to be kings each king with different stats either they can be diplomatic or adminstrative or a war mongerer. heirs can have weak claims on the throne so people you have royal marriages with might go to war to inherit your throne and it can be the other way around you taking their throne.you can't go to war with anyone you wish as you need a cassus belli (reason) going to war without a reason   will greatly make you suffer as other countries might form a coalition on you (trust me i went to war on an african minor for no reason then THE ENTIRETY OF NORTH AFRICA and arabia went to war against me.) and the money system in this game is great you get income from multiple things like trade or tax etc and that money can help you recruit regiments of armies or building stuff and you can gift money to other countries so they like you.there are diplomatic and adminstartive and millitary points that you gain through adminstratives you can use theese points to get ideas for example you can colonise the new world from the new world idea.OKAY I WILL STOP NOW THIS IS TOO COMPLICATED.what matters is:you wont like this game if you are a casual gamer or an rts gamer from games such as command and conquer, this is a Grand Strategy game if you like the total war series you will like this. although this is much more complicated and will take months to get used to the basics.plus there is a mod that lets you play from 51 ad all the way to 2015 and beyond meaning you can pick any country from 51 ad to 2015. romans mongols etc etcPros:-level of detail-diplomatic system-mods like the one i mentioned-level of replayability-The amazing orchestral sound trackmuch moreCons:battle system.few glitchesRating is 9 for me. add one if you are a paradox fan (sadly i only knew them from this game.)subtract two if you are not a fan of the grand strategy franchise.Aaand post.

												A masterpiece of the Grand Strategy genre. You play as a wide selection of nations in the timeframe of 1444 to 1821. You have to take care of your economy, people, neighbours, diplomacy, religion and military while the rest of the world either wants you dead or torn apart. Find allies, and crush the baguette, remove kebab from Europe or stop Russia from annexing Crimea 400 years before Putin was even born. It's your choice. And if you ever get bored of the main game, there are great expansion packs that can squeeze some more hours, even when your playtime is in the thousands. And the modding community is alive and well too. A very good buy if you like the genre, and a great one if you enjoyed Civ.			"

												Europa Universalis IV is the game you graduate to when you’re tired of Civilization or you just want something different or new. That’s ultimately why the core of the game is familiar.  You never truely graduate away from Europa Universalis IV. This game drops you in the deep end before you’re ready and you can either drown or learn to swim, but if you can swim back towards the shallows during those first five hours, you’ll unlock a game so rich that it’ll be helping you tell stories for years.  Ignore most of the negative reviews as they only complain about all the DLC.  Don't buy the DLC and just enjoy the game for what it is.			"

												After a game play with ironman mode of CK2, I think currently, EUIV is still the best game among Paradox games despite the fact that patches after patches, byzantine players, normad players and some other ppl who are struggling for their achievements all suffer through each updates. Comparing with CK2, the game is more predictable: you don't need to worry about the massive revolts which are tirggered whenever your monach dies, nor do you need to deal with the massive aztecs, mongols who have no attritions. War score and military acess rules make the war more realistic. It's much more friendly for achievement players in this sense and only drives you mad in rare occasions.Comparing with VICII, the learning curve is shorter. As long as you know how to manage your national ideas and understand all those modifiers, you can just get through it quickly.For the new players, starting without ironman is a nice choice. A castilian compaign will let you understand the general mechanism of the game including vassals, personal unions, crusades and colonization. A moscow game will give you some ideas of the technology group and none catholic countries. An australian compaign will introduce the mechanisms of the HRE and diplomatic power. If you are a fan of map/history, it would be a nice choice for you.			"

												This game is extremely fun. It'll be difficult to learn everything at first, so don't freak out. It'll take time to learn everything and get good, but after that this game is really really fun. You can play any nation you want and even add your own in with a DLC. Many of the better and useful things are locked behind a paywall, like the very necessary development feature in the Common Sense expansion, which is $15, or the Art of War expansion, which is just loaded with nearly everything you'd ever need, is $20, but the game itself is  definitely worth the money. It's just once you get the expansions you'll never want to go back to the normal version of the game.   It's rather complicated, but that's only because there is so much to learn and the proper way to learn it all is different for everyone, but I think the best way to learn for beginners is to just watch someone play the game itself. One of the things you will need to actively find how to's for is the trade system. Don't worry though, it's not difficult. It's just that it is blunt and doesn't tell you much of how it works from just looking at it. Trades important, for it can get you from the red, to the green, and even fund your armies sometimes if it gets high enough. The military combat is rather difficult if you don't know what you're doing, but if you play as a nation that's not in Europe, or one of the more separated European nations, then it won't be a problem and you can learn how to do war yourself. I recommend being England as a European nation to play as. They can't get invaded easily because of their navy, so you wouldn't have to worry about dealing with war too much as you figure out how to play. The Diplomacy is fine, easy to do, and you can figure it out just by looking at it, but it can be your best friend for getting land or avoiding war if you plan things out just right. It'll even help you win the war, before you even start it. It's best to play with a friend that knows how to play as they will help you from dying if you plan to play in Europe, or out of Europe as the Europeans will colonize.   Modding is really easy to learn, if someone's teaching you, although figuring out how to upload the mods is really difficult if you don't know how. I've started to mod not to long ago, and I've developed a very well crafted and balanced nation with no experience with programming when I started. It even has a set list of what it will do when it becomes an A.I. There also a good chunk of mods that can satisfy your distastes with the game like there being no Secularism, enough music, or the game length being too short. It's really not short, but if you want it to last forever you can do that. ^-^    I say that even with some faults the games has many great things that balance those faults out. The faults aren't that bad, but the good is great. If you wanted to make a mod that adds a new country that's specific to you, you can do that, and all it would do is take time. Modding this game isn't hard, but it is very time consuming. As the wise and powerful Egoraptor said, ""It gives the illusion of difficulty because it takes up your time."" Have fun playing!			"

												Came back to play this after a long time, had nearly 200 hours in it. Found that the updates to the game completely unbalanced the game. I rather like to play as micronations struggling to survive against the odds, I get that's hard, that's why I like it. But the updates have made this completely impossible, not playing as an already large nation is asking for a screwjob. I'd like to compare that frustration to Dark Souls (I have it on console) but at least Dark Souls has a strategy too it that can help you overcome the odds, this is just asinine. Worst off I've tried to reset the game to versions such as 1.11.4 and 1.12.2, the earliest versions that supported the El Dorado DLC and not the recent updates, they crashed every time I started a game. Uninstalled, no question about it I have no reason to continue playing this game. I'm just happy I got my moneys worth out of it before all this happened.If you want details about the updates themselves they go as follows:Provinces instantly fall if they do not have a fort, putting a strain on your forces to constantly recapture them if you are doing anything more than chasing down one enemy army.Buildings (such as forts) have over doubled in costs, costs micronations I like to play as cannot afford. There seems to be no boost to cash flow.Each province with a fort costs 1 gold to maintain, in large nations that adds up quickly in small nations that puts you in debt.I'm not honestly sure what else they added, I saw this and I was pretty much done. Military conquest was supposed to be engaging, difficult, and rewarding not a pointlessly frustrating hassle. "

												This game is the pinnacle of grand strategy. Through exploration, colonization, conquest, trading, and diplomacy you will lead your nation to great glory or utter defeat. Play any country through the age of discovery, the protestant reformation, and into the age of classicism.This game is a must have if you are a grand strategy fan or even just a history buff obsessed with the time period. though not completley historically accurate it is very authentic, and as it is a sandbox game as you play it gets less and less accurate but its possible you may pick up some history and geography.Although its predecesors were overtly complex, I believe Paradox Masters of Grand Strategy have found a good balance of detail intricacy and accesability. Now buy this game and lets play! It has steam works so you can jump right into multiplayer with no hinderments. Get started today you will spend hours clicking away tweaking your country and taking over the world.			"

												This game was amazing. It is a very hard game to play and understand ( and if you are looking to learn i highly recommend watching arumba he has amazing tutorials on this game) but once you understand it it becomes something great. This game is much like cursader kings so if you like that title you will like this one however this one is more focues ond states rather than on characters. Another thing about this game is dlc. Dlc is something that really improves this game but it also in a way punishes you. An example of this is the mare nostrum dlc got released ad as usual a patch came out with it. The patch made it that spying is much more effective however only if you buy the mare nostrum dlc can you counter spying meaning its impossible to stop the constant stream of people spying on you for no reason. Also do not get this game if you want a conversion mod.Great game however the patches are making it more of a chore. They add new systems with these patches that make it even more complex and sometimes just more boring since it makes you wait longer in the game rather than being able to act at that moment. An example of this is you used to be able to conquer the world without a problem. however now there is a system which implements a limit on the amount of areas you own and they arent effective if you go over the cap. These are things that should be optional rather than forced. I highly recommend this game but only if you get all the dlc. Otherwise your going to be playing a half made game.			"

												Who actually writes a -review- for something off steam? It's a total waste of time, isn't it? Who wants to provide free marketing to a videogame company? For Europa Universalis IV... No, it isn't a waste of time. EU4 deserves a review. This game is a masterpiece.If you've ever played risk, Civilization, or any of the Total War games, EU4 is all of those games ramped up to eleven. This game is one of the most deep, complex, and engaging strategy experiences you will ever encounter, putting you in the shoes of any nation in the world you can think of between the years 1444-1820. One of EU4's most interesting elements that defines the franchise is that there is not any clear goal; you decide what you want to achieve. It's a sandbox in every meaning of the word; the sky is the limit in terms of goals here. Do you want to be the most powerful nation in the world, ruling the seas from Britain with a mighty fleet? Or perhaps play as France, the terror of Europe and scourge of Austria? Or maybe you just want to play as a Native American tribe and attempt to survive the onslaught of European colonizers, hungry for land and gold. It's all possible. Some people even make a hobby out of taking the most doomed nations possible that are literally meant to just die, and making them into superpowers. Who would've thought it was possible for the Knights Hospitaller, reduced to a single island in the Meditarranean, to conquer all of India and the Middle East?The real pleasure in EU4, however, lies in its sheer depth. Nothing is cookie-cut. Every aspect of running a nation, from staffing the government with suitable advisors to waging war on rivals (with realistic attrition - don't invade Russia in winter, you nitwit) is covered. Rich events and choices flesh out the environment of the time, simulating things such as the French Revolution and unification of Spain, and even though the game is almost 400 years long, things don't get TOO off course historically. Impressive, considering the timespan. It's a game for history buffs, but everything is well-explained enough so the layman can understand what's going on too. The graphics and user-interface are above average, really. The map is usually crisp and clean, providing information on current events for the player's benefit. The UI is complex, but understandable over time. Multiplayer with friends is an outstanding experience, and something that everyone playing this game should try at least once.No review's complete without mentioning the bad and ugly, however, and there's certainly that in EU4. The learning curve, for one, is absolutely murderous - And this is Paradox Interactive's easiest title. The sheer amount of things to do will absolutely overwhelm any beginner for about the first week of gameplay. There's a few design flaws with the game itself, such as the game becoming too easy if you're really good at it or just start in a strong position - Starting as the Ottoman Empire and smacking around your inferior Eastern neighbors with outdated technology, then turning to your Western neighbors with the might of India behind you is not a challenge at all. There's the occasional bug or thing that'll happen that is absolute nonsense, but it's understandable in a game of this size; the AI can be a bit patchy at times too.  In conclusion - If you consider yourself to be a fan of strategy games, you need to at least take a look at Europa Universalis IV. It's a different kind of game that looks at things on a huge scale. It's not politically correct, and doesn't apologize for this. It's deep. It's fun, once you get into it! It's a cut above most gaming products on the market right now, and it at least deserves your consideration. Give EU4 a try - And maybe shoot me a message if you have a question or two about the game, I'd love to help. Strongly recommended.			"

Of course when starting out youll find yourself getting violently curbstomped by France 98% of the time, but its still fun. Great game 10/10.			"

												The last expansion (Common Sense) seems to have torn the player base apart. I personally prefer the new EU4, since the changes brought a lot of depth into the game.For example:Carpet sieging all of the enemy's provinces is no longer a valid option, since the new forts actually require an army and manpower to succesfully siege them.Developement mechanics are much more interesting than the old building system.Units get their movement order locked under certain cirumstances, which removes the irritating province-dance with the bots.My only complaint so far is that the new mechanics seem too advanced for the bot, bringing the difficulty down.

												I'll write down my thoughts of this game and the ''dev''. Excuse me from the start for the ''grammar fails'' I'm not a native speaker but hey... :)Man, I love this game!!! But... Paradox's policy has changed over time. I'm pretty sure you can still have fun playing vanilla game. But soon or later Paradox gonna take that fun back while looking into your eyes and smiling. Because you'll love the game dynamics and get used to it but then they make up a new DLC and if you dont buy it soon or later they gonna add some new dynamics to your ''vanilla'' game from the ''new DLC''. So, update by update your ''vanilla'' game will be more incomplete and lacking dynamics to be able to do play properly...Example. If you buy the vanilla right now you'll get tons of other dynamics from the DLCs but just to be able to ''develop your provinces by monarch points'' (such a good dynamic) you have to get the ''Common Sense'' DLC. And you'll start feeling the pressure because your game is incomplete.Another example. I have the El Dorado DLC (Which gives you tons of combination of being able to create your own nation in game). No matter what I should be able to create an ''Arabic nation in Russian territories having Chineese technology and ''Merchant Republic'' as state type''. But I cant! Because now they made ''Mare Nostrum'' DLC so I can still see ''Merchant Republic'' option but cant choose it cuz I dont have Mare Nostrum!!!! Arhg!!! Do you feel the angst I have???SO THAT MEANS PARADOX CAN BLOCK YOUR ''DLC'' DYNAMICS BY MAKING UP NEW ONES!!!!Solution. If you are a competitive guy (I have to get the achivements!!!) you better buy all of them at once! Do it! And dont look back. You wont be mad.Other than that, if you wanna play a strategy game and chill just get the vanilla and maybe El Dorado DLC as I've said that gives tons of combination on creating nations. Vanilla Game = Not recommended for competitive guy and just ''okay'' for ''lets play strategy and chill'' people.Thanks...			"

												FOUR HUNDRED HOURS...(edit: closing on 600 hours)I haven't spent that kind of time on a stategy game since Civ IV. In a nutshell this is easily one of the best strategy games available at any point in the history of gaming.Still reading? Ok. Thanks...let me make it worth your while. I've played EU, EU3 and EU4 and this is the best of the series. The other games engaged me for 30, 50 or 60 hours. That's not bad but they never entirely grabbed me. This one is simply a better game than anything Paradox has ever released. The new Clausewitz engine renders this game beautifully. For those worried about the multitude of DLC packs, don't be. The base game plays beautifully and it feels complete. I only purchased the DLC well after I had 100 hours into it. Some may find the DLC worth it. I certainly did. But if you don't get it you're still buying a complete game.So what makes this game good? Options and choice without complexity. EU4 is the epitome of ""every action has an equal and opposite reaction"". Sure, you can play as a massive warmonger and try to gobble up everyone. But then you'll have to deal with the internal unrest and your neighbors banding together to take you down a peg. You can play as a nice neighbor and not attack anyone but then you'll have to deal with keeping major allies happy in order to watch over you. You'll have scenarios where lifelong allies of yours attack each other and you'll have to decide which one to back. Do you build up? Do you build out? It's all up to you. You can take France or the Ottomans and try to dominate the world. Or you can take a tiny country and just try to survive. And there's no ""victory"" in the game. Whether or not you won or lost is your call, not some arbitrary game decision. Meanwhile, you're balancing military, political ramifications, gold, your provinces, technologies and a host of other factors. It's a lot to juggle but it's not overwhelming.There's a learning curve here, but the new engine makes everything more accessible than ever. Thus while some people have been put off by the complexity of this series in the past, this one is actually fairly easy to get into. Now for someone who is entirely new to the engine it's going to take some time to learn your way around. It's not a typical strategy game where you can rush your actions. You have to take your time, plan your actions perhaps decades in advance and then be ready to strike at a moment's notice. It's wonderful fun.There aren't any large flaws with EU4, which is one of the highest compliments I can pay a game. It is highly recommended for any strategy gamer's library.			"

I was fascinated so bought it and tried it out: AMAZING.I can just say that you can take the role of a country/kingdom/whatever from all over the world, from European countries, african tribes, asiatic empires or even the japanese clans/shogunate. Choose what you want and throw yourself in an epic quest starting from 1444 and ending in 1750.I HIGHLY SUGGEST IT. 5/5.			"

												I loved this game before last patch. It was almost perfect (AI could be better, but I'm not gonna compain). And then... Last ""patch"" came (with dlc). This patch is a HUGE stepback for EU4. All mechanics changes (sieges, unbalanced costs for coring and diploanexing, removing buildings, turning good and easy buildings managment into piece of micromanagement crap) are just stupid and silly. Best one - they did not changed code of AI. Yes, AI is behaving like in previous version (and often can't move at all). Update and ""Common Sense"" ruined EU4. Don't even waste time on this game. Go play EU3, it's better than EU4 after ver 1.12.			"

												If you have not bought ALL the DLC for this game - don't even start to play it, coz you will lose. There is no way to win without some DLC features. Game is basicaly unplayable and Paradox should be lynched for that. Wasted God knows how many hours playing for Cusco/Inka just to realise that without the ability to reform religions(that comes with DLC El Dorado as I guess) you just gonna lose no matter what coz you won't have coloinst early and other stuff. And I had to go to youtube to even know that.The game is basically a scam at this point, not recommend, you'll just waste your time and lose after a while without ALL DLC features. (and to say that I bought some edition that had 3 DLCs included in it, still got ripped off, can't belive it, not gonna by anything from Paradox ever)			"

												Updated on 23.12.2014. In short, the three major expansion have fixed most of the issues with the game, and added a massive amount of extra content and flavour.Review:An improvement over the already excellent 'EU3: Divine Wind' in almost every way imaginable. - For those interested in the genre, this is probably the best place to start: Excellent tutorials (by Paradox's standards, at least), less unnecessary abstraction, but all the depth of a PDS game. You'll still fail miserably a few times before fully figuring the game out, but that's always been part of the fun in these titles. So ye, if you're new to grand strategy, get this.- As for 'us' veterans? Improved mechanics across the board, trading that makes sense, more challenging AI and Ironman mode make this a worthy sequel to EU3.The biggest change from EU3DW is the monarch point system that replaces the budget sliders and magistrates. A welcome change, in my opinion, as now you can't just adjust your sliders a bit in the early game for high stability and fast military tech. Monarch points are used for national ideas, tech, buildings, national decisions, even peace treaties. The highly limited amount of monarch points earned per month force the player to really think about his actions. No more spamming buildings at max magistrates and never touching the sliders.  This system does have slight balance issues: military tech is always a better investment than military ideas, for example, and the fact that your ruler's skills play a major part in your monarch point income can screw over large portions of a playthrough. Fall behind in military tech because of an idiot king? lol ok, Prussia is going  to eat you now.Other small problems include the infrequent revolutions and apparent ultra-stability of large AI nations. In my three finished campaigns, [strikethrough]only a handful of American nations ever managed to gain independence, and I've never seen a Revolutionary France. Small sample size, yes, but it does seem like large empires are a bit too stable at the moment.[/strikethrough] These happen far more often now. Colonial nations revolt quite often and the revolution mechanic makes seeing revolutionary nations far more common.The UI is much better this time, being closer to CK2's than EU3's, but the panels and the font are still far too small at 1920x1080. Fortunately, there is a fix to this in the Steam workshop, another great addition to the game.AI has seen quite a few improvements as well, especially in diplomacy. Every nation now has a limited amount of diplomatic relations they can maintain, and the AI does seem to understand the mechanic quite well, cutting ties with nations because of shifting interests, and seeking new allies as the game progresses (instead of picking 3 allies at the start of the game and sticking with them, like in EU3). Cascading alliances are not a problem anymore, as infamy was replaced by an aggressive expansion relations hit to all nearby nations. AE going too high leads to the AI forming coalitions: defensive alliances that do what cascading alliances were supposed to.Overall, the AI nations seem far better at waging war; effectively pursuing hostile armies, splitting up to siege multiple provinces at a time, exploiting river crossings to crush larger forces, etc. EU4 > EU3  Divine Wind. [strikethrough]Only thing I actually miss from EU3 are the overseas territory names (ie. Portuguese Africa, British Caribbean)[/strikethrough] Conquest of Paradise adds this back in.- How is it as a standalone title?A bloody brilliant game, and miles above any non-PDS strategy game in depth, scale and complexity. It also looks very pretty, so that's good. I was a long-time Total War fan, before being introduced to EU3. Now, even Empire: Total War feels far to simplistic.Expansions:The Conquest of Paradise- Colonial nations form when you have enough colonies in an overseas region. Similar to vassals, but pay tariffs instead of taxes. A pretty cool mechanic, though I do miss being able to micromanage every single colony.- Randomized New World. Not too exciting. Terrain generation is really odd, and looks like a random map seed from Age of Empires 2.The Wealth of Nations- Revamped trade system is great.- Trade companies are like colonial nations in the East. Cool system, but has the same problems CN's have.- New diplomacy options are great. Transfering trade power, new casus belli. Great additions.Res Publica- More flavour for Poland and the Dutch. Not too exciting, but highly recommended if you want to play those nations.Art of War- More diplomacy options again. Excellent additions like supporting rebel CB, fight for subject CB, war reparations.- Autonomy system added in the patch is great, as is the new revolution mechanic.			"

												poentially the best game of its kind IF it didn't have a few fraustrating improbable things that totally ruin the experience.-a rebellion in a region might field more men than the entire nation and with more artillery than a superpower-at very easy level you might lose a battle when you outnumber an enemy 3 to 1 and have better tech....even if u defend behind a riverI hear many of these things are solved if you buy 1 or 10 of the dozens of ""expansions""....but I really don't feel like sorting thru all that and spending more cash to have an already expensive game properly function.

												Only Paradox game I would out right reccomend. Not perfect and their DLC policy is still moronic. Playing as smaller nations can feel very RNG reliant and mostly unfun. Bigger nations is where its at. Mostly solid and polished in terms of visuals, UI and gameplay. But by far the WORST mechanic is the rebellion system, instead of having interesting things happen while not at war the game just spawns rebels every now and again to hamper your expansion and annoy you. Instead of rebels ya know realistically popping up when they have reason to rebel.Overall 7/10 only paradox game (besides Stellaris) where DLC isnt neccesary.			"

												If I wanted to not be able to walk into the southern half of Morroco because there's a stupid fort that I can't get to because the province is guarded by a fort, I would have bought the damn DLC that featured it. However, Paradox has apparently taken everyone's advice and put features like this into the base game. But I don't want it. Too bad! Enjoy playing with the estate constantly wanting your land and such! Watch as you lose a war because you can't reach the capital because an entire line of provinces can't be crossed because of one fort! I hate what Paradox has done.

												This game is a big surprise for me this year. I never though i will enjoy it so much since I havent played any Paradox games before. This has to be because unlike Total War series Paradoxes games doesnt look attractive at all :D, but when i started playing this i couldn't get my hands off it, its so addictive. I have long been a Total War series fan and i still like some of their games but this game is in many ways way superior than any TW game - modded or not. Unlike Rome TW 2 this game is imo one of the most well though games i ever played, and i will be easily putting hundreds of hours in, and enjoying every moment of it. The complexity of whole system may seem huge at first but its worth to invest some time in understaning it, since it will be returned to you tenfold.Many thanks to Goro and others who persuaded me to buy this game ;DFinal verdict 10/10, my GOTY :D			"

												If you've come here for a 4X, please you need to redefine what you think a 4X is. EU4 is sandbox and that, and it's just an experience. 4X implies a goal and competition, and there is definitly a competition in Multiplayer, but that is only 15% of the game, but there is no way to ""complete"" the game. The only way to do so is to World Conquest, which is next to impossible for Casual Players like me.♥♥♥♥♥♥I am still learning parts of the game I don't even know. On top of that all a new DLC is arriving in what will be now 8 days, and probably around the time you read this it's already out. I know you'll see♥♥♥♥♥♥like ""Don't buy, pirate, Paradox is money grabbing ♥♥♥♥♥s."" Let me just say... No. They aren't money grabbing, sure they have some sketchy♥♥♥♥♥pricing ranges on some mediocre dlc's but what makes them different to EA, Ubisoft, any major publisher is they include half of the contents in a free patch. Not to mention they work on their games for years. I'd just like to point out that EU4 came out in August of 2013. It came out 3 years ago, now you can get most dlc half off during one of the multiple steam sales,♥♥♥♥♥sales, or amazon sales that happens over the year. What amazes me most is the dedication to the fanbase, most devs will release small patches alongside dlc expansions for a set price of 20 USD. On top of that did I mention you get FREE contents every dlc release. Please name one other ♥♥♥♥ing major publisher that does that kind of thing. I can help you with that, none. Paradox is the only major developer who does this, and I respect them for that.EU4, isn't easy, but it's so much fun by the time you learn it. Definitly worth the grab even if it is full price, but if on sale even better because you can get some dlc alongside it. Remember, Paradox isn't like the other Publishers, they actually know what they are doing.Updating for the event (November 26th)			"

												I am a huge fan of the Europa Universalis series, and a huge fan of Paradox games in general.  I have almost 1500 hrs logged into EU3 and another 3-4000 hrs spread across HOI3, Crusader Kings 2, Victoria 2 and Sengoku.  EU3 was easily my favorite of the bunch...So on to my impression of EU4.  Imagine EU3 with better graphics and all the fun ripped out of it stillborn and left to die on the operating room floor.  They have ruined this game.  Ruined.  R.U.I.N.E.Duh.In the interests of me not having an aneurism, I'll just limit my comments on the weird, delusional, nonsensical ""coalition system"" to this.  Great concept, worse than amateur level execution.  Now on to my biggest beefs...  Defeat your enemy in battle then beat him to the next province to cut off his retreat?  Well go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, his troops are all magic ninjas with the special ability of being able to hide from your ARMY.  Want to go invade your enemy?  Not so fast, there's a castle two provinces adjacent that magically prevents your army from moving there.I have no problems with adding in game mechanics to help balance things, but this is ahistorical horse♥♥♥♥♥♥  If I wanted to play a game that had a ""fairness fairy"" I'd play something in the fantasy genre.  I come to Paradox for REALISM.  Not for magic castles that prevent movement in neighboring duchies just because some re-tarded asshat wanted to add maintainence for castles and now we need to balance that.   And I understand Paradox has ALWAYS had weak ""stack mashing"" battle mechanics, but historically as well as in EU3, the majority of casualties occured after an army routed.  Maintaining control of an army in full retreat across multiple provinces is a herculean task.  If you ain't Napoleon, you ain't doing it.  And yet...I waited patiently for them to fix the broken, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, lazy fake♥♥♥♥♥♥♥mechanics with patches or DLC.  Meanwhile I played CK2.  Now Lo and behold some of this stupid ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥has begun to appear in CK2.  Hey Paradox, your ""broken retreat"" concept is a broken game mechanic.  And its driving this loyal paying customer away from your games in disgust.			"

												This is a wonderful game with a Real time challenge, it is very challenging and you can have so much fun playing as the nation you want to ranging from The United Kingdom, To Persia. The new DLC ""Common Sense"" In my Opinion has changed the game in a way that it will never be the same, Let me explain. Whenever I siege and occupy a province and move my men out it will un-siege itself and I have to re-siege it. I was at a war with Ottomans and I was about to win till my Objective province got un-sieged and I lost an army stack because while I was re-siegeing it his main armies came and destroyed everything I had. I could have won and could have peaced out if I had that province but that fact that this DLC has made it so it un-sieges the provinces I take over makes me mad and it costs manpower to re-siege and manpower is something that is valued in this game. Not to mention the new Outrages Admin points you have to spend just to core one province, I full annex Wallachia under Hungary, it costs over 400 Admin and I am saying, ""Good Job Paradox you have ruined my game!"" Also this is not the only bad thing Common Sense has done to our beloved game, it made it so when AI fight their armies go crazy around the map, and thats not even the worst part! I mean the fort system is so bad I just want to use cheats to full annex a nation because of the anger and madness I have of the fort system. Though if you have made it this far into my paragraph you might want to listean even more. The value of sieging a province that a country owns is worthless! I siege all the balkans under Ottomans Control and it is only 6% Warscore, what the actually heck. The only fun thing for me in this DLC is the new re-shaped Provinces, the new nations, the 1490 Italian's leaving the HRE which makes invading them more fun for outside HRE nations, and the last good thing about Common Sense is the devolpment system, I love how you can make your nation strong. Let's say I play as Hungary, I can develop my country to be as strong as Castile,Aragon,France, and Poland. The new DLC in all is worthless and I suggest you do not get it. Other then that Europa Universalis IV is a fun, Stragetic game and I would suggest you get the game but not Common Sense. If you have read this paragraph I hope you agree with me and Paradox, if you are reading this please fix these things to make the fun come back to the game. I put to many hours and fun into this for you to turn it into a non-exciting game! Thank you all for your time of reading this Review.			"

												This game is broken and the developers are genuinely evil people. No, I see you looking at my playtime. NoSeriously, I don't know why I tolerate it. I mean, I really don't know why I take this so well. It's just...darkness induced apathy, I suppose. But really, this cashgrab ransom of a game is probably the worst example of the gaming industry I can possibly think of, and I almost love it.Here's the short version:They broke the game, and the only way to un♥♥♥♥ the game is by buying a DLC.The DLC is called Common Sense.For 20 dollarsI have to admit, I busted out laughing, hard, when I saw that. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I genuinely enjoy how terrible these developers and publishers are. They are so evil it's actually ♥♥♥♥ing funny.Basically, long and short of it, ever since 2013 the developers have been holding the game hostage. Every couple weeks, they'll 'update' it, consisting of several dozen 'features' that you have to pay for. 20 bucks each DLC. If you do not have this dlc, that's okay. You just can't use the features. I mean, sure, the entire game is now balanced around them, and you're ♥♥♥♥ed unless you buy it so you can upgrade your♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it's freeeee!This means that unless you buy every DLC at the moment it's released, you can not win. Full stop, it doesn't allow you to win. It's a fee to pay game at it's worst; the publisher is rotten and everyone involved has given up any artistic or even mechanical vision they had for it. Do not buy it. Do not buy anything paradox has published. They will stop at nothing to try and force you into buying 20 dollars worth of nothing every couple weeks.			"

												I recently picked this game up again after a year long haitus. The game has been improved on every level since I last paid, however since I am not a muppet I will not pay for a bunch of DLCs which come to a price higher than the base game itself and which should have been patches anyway.Like how can you patch the game so that you can build fewer buildings, then release a DLC for over £10 which lets you build provinces up to the amount of buildings you could build before the patch and think that's acceptable? Who is buying these DLCs? I understand why people want them, I want them myself, but only because they change the game's base mechanics back to the level they were at at release. I refuse to pay for them though. I don't understand who would pay for them.It's not even as if grand strategy is a niche market anymore and Paradox need every penny. In that case I might be able to justify it. Paradox is doing this because they can, with their stranglehold on the grand strategy market. I'm not gonna enable them though. If you're thinking of buying this game, please don't, do not enable shameful business tactics.			"

												I want so badly for this game to be fun, because it's such a cool concept. But I've been disappointed every single time I load it up and give it another try. It could be so much better.Here's something to understand if you're thinking about trying it: It's more like Risk than Civilization. It's a game about conquering territory, not building an empire. War is the only practical thing there is to do. If you're not at war, you're just gonna be staring at the screen for hours waiting for numbers to go up.Nothing will make sense to you the first time you play this game. The amount of help provided is very limited, and the UI is very confusing. Icons without meaning abound. Numbers and modifiers are given without explanation of what they actually do.If you stick with it, you'll discover that fighting and conquering land is kinda fun. Troops are moved around in real-time, which makes it feel realistic. I'm sure I would have more to say on combat if I knew more about how it worked, but of course, it isn't explained very well. 90% of the fun in this game comes from looking at the territory you own and thinking ""Ahh, look at all the land I own now.""The massive amount of provinces and nations in this game is really, really cool. There are hundreds of nations, and every one is playable, from the biggest to the smallest, from Europe to Africa to Indonesia to America. However, nations outside Europe receive crippling penalties that end up making them much more boring to play than they should be. Different regions of the world have different technology penalties. East Asia, for instance, has technology 60% more expensive, and certain regions of America have technology 250% more expensive. You can remove this penalty through an extremely painful ""westernization"" process. I dislike this system immensely. I wish there had instead been a set of technologies the more primitive nations would have to go through before getting caught up. This would still have kept them behind the Europeans, but it would have given the player something to do. Instead, my native tribe seems to consist of a bunch of morons who can't learn.Most things in this game require a resource called monarch power to perform. This comes in three types: administrative, diplomatic, and military. You get a base amount of monarch power per month, and then the rest is determined by your advisors (which you can hire for gold, if you have enough) and your ruler. If your nation isn't a republic, you can't control who your ruler is...and your ruler massively influences how much you can do in this game. If you have a good ruler, you can do all sorts of fun things, but if your ruler sucks, you're stuck sitting and waiting for decades of game time and hours of real time to do anything at all. Waiting seems to be a common theme in this game's play.You can build buildings in your provinces if you happen to have lots of gold, but it's not very interesting to do so. The buildings have only a small effect individually. Like I said, this game is more about taking land than developing a nation.Exploration and colonization was something I was excited to try, but it turns out you can't do either until you take very specific policies...I wish every nation could expand to unoccupied territory from the very beginning, but this is not the case.I find that most of the strategies I try this game are...cheesy. For instance, if I'm a weaker nation and I want to bully some of my neighbors out of their land, I will attempt to ally with a strong nation, get them into my war...and then make sure my armies land on the provinces I want to take before theirs do, because whoever starts a siege on a province first gets claim to that territory. This doesn't make me feel like I'm winning, it just makes me feel like I'm gaming the system.There are more things I could complain about, but the gist is that this game seems awesome yet constantly disappoints me. If you like maps and war, you'll probably like this game. If you like SimCity or you're the kind of person who prefers peaceful victories in Civilization, you probably won't. "

												The game had potential, but whoever makes it chose otherwise. A questionable vision of geography and history of the mid fifteenth to early nineteenth centuries, an inaccurate world map, and dull gameplay. The small updates they call ""downloadable content"" which are smaller than an expansion but somewhat bigger than a patch are unjustifiably expensive compared to the novelties and tweaks they bring.I will not buy any titles from this firm unless they change their practices and apologise.

												This game is amazing. It's so thorough and realistic! You simply cannot build a massive empire without worrying about stability, and even when you do begin to get big, you have to worry about coalitions, other massive empires! It always keeps you on your feet in some way no matter how powerful you become.Features I love tremendously:Modding Community. I can't express how awesome the modding community is for this game. My favorite mod is the Extended Timeline. I created a massive Germanic Empire covering europe following romes demise during the migration period(I replaced the roman empire, and more, hehehe). I even took on the mughals (which formed from parthia.Frequent Updates and Patches. This just shows how much Paradox Entertainment cares for their games to keep them entertaining. The new Art of War expansion added so much! 900 extra provinces, 150 new countries, new rebellion mechanic, better war mechanics.. that is just the tip of the Ice berg! http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?810805-1.8-Full-Patch-NotesDiplomacy. This is tremendously well done. You can literally manipulate the throne of another kingdom and force them into a Personal Union (only if your Christian, since the AoW update). Diplomacy dictates every corner of this game. If you expand too quickly, your neighbors will see that as 'aggressive expansion', and possibly form a massive coalition against you. This is an amazing game-balance mechanic, as it prevents big empires from going on a conquest rampage. You are forced to form alliances no matter what nation you start as, least you fail the game in the short run, and if not the short run, then the long run.War. The war.. It's so amazingly realistic. It makes you feel like your fighting against another nation like they would in that time period (With crusader kings being even more accurate in this regard). Every single day begins to count during a war (real-time after all, no joke) The way a war is fought is heavily dictated by the supply limit a province can provide your troops. A smart enemy can fight a war of attrition against you, making you lose thousands of troops each month while you flee.Expansion. Yes, I love how the expansion isn't dictated by what you occupy, but what your warscore is in a single war. This boost the realism level to almost as high as it can go. Historically it was impractical, and logistically impossible to conquer a huge empire in one war. You would have mass rebellions, and administrative problems to say the least. Couple this with the over-extension mechanic, and that is where the realism really blossoms. Even when you conquer a small section of an enormous empire, and you still have to deal with massive instability and revolt risk!Honestly, this review only covers a small fraction of the awesomeness of this game. There are so many equally awesome features that I have not covered in this review, and I'm lazy. If you are a fan of conquest games, you should buy this game undoubtedly - unless you prefer the style of CK2 over EU4 (I like both).			"

Glad I did as this is an amazing game.If, like me, you are put off by really complicated strategy games then please persevere with it! Once you get the hang of the game engine it is a thing of beauty.There is so much depth and historical detail in this game that it is astounding how much work it must have taken to create!The graphics are really good for a strategy game and the interface becomes very easy to understand after a few games.Do not be put off by initial difficulty, it is defintely worth the effort!The extra DLC also shows how much love went into this game and continues to go into it.Put simply, if you want to truly control the world or think of yourself as Machiavelli this is the game for you :)			"

It is the best game I have ever played, it is so in depth, and everything you do will have good or bad repurcussions. The community around the game is excellent, with many mods available and youtubers like Quill18 and Arumba. My love for strategy gaming began at Civ 5, and now, after owning multiple total war titles and other strategy games, this is the best of the best. The multiplayer is brilliant, as you can play with mods which allows for so many different ways to play. If you have the money you must buy this game, as it is truly the best strategy game available.			"

												This is by far one of the best games I have ever played. This has blown all other strategy games I have played way out of the water. Normally with strategy games I am downloading mods for them after about 150 hours but I am currently over 400 and I don't plan on getting any for another few hundred. Although I have heard the timeline mod is awesome I am going to play the vanilla game to its fullest. This game may take a long time but its full of things to keep you busy. From plotting your next conquest to being cought completely off guard by a declaration of war. You can take the smallest nations and turn them into glorious empires. You can also be utterly crushed under the boot of jealous neighbours.I have only been able to complete 4 campians (Who knows how many I have failed XD) and my favorite was forming Italy as Naples. It was extreamly hard as Austria desided to take Milan but I finally formed Italy in 1700. Shortly after that France and me had to fight off the Commonblob. It was a long and bloody war but we came out on top (and low on money and manpower). That war was the most enjoyable one I have fought thus far.Note: There are people who don't like thier DLC system and I cannot blame them. But this game (and all of their others) is just so awesome I am willing to buy them all to support Paradox and help them develop more awesome games in the future. In conclusion, if you are a lover of strategy games and have loads of free time this game is perfect for you!!!			"

												in playing this game as great britan there is one thing I have become more obsessed with in life than anything. Trade. You see I started this game with four friends of mine respectivly  playing as castille, austria, Serbia, and sweden and as time has gone on the more of a raging ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I have become.Seeing their trade nodes without the british flag flying high declaring ownership infuriates me, I have deleberitly undermined their economies to further advance my own economic gain all under the justification it was ""For the greater good"".  And when the greater good was not a good enough reason i fell back on blatent hostilites and economic sanctions through moving trade away from their nodes and into my own.I dont even need the ammount of money im getting at this point in time, when in gods green earth am I going to spend 132k Ducats? Why would I -need- 300+ Ducats a turn? now approaching 400.  I sit now all day at work, even when i sleep thinking of ways to forward my economic gain regardless of their economic needs and im seriously getting worried about myself.  My friends have gone so far as to say ""I want to get off Admiral Burkes wild stock exchange"" when I offered to subsidize them around 100 Ducats each (Mind you the HRE, Scandenavia, Spain, and serbian greece had formed by this time).10/10 would nearly lose friends again in a wild beligeriantly imperialistic lust for more gold.

												Europa Universalis 4, the game so good you'll develop E-U-4-ia is a grand strategy in which you select a nation and try your best to not get conquered by France, the Big Blue Blob.  Even if you're some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little Asian nation, don't worry, BBB's-a-comin' sooner or later.  Probably later.To me the real time the game shines is during multiplayer, where all of Europe can jack each other off in Woodstock-class hippy peace time, dividing up the world so nobody is sad and teaming up in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t alliances against anyone who would try to provoke actual conflict.With frequently-added expansions to the game that aren't nearly as trivial and cash-grabby as certain other studios (not going to namEAnyone) your experience becomes even greater over time.

												How to play Byzcan'tine Empire:Attempt 1: Get Poland as ally but Lithuania PU never fires. Check Austria diplo and it's a minor in a PU with Aragon 2 years into the game.Attempt 2: Ottomans ignore you for 15 years and blob literally everything in Asia Minor and all minors in Balkans. Poland then dishonors call to defensive war against Ottomans for no obvious reason (not already in a war etc.).Attempt 3: Ottomans declare war before you can get any allies.Attempt 4: Hungary white peaces out while Ottomans are also majorly losing a war with Mamluks on the other end. Ottomans then wreck you.Attempt 5: Game starts out good. Within three years of game start your ruler dies and a rebel pretender much stronger than you stack wipes your army and takes Constantinople.Attempt 6: Game starts out good. Within four years of game start your ruler dies and a rebel pretender much stronger than you stack wipes your army and takes Constantinople.Attempt 7: Game starts out good. Within two years of game start your ruler dies and a rebel pretender much stronger than you stack wipes your army and takes Constantinople.Attempt 8: Everything set up nice with Polish/Lithuania ally. Wardec Ottomans and Poland/Lithuania get completely destroyed due to generals literally rolling eternal 0's and 1's.

You decide to try again game hasn't even started yet.Attempt 12: You decide the fourth rivalry in a row may not be a bad thing if you try an Austria alliance again. Improve relations with all 3 anyway. Can't get diplo high enough to ally Austria (stops at -13 with no other options).

												This game is amazing. It's so thorough and realistic! You simply cannot build a massive empire without worrying about stability, and even when you do begin to get big, you have to worry about coalitions, other massive empires! It always keeps you on your feet in some way no matter how powerful you become.Features I love tremendously:Modding Community. I can't express how awesome the modding community is for this game. My favorite mod is the Extended Timeline. I created a massive Germanic Empire covering europe following romes demise during the migration period(I replaced the roman empire, and more, hehehe). I even took on the mughals (which formed from parthia.Frequent Updates and Patches. This just shows how much Paradox Entertainment cares for their games to keep them entertaining. The new Art of War expansion added so much! 900 extra provinces, 150 new countries, new rebellion mechanic, better war mechanics.. that is just the tip of the Ice berg! http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?810805-1.8-Full-Patch-NotesDiplomacy. This is tremendously well done. You can literally manipulate the throne of another kingdom and force them into a Personal Union (only if your Christian, since the AoW update). Diplomacy dictates every corner of this game. If you expand too quickly, your neighbors will see that as 'aggressive expansion', and possibly form a massive coalition against you. This is an amazing game-balance mechanic, as it prevents big empires from going on a conquest rampage. You are forced to form alliances no matter what nation you start as, least you fail the game in the short run, and if not the short run, then the long run.War. The war.. It's so amazingly realistic. It makes you feel like your fighting against another nation like they would in that time period (With crusader kings being even more accurate in this regard). Every single day begins to count during a war (real-time after all, no joke) The way a war is fought is heavily dictated by the supply limit a province can provide your troops. A smart enemy can fight a war of attrition against you, making you lose thousands of troops each month while you flee.Expansion. Yes, I love how the expansion isn't dictated by what you occupy, but what your warscore is in a single war. This boost the realism level to almost as high as it can go. Historically it was impractical, and logistically impossible to conquer a huge empire in one war. You would have mass rebellions, and administrative problems to say the least. Couple this with the over-extension mechanic, and that is where the realism really blossoms. Even when you conquer a small section of an enormous empire, and you still have to deal with massive instability and revolt risk!Honestly, this review only covers a small fraction of the awesomeness of this game. There are so many equally awesome features that I have not covered in this review, and I'm lazy. If you are a fan of conquest games, you should buy this game undoubtedly - unless you prefer the style of CK2 over EU4 (I like both).			"

The GameEuropa Universalis is an amazing game. The depth it's able to capture is astounding and it implements a lot of features pretty seamlessly. Its incredibly addicting, and you'll soon want to add every puzzle piece of the map to your empire for nothing more than bigger name placement. It's a great game, and it'll ruin games like Civ 5 for you.There's been some issues throughout the updates and DLCs, but that's the same with most games, and they're usually smoothed over with the new patches. The zone of control system for forts still feels like it needs to be reworked but for the most part, this patch (1.19) seems really stableThe DLCIf the DLC turns you off of it, know that many of the DLC make the game seem like a new game with every purchase and even though it is a bit greedy-looking, I think it's much better than just waiting for the new game. If you were looking for which DLC you should buy to make the game ""complete"" here's my list:The CossacksRights of ManEl DoradoWealth of NationsArt of WarConquest of ParadiseCommon SenseAnd if you can snag Mare Nostrum and Res Publica they're pretty great too. TL;DREU4 is worth the money, its more addicting than crack, I would know. "

												8/10 - This is a GREAT game.+tive Points - It is EXTREMElY addictive and enjoyable for long hours, there is literally never a moment with nothing to do; whether it be war, building infastucture, stabilising your economy or advancing technology. Especially fun with many friends on multiplayer; this is when the game is incompareable to anything else, it IS grand stratergy. You really get drawn in and you get stuck to its sticky bosom of pure enjoyment. You really feel you're building an empire, and there are so many playable nations you literally can replay the game thousands of times, for thousands of hours. It is also one of the most easily modable games on Steam, with many mods adding even more greatness to an already great game.-tive Points - If you're new to stratergy, this game throws you into the deep end and you will spend a LONG time getting to grips with the multitude of mechanics. Battles, although fun and challenging, can be repetitive with the same animations and tactics, a little more variaty and interactive-ness is needed in my opinion. Multiplayer HAS A LOT OF ISSUES. Although it is the best part of the game, the servers have many issues, with players frequently and randomly disconnecting or not even being able to join a lobby. A game in multiplayer may take time to get going, but when it does, it is AMAZING!Overall, if you love stratergy, this is a requirement. If Paradox can sort out multiplayer servers and issues, you would be looking at a 10/10 game here, but these issues do make the game frustrating at times.			"

With a little imaginiation it feels like you're rewriting history with your own spin, and you can do it over and over again with hundreds of nations.			"

												My take on this game :Pros :(+) Great simulation of Europe, Holy Roman Emperors, and the wars in between.(+) Great simulation of New World Exploration. While we somewhat knows where is continental America, this is somewhat fixed in a New World DLC.(+) Great simulation of Europe technologies. The technologies are also explained in a historical context.(+) Good simulation of warfare. In addition of tactical battles, one can also won by engaging naval blockades, trade embargoes, and such.(+) Good simulation on politics. Declaration of war is not that simple, you have to obtain a reason : whether it is a different religion, reconquest, etc. The mechanics of War Exhaustion, Stability, and Aggresive Expansion enable careful warfare and not all out map painting.(+) Each big nation have their own ambition and mission. For example : Brandenburg to form up Prussia, and later Germany. Cons :(-) Sometimes your allies make such bad decision. Such as waging a 20-years war with a HRE/France for one pitiful province. Or wage 10+ years war that consumes manpower and increase war exhaustion for one tiny land.This game is a historical simulator, not 100% accurate but still put history in context.			"

												It is absolutely amazing. The incredible rush you feel when you zoom out and realize that your country's name is the biggest in the world. The satisfaction of going to the religions map mode and seeing that all of italy is finally sunni after a century of conversion. The thrill every time you start a new game playing as one of over 300 diferent countries in one of 377 unique starting times (you can start playing during any year between 1444 and 1821). These are not even a fraction of the reasons why this game is possibly the greatest game i've ever played, and by far the greatest strategy game out there. Is has so much replayability it's ridiculous. It's not just addictive like some stupid arcade game, it's fulfilling and great fun. Don't believe me? look at the other guys that have left reviews. Over 500 freaken hours. do you know how long that is? That's almost an entire month's worth of hours. That's one 936th, or more than 0.1%, of the average american's life span, playing europa. No one plays that much because it's a bad game. And if you ask me, that's time well spent.			"

												Truly not abusing the term ""grand"" when it comes to grand strategy games, EUIV is hands-down the best 4X game I've played in many, many years. Having the option to play as any nation ranging from the start of the European Renaissance to past the American Revolution, the scope and involvement in your nation's development is unprecedented. Making sure to keep your expansion in check and powerful allies placated will have you forming decisions well well into the hundreds of years. Most nations (even smaller ones) have unique sets of ideas that will radically alter your playstyle - will you conquer massive swaths of land as the Ottoman Empire, diplomatically unite the Holy Roman Empire as Austria, build trade dominance with Venice, or play as a little-known minor country in Africa, India, or Asia? There are literally hundreds of choices.This game is not for the faint of heart or those without a fair amount of time to invest - a single game can easily last weeks! That being said, pick this up if you have any interest in strategy, or even just world history! It's the best excuse for sinking 12+ hours into a session - you're ""learning"" about the world!			"

												I was about to get my buddies to buy this and play it with and rememeber the DLC is a daunting nightmare. Not only is there so much of it, but its all sold seperately. Impossible for new players. I live civ 6 did where you could buy the complete for $80, and that has all the DLC, or you could get the game and buy the DLC individually. And its hard to not reccomend this game, but the DLC makes it impossible to want to play anymore.			"

												Probably one of my favourite games of all time (Alongside CK2), but this DLC policy is getting ridiculous. I'd also argue this game's dlc policy is much worse than CK2's, because while CK2's expansions mostly expand the non-catholic/european factions (with the exception of the last three), meaning you can still have a fairly complete game while playing as said european faction (That game's DLC is still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t though just not as bad), EU4's expansions focus primarily on adding game mechanics, meaning without the expansions you're missing a huge amount of features, on top of that, they've been balancing the game in the last few patches AROUND the expansion mechanics, meaning the game's basically broken on it's own. For example, a few months ago they revamped the technology system, before if you were a non-european faction you had to ""Westernise"" to get the fastest technological progression, however they replaced that with a new system called ""institutions"", where every so often an ""institution"" (the renaissance, colonialism etc) will pop up somewhere on the map and start spreading, if you don't embrace the latest institution you're gonna get left behind in the technology race with an ever increasing penalty as time goes on, now personally I like the new system much better, it's a great addition, but the problem is one of the primary ways of getting institutions into your provinces is by developing them, and you need Common Sense to do that. Tl;dr Game's a 10/10 experience with all the DLC, but the DLC policy is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the game's basically broken without all of it.			"

												An Amazing game missing some of the key features which its predecessor had, but along with new game mechanics not having them seems only trivial. The new trade system allows players to engage in wars for trade and also enables dynamic fluctuations between profit. The new coalition and aggressive expansion system means that players have to be more careful and watch who they are angering. The coalition system allows players to stop nations who outgrow their respective borders, but can also be turned on the player if aggressive expansion gets too high with surrounding nations. These features make this the best installment in Paradox's Europa Universalis series, and i would highly recommend this to anyone new to paradox games or even seasoned vets of Europa Universalis.

												     Europa Universalis IV is a Grand Strategy Game developed by Paradox Entertainment. The game allows you to take control of a country from the time period of 1444 until 1820 (An official save converter for Crusader Kings II can push this date as far back as 867). The country pool you draw your selection from is vast, ranging from future world powers like England, Sweden, and France to Native American and Meso-American tribes like the Shawnee, the Cherokee, The Aztecs, and the Inca. Keep in mind that every country is not created equal; Western Countries have a much easier time as opposed to those with Eastern or Tribal cultures. Westernizing as a tribal group is always a must; you will be crushed otherwise.    In Europa Universalis IV, the world is your oyster. Your goals are yours to define; Emergent Gameplay is very much a key point of the game. Do you restore the Byzantine Empire from it's single holding of Constantinople? Do you attempt to conquer the new world as the Ottomans? Or do you follow the historical path of your country, such as colonizing the New World as Spain or Portugal? All of these scenarios are able to occur in the game, and feel immensely gratifying when completed.The Game plays like a charm, although I would recommend turning off Lucky Nations as they tend to skew the game in the AI's favour, with the game following the Earth's history a bit too closely. England, France, The Ottoman Empire, and Spain all usually end up becoming the defacto world powers with Lucky Nations set to historical. With Random Lucky Nations the game becomes a bit more interesting, but I would still say to turn this setting off.    The game also has a large learning curve, though the tutorial in the game helps you get the basics of the game down. The rest, however, is up to you to verse yourself in. You will lose. Often. But those often are not like those other strategy games such as Civilization. These losses teach you all kinds of interesting facets of the game. In no time you'll be ensuring the nation you're about to crush has no alliances with a more powerful Nation, or that they're currently weak thanks to fighting rebels that you spent some ducats to support.  Overall, I heartily recommend Europa Universalis IV. Though it's hard to get a grasp on the genre, Grand Strategy Games never fail to provide an entertaining, thrilling ride throughout a possible alternate timeline.			"

												Europa Universalis IV spans a longer duration of time from the end of the 100 years war right up to the Napoleonic Wars. Can easily mod that time dates so your game lasts much longer. When I first started playing this game just like Hearts of Iron III and Victoria 2 I was for a short time lost on how to play the game; however I quickly learnt how to manage a faction and to no suprise end up loving this game. SO lets have a pro and a con list to make it easier rather than writing paragraphs about the game:♥Pro's♥-A war exhaustion and overextension system which effects your nation and increases the chance of revolts that de-stabilises your country. As you take more land that isnt yours your over-extending so you will have to spend a slight duration of time to make that land your core (officially yours) to reduce revolts and to lower over-extension. This adds realism and an amazing fun factor.-Stability has a huge important part for your faction. As time goes on certain events or actions will make your nation go down in stability; therefore having an overall effect on your country.-Enjoyable colonisation system making it more realistic and yet straight forward to colonise other territories such as the Americas, Africa and Asia.-Good easy to set up multiplayer that lets you host games and have your friends drop in without the need of having an Himachi account. [Himachi sucks]-More in-depth diplomacy system as opposed to the previous paradox games.-Generals are the key as well as military, diplomatic and administrative advisors that all help give you bonuses as well as keep the morale of your armies up. Costs to have them though.-More improved system of having vassel states to reduce the amount of land you own which revenues 50% of its profit to you.-Small file size and easy to run.-Effective soundtrack.♥Cons♥-The ability to in-game not be able to change the name of your country without modding.-Price on Steam. Can wait for the sales or look elsewhere like Allkeysshop.com where you can get it 2/3 cheaper like I did.-At this current time for me on my mac book it does not add hours played time to my steam account; whilst on my laptop it does.

												Europa Universalis IV was published and developed by Paradox Interactive (a publisher and developer of niche games)Initially I want to point explicitly out that this game is for grand strategy game lovers and history geeks (including myself ;) )However, I'll start with the positve aspects of Europa Universalis IV. EU4 offers you a variety of nations to play. You can play with >260 natioms.It also has got a dynamic economic system that you can manipulate with trade ships or owned land in the certain trading node. I also enjoy the military and geopolitical factor in EU4 because its the best part in my opinion. The actual combat is pretty unique because unlike in the Total War series, it is like a board game. You have to pay a lot of attention to various factors: you have to pay attetion on your tech level, the terrain (NEVER underestimate the terrain), the morale of your troops and their discipline, if you play smart you can kill a larger army by simply having high morale, good tech, disciplin and a terrain advantage on the other side if you act stupid and attack an enemy that has got these advantages you'll possibly send your loyal troops into a deathtrap. This can be frustrating but it isn't the games fault your decision your fate.However, this is just one way annexing it in a peace deal there are more ways to get your empire to grow: gain territory through a personal union (royal marriges pay of) or vassilize the country and integrate it into your grandé nation.Another important game mechanic tool is the diplomacy you can ally, sabotage, create/join a coalition , support your allies. There's a lot more you can do it's just an insane amount of opportunities in order to make histroy as YOU like it. Now I'll come to the best part of that this game has to offer: the community, the community is smart, backstabbing :) and very into EU4. In addition to that there's also the genius modding community creating ahistoric mods, game improvements, essentially everthing that you search in the mods you'll find it! Now to the negative parts:There are not a lot of negative parts so i'll keep it as short as possible.- Not very stable multiplayer- localization issues with non english versionsWell thats all i have to complain about at the moment. I would totally recommend you buying EU4 if you're into history or/and strategy games because it will suck you in and steal all your free time. Thats it, if you dis/liked this review please comment it and I apoligize for spelling/grammar failures as I'm no native english speaker.			"

												Yes, Eu4 is a great strategy game. Not like Civ. or something else, PI intended to give players a vivid historical simulation and they've somehow made it. Despite some weird things that happens again and again (e.g. Ming splits in 1500s, Korea occupies Manchuria, Sulu and Tidore and some other countries in SE asia colonies Taiwan, Micronesia and sometimes Australia and etc.), it's a quite good game.However.- Can Paradox Interactive make fewer DLCs? I can hardly afford them.- Can Paradox Interactive support Chinese language? About tens of thousand players here are dying for it, and some of them turn to pirates for ""help"". Playing a pirate game is definitely illegal and immoral, but it's PI who lose money and business.			"

												If you like strategy games and history before WWII or heck even before the Victorian Era between 1444-1821, this game will fill that desire. If you like to bring countries like Austria, England, and France to their historical glory, you can. If you want to change the face of history like Ireland and Scotland conquering England or being able to dismantle the HRE before Napoleon in 1806, you can. If you want to create the massive trade and colonial empire a minor country like Portugal or the Netherlands tried to do, you can. If you even want to take part as a non-western tech country and manage to survive their conquering onslaught and in turn invade mainland Europe.... Europa Universalis IV can help you do all of this.			"

												With a large range of nations to play and a complex diplomatic system, EU IV manages to live up to it's previous title, EU III. The map is much more detailed now and the trade system is much more robust than in the previous game, even offering you a visual representation of the trade routes and trade areas.Thge religion system is also improved. For example, playing as a catholic nation, you can vote bishops by using your religious influence on the Papacy and the bishop may even become the Pope. The military system is also improved a slightly more detailed. It offeres a much easier to manage system wehre you can easily split your troops, move them or even recruit. There are also more types of rebels and even flags to represent them. They are much more powerful in comparison to EU III and if you're not careful they can really screw over your nation.The player has more control over colonization and how it works making you feel more in control of your empire. You can send colonists to a specific place (depending on your technologies) and you can either try to work together with the natives or send down an army and slaughter them all.The technology 'trees' have more to them now in comparison to the previous title and uses a point system to unlock different technology types. The point system is where the game unfortunatly the game fails. It offers three types of points, Administrative, Diplomatic and Military. All these are harnessed over time but the speed they are harrnesed at depend on your monarch and the advisors you have. With these points you can unlock new technologies, reduce your over-expansion, increase stability,decrease inflation and etc. This system makes the game feel way too arcadish, and you'll find yourself finding all sorts of ways to aquire these points but they make no sense realistically. the Europa Universalis series was very popular for it's somewhat realistic approach to things, making it more of a historical sandbox simulator rather than a Star Craft like RTS except on a huge map, trade and diplomacy. It is also far less challenging to achieve certain things in the game like form a commonwealth or a nation (but that's not always true, some are still fairly challenging).All in all it is still an enjoyable game and it's even more enjoyable if you're playing it with the MEIOU and Taxes mod which offers a much more robust religious system, more historicaly accurate map, general rebalances and much more.

												If you like strategy games and history before WWII or heck even before the Victorian Era between 1444-1821, this game will fill that desire. If you like to bring countries like Austria, England, and France to their historical glory, you can. If you want to change the face of history like Ireland and Scotland conquering England or being able to dismantle the HRE before Napoleon in 1806, you can. If you want to create the massive trade and colonial empire a minor country like Portugal or the Netherlands tried to do, you can. If you even want to take part as a non-western tech country and manage to survive their conquering onslaught and in turn invade mainland Europe.... Europa Universalis IV can help you do all of this.			"

												It's a good game but Paradox continues to make me hate. They bring crucial updates under the name of ""DLC"" and they sell them more expensive then the actual game. Transfering occupation, developing provinces and many many more. Wtf paradox? I'd pirate it instead of buying if i knew it.			"

												EU4 is a complex game but an incredible amount of fun and reasonably accessible. You play as a historical nation from 1444 and its course through history is yours to take. It's essentially a geopolitics simulator. Ever wanted to re-enact the American Revolution? How about a British Empire 400 years early? Or what about going totally ahistorical and doing something like colonising Canada with the Tibetans? You can do it all. History buffs and 4X gamers, this is a great title and has everything you could ever want.			"

												First of all, let me say that I've been playing the hell out of this game since version 2.  I had pre-ordered version 4, but didn't get time to really play it in depth until recently.  Despite some of the critcism that follows, I've never regretted a cent that I spent on this software.EU stands tall in the pantheon of strategy games.  It is both a world building game (cousin to civilization, Master of Magic) and an historical game (operational war games, Harpoon, etc.)  It has enormous depth and historical accuracy.  The developers have done a great deal to expose all of the game's variables to tinkering : diplomacy, military, espionage, economics.  It invites, no, insists on micromanagement.  EU is not one of those games you knock out in an hour or so.  A completed game demands many hours over the course of days.  I play solo.  I'm not a social wargamer.  When I do play socially, it's generally on a tabletop at my local hobby store facing a real opponent.  So my first criticism has to do with the A.I. opponent.  The AI in this game has gone from challenging to brutal to (in v.4) psycho.  An historical game like this one, should include both a sandbox mode and an easy mode.  EU has an 'easy' setting ... it's the only one I've ever played and the AI on the 'easy' setting is, I say again, psycho.  One slip up, or sometimes no slip ups and all of a sudden, with little or no warning, twenty heavyweight high-tech countries gang up on you and destroy the country to worked so hard to build.  This has been a weakness in the game from the very beginning.Next concerns a couple of specific rule changes in v.4.  Version 4, overall, seems to favor historical accuracy over historical variation, to the point ot shoving the player into an historical box.  In version 3, I was able to colonize the New World with both Venice and Naples.  Version 4 makes that difficult if not impossible.  Even if you manage to get troops across the Atlantic and seize a native province, you can't core it, and thus, yoiu can't create an overseas empire.  Also, the idea of 'rivals', along with a penalty for not picking them is another example.  It narrows, not expands the player's choice of diplomatic strategies.If you've never played this game, and you're reading this review, don't let the above critcisms put you off.  If you like this sort of game, EU IV is a great choice.  It will give you many hours of challenge and enjoyment.  The game plays well with Windows (try pausing, then ctrl-esc).  It also has a robust API that many users have used to create interesting variations.			"

												I highly recommend this game to any strategy buff. It is better than Total War and Civ by far IMO due to its design. It is real time and may seem complicated to play with the overwhelming interface, but it really isn't. Their are no resources like food or wood to micromanage for example, all you have to worry about on the surface is stability,unrest and your income. Other things like war exhaustion and aggressive expansion come into play also during conquest.The diplomacy in this game is the most functional I have ever encountered in a strategy game and has real consequences.You can know based on your diplomatic score how nations will react to you most of the time which comes in very handy. For example, when deciding to declare war on a common foe unlike Total War or Civ you will know beforehand if they will join you or not based on various factors, you will also know whom you will be up against. Diplomacy is essential to your survival, and can really make or break your game. You are not likely to survive or progress in the early to mid stages of the game if you do not form alliances. If you are too aggressive and ♥♥♥♥ off the wrong people, coalitions will form and attack you and force you to give up territories.The game is real time and you can adjust the speed to speed up during slower times in between conquests or to slow down to micromanage your troops and events at a pace that is comfortable for you. This was a breath of fresh air for me coming from Total War Rome 2 where campaigns can take 40 hours or more to complete. Depending on how fast you set the time it is possible to finish a campaign depending on your goals in around 10-12 hours. Additionally, all nations are available to play each presenting the player with a unique challenge and experience. This game is a sandbox game, so there are no ""victory conditions"" unlike in Civilization or Total War, which gives you total freedom to pursue Ironman achievements, focus on building a trade empire, colonize, lead a crusade, overthrow the Holy Roman Empire, become the Emperor and many more. For example, you can play as The Ottomans who have the best starting position in the game or you can play as The Knights of Rhodes who have nothing but a tiny island and are in one of the worst starting positions in the game, being threatened by The Ottomans for a different challenge.It is totally up to you. There is nothing more satisfying than triumphing as a small nation over larger foes through skill and diplomacy.Every game plays out differently due to the AI RNG which allows for almost infinite replayability. There are many achievements to get that are very rewarding and challenging if you play in Ironman mode. DLC:There are quite a few DLC that are essential to getting the full experience out of the game. They are good in that they add new features that are blocked behind a paywall in the base game but bad in that you have to pay extra for them. The reality is that most of them are not essential to the game but Art of War and Common Sense should be the ones any player has at a minimum.The DLC can be found on sale typically during steam sales for very cheap or you can go to 3rd party sites to find them for an affordable price if you don't want to pay full price.The learning curve is steep and I am still learning things so it is highly recommended that you search the wiki and watch YouTube videos to learn the fundamentals of the game as the tutorial is seriously lacking.Overall as a complete game. I cannot say enough good things about it. It is currently IMO the best grand strategy game on the market even with the DLC business model. 10/10			"

												Nearly 1200 hours in this game and I cannot recommend it. Ultimately I (probably) got a positive return on my time investment in terms of hours, but I can't say how many of those hours in this game were entertaining. It's odd to think that - so many DLC and patches into EU IV's lifecycle - I think the game was better earlier. The fundamental problem is the DLC, and I'm not talking about the pricing. Please allow me to explain:Each DLC adds new mechanics to the games. Everything from new vassal interactions to ""estates"" which you can ""interact"" with (i.e. click a few buttons) that attempt to add some flavor to the internal management of your chosen nation (an aspect of the game which is decidely weak). You might be seeing the problem already. If each DLC adds a new ""feature de jure"" but Paradox can never be certain who has what DLC and what combination of paid addons they may be playing, each DLC is essentialy its own little island.The game has become a monstrous patchwork. An inelegant frankenstein of DLC features that were sold for prime in their day and are rarely touched again. The game stops looking like a cohesive whole and instead appears more as a checklist of which features you've bought and paid for and those you have yet to purchase.It's a shame, really. However, just like with so many things in life, simplicity does not necessarily mean spartan, brevity is not always pithy. EU IV exchanges holistic gameplay structures for something cobbled together out of some very expensive bricks.			"

												This game is essentially a simpler version of Crusader Kings or a more complicated version of Civ. It ends up playing a lot more like Crusader Kings than I had imagined. It just doesn't have all of the people and duchies and the like to deal with.The map is great and being able to play with a preposterously large number of nations is very appealing. I like the missions that one can choose that are tied to one's nation as the flavor text makes them feel more historical.The interface is bad. Epically bad, as with Crusader Kings. When you have a base game and then tack on a bunch of extra features made by different people, it clearly shows. Even playing through the tutorial and having played both Crusader Kings and Stellaris before, it was difficult to get around.Recommended if you're really into historical strategy. Not a good choice for a quick, casual playthrough.			"

												if paradox made a chair, they'd sell the legs and backrest as individual DLC for $15 each, and they'd probably take away the seat after a while, paint it in some wacky colour-scheme, tape on a d i l d o and re-sell it to you for another 10 or 15 dollarst. kojak			"

												Nearly 1200 hours in this game and I cannot recommend it. Ultimately I (probably) got a positive return on my time investment in terms of hours, but I can't say how many of those hours in this game were entertaining. It's odd to think that - so many DLC and patches into EU IV's lifecycle - I think the game was better earlier. The fundamental problem is the DLC, and I'm not talking about the pricing. Please allow me to explain:Each DLC adds new mechanics to the games. Everything from new vassal interactions to ""estates"" which you can ""interact"" with (i.e. click a few buttons) that attempt to add some flavor to the internal management of your chosen nation (an aspect of the game which is decidely weak). You might be seeing the problem already. If each DLC adds a new ""feature de jure"" but Paradox can never be certain who has what DLC and what combination of paid addons they may be playing, each DLC is essentialy its own little island.The game has become a monstrous patchwork. An inelegant frankenstein of DLC features that were sold for prime in their day and are rarely touched again. The game stops looking like a cohesive whole and instead appears more as a checklist of which features you've bought and paid for and those you have yet to purchase.It's a shame, really. However, just like with so many things in life, simplicity does not necessarily mean spartan, brevity is not always pithy. EU IV exchanges holistic gameplay structures for something cobbled together out of some very expensive bricks.			"

												This is an amazing strategy, it has ~400 year time span in game(irl over 5 hours depanding on how many times you pause the in-game clock), and you can play as any state between 1444-1821. This game is a few years old and that may mean to other games quaulity is declining, but with this game upadates are regular, but currently the $15-$20 dlc policy will cost you $120 extra, unless you buy them on while on sale, which will make the ~$48(at least for me), but just the base game is good enough(the updates usually inclued free content in the base game). All 'n all, Europa Universalis IV (Eu4) is worth a buy.			"

												This game is essentially a simpler version of Crusader Kings or a more complicated version of Civ. It ends up playing a lot more like Crusader Kings than I had imagined. It just doesn't have all of the people and duchies and the like to deal with.The map is great and being able to play with a preposterously large number of nations is very appealing. I like the missions that one can choose that are tied to one's nation as the flavor text makes them feel more historical.The interface is bad. Epically bad, as with Crusader Kings. When you have a base game and then tack on a bunch of extra features made by different people, it clearly shows. Even playing through the tutorial and having played both Crusader Kings and Stellaris before, it was difficult to get around.Recommended if you're really into historical strategy. Not a good choice for a quick, casual playthrough.			"

												I really wanted to recommend this game, and at one time I could, but at this point, I cannot.I won't go too far into it, there are hundreds of similar reviews sprinkled throughout the base game and the DLC that say it all. The game has pretty much become a cash-grab with all of the numerous DLC that either don't add much to the game, or cripple you if you don't get it. That, and some questionable mechanics changes (Like blocking strait crossings being useless now), renders this a rather lackluster game. If everything, that being the base game and all DLC, were $20-40, then sure, it's worth it. But ~$240 (I realize this is considering all DLC, not just the pure expansions) is not a good price.			"

												This game, for being a complex grand strategy game, is very beginner friendly. I am relatively new to the genre, and only played Crusader Kings II before this game. It has decent tutorials, and a vastly improved interface that is easy to navigate. That does not mean it is oversimplified, however, and there are a lot of aspects of government and colonization to manage. EUIV has the capacity to provide hundreds of hours of gameplay, and I highly recommend it!			"

Europa Universalis IV (V. 1.12.2.0)Europa Universalis IV is a historical simulation / grand strategy game developed by Paradox Interactive. First released almost two years ago back in August 2013, the game continues to receive regular updates and instalments in the form of DLCs, the most recent of which - Common Sense - was released in June 2015. Starting in the year 1444 and ending in 1821, the game gives you the chance to rule any nation in the world during the era of Colonisation, when the nations of Europe explored the world in search of new land and riches. This review will focus predominantly on Gameplay due to how important it is to the game, but because of the word limit I will not be able to cover everything.GameplayIn the game, you are given control of any country you choose throughout the world, in any time period between 1444-1821. Being a grand strategy, there are a lot of things to focus on. One of the most central features of Europa Universalis IV is technology, which you must upgrade throughout the course of the game by generating and spending points (commonly referred to as monarch points), which are gained each month in-game and are split into three areas: Administration, Diplomacy and Military. Points are generated based on the skills of your leader and your leaders advisors, who cost gold (in-game ducats) to employ, but along with generating points can also give other bonus modifiers to your nation. You are given the ability to focus on a specific area if you deem it necessary, at the cost of losing points in the other categories. Technology is split into the same three categories as the points, and have up to thirty-two levels. As you progress, being ahead in technology gives you bonuses over other nations in the game, at the cost of the next technology level costing more because you're ahead of time. Being ahead in technology, as well as other things, contributes towards your Game Score, which merely gives you a ranking to see how well you're performing in comparison to other nations. Where you start geographically in the game decides your nation's technology group, of which there are a few. The further away you move from Europe, upgrading your technology costs more monarch points, which means it takes longer. As a balance however, the lower your technology group, the more monarch points you can generate and store. When playing as a non-Western nation, you have the ability to 'Westernize' once you border a Western nation, on the condition that you're behind on at least seven levels of technology. After reaching the fifth level of Administrative Technology, you can unlock an Idea Group in one of the three main areas of Administration, Diplomacy and Military, which you can progress along by spending monarch points. Every nation in the game starts out with National Ideas, which give extra bonus modifiers to your nation and can be unlocked through completing ideas in Idea Groups. Once Idea Groups are completed, some can be paired together to set National Policies, which can give you extra bonus modifiers at the cost of a single monarch point in that policy's key area (e.g. an Administrative policy costs you one Administrative point monthly in-game to maintain).There are many other things you will have to spend your monarch points on, so spend them wisely. There are other points which you will have to focus on: Stability, Prestige and Legitimacy and Power Projection. Stability is the overall strength of your nation, and if it is positive, that will give bonuses to your nation. If it is in the negative, it will give penalties. Prestige is how noteworthy you are, and has the same impact as Stability. Legitimacy is the strength of your ruler; the less Legitimacy your ruler has, the less authority they have. Power Projection is how imposing you are towards other nations, and this depends on how active you are against your nation’s Rivals, which you can choose throughout the game. Alongside all of this, you will have the help of various invisible individuals who you can send around on various tasks. You will have Diplomats who you use to improve relations and form alliances, or even fabricate claims and declare war on nations. You will have Merchants which you use to steer trade and collect trade from various nodes, and Missionaries to help convert land. A key feature of the game can be utilised through Colonists, who – once unlocked – can be sent to colonise regions like the Americas and Africa. Finally, you must build your armies independently (based on Infantry, Cavalry and later Cannons) and hire generals to lead them. Navies are also built independently, with various units built for specific purposes. Provinces can be improved with various buildings that grant bonuses, and the more Development a province has the more buildings you can build in them. Random events will occur from time to time, which can either have positive or negative effects depending on what decision you pick. Considering all of this – and other aspects I haven’t even covered – I’d recommend that players take a good long while to explore the mechanics of the game before becoming too ambitious in their aims, particularly as the User Interface does have a few hidden yet incredibly important pieces of information players should keep an eye on.Graphics and SoundThe world map is displayed beautifully, and features many useful and varying map modes to give you all the information you might need to digest from just a quick glance. Decorated with beautiful terrain and sprites, it’s easy to spend hours just surveying the map without any in-game time actually passing. The soundtrack is also quite enjoyable to listen to, and in Paradox’s usual style of thinking outside of the box, the addition of heavy metal music to the soundtrack makes playing the game even more enjoyable, if not just for the music itself. Three Pros and ConsPros:+ Perfect for fans of history, and a must have grand strategy for any armchair general or wannabe dictator. + Every game is unique, so you can play again and again with many different outcomes. + Workshop-supported; community content gives the game even more replay value.Cons:- Hard learning curve; in-built game tutorial is severely lacking. - The User Interface can be incredibly overwhelming at first, and a lot of crucial numbers and modifiers are hidden in the tool tips with no obvious pointers as to where they are. - Certain features depend on whether the player owns a particular DLC, which narrows down the possibilities with the base game.ConclusionEuropa Univeralis IV is the physical definition of Grand Strategy; limitless possibilities await you as you lead your chosen nation to a glorious future. Whether you follow history or change it is up to you, and the goals of the game are your own. A definite must-have, the game will have you hooked for hours and is a momentous challenge, but I can guarantee you that it will not be a waste of time.Nominated for a Steam Award 2016			"

I could simply make a new game from scratch with GameMaker or Unity or SDL and I would have more fun and control on it without a ton of DLCs that are there only because they are lazy, greedy and must pay their mortgages or their rent or their monthly new car payments..P.S.: I do not like iron man so that is the reason I do not have achievements..

												No longer recommending this after close on 3,700 hours.EU series is meant to be played as Austria. That country is purposefully given far too much weight because Heil Hapless Hapsburg (hapsderp, haw haw). o/Of course, we've so much DLC That DLC has become an inbred monster of a thing, which is fitting. Edit: To clarify and come across as less spiteful, I wonder where the slavish kow-towing to the HRE comes from -not one of the more well-known global empires ever. There's even a non-toggleable dedicated UI element to them for their mini-game (dull as dishwater but you're -supposed- to care about it for some reason). See, if the series was set in Europe alone, this would have merit, but the whole world is opened up and yet somehow the Great Mughals or Ming are supposed to care about a small mini-empire far far away (Austria, default country of interest sooner or later, wherever or whatever you may be playing -true story).I have never understood this virtual hapsderp Austria Shrine (Prussia is PDX's second, lesser wet dream nation). Similarly, finished with the corporate money grubbing as a point of principle as well.Anyone have a good book recommendation?			"

												I have tried very hard to like this game, and I have played it for quite a considerable amount of time in both a singleplayer and multiplayer capacity. I just can't like this game, it is objectively bad in almost all criteria.Some say all the additions made to it since it first came out have been a good thing, however, in my mind overall it has left the game a bloated mess with far too many small features and systems with nothing coherent to hold all of it together. Victoria 2 has a pop system underlying everything, Hearts of Iron has its military system as the basis for the whole game and Crusader Kings' main feature is the dynasty system. They all have a clear direction. Ask yourself what EU4's main fundamental core is and you are left wondering.Those other 3 Paradox games I mentioned all feel like you are actually living through a period in history, and you can at least feel like you are playing something meaningful, but EU4 has nothing that brings it to life. It's just an assortment of loosely connected numbers over an extremely ugly-looking playdough map that not even visual mods can fix. For example, when an estate gets too much influence, it does not conjure historical ideas or images of the nobility of your realm having too much of a say in your nation's affairs: it's just an arbitrary number that needs to be below 80 or else bad things happen.The military system is pathetic; as much as there appears to be a lot of nuances; in the end it completely boils down to rolling dice. Not only is the combat itself purely luck-based, the quality of the generals who lead your forces is also random. The fort system is a complete disaster. The idea of army movement being hindered by forts is alright, but the provinces on the map are far too big for it to work properly. Your army can somehow be totally blocked from moving by a fortress which in geographical terms is hundreds of miles away.The only enjoyable thing about it is the brief gratification of blobbing your empire. You might as well take a blank map of the world on MS Paint and start painting it with your favourite colour, rather than spending an arm and a leg to buy EU4 and all its endless DLC. Hordes of /r/paradoxplaza zombies who are normally ardent socialists will unironically defend Paradox's breathtaking greed when it comes to downloadable content, which would make even Donald Trump raise an eyebrow.

												Too much DLC. Way too much DLC. Even with a 75% off sale and excluding stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥like the ebooks, this game is near $60 dollars. Moreover, the DLC is constantly changing the gameplay in ways you might not like (2014 EU4=/2016 EU4). Don't buy the DLC? Have fun playing a stripped down version balanced around that DLC but with all the new features disabled. That's not even including the new bugs introduced (some DLC releases have made my game unplayable for weeks). Enough is enough Paradox, I had fun but I think it's time I got off this crazy train of yours. I hope you're happy with all the money you made off of me.			"

												If you want to spend a huge amount of money on a cancerous DLC policy, this is the game for you.Every new DLC release Paradox overhauls the game with a patch, adding ""brand new"" features and complicating features that were fine and locking the use of those ""new and improved"" features (that weren't there before and not entirely necessary) to anyone who hasn't bought the DLC.11/10 would go bankrupt again.

The only bad thing i would say is that if your not running more than the pc requirements, getting achievements requires ironman mode which forces monthly autosaving and this can cause some lag if your not running more than the requirements.

												Calling Europa Universalis IV only as a grand strategy game won't do justice to it. Rather, it is also a history simulator.In your usual strategy game franchises like Civilization and Age of Empires, you start equally from zero: a first city, a few citizens / worker, no significant military power, no obvious technological advantages, and sometimes randomized map. Things are quite different in EUIV, since it's really asymmetric. Big nations like Ottoman or Austria have a powerful military, rich provinces and strong diplomatic influence from start, while small nations like one-province Albania or Irish nations have a few number of army and frightening neighbors. Technology starts almost the same, but from time to time European powers will almost always have a big technological advantages against Asian, African and Native American nations.This game don't shy away from the fact of European hegemony in 1444-1821. However, that doesn't mean the European power will always ""win"" the game. In fact, most of the satisfying experience is turning the tide of history: trample the Iberian shores as Aztec, invade British isles as an Indian nation, prevent European from getting a foothold in the Spice Islands as South East Asian nations, or, if you are crazy enough, try to conquer the world as Ryukyu, a Japanese one-province nation in nowadays Okinawa. Playing smart with intricate network of diplomacy is the key here, as waging war is not only the solution.EUIV is also sometimes an overwhelming game for many people. It is complex, have a steep learning curve and the in-game tutorial is not really helping. It's best to read the wiki and watch other people's play to learn and refine your playing skill, as many nations have very different playing strategy, style and even gameplay mechanics. The number of DLC is also overwhelming, but actually the essential ones aren't that many.There are many gameplay elements that I didn't cover here, like economy and trade, religion, rebel, colony, diplomatic relations, justification of war (Casus Belli), military and battle mechanics, internal factions, etc. But that's another topic for another day.

												Has a tough learning curve that takes time to overcome. I would recommend watching a 'Let's Play' series to get an idea of how the game works. Jumping in blind can be intimidating and frustrating, so just spend a little time getting a basic idea of what's in store. Stick with it and you will be rewarded with one of the greatest grand strategy games released.Absolutely would recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy. Very few games can offer unique playthroughs with this level of planning and strategy involved. If you play the length of the game, it really has a great sense of growth, development, and progress as you take on challenged and achieve goals. 150+ hrs into this game and I still find new ways to improve from my last playthrough. Only BAD thing is some of the expansions are, essentially, required to play the ""full game"" at this point. Fortunately, they are priced fairly and after a few games you'll want them anyways. :)10/10			"

												This game is a masterpiece. As someone new to the Europa series yet a lover of Crusader Kings II, this game improves and adds upon what Crusader Kings had. It no longer features the intrinsic and complex balancing of nobles, ministers, and agents but instead takes the complexity of balancing people and changes it to balancing a nation. This time, the entire world is the map and the player has the ability to choose between 1444 and when it ends in 1821 for a timeframe. Civilizations range from Portugal, England, Denmark, Bohemia, Venice, Ottomans, in Europe (plus many, many minor factions like Brunswick, Aragon, Hesse, Burgundy, Utrecht, etc.) to the Ming Dynasty in China or the Date, Shimazu, Uesugi, and other clans in Japan to the Aztec, Maya, Iroqouis, Inca, or Huron tribes of the Americas. Now there is the ability to research technologies and form ideologies which help to shape the focus of your empire. Do you want to have a small, yet qualified military to protect your trading empire? Or a massive military with no desire for colonization? Do you want to create spies to infliltrate and sabotage relations of other nations, ending alliances? Or maybe cause a rebellion to rise before declaring war? The world is in your hand in this game, it is still just as complex and beautifully deep as other Paradox strategy games, but now it is mastered. I would heartily recommend this game to anybody who likes deep strategy and does not care just about explosions, Star Craft or Total War styled battles.			"

												Absolutely brilliant grand strategy from Paradox as always. Interesting mechanics, a huge array of choices as who to play, great fun even if you're playing as some minor Asian nation and a brilliant modding community and randomness to each game that provides unlimited replayability. If you want a grand strategy that provides challenge, immersion and depth then this is the game for you.It's not without it's faults, namely it's worryingly large number of bugs, but Paradox is constantly patching and updating the game on an almot monthly basis fixing most as the pop up. Multiplayer can be a bit funny, but I've had great fun playing it online with a few friends, conquering entire continents between us. Furthermore, many nations provide a very interesting situation where you must tread carefully and take risks to advance, which is something I feel lacking in many strategy games. I often find many games lackjing any real sense of risk, more often a simple pattern holding true to each game. EU4 overcomes this rather well. Nations like Najd, Songhai or any of the Infian nations provide great interesting events and challenges, with even more round the corner when the Europeans turn up at your door!Overall I'd rate this an 8/10. I've personally never encountered a single bug, but I'm aware other in the community have to great extent and so it would be foolish to pretend they don't exist. Certainly this game is playable and most of all, fun. If you enjoy any paradox game, you'll enjoy this.			"

												Europa Universalis IV is one of the most interesting, time-consuming and genre-defining ""grand strategy"" games ever made.You can control any country in the world (Native American tribes, Mongol Hordes, the pope, Holy Roman Empire) in the Age of Discovery (1444-1805). Every nation, howsoever small, has the chance to become a superpower in colonizing, rading, land war or naval warfare.This game is hard to learn, but if you watch some tutorials, play for yourself, watch some more tutorials and play some more, you acquire the required knowledge to have a lot of fun.Paradox Development Studio is also known for improving their games by adding more stuff (free patches and major game changing DLCs) to the game, even years after the releases.It's definitely worth buying for the full price, if you have enough time to spend.

												One of the best games I have ever played. Paradox truly is the one stop shop for Grand Strategy. If you like your games simple and without strategy there are plenty of brain dead games out there you can passively be entertained by....but if you love a game that challenges you and continues to suprise you with its nuance and complexity, then fire this game up as soon as it is done downloading. Unlike when Creative Assembly rolls out more paid DLC for a broken release....it seems the game has always been complete, but every DLC adds to the complex tapestry that is this game. Warning: Take a bathroom break, remember to eat, and maybe set a timer in case you have a tendency to get sucked down that rabbit hole. Enjoy!			"

												Eu4 is one of the few games I have ever become truly addicted too. I have played many for a fair amount of time but would always eventually get bored. I now have over 1000 hours in eu4, a thing I thought I would never do in a video game. The raw potentiality in this game is what keeps bringing me back. You can play any nation in the world and bring them to glory or ruin, thus putting you in the same roll as all great conquerors and statesmen have held. Power is addicting, and this game is a power simulator. The updates have over time drastically changed the game, and although I would not say it has really gotten better, it has changed. Overall this is an absolute must play. Sure the learning curve is more like a cliff than anything else and France will end up screwing with you, but in the end it is an amazingly fun sandbox Empire builder. And thats why I give it a solid 10/10			"

Love the fact it's been released a long time ago, yet they keep on adding new stuff, mechanics etc. If you're new to the game, i heartly reccomend going for Complete edition with all DLCs or you'd be missing on lot of fun. I personally see Paradox DLC strategy as good way to keep this awesome game going. It's lot cheaper than playing some MMO for example and with every DLC you also get completely free expansion.Also important to note that if you play this with friend / friends (which is btw the best way to go) only ONE of you (Host) needs the DLCs, so in the end it's not that costy. Also you can always bring someone ""aboard"" with only basic EU4 that is sometimes on sale for almost nothing and by hosting they get access to everything you purchased earlier. Don't know of any other game that does this. Over and all - This is the BEST Historical Grand Strategy game i've ever played. If you want different era, please see other Paradox products (Hearts of Iron, Stellaris).			"

												A complex strategy game where you can play from a multiple of civilizations. This game has a million possiblities with it and although the gameplay is very complex at first, it gets very addicting fast. If you like strategy games I reccommend this one as you are able to do a wide variety of things while still being challenged by other civilizations or ways of playing.			"

As long as they continue to give us the free content, I will be more than happy to buy the paid DLC from Gaben (druing sales).

												If you are in general a fan of war, history, strategy, trade or Europe, or more specifically European warfare, the strategy of European warfare, the history of the strategy of European warfare, or especially the history of the strategy of European warfare, politics, trade and nationhood during the Age of Exploration, this game should pique your interest. To get a taste of the game, I'll just tell you what happened in my last campaign: After conquering the Zapotecs and Mayans over the course of a century long series of conflicts, the Aztec Empire experienced a golden age of peace and prosperity where mountains of wealth were stored away for future use. This all ended when the European powers suddenly colonized and cornered the Empire on both sides: the Portuguese to the south at the Yucatan and the Norwegian to the north on the Gulf of Mexico. Immediately Portugal attacked. To prevent its eminent destruction by a more technologically advanced nation, the Empire converted to Catholicism, became Defender of the Faith, westernized and went to war with the Protestant heathens to the north. Over the course of three wars with Norway, the Empire successfully converted its people to the new religion and actually obtained more influence in the Papal Curia than Portugal had. Despite the Aztecs conquering Protestant territory up to the mouth of the Mississippi, successfully converting the entire country to Catholicism, and having good trade relations and national reputation with Portugal, the Portuguese eventually attacked again, sacked Tenochtitlan, bankrupted the Empire and stole away the Yucatan peninsula from its rightful owners. It seems that in the trifecta of war (God, Glory and Greed) Greed has been and always will trump what is religiously right. If you learn anything from that it should be playing non-European countries is hard. But even on the hardest difficulty, this game is very fun and will result in some amazing stories. Also! If you do decide to buy this game, please don't forget to play with the music on. The soundtrack will make you feel much more badass when you play. Trust me.			"

												Very complex strategic game. I've played a lot of Total War and some Civ games but if you want a realistic strategy game, I think this one is by far the best out there. Not a single campaign is the same, which is why I've played this so much. Here's a small list of advantages and disadvantages:+ very realistic and historical  + enormous amount of playable countries, most of them with unique ideas and events+ literally can't get bored once you're hooked up+ DLC's  add a lot of features, good price if on sale IMO. Are a must if you are a fanboy like me+ I've got 500 hours and I still learn new things every campaign+ Game is very balanced IMO, it's not like Total War where most of my campaigns look kind of the same+ Mods are available and bring interesting features- DLC's are expensive and there are a lot of them, only buy them if you like the standard game- very hard learning curve due to the absurdly complex of interreacting features- only the major DLC's are worth it- if you like to battle yourself like in Total War, this isn't possible "

												Europa Universalis IV is grand strategy at its best. It is epic in scale and depth, with literally an entire world to explore over three of the most dynamic centuries in history. It manages to create a completely believable world that pays homage to the forces that have shaped history while simultaneously giving you the opportunity and tools to reshape it in anyway you please. The sheer number of features and mechanics at work can be a bit overwhelming. The interface certainly takes some getting used to as you are inundated with bewildering amounts of information. However, as you gradually learn to master these features and mechanics, you crave every bit of scrumptious data as your actions both affact and are dictated by then. This is a refreshing stand against the plethora of games that continously dumb down in order to appeal to mass audiences. The real weakness in this game is suggested in the name. While the European playthroughs are as fleshed out and fun as you would expect, those in other regions of the world are noticeably less so. Certainly, the developer is slowly working to address this problem. Through patches and expansions, places like East Asia and the Americas will become more fully developed with more nations and features. Still, the general focus on Europe hurts the otherwise immersive game experience. Completely recomended for strategy gamers, cartophiles, and lovers of history. 9/10			"

												Sinking many hours into this game, tearing it apart in every way possible this is my review.We'll start with the pros and cons.Pros:+ There's constant updates and DLC release keeping you hooked on new content.+ A very strong and thriving community with a lot of mods, youtube videos, streamers etc.+ Paradox's way of handling DLC is the best I have seen with any developer.+ Replayability and diversity in the gameplay.+ The scale and scope of the game is unmatchable.+ Fun gameplay lasting for many hours (assuming you get into it).+ Save file compatability with it's sister game Crusader Kings II.+ Great music and very diverse music DLC.+ Finding a balance between fun gameplay and historical settings.+ Many unique and historical achievements that will fill your belly with joy.+ Sweden is overpowered!Cons:- Very complicated and confusing gameplay at first resulting in a very steep learning curve.- Gameplay can sometimes be very boring and dull, especially with a low performance computer.- Tooltips can sometimes be flawed and will show the wrong information.- Finding bugs is quite common, but constant updates usually keeps up pretty good.- A full playthrough takes a long time and saves may not be compatible with the next update, so look out!- Sweden is overpowered!Multiplayer is a blast playing with your friends, but because of the nature of the game you can't really play with strangers. Sitting down and playing a full game with a stranger will simply take too long.  But playing with your friends is a load of fun. You can also play modded EU4 online and the multiplayer host's DLC will be activated for everybody in that game.Singleplayer is a lot of fun. You can select any country, Europe, Asia, Africa, America, anywhere and play as that country.  There are a couple of scenarios that you can start with, the first 4 scenarios takes place on the date 11/11/1444 the different scenarios centres on different regions and time periods in the world and shows what countries are interesting choices during that time period. The game is earliest started in 1444 and the game ends in 1821. You can choose scenarios like 'The American Revolution' where Britain, the USA are some of the interesting choices. You can choose the scenario 'Revolutionary France' where France is an interesting choice along with Russia and the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth are interesting choices due to them being involved in a war. There's lots of achievements to do achievement runs on, they are all quite unique and are loads of fun. E.g. 'Poland can into space!' Reach tech 32 as Poland, 'Georgia on my mind', conquer all 3 Georgias and 'Marshy March' have a march with at least 2 marshes. These can be challanging and even impossible. Giving all this content adds to great replayability.DLC is handeled very nicely with DLC being released 2-4 months between eachother. DLC costs about 15€ and old DLC features slowly gets added into the game through updates, so you can simply wait for some features if you don't have access to all DLC. Of course cosmetics like skinpacks and music packs can often be purchased for less than 3€.This game really takes grand strategy to a new level. The scope of the game is huge and the amazing work of paradox is unbeatable by any other strategy game. This is definately the best grand strategy game in the world and probably one of the best strategy games in the world. Learning the game takes a while and it's hard to perfect your skill. Watching youtube videos of people playing the game is one of the best ways to get into it. Try Arumba, Sheryrr and Quill18 and their friends as they play this game and takes it very in depth.My verdict:Most strategy games have a very steep learning curve and this will not affect the score as this was intentional by the devs.I'd say that this game scores a  94/100The missing 6 points consists of the bugs, the tooltip issues and saves incompatability to new updates (even though the latter is understandable.)Thanks Paradox, this game is your best one yet. Keep it up! //Simon			"

												I wasted half a lifetime on this game, so i think I owe it a review. Ok, for starters: if you're not into strategy games (yet), you can stop reading now. This game is not going to get you into the genre. If you already like your Total War, your Civilization and your Age of Empires and you want something bigger, harder and more complex: Paradox Interactive has you covered. They have grand strategy games in just about any historical time where people liked to kill other people in a somewhat orderly fashion. And they're all good. Hell, some of them are great, and especially Crusader Kings II is a gem which you should definitely check out. But Europa Universalis IV is the best of the lot, and far easier to get into. The UI is better, the visuals and soundtrack are pretty, and the modding community is large and awesome. The updates and DLC are also still coming out regularly. The price combined with the DLC's may seem quite pricey, and perhaps it's best to wait for a sale, but most of the updates have always been free, and the DLC is never absolutely required for a full experience - *angry glare at CK II*. I still think it's worth it, though: You can pour hundreds of hours into the base game, and hundreds more into the mods. Of course, the game isn't perfect. Paradox's Multiplayer tends to be as stable as your relationship with your girlfriend after they just released a new game. Europa Universalis IV doesn't quite go down to the usual♥♥♥♥♥♥drinkingly bad level, but the regular desync or bug which requires everyone to restart their ****** game again (which also takes ages) before you can continue again can become an annoyance fairly quickly. The Tutorial is also a pile of garbage, and I recommend to just watch a let's play on youtube instead. But all in all, watching my Etheopian Empire stretch from Egypt to South Africa, holding off the English an the Portuguese colonists, and winning that crucial battle against the ottomans... There is no greater feeling in this world. 9/10 recommended.			"

												EUIV is a very well designed game, but the entry cost is a bit high. The tutoral isn't as helpful or as in-depth as it needed to be to serve as a strong introduction to the game; it also was apparently unupdated for patches and DLC/Expansions. After the initial time investment (I spent around 8 hours actually learning how to do various things in the game) and a trip to the wiki (eu4wiki), the massive depth of the game really shines through. The randomness of the game allows for a massive amount of replayability, which combines well with the sheer size of the game to create an experience that can last for hundreds, if not thousands, of hours. There are a few nitpicks, especially when the game refuses to say why something can't be done. There are certain moments when very unrealistic things can really break the immersion and tone of the game which is both a flaw and a testament to how well the rest of the game handles realism.While this certainly isn't something that everyone would like, and there is a good deal of time and effort input required to glean any experience from the game, the reward is an immensely deep and lengthy, yet enjoyable experience.EDIT: A note on the DLC policy of the game: The game is constantly being updated (both with improvements and some poorly thought-out mechanics) and DLC is intended to fund this. The different DLC have very different value-to-cost ratios (Art of War-good, Mare Nostrum-bad), so it's definitely better to buy the DLC on sales, since the total overall cost is a bit absurd. Some of the changes that come with the free patches can be quite divisive, and the reviews for the accompanying DLC often reflect this. The patches also have pretty bad Quality Assurance and often times bugs can remain for months after being added and reported.			"

												Editing this review from January 2015 since it has been over 2 years and over 1000 hours of gameplay (for me) since:In my first review I raised the point of ""National Ideas -> Unique National Ideas"" (the unique bonuses that countries can unlock during the game) which mostly has been done, so kudos to you Paradox, you delivered! So most of the nations has their own unique ideas or atleast ideas made for specific areas of the world (example West African Ideas, rather than the normal ""National Ideas"").What can I say about this game? I've played it about 1200 hours and have enjoyed it most of the time. There were few major DLCs that changed the game in a direction that many players didn't like, but most of the 'negative' stuff has been fixed and in its current state I would highly recommend this game.The game offers rather deep experience (but not as deep as some specialized games that focus on one area) in grand strategy game genre, you can dabble in trade, diplomacy, economy and military - dabble and dabble, or take it serious, it's your decision how serious you want to be in your gaming experience, since this game and other game in the same genre (Grand strategy) offer you quite many possibilities to do very specific scenarious, historical re-enacts and what not. And that is one of the main things why I would recommend this game - the re-playability - endless possibilities with hundreds of playable nations, custom nations, random ""new world"" (North and South America doesn't exist, but are replaced with random continent/s) and of course the semirandomized AI behaviour that makes the world behave some what different in every game.Since the mechanics of the game are rather extensive, I'm not going to start talking about how different things work, just know that this game and others like it have rather steep learning curve, but once you get the game going it's easy to go with the flow and just learn through experience and reacting. I'm not saying the mechanics and the game is perfect, but through very (VERY) active and passionate development team this game is a living process, evolving all the time.The one of the most important questions to you - who's considering if he/she should buy this game - is this: Are you willing to spend more money in one game than you normally would? Most of the people would not buy this game and all of its important DLCs without any discount and I can't blame you. So if the cost is what keeps you away from this game, just be patient and wait for summer, autumn, christmas or what ever sales and buy it then. But I assure you that if you give the time to learn this game and the nooks and grannies it has in it you'll have enormous amounts of fun.This review stretched almost as much as my gaming sessions with this game has...

												Great game with quite a bit of depth for strategy lovers, only con thus far is that it is quite an intensive game. If you want to have achievements, autosaving needs to be on and that means creating a new 26mB save file every decision you make...But if you have a high performance PC this should not be a problem			"

												Pretty neat game; you essentially take the role as a nation and lead it to glory. Pretty open and the criteria for ""Victory"" in most cases lies in what YOU define as as a win. So if that's military conquest or diplomatic annexation you can do that. Hell; you can spend the entire game doing nothing but trading, only warring for your economic interests. It's a really magnificent game and something I'd assuredly reccomend picking up at your convienance. It goes on 50-75% sales almost  every sale as well as every time a major DLC come outs. Is you'd like an in-depth look at the game consider looking up people like Arumba or Shenryyr on youtube; they produce quite alot of content on EU4.			"

												Crush the Austro-Hungarian empire in it's infancy, ensure that Spain humbles England in the Anglo-Spanish war or have the Russians join forces with the Ottoman Empire against the Poles. Europa Universalis IV gives you a chance to rewrite and map out your favourite alternate histories and run your own experiment in perverse Machiavellian politics. So If you're the sort of person who doesn't have the patience to go through the grind that an average bill takes to get past the senate or if you're a Sith then you'd best look away, because this game most certainly does not deal in absolutes.Winning isn't really winning. Actually I really haven't figured out how to win in this. It's rather vague, since there are no victory conditions just the end of time or the demise of your empire whichever comes first. Playing as Muscovy I decided that it was my duty to defeat my rival Novograd who'd slighted me and showed the temerity of boasting a trade hub which from the tutorial I gathered was an important thing. I managed to capture each province, but when it came to negotiate it turned out that I'd have to give most of their land back else face crushing penalties, revolts and frantic red flags on my console. It did take me nearly as many hours as agreed upon by Nato's  latest report as to how long it would take Vladimir Putin to march through the Baltics. After which I turned my attention to the growing threat of the Lithuania who seemed to have allied with Poland and harboured a delicious looking Kiev. But, there rose another threat in the form of the Ottomans to the South and I decided it'd be best to go east for the next few…hours or decades. To colonies the vast expanses of Siberia I had to turn to the tech tree which lets the player spend points garnered in Administration, Military and Diplomacy. Some of the abilities that each trait unlocks takes a leap of faith, but take it with a pinch of salt, the system seems balanced enough and each decision is a tough call. So despite the rather vague relations I enjoyed the tech trees as it put me in the place of the fictional Chancellor who'd have to sigh and raise his hands and say 'If only…' and 'for the greater good.' Another great though frustrating thing about the points is that you can decide between the short term and the long term uses. The short term allows you to hire generals, boost stability to prevent rebellions and drive down inflation and boost coffers. The long terms affects the tech advances and lets you keep an even footing with your neighbours and rivals. Religion and culture aspects are easy to understand, trade less so. At times it does feel like it's getting too anal but hey remember the process of that bill? It's going to be a long haul for incremental gains.At least the UI is easy to manage, A large button gives you a panel dropdown of almost anything you need. You can pause, slow down and speed up while you consider important decisions. And you can hover buildings around different provinces and quickly figure out where best to place them for maximum effect from the main panel rather than going to each territory separately. The UI looks good but could feel better, it does take forever to load, doubtless cramming up all those tiny details. Directing trade is a steep learning curve with little feedback. Culture and religion could easily have been merged into a single entity. The detailed tech tree is well still a mystery after 100 hours of playing but hey that could be a good thing. Someone will probably figure it all out in another 900 hours of gameplay.Despite all that I'm still intent continuing on in my noble attempts to invade Poland.  "

												OK, serious review time.After nearly 900 hours of playing this game, I believe it's appropriate for me to leave an actual, serious review. So this game takes place from 1444 to 1821, so the Renaissance to post Napoleonic Wars, which is a big span of history. You play as a nation trying to find your place in the sun, aspriring to empire-dom and to position you and your nation in the annals of history. You could play as the historical big boys like Castile, Portugal, France, Russia, the Ottomans, etc.Or you could start small. And dream big.This is where the game truly shines. Building yourself up, conquering everyone and everything around you. Sending your people across the seas to build a new home. Constructing the finest army and navy the world has ever seen. Amass a trade empire, steal wealth from your rivals or cleaverly place your merchants in prime cities and ports. Develop your provinces to squeeze as much money, resources and manpower as possible. Build buildings to assist you on your quest to glory, like barracks to improve manpower, marketplaces to squeeze trade out of important provinces or build temples to tax your people more efficiently. Choose idea groups that boost the stats of your nation, like Religious for converting heathen and heretic alike, Quality for easy and quick wars and so on. So what are you waiting for? Pick up a copy and play this beautiful game of grand strategy and conquest. See you at 1000 hours.			"

Many DLC should have been released as an improvement patch but a DLC?

 Europa Universalis IV The Sequel to the critcally acclaimed Europa Universalis III did not disappoint.  With a variety of a new features mounted on a brand new Clausewitz 2.0 engine the game is much more smoother and less clunkier in most aspects, having streamlined alot of the chores into a simple click of a button. Detaching for a siege,Patrolling,rebel supression etc is just a click of a button away as compared to EU3 where you had to manually detach men for a siege for example.As the name might suggest,the scale is colossal spanning 7 conintents and 5 oceans (barring Antartica) the world is your playground. There is no clearly defined objective or motive , it is all up to you ,the player. Playing as England you can try to beat france in the hundred years war and rewrite history. If your a fan of the Romans, you can try to restore the roman empire. Take the balkans back from the ottomans and push them out of asia minor,maybe expand into western europe and reconquer the city of Rome. You can even explore a randomized new world with the Conquest of Paradise Expansion. The possibilities are endless.However,as with any games,there are definitely bugs and flaws. The Protectecrate System as of now is essentially useless,they do not fight in battles and only give you trade power. Your Protectecrates system to benefit more off you than you do off them. Colonial Nations are abit buggy as well,other colonial nations can declalre war on your colonial nation without even calling you to arms, so if for example a 20 province colony of portugal declares war on a 5 province colony of yours,you can not do anything except watch them eat your colony up unless miracously they win that war.There are still many more bugs which i have not pointed out. but you get the ideaThat being said though Europa Universalis 4 is still definitely worth getting , it's replayability value is practically endless and if you have Crusader Kings 2 and the CK2 to EUIV converter , you can start a game in CK2 and Continue all the way to the end of EU4 and maybe even Victoria If there is a converter.9/10 Rating "

												Very complex strategic game. I've played a lot of Total War and some Civ games but if you want a realistic strategy game, I think this one is by far the best out there. Not a single campaign is the same, which is why I've played this so much. Here's a small list of advantages and disadvantages:+ very realistic and historical  + enormous amount of playable countries, most of them with unique ideas and events+ literally can't get bored once you're hooked up+ DLC's  add a lot of features, good price if on sale IMO. Are a must if you are a fanboy like me+ I've got 500 hours and I still learn new things every campaign+ Game is very balanced IMO, it's not like Total War where most of my campaigns look kind of the same+ Mods are available and bring interesting features- DLC's are expensive and there are a lot of them, only buy them if you like the standard game- very hard learning curve due to the absurdly complex of interreacting features- only the major DLC's are worth it- if you like to battle yourself like in Total War, this isn't possible "

												If You would like to rewrite history, You've found Your spot.Lots of DLC may discourage from buying but imo, You don't need them to enjoy the game. Would recomend to people who are into slowpaced hardcore strategy games.If You are not one of said people, don't buy it.			"

												EUIV is a fantastic grand strategy game. If you like strategy then this is simply one of the best games that you can buy.It is the most accessible of the Paradox grand strategy games and definitely the most friendly for a new player. Having said that, it is also probably the toughest to master. The mechanics are deep and complex, and it is the case that you will probably still be learning new things even after playing for hundreds of hours. EUIV requires a high level of strategic thinking but it is also a game about stories. It is always interesting to look through the map at different corners of the globe and see how a new divergent history is playing out during each play-through. Of course, the real fun is in the journey that you have with your selected nation as you guide them through this period of history. It is a big sandbox in which you can create a new history for your selected nation.The music in EUIV is wonderful and the map is gorgeous. I must emphasise the high quality of the music, which is produced by Andreas Waldetoft (he has also produced excellent music for other Paradox games such as CKII and Victoria II). In short, EUIV is a fantastic strategy game. For anyone who likes Civ or other 4X style games, EUIV is definitely a game you should look at! If you enjoy games that make you think, require lots of strategy and that are heavy with complexity then EUIV is the right game for you.You might find this beginner's guide useful for more information about the game - http://www.eu4wiki.com/Beginner%27s_guide "

												This game has some really cool mechanics. Some ppl may disagree with me, but I like the way Paradox is updating the game. As long as they continue to give us the free content, I will be more than happy to buy the paid DLC from Gaben (druing sales). The game is addictive and has the amount of depth any strategy game should have.			"

												Historical Grand Strategy done right.Simply put, this is a deep, complex and rewarding take on an amazingly important and rich period of human history. Next to EUIV, the arguably most popular strategy game around, Civ V, is strategy for 4-year olds.Having played this after investing hundreds of hours in Crusader Kings II, it really feels ""right"". While CK2 focused more on the individual characters, with a lot of rich RPG-like elements and a lot of intrigue and diplomacy, EUIV takes a more high-level approach, that really works to its benefit.It's not an extremely easy game to get into to, but it's not as difficult to ""learn as you go"" as you might think. Overall, I think it's the more accessible of the EU series thus far.The sheer amount of content and possibilities in this game makes it worth to play again and again, in ever more challenging scenarios and starting nations. No two games will ever be alike, even with the same starting conditions.In terms of actual gameplay, success hangs in managing the fine balance of resources, diplomacy and opportunities that arise. It's tough, but fair. It never really feels like you're losing for no good reason. The AI is aggressive and will exploit your weaknesses, but there's always a way around it, even if you only realize it when it's already too late. It feels real, like something that would've happened in real life.To sum it up, buy it and play the heck out of it. Get CK2 while you're at it, too. They are both amazing games, that really complement each other really well. It's my favorite pair of strategy games. "

												Being white has never been this much fun. 10/10 Would ""attack natives' againMy actual review/opinion:Europa Universalis IV is mostly gonna be you staring at a map (mostly of europe) and watching the world slowly turn to crap. It'll involve lots of fabricated claims and eventually turn into routine expanision followed by certain landmark decisions or tech ups to ensure your armies are as op as possible. It gets to the point where you begin to memorize what nations will rise and which will fall so when you're bored there's something the look at while your aggresive expansion goes down. I'm not gonna review like the entire game cuz I'm really lazy and there's some parts of the game I really don't know much about but I'll conclude by looking over the two nations I've finished a game with.Muscovite Cub/Russian Bear: Probably one of the more entertaining nations out there, their traditions and ideas make it easy to build up huge armies and expand right out of the get go. The real problem that could stop the bear in his early expansion is a nomad gang bang or poland-lithuania but once those are out of the way, you'll be on the path to shreking everything from eastern europe to the open fields of Mongolia.Timurids/Mughals: The strongest of all the nomads in the middle east and has the potential of being a great power.They used to be even better when you didn't need to reform your government to become the mughals. A thing that many may not know is nomads are extremely powerful early game and can easily make a empire as they can declare on anyone they border as well. So combined with the Timurid's ability to form a ""civilized"" muslim tech nation bordering the indian tech group is pretty great (also the fact you get claims on all of India). Once all of india is taken pushing into the middle-east and the gold mine that is china becomes easy.I recommend this to people willing to try new things. Sure it's fun to play as england and crucify some irish but, creating an irish empire through brutal wars of survival just feels like something you'd read in a textbook and go ""holy crap that actually happened"". One the most amzaing things this game gives me is a way to use my imagination and create a story about the empire I made.P.S. ty paradox for buffing Ming, The Middle Kingdom shall endure and the western dogs will be nothing except dirt beneath our celestial feet. #asainpower			"

The only bad thing i would say is that if your not running more than the pc requirements, getting achievements requires ironman mode which forces monthly autosaving and this can cause some lag if your not running more than the requirements.

If you learn how to play this game it is really fun to be able to randomly declare war on world superpowers and devastate their country. I remember one time I took over all of Scandinavia and parts of Europe with Denmark, or the time I landed Spanish troops on English shores and brought absolute chaos to their country. Good times.

												I don't play strategic games often, because I cannot find something that gives me a true experience. That happened until i found Europa Universalis. This game gives you the power to do anything. Colonize with Japan and beat Portugal, France and Spain in the colonization race, be the ottomans and conquer Europe. Start a nation in Africa and dominate the world. The possibilities are infinite, and you can experience different endings in multiple playthroughs with the same nation. The learning curve is quick. At the beginning, you can find the game hard, but as time goes by, and after a couple of hours of playing it, you will have no difficulty on playing it. Besides, you have a lot of answered questions in the internet, you just need to google it if you can't find the solution for your problem. Also, the graphics are astonishing, and I really enjoy the multiple maps (diplomatic maps, religion maps, culture maps, etc etc) full of colours, it is really catchy. Even if this is not enough for you, the game presents you with brilliant soundtracks, giving you the feeling that you're really living the experience.I would totally recommend this to any strategic players, it's hard to not love this game. 9/10			"

												This game has literally eaten up all my free time for the last 1,5 years. Yes, 1,5 years. I am well over 1300 hours at this point. If you like taking over the world either through conquest, subjugation or trade dominance then this is probably for you. If you are a fan of Total War, but more interested in the campaign map than the battles (like me) then this is your perfect match.You can play as ANY nation on the map. Want to take over the world as Timbuktu? No problem... sorta!While the game does have a steep learning curve, there are many entertaining videos on Youtube that you can learn from surprisingly fast. The in-depth strategy of this game is what gives it appeal to me. Don't forget your casus belli!			"

												Crush the Austro-Hungarian empire in it's infancy, ensure that Spain humbles England in the Anglo-Spanish war or have the Russians join forces with the Ottoman Empire against the Poles. Europa Universalis IV gives you a chance to rewrite and map out your favourite alternate histories and run your own experiment in perverse Machiavellian politics. So If you're the sort of person who doesn't have the patience to go through the grind that an average bill takes to get past the senate or if you're a Sith then you'd best look away, because this game most certainly does not deal in absolutes.Winning isn't really winning. Actually I really haven't figured out how to win in this. It's rather vague, since there are no victory conditions just the end of time or the demise of your empire whichever comes first. Playing as Muscovy I decided that it was my duty to defeat my rival Novograd who'd slighted me and showed the temerity of boasting a trade hub which from the tutorial I gathered was an important thing. I managed to capture each province, but when it came to negotiate it turned out that I'd have to give most of their land back else face crushing penalties, revolts and frantic red flags on my console. It did take me nearly as many hours as agreed upon by Nato's  latest report as to how long it would take Vladimir Putin to march through the Baltics. After which I turned my attention to the growing threat of the Lithuania who seemed to have allied with Poland and harboured a delicious looking Kiev. But, there rose another threat in the form of the Ottomans to the South and I decided it'd be best to go east for the next few…hours or decades. To colonies the vast expanses of Siberia I had to turn to the tech tree which lets the player spend points garnered in Administration, Military and Diplomacy. Some of the abilities that each trait unlocks takes a leap of faith, but take it with a pinch of salt, the system seems balanced enough and each decision is a tough call. So despite the rather vague relations I enjoyed the tech trees as it put me in the place of the fictional Chancellor who'd have to sigh and raise his hands and say 'If only…' and 'for the greater good.' Another great though frustrating thing about the points is that you can decide between the short term and the long term uses. The short term allows you to hire generals, boost stability to prevent rebellions and drive down inflation and boost coffers. The long terms affects the tech advances and lets you keep an even footing with your neighbours and rivals. Religion and culture aspects are easy to understand, trade less so. At times it does feel like it's getting too anal but hey remember the process of that bill? It's going to be a long haul for incremental gains.At least the UI is easy to manage, A large button gives you a panel dropdown of almost anything you need. You can pause, slow down and speed up while you consider important decisions. And you can hover buildings around different provinces and quickly figure out where best to place them for maximum effect from the main panel rather than going to each territory separately. The UI looks good but could feel better, it does take forever to load, doubtless cramming up all those tiny details. Directing trade is a steep learning curve with little feedback. Culture and religion could easily have been merged into a single entity. The detailed tech tree is well still a mystery after 100 hours of playing but hey that could be a good thing. Someone will probably figure it all out in another 900 hours of gameplay.Despite all that I'm still intent continuing on in my noble attempts to invade Poland.  "

												Editing this review from January 2015 since it has been over 2 years and over 1000 hours of gameplay (for me) since:In my first review I raised the point of ""National Ideas -> Unique National Ideas"" (the unique bonuses that countries can unlock during the game) which mostly has been done, so kudos to you Paradox, you delivered! So most of the nations has their own unique ideas or atleast ideas made for specific areas of the world (example West African Ideas, rather than the normal ""National Ideas"").What can I say about this game? I've played it about 1200 hours and have enjoyed it most of the time. There were few major DLCs that changed the game in a direction that many players didn't like, but most of the 'negative' stuff has been fixed and in its current state I would highly recommend this game.The game offers rather deep experience (but not as deep as some specialized games that focus on one area) in grand strategy game genre, you can dabble in trade, diplomacy, economy and military - dabble and dabble, or take it serious, it's your decision how serious you want to be in your gaming experience, since this game and other game in the same genre (Grand strategy) offer you quite many possibilities to do very specific scenarious, historical re-enacts and what not. And that is one of the main things why I would recommend this game - the re-playability - endless possibilities with hundreds of playable nations, custom nations, random ""new world"" (North and South America doesn't exist, but are replaced with random continent/s) and of course the semirandomized AI behaviour that makes the world behave some what different in every game.Since the mechanics of the game are rather extensive, I'm not going to start talking about how different things work, just know that this game and others like it have rather steep learning curve, but once you get the game going it's easy to go with the flow and just learn through experience and reacting. I'm not saying the mechanics and the game is perfect, but through very (VERY) active and passionate development team this game is a living process, evolving all the time.The one of the most important questions to you - who's considering if he/she should buy this game - is this: Are you willing to spend more money in one game than you normally would? Most of the people would not buy this game and all of its important DLCs without any discount and I can't blame you. So if the cost is what keeps you away from this game, just be patient and wait for summer, autumn, christmas or what ever sales and buy it then. But I assure you that if you give the time to learn this game and the nooks and grannies it has in it you'll have enormous amounts of fun.This review stretched almost as much as my gaming sessions with this game has...

After which I turned my attention to the growing threat of the Lithuania who seemed to have allied with Poland and harboured a delicious looking Kiev. But, there rose another threat in the form of the Ottomans to the South and I decided it'd be best to go east for the next few…hours or decades. To colonies the vast expanses of Siberia I had to turn to the tech tree which lets the player spend points garnered in Administration, Military and Diplomacy. Some of the abilities that each trait unlocks takes a leap of faith, but take it with a pinch of salt, the system seems balanced enough and each decision is a tough call. So despite the rather vague relations I enjoyed the tech trees as it put me in the place of the fictional Chancellor who'd have to sigh and raise his hands and say 'If only…' and 'for the greater good.' Another great though frustrating thing about the points is that you can decide between the short term and the long term uses. The short term allows you to hire generals, boost stability to prevent rebellions and drive down inflation and boost coffers. The long terms affects the tech advances and lets you keep an even footing with your neighbours and rivals. Religion and culture aspects are easy to understand, trade less so. At times it does feel like it's getting too anal but hey remember the process of that bill? It's going to be a long haul for incremental gains.At least the UI is easy to manage, A large button gives you a panel dropdown of almost anything you need. You can pause, slow down and speed up while you consider important decisions. And you can hover buildings around different provinces and quickly figure out where best to place them for maximum effect from the main panel rather than going to each territory separately. The UI looks good but could feel better, it does take forever to load, doubtless cramming up all those tiny details. Directing trade is a steep learning curve with little feedback. Culture and religion could easily have been merged into a single entity. The detailed tech tree is well still a mystery after 100 hours of playing but hey that could be a good thing. Someone will probably figure it all out in another 900 hours of gameplay.Despite all that I'm still intent continuing on in my noble attempts to invade Poland.  "

												Sinking many hours into this game, tearing it apart in every way possible this is my review.We'll start with the pros and cons.Pros:+ There's constant updates and DLC release keeping you hooked on new content.+ A very strong and thriving community with a lot of mods, youtube videos, streamers etc.+ Paradox's way of handling DLC is the best I have seen with any developer.+ Replayability and diversity in the gameplay.+ The scale and scope of the game is unmatchable.+ Fun gameplay lasting for many hours (assuming you get into it).+ Save file compatability with it's sister game Crusader Kings II.+ Great music and very diverse music DLC.+ Finding a balance between fun gameplay and historical settings.+ Many unique and historical achievements that will fill your belly with joy.+ Sweden is overpowered!Cons:- Very complicated and confusing gameplay at first resulting in a very steep learning curve.- Gameplay can sometimes be very boring and dull, especially with a low performance computer.- Tooltips can sometimes be flawed and will show the wrong information.- Finding bugs is quite common, but constant updates usually keeps up pretty good.- A full playthrough takes a long time and saves may not be compatible with the next update, so look out!- Sweden is overpowered!Multiplayer is a blast playing with your friends, but because of the nature of the game you can't really play with strangers. Sitting down and playing a full game with a stranger will simply take too long.  But playing with your friends is a load of fun. You can also play modded EU4 online and the multiplayer host's DLC will be activated for everybody in that game.Singleplayer is a lot of fun. You can select any country, Europe, Asia, Africa, America, anywhere and play as that country.  There are a couple of scenarios that you can start with, the first 4 scenarios takes place on the date 11/11/1444 the different scenarios centres on different regions and time periods in the world and shows what countries are interesting choices during that time period. The game is earliest started in 1444 and the game ends in 1821. You can choose scenarios like 'The American Revolution' where Britain, the USA are some of the interesting choices. You can choose the scenario 'Revolutionary France' where France is an interesting choice along with Russia and the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth are interesting choices due to them being involved in a war. There's lots of achievements to do achievement runs on, they are all quite unique and are loads of fun. E.g. 'Poland can into space!' Reach tech 32 as Poland, 'Georgia on my mind', conquer all 3 Georgias and 'Marshy March' have a march with at least 2 marshes. These can be challanging and even impossible. Giving all this content adds to great replayability.DLC is handeled very nicely with DLC being released 2-4 months between eachother. DLC costs about 15€ and old DLC features slowly gets added into the game through updates, so you can simply wait for some features if you don't have access to all DLC. Of course cosmetics like skinpacks and music packs can often be purchased for less than 3€.This game really takes grand strategy to a new level. The scope of the game is huge and the amazing work of paradox is unbeatable by any other strategy game. This is definately the best grand strategy game in the world and probably one of the best strategy games in the world. Learning the game takes a while and it's hard to perfect your skill. Watching youtube videos of people playing the game is one of the best ways to get into it. Try Arumba, Sheryrr and Quill18 and their friends as they play this game and takes it very in depth.My verdict:Most strategy games have a very steep learning curve and this will not affect the score as this was intentional by the devs.I'd say that this game scores a  94/100The missing 6 points consists of the bugs, the tooltip issues and saves incompatability to new updates (even though the latter is understandable.)Thanks Paradox, this game is your best one yet. Keep it up! //Simon			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough. I have spent so many long hours playing this and I can always come back and expect a completely different experience. No nation plays out another, and even starting a new game as the same nation will turn out drastically different than the last. There is even good variance in difficulty, proving a challenge for those new, and to more experienced players. All in all, definately pick this game up if you are into strategy games, and if you aren't then wait for it to go on sale and grab it. Bit of a learning curve attached but once you overcome it, expect hours upon hours of enjoyment.			"

												This game has literally eaten up all my free time for the last 1,5 years. Yes, 1,5 years. I am well over 1300 hours at this point. If you like taking over the world either through conquest, subjugation or trade dominance then this is probably for you. If you are a fan of Total War, but more interested in the campaign map than the battles (like me) then this is your perfect match.You can play as ANY nation on the map. Want to take over the world as Timbuktu? No problem... sorta!While the game does have a steep learning curve, there are many entertaining videos on Youtube that you can learn from surprisingly fast. The in-depth strategy of this game is what gives it appeal to me. Don't forget your casus belli!			"

												This game is like a historical playground. Let's put it like this. Say I play as a country no where close to Europe such as the Iroquois. I peacefully dominate my neighbors and await European nations to come so I can advance my technology off of them. After years and years of waiting I finally reform my government and catch up in technology significantly. And so finally a European nation throws a colony in my sightlines and I am excited! The border shows it as yellow so surely it is Spain/Castile. It was quite strange but these things do happen so I shrug it off. I await the reveal when I am thrown into disarray! Why is Scotland colonizing Canada and not England? After anxious waiting the maps of Europe are finally revealed to me. Russia has been overrun by China. Scotland has almost fully annexed England and is now eyeing Ireland next. Spain is no longer spain but now a part of Italy. Italy was actually formed! Why? How? Oh. France was eaten by Burgundy, Austria, and Portugal. Without France's intervention in Italy the nation was actually formed which never happens ever. Ever ever. And so new maps are given to me and I discover most of the continest of Africa and half of Asia. And what I see is a sand colored outline across the shores of Africa. It is the Mamluks! And they have achieved the same goal I have been earnestly awaiting for so long. They have westernized and have now vasslized the Ottomans. Looking further west I see one thing that is normal. A formed Hindustan in India. What is not normal is that upon closer inspection the nation was formed by none other than the mountain nation of Nepal. A nation that starts with two poor provinces and surrounded by dangerous foes. Among the other strange things that happen in the game were the Italian colonies of Brazil Australia and the Carribbean, the formation of Scandinavia (peacefully, which never happens yet again),  Malaya aka Indonesia being formed by some miracle. Byzantium still alive. Russia being small. And then Scotland declares war on France mid-game and then wins. All in all I lost that game to the superior forces of the Italy and Scotland. Combined their forces were something not expected. At all.10/10			"

												Europa Universalis IV is one of the most interesting, time-consuming and genre-defining ""grand strategy"" games ever made.You can control any country in the world (Native American tribes, Mongol Hordes, the pope, Holy Roman Empire) in the Age of Discovery (1444-1805). Every nation, howsoever small, has the chance to become a superpower in colonizing, rading, land war or naval warfare.This game is hard to learn, but if you watch some tutorials, play for yourself, watch some more tutorials and play some more, you acquire the required knowledge to have a lot of fun.Paradox Development Studio is also known for improving their games by adding more stuff (free patches and major game changing DLCs) to the game, even years after the releases.It's definitely worth buying for the full price, if you have enough time to spend.

												Absolutely brilliant grand strategy from Paradox as always. Interesting mechanics, a huge array of choices as who to play, great fun even if you're playing as some minor Asian nation and a brilliant modding community and randomness to each game that provides unlimited replayability. If you want a grand strategy that provides challenge, immersion and depth then this is the game for you.It's not without it's faults, namely it's worryingly large number of bugs, but Paradox is constantly patching and updating the game on an almot monthly basis fixing most as the pop up. Multiplayer can be a bit funny, but I've had great fun playing it online with a few friends, conquering entire continents between us. Furthermore, many nations provide a very interesting situation where you must tread carefully and take risks to advance, which is something I feel lacking in many strategy games. I often find many games lackjing any real sense of risk, more often a simple pattern holding true to each game. EU4 overcomes this rather well. Nations like Najd, Songhai or any of the Infian nations provide great interesting events and challenges, with even more round the corner when the Europeans turn up at your door!Overall I'd rate this an 8/10. I've personally never encountered a single bug, but I'm aware other in the community have to great extent and so it would be foolish to pretend they don't exist. Certainly this game is playable and most of all, fun. If you enjoy any paradox game, you'll enjoy this.			"

												One of the best games I have ever played. There is so much to do in EUIV that its hardto know where to start, you can start the game anywhere on the globe between the years1444-end date. Start as anything from a backwards sub-saharan nation and learnthe ways of the west and beat back the Europeans, be a small indian nation andunite the continent forming mighty Hindustan, or maybe play as Portugal and colonizelike a madman building a huge overseas empire, the choice is yours. Spread yourreligion across the world, or be accepting of other faiths and cultures the choice is yours.War, trade, faith, diplomacy so much to do so little time!Also a big plus is that the game got a huge modding community with many great modsthat makes the game even better! 10/10			"

												(Still don't think I put in enough hours but heres a review.)Most 50-60 dollar games give me 50 to 60 hours of playtime. If they have DLC which tends to add another 20 to 40 dollars to the pricetag it can add to that.Ive spent well over 1000 hours so far on Eu4 and still haven't touched most of the content. Most people will complain about the DLC which adds 200+ bucks to the price but hell, I enjoy the game,  and all my friends enjoy the hell out of it. It's fully worth it if you love Grand Strategy games.			"

												Great game, terrible learning curve. Totally worth it. Buy DLC when on sale because you are going to want most the DLC to have the best in-game experience. Othwise wait or you will be spending $80+.			"

												Fun game, overpriced DLC. Paradox makes good strategy games but they treat their customers like cash pinatas. I would recommend against buying any Paradox add-ons as they are thinly-veiled cash grabs. As for EUIV, hold off on purchasing until it's on sale for 50% off.			"

												Europa Universalis is a masterpiece for grand strategy gamers, its complex but everything works fine and is logical. Its always great to play this game: wars, diplomacy, economy, rebels and the colonies. The AI is really smart, in diplomacy its based on points  if they accept something you want; alliance, support indepence, its based on: opinion, attitude, allied with hostile, small army strength and far away from other nations(and much more).sometimes the opinion is 100 but the attitude neutral. This will give you - points for an alliance offer but opinion will give you + points for an alliance, this makes it harder to make a alliance. Thats just a example from how everything works so good in eu4, compared to ckII where dumb -- ++ are used. Also the multiplayer is really addicting but on the other hand really long. Its cooler to play with friends for a hour in the day.9.5/10			"

												So yeah. This game. Listen to me, it's great! And I'm freakin' addicted. I'm still in my first Playthrough, but I can tell, it's a very well performed mix of all Strategy games we'd had so far (even though it can't compair with the dynasty-system of Crusader Kings 2, BUT only in that part like everything else is better). It's like a huge world dominition where you have to find the balance beetween War, Tech-Researches, Trade, Diplomacy and Colonie's. It's like the finished Version of ""Crusader Kings II"" and ""March of the Eagles"" and it works perfectly! If you enjoyed 'map part' of the ""Total War"" Series or ""Crusader Kings II"" and ""March of the Eagle"" you'll sure find this game even better than these 2 (even though there aren't a real time battle's like in '""Total War"").It's a very enjoyable game, with high replay rate's. Because you can play as EVERY Nation (starts at nations like England or Mecklenburg and ends with many Indian nations). I'll give it 9 out of 10 Points. It's a Must Have if you like Deep-Strategy-Games. :)			"

												Otherwise known as ""The Map Game"".  Simply brilliant.  Forget the razzle dazzle of tactical combat.  You buy other games for that.  Combat here may be considerably more complex in fact than anything you may have played before, but its not flashy.  This is an empire game.  This is a What If game.  This is a choose your own goal and play game.  This is coop or PvP.  The designers are constantly rebalancing and adding new elements.  It may be a couple more YEARS before they let it go and do something else.  So yes even if you master it gameplay wise it changes again.  It strives for realism, and provides a barebones political RPG experience.  Its hard, but hardly impossible.  It constantly teaches you new things, forces you to see your own errors, provides a list of achievements that you really want to attempt.  There's numerous things to do.  Colonize.  War,  Master the Seas.  Establish a trade empire.  Rewrite history.  Screw with politics.  Focus on some things ignore others.  Try to do it all.Try to take over the entire world.  Why haven't you bought this yet ?			"

												Europa Universalis IV is a very simple game, in theory. You control a nation, from 1444 to 1821, and lead it to world dominaton or commercial dominance or whatever else you want to do, using your military and diplomats to get what you want.In practice, it is incredibly complicated. Every country not controlled by a human is being run by the AI, even if you can't see them. Every other country will react to changes in the political climate as they happen, generally resulting in very unexpected endings. Each country will have its own opinion of yours, influenced by things like who your enemies are, how much land you took in recent wars, what religion your country practices, and even whether or not they just want you dead to begin with.There are a variety of ways to make other countries see more highly of you, just as there are ways to make them want you dead even more than they already did. You can annex smaller neighbors that think highly of you, or you can go to war and dominate your neighbors instead. Each country has a goal, and these goals will change dramatically over the 380 years you have to act. Each country has its own bonuses; the Merchant Republics of Venice and Novgorod are in a great position to amass large quantities of wealth, if they survive. The giants of Muscovy and Austria can easily dominate anyone who tries to oppose them.The question is, what is it you want to do? The Byzantines, driven to near destruction by the Ottomans, can still be led to the restoration of the Roman Empire by anyone willing to lead them there. The Swedes, in the Kalmar Union under Denmark and sure to be annexed, can remove the Danes from their throne and become a colonial empire under the right leadership. There are, without exaggeration, an infinite number of possible directions you can take this game. The El Dorado expansion pack and its custom nation designer only reinforces this; build a Muslim republic in Lithuanian land, conquer Russia with it, and then become an Islamic Russia. Set up a Jewish empire in Ireland and conquer England. Whatever. Go do it.Now, I assume, you're thinking ""Ok, that's all good, but how well is it executed?"" Flawlessly. The incredibly complex diplomacy system gives every nation a mind of its own; every country will forge alliances and make enemies by themselves, and you can manipulate that with ease to ensure a network of powerful alliances with which to conquer the world. The military system, equally deep and complex, can lead to wars lasting anywhere from merely a single year to several decades. Use technology to outmatch your opponents, and defeat them with a vastly superior army, or expand as much as possible and defeat everyone with sheer numbers.This game, essentially, is the definitive strategy game. Watch as the world changes and as empires form from nothing. Build your own empire and stop all the others. There is infinite replayability; a game will never end the same way twice; Steam achievements give a reason to try many different countries, learn several strategies, and conquer the world ten times over; multiplayer adds an extra layer of madness, allowing you to conquer the world with your friends, only to have them betray you later. There is no good reason for anyone interested in history or strategy games to not buy this one; it is, in a way, the perfect strategy game. The expansions only make it moreso, but add an entirely new system to learn. Even without these expansions, however, there is an almost endless supply of extra content available for free, right here on Steam. With mods, this game can become new again, even for a seasoned veteran of 3000 hours.If I have only one complaint of this game, it is the multiplayer community, and even then the game is not at fault for this. Too often, people will host games and simply boot anyone they don't want, or else make up some sad story to convince people to leave on their own. There is a very simple way to prevent people you don't want to play with from entering your game: put a password on it, and share it with people you do want to play with. This problem leads to another: the lack of a good supply of people with whom to play online multiplayer. Every once in a while, a good person will come along and allow everyone to play with him. These people are, unfortunately, rare, but when they do come along the experience is almost always a great one. There are some synchronization problems with multiplayer, as well, but any game as large as this, when hosting several people at once, is sure to have these, so again I cannot fault this game specifically for that. There will be bugs; it is difficult, after all, to solve every single problem when there is so much code to check; but when there is a problem that the developers have not found, once it is found and reported it is usually corrected soon after.I therefore conclude that this is one of the best games of all time. I can highly recommend buying it, even at full price, and I would rarely advise buying something at full price.			"

												One of the best strategy games out there, set during the Early Modern Era, this game allows you to create the empire of your dreams, be it merchant republic, a feudal monarchy or enlightened despotism. Despite some flaws still persisting, the game keeps getting better with each patch and expansion. It is a bit too much abstraction-heavy though, so it's best played in MP or by rolepaying for an AAR.			"

												I have been told multiple times by my friend to buy this fantastic real time strategy game. I took me some time until I was convinced to spend my money on this game, because I was waiting on a sale (This game is totally worth buying full price, however it is frequently on sale).First impressions:I was fortunate enough to have someone experienced, to teach me the game mechanics, because Europa Universalis 4 is very complex games, that requires a lot of time and effort to learn. Personally, it took me around 30 to 50 hours of multiple playthroughs with different countries to completely understand the basics. However now with over 120 hours of having played this game (as of writing this review) I really understand what I am doing.Singleplayer:Personally, I wouldn’t recommend playing singleplayer at first to someone who is new to the game. Look for someone experienced who can teach you the basics first. If you know what you are doing, singleplayer is a great way to relax or if you want a challenge you can start a game in ironman mode. Ironman mode is an optional gameplay feature that restricts control over the saved game, disallowing the player from correcting mistakes and changing decisions made during the course of play. So basically if you screw up you cannot reload a save file.Multiplayer:I find multiplayer the best way to experience the game. Concurring the world with your friends, creating colonial empires, handicapping yourself for example to defeat Europa as an underdeveloped tribe together and many other things, give the game a huge variety.  The game can change form slow pace gameplay, like building an infrastructure to intense battles to defend or conquer land, in an instant. Every new playthrough with your friends, even with the same countries, feels like a new adventure.I personally think playing against real players is the greatest way to enjoy this game. Even though the AI is smart and is being improved constantly it can sometimes be predictable and okaying against Randoms or friends will give you the best experience.Are there any negative aspects to this game?Yes, there are some negative aspects to this game. Some are minor like the steep learning curve and some are rather negative, like needing all the DLCs to fully experience the game and if you really want to get the game with all the DLCs, you will spend easily more than 80€ (As I already said the game and the DLCs are frequently on sale, which cuts the total price more that 60% to around 40€). If you play alone without most of the DLCs the game feels like it is missing some key features. However, this can easily be bypassed if one of your friends already owns the DLCs, because if you play with your friends a multiplayer session and the host owns the DLCs, everyone connected can experience the additional features of the DLCs without paying. That’s a great move by paradox studios.Summary: So, should I buy this game?You defiantly should buy it. I have rarely found strategy games, that had me addicted, saying multiple times a day to myself: “Come on, 5 more minutes are ok! You can go to sleep then”. The complexity of this game is what makes this game so great and addictive to play. Even though the price is expensive, EU4 is frequently on sale cutting its price by around 50-75%. Furthermore, for the beginners I strongly suggest watch tutorials that explain the basics so you don’t feel lost at the beginning. If you are not willing to invest time in learning this is not a game for you.Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy Europa Universalis 4.This was my first review if you have anything to say, that I can improve for my next review pls do tell me.

												Base Rating 9.5(With Major DLC)All Right many of my friends were very nervous about purchasing this game after all it is 40 dollars or your local equiavalent.I was the first of our group to purchase this because I was told it was more empire managment than another paradox game that you might be famaliar with Crusader Kings 2. I Enjoyed that game and it was my first paradox game that I didn't rage quit in 1 hour.So the basic thing that made me buy it was that I heard it was similar to CK2 but it was in my favorite time period except more empire management. Now I had watched videos about the game but I was still incrediably nooby and died a crapload of times thanks to my refusal to play large nations. I feel like theres a huge learning curve and lots of planning and proper execuation to properly reach your goal. At times it will be filled with complete disparity as events such as Peasant's war will hit you at the absolutley worst time. First time it happend I was playing with a friend multiplayer and it begun after I literally just seconds after I finished a massive war with Austria. My friend and my ally tried his best but was also exhausted because he had aided me in the previous war. If things couldnt get worse my treasury was depleting fast so I had to disband most of my heavy ships. To make matters even worse England(Allied with Austria) seeing my weakness delcared war on me and so did bunch of idependent rheinlander states. Mircaulously me and my ally prevailed and I got revenge on all those who wronged me and invaded the british isles. All this brings me to the point that this game is filled with possibilities and that I only sctrached the surface with this review. Therefore I must oblidge on fullheartly recommend this game for anyone who loves Grand Strategy and Historic games. GoodLuck and Godspeed!			"

For about a good 300 hours I played this game with no DLC and only then I bought 1 after. The DLC enhances and further immerses you into the game. The game is complex, and has a huge depth. Even after 1K hours, I still don't know how to  conquer the world yet lol. This game will make you frustrated, angry, sad, happy, and narcissistic. I definitely reccomend this game to those who like grand strategy, conquering, and those who are into history.			"

GameplayIn a few words: The game is great!In a long story: The game is great, first when i bought this game i though oh well, this is going to be easy to play. I have played the older EU games and the total war series... Man was i wrong when i thought that.Firstly i played the tutorial, i'm someone that always plays it no matter what game, well the tutorial itself was already hard because the whole UI was different, after a few hours i got the UI in my head. So yeah that was a piece of cake.The game itself was really hard for me, i was so used to the total war series and its warfare and diplomacy.After a long time reading the EU4 wiki i began to understand how the game worked. Diplomacy was not like just doing it you had to think ahead in time.Warfare was different too like a siege, you just need a general to get a better siege, also attacking the stronghold while the walls were still standing was a bad idea. Well i learned that.Best of all you can pick all the countries, this gave me so much freedom that i sometimes still abuse till this very day.Even passing through any new reforms, and new technologies really feel like they do something to your country as a whole and its people.The game itself doesn't provide any turnbased gameplay, no it's all realtime even the multiplayer.You think you can be powerfull as Germany, France, England or Russia or any other country? Well forget it, if you're too agressive other countries will go in a pact against you, i mean come on man the AI feels so smart in this game, yes sometimes it's bad but hey it's a game.ModdingAfter playing this game for a while i wanted some different gameplay so i installed mods, like the Extended Timeline Mod, which really recommend, but only after you've played the original game first!After installing some music, graphical and other mods that change gameplay, the game felt even more differently!ImmersiveDon't get me wrong, this game is not immersive like Battlefield, Call of Duty or Red Orchestra (2).This game is more immersive like you're really feeling that you belong to the country and it's ""digital"" people. If something happens in your land that has any influence to your land and its people you really have the feeling to do something about it, well you better do it otherwise you get ♥♥♥♥ed in the **** later on.But i mean, man my country is devided by its religion, the other side is catholic. Meanwhile the protestant part wants a reform. Netherlands! ^^.Even forming the Netherlands as Utrecht in IronMan mode was a ♥♥♥♥♥, i had luck  that France was willing to help me fight against Burgundy. Even though if the king died i would have to face Austria.Yes the game can be confusing, but also very very simplistic.So many shiny buttons yet so few.OverallI recommend this game to anyone even you haven't played any EU series, i promise you this game provides a totally different gameplay then most other strategy games.This game is a grand stratagy game not just any ordinary strategy game. so what are you waiting for!start throwing money at your screen, just freaking now. Come on ******* NOW!!! "

												If you enjoy grand strategy games, then this is a solid purchase.  Instead of dealing with more personal characters like in Crusader Kings II.  You are dealing with states and countries.  As all Paradox games are.  It is a little daunting at first.  Expect to get crushed in an instant if you're not sure what you doing.  But each time you fail, you'll learn what to not do for next time.  The only problem is a continuing one from the developers.  Lots of DLC that is rather expensive, i've found they do add to the game and are good assets to the base game.  But...  Don't pay full price for them.  They come on sale regularly enough, so just hold your horses (and your cash) and get them at a reduced rate.			"

												I couldn't recommend this game more, while it's not for everyone; if you like strategy games, you're sure to like this.It allows you to establish an empire, with the main focus being on European colonisation and expansion, but you can do it as almost anyone, for example you could colonise America as Castille (later Spain), conquer everything as Russia or maybe attempt to conquer the world as the Ryukyu islands.The game isn't just your normal conquest game, it has lots of micromanaging and you must be careful what you do.Cons;VERY steep learning curveCan get tediousParadox manages to mess up every patch for a day or soPros:Once you've learnt it it's loads of funNo game is the sameMods on Steam WorkshopSo, if you ever wanted to conquer France, but realised that you're not allowed to do it in real life, then here's the solution to your problems, do it in the most fun strategy game in ages!

												This game is great! Overall it is a huge improvement from the Third with much better working diplomatic and trade system. This is no longer a game about conquest (In Europa 3 I took over all of Europe fairly easy as the Ottomans. And then there wasn't much point in playing) but rather about good state building over time. Mods work very well on the game there is full steam support for them.

PDX games are usually great, supported, and worth the money without the DLC, but you can also choose to enhance your experience and get another 40-50 hours out of it (assuming you don't play multiplayer) for 15 Euro. That's a ***** great value!			"

PDX games are usually great, supported, and worth the money without the DLC, but you can also choose to enhance your experience and get another 40-50 hours out of it (assuming you don't play multiplayer) for 15 Euro. That's a ***** great value!			"

												This game is fun. Start out small.Conquer some countries. Get rich. Get a gigantic coalition against you.Lose game.Repeat.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For all of the people swayed by the amount of DLC in the game that you can buy, note that you do not have to buy it in order to enjoy this game. For about a good 300 hours I played this game with no DLC and only then I bought 1 after. The DLC enhances and further immerses you into the game. The game is complex, and has a huge depth. Even after 1K hours, I still don't know how to  conquer the world yet lol. This game will make you frustrated, angry, sad, happy, and narcissistic. I definitely reccomend this game to those who like grand strategy, conquering, and those who are into history.			"

												Great game, its a lot like Hearts of Iron but with like 1,000 percent more to do and more countries to pick from and 400 years or so of ruling dynasty, only down part to this game is all the DLC equals allmost 300 USD!!!!! like who the heck is going to pay 300 bucks for DLC for a game? I could see makeing them 4.99 or 9.99 the most but this 19.99 for a damn patch or 29.99 for a patch is stupid and the policy needs to be looked at, im giving it a thumbs down because all aspects of the game count includeing DLC, its to expensive and I wouldnt waste your money on it, can only do basic world domination without DLC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												One of my all-time favorite strategy game!  Been playing the EU-series since EU 1!+Fun multiplayer+Good community and mods+Lots of DLC.s , but you don´t need them all since many new features is included in the patches.-Somewhat steep learning curve although much better than the previos  EU1, EU2 and EU3 -Some problems with backward compabilities and saved games when new patches are released, but you can go around the problem by choosing whitch version of EU  want to play in Steam.

Name one game that is 4 years old and still has a developper actively releasing patches and dlc at an interval of 3 - 6 months. except other paradox titles. and Valve, ok you got me there.anyway, if you are a strategy fan you must play this game. In essence it's just a very fancy excell sheet that allows you to paint the world map in your chosen color but boy will you have fun doing it and feel like a clever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the same time.

												Base Rating 9.5(With Major DLC)All Right many of my friends were very nervous about purchasing this game after all it is 40 dollars or your local equiavalent.I was the first of our group to purchase this because I was told it was more empire managment than another paradox game that you might be famaliar with Crusader Kings 2. I Enjoyed that game and it was my first paradox game that I didn't rage quit in 1 hour.So the basic thing that made me buy it was that I heard it was similar to CK2 but it was in my favorite time period except more empire management. Now I had watched videos about the game but I was still incrediably nooby and died a crapload of times thanks to my refusal to play large nations. I feel like theres a huge learning curve and lots of planning and proper execuation to properly reach your goal. At times it will be filled with complete disparity as events such as Peasant's war will hit you at the absolutley worst time. First time it happend I was playing with a friend multiplayer and it begun after I literally just seconds after I finished a massive war with Austria. My friend and my ally tried his best but was also exhausted because he had aided me in the previous war. If things couldnt get worse my treasury was depleting fast so I had to disband most of my heavy ships. To make matters even worse England(Allied with Austria) seeing my weakness delcared war on me and so did bunch of idependent rheinlander states. Mircaulously me and my ally prevailed and I got revenge on all those who wronged me and invaded the british isles. All this brings me to the point that this game is filled with possibilities and that I only sctrached the surface with this review. Therefore I must oblidge on fullheartly recommend this game for anyone who loves Grand Strategy and Historic games. GoodLuck and Godspeed!			"

GameplayIn a few words: The game is great!In a long story: The game is great, first when i bought this game i though oh well, this is going to be easy to play. I have played the older EU games and the total war series... Man was i wrong when i thought that.Firstly i played the tutorial, i'm someone that always plays it no matter what game, well the tutorial itself was already hard because the whole UI was different, after a few hours i got the UI in my head. So yeah that was a piece of cake.The game itself was really hard for me, i was so used to the total war series and its warfare and diplomacy.After a long time reading the EU4 wiki i began to understand how the game worked. Diplomacy was not like just doing it you had to think ahead in time.Warfare was different too like a siege, you just need a general to get a better siege, also attacking the stronghold while the walls were still standing was a bad idea. Well i learned that.Best of all you can pick all the countries, this gave me so much freedom that i sometimes still abuse till this very day.Even passing through any new reforms, and new technologies really feel like they do something to your country as a whole and its people.The game itself doesn't provide any turnbased gameplay, no it's all realtime even the multiplayer.You think you can be powerfull as Germany, France, England or Russia or any other country? Well forget it, if you're too agressive other countries will go in a pact against you, i mean come on man the AI feels so smart in this game, yes sometimes it's bad but hey it's a game.ModdingAfter playing this game for a while i wanted some different gameplay so i installed mods, like the Extended Timeline Mod, which really recommend, but only after you've played the original game first!After installing some music, graphical and other mods that change gameplay, the game felt even more differently!ImmersiveDon't get me wrong, this game is not immersive like Battlefield, Call of Duty or Red Orchestra (2).This game is more immersive like you're really feeling that you belong to the country and it's ""digital"" people. If something happens in your land that has any influence to your land and its people you really have the feeling to do something about it, well you better do it otherwise you get ♥♥♥♥ed in the **** later on.But i mean, man my country is devided by its religion, the other side is catholic. Meanwhile the protestant part wants a reform. Netherlands! ^^.Even forming the Netherlands as Utrecht in IronMan mode was a ♥♥♥♥♥, i had luck  that France was willing to help me fight against Burgundy. Even though if the king died i would have to face Austria.Yes the game can be confusing, but also very very simplistic.So many shiny buttons yet so few.OverallI recommend this game to anyone even you haven't played any EU series, i promise you this game provides a totally different gameplay then most other strategy games.This game is a grand stratagy game not just any ordinary strategy game. so what are you waiting for!start throwing money at your screen, just freaking now. Come on ******* NOW!!! "

												tl;dr: Great game, lots of detail and depth, people attacking DLC policy ignore the fact that the base game is perfectly fine on its own and purchasers are not being cheated.Dear Reader,Please take the reviews bashing Paradox for their DLC policy with a grain of salt. Paradox is not cheating buyers, nor have they cut up the game and sold it in pieces, or in any way ""forced"" players to buy it. The game was released in 2013, and since then has seen a constant stream of updates, patches and improvements. Many of the new features and all of the patches are free. While I concede that the game has a great deal of DLC and many of them are overpriced (when not on sale, at least), Paradox has continually improved the game even for people who don't buy the DLC. I reccomend trying the vanilla game and getting the most critical DLC (Art of War, Common Sense, Cossacks, Rights of Man) on sale if you like what you've seen. While some of the features of the DLC are extremely useful, the game is not broken without them, and they are not necessary to play.On to the game itself:Europa Universalis IV is an amazingly detailed grand strategy game, and one of the best games I have ever played. Its diplomacy, warfare and economics are incredibly detailed and diverse. Variations in country attributes, religions, geography and government give the game near-infinite replayability (for me at least), and the ability to customize your nation and choose it's path means you can create anything from a globe-spanning colonial trade republic to a strictly authoritarian monarchy with an unbeatable military. I strongly reccomend the game to anyone with the slightest interest in strategy.The devs are friendly, communicative and take player feedback. Nearly all issues that players bring up are dealt with, and devs are active in conversations on the Paradox Forums. The community is also friendly and reasonably large. Multiplayer games are common and the subreddit and forums can usually answer any questions you have. Just watch out for the memes.While the price tag can be imposing, the game regularly goes 75% off. DLC can also be found regularly for 75% or 66% off.Just to let everyone know what they are getting in to: when I say this game has depth, I mean DEPTH. While this is great for creating intrest, realism and replay value, it also means the game can be complicated and confusing to start. This is NOT a game where you can click around and easily figure things out for yourself; I would reccomend any starting player to find a friend who already knows the game to explain it to you. Starting will probably require an hour-long explanation that will leave your head spinning, but after you get started, the game provides hundreds of hours of challenges and fun. If none of your friends own the game, there are many guides to try to help you get started or understand a certain country, and as mentioned before, the community is large and happy to answer any questions. Just search for the EUIV subreddit or the Paradox Forums.Happy Conquering, Everyone!			"

												This game is quite fantastic for when you're depressed or having an existential crisis or anything alike. Since it's time consuming and requires you to pay a fair amount of attention, it helps take your mind off of what is keeping you down in the dumps. Sometimes you can sort play it absent-mindedly and just indulge yourself in some decent music or a deep conversation without losing all your focus on the game.It's not a mind-blowingly awesome or hugely-rewarding game, but it's like the best to kill time with. I'd compare my experience with Europa Universalis IV to going on big♥♥♥♥♥walks and drives and♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Fun game, overpriced DLC. Paradox makes good strategy games but they treat their customers like cash pinatas. I would recommend against buying any Paradox add-ons as they are thinly-veiled cash grabs. As for EUIV, hold off on purchasing until it's on sale for 50% off.			"

												One of the very best grand strategy games out there. If you have a thirst for world domination and do not like people to tell you how to get there, then this game is for you! You get so many avenues of approach it will become a whole thesis just to list them all. It's about building your country, keeping your friends close and enemies closer, its about building up your army and staying ahead in technology, so that your armies get that edge they deserve! Its about the buildup to the perfect coup de gras. One thing this game does well if to present choices without dumming down the mechanics, in fact it is my experience that with new expansions they ad or expand on gamemechanics making the game more and more immersive, and thus giving the player even more ways to move ahead. This means however that the game has a steep learning curve for new players. You can expect to spend the first 10 or so hours to get a good grip of the basics and still have trouble beating your larger neighours. But the satifaction when you first manage to take down France is immense!To help you, there is a very good and fleshed out wikipage, that for the most part gets updated almost instantly after new expansions gets released.For me, and this is the reason ive reached this many hours on the game, is multiplayer. Going into multiplayer with friends or finding players through the paradox forums, will add a whole new game experience to the mix. Every area of the game gets improved, war, diplomacy etc. The multiplayer part does have a few problems though, as with most paradox games, the game can get unstable after a while, and out of sync problems can and will happen. Slower computers or computers with unstable or slow internetconnection will also present a problem, but can for the most part be solved with slowing down gametime.I recommend this game because there are so many fun hours to be had. Because the way you want to play it, is entirely left up to the player, and because Paradox seens genuinly interested in improving upon this game with its now many expansions.			"

It is also an excelent multiplayer experience.			"

												You guys should change the name to DLC Universalis or Paradox Universalis. I've tried playing EU4 on my friend's as I played it there over 1000hours with complete bundle. Now, I already bought the game on my own account and sadly, not in a complete bundle. I have to say that this game is so f*cking expensive. Many DLC should have been released as an improvement patch but a DLC? You gotta be kidding me.I like your games, especially THIS ONE. but all these pricey stuff making me uncomfortable.Should I recommend the game to my friends? Sure. Will they buy it If I tell about this pricey stuff? Probably not.			"

												If you want to spend 100 hours learning the basics of a game, Europa Universalis IV is a great choice. It also helps if you are interested in alternate history/history and geography. Quite a bit to learn from it too!The only negatives according to me, are the DLC required for the optimal experience (there are often sales though) and the fact that the game is very time consuming, especially in the learning phase (of course this is not a problem if you simply do not mind spending time on it).

												In all of Paradox Entertainment's vast arsenal of historical ""strategy/simulation"" games, Europa Universalis has always had a special place in my heart.The attention to detail is fantastic. What one would dismiss as simple flavor (unit graphics, etc.) is actually an integral part of EU IV, the latest game using the Clausewitz engine, which basically freed this genre from its old horrible graphics. The GUI could use a little bit more work, and it's as clunky as it has always been with Paradox games, but it does the job well and there are major improvements nonetheless.Historical accuracy is also fascinating, although one could have some problems with how some historical events are translated into the game's language (modifiers, rewards, etc. sometimes may not exactly reflect the impact some of these events had in the history of the Empire that the player chooses to play.It still is a fascinating piece of art, with an engaging gameplay that can glue one to the chair for hours end. The ""just one more turn!"" effect of the Civilization series translates here to ""just one more year until I save and quit"".The music has improved so much since the older days of the franchise.10/10, would buy again.

												Ironically, I did not like the game at first and submitted a refund request. But, as fate would have it, I went over the 2 hour limit in the tutorial section; forcing me to either quit and throw away (...what was it...$30?) cash or bite the bullet and force myself to play. Well, thank god I chose option 2, because it is now one of my all time favorites.  Quite simply, if this game was a household name, it would destroy the Sid Meiers Civilization series. The game is really just genious, I can't even begin to describe how brilliant it is. Paradox created something truly special here, this game and the rest of their games are truly their own genres. This review is not even just on EU4, this is a review on Paradox. Paradox Interactive, I applaud you. Despite being relativly small, you have created some of the biggest games ever: Mount & Blade series, Euroa series, Victoria 1 and 2, Hearts of Iron, and Crusader Kings 1 and 2 (EU4 and CK2 being my favorites). Many may say that you overrice small, pointless DLC, but for you guys, I really don't mind.There are already hundreds of detailed reviews online and right here in Steam Reviews, so check them out if your intrested in pros and cons. I am here to simly say:                This game is a gem, Paradox is a gem, I love staring at maps, France can blow me and remove Kebab.			"

												Europa Universalis IV is a global grand strategy game covering the period from 1444 to 1820.  The game is complex and rich in detail.  It offers extensive replayability not only in the choice of nations (from the great nations of Europe or Asia, a small merchant state or a american / meso-american tribe) but the strategic path you take to build your empire. You can start with a great power such as France or England and carve a path of conquest thru Europe, or start  with a small merchant state and expand thru trade. Choose Spain and build an empire by colonizing the New World (and Africa and Asia), or perhaps start as the Incas and conquer meso-america.  The gameplay choices are endless.    The game does have a fairly steep learning curve and requires a fair amount of micro managing to build and maintain your empire.  You'll need to build relations, create alliances, establish colonies, protect your trade, create vassals, suppress revolts, arrange royal marriages, research different techologies, establish national policies and embark on military conquests while calling on your allies for support (and cursing them when they tell you to get lost).  And that's just a small sample of the myriad of decisions.  There is a lot of DLC available for the game.  Each expansion release coincides with a game update that introduces free new mechanics while the expansion expands those mechanics with additional features.  While the base game remains playable without the expansions, the full impact of the new mechanics is lost without the expansions.  That's  subjective and a matter of personal taste.  Additional DLC in the form of unit, portrait and song packs are simply a matter of choice.  Of all of Paradox's strategy games, this one is probably my favorite.  The incredible detail and broad range of options make this a must have for anyone who enjoys strategy games.   If micro-managing isn't your cup of tea, then give the game a wide berth. As you can see from my accumulated playtime (1,288 hrs) the game can be really addictive			"

												Despite the rough learning learning curve (which is not as rough as it seems), it's one of the greatest strategy titles out there. Huge sandbox world with thousands of countries to choose from, emergent storytelling, new challenges each time, relatively deep and detailed sustem. My favorite game of all time.			"

												_Game information_I'll be reviewing this game as someone who hasn't played the previous games that much. I've played 1-2h of EU3 while waiting to buy EU4.As of writing this I've played 179h of EU4 and just now finished one game in Ironman mode (saves every month and you can't go back nor cheat). Around 100h of the 179h I've played that one game as Sweden where I own Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Mexico and a lot of provinces of east europe including provinces from Finland to Kazakstan, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and also own provinces around Hamburg in Germanic territory.The game starts at 1440 AD and ends at 1820 AD. You get to choose countries from all over the world to play as and every country has it's own ideas and special events. Meaning that no country is the same as any other.In 1440 AD in North America you have a few natives, including Aztec which are very low tech. In Europe there's a lot of small countries within the germanic region under something called the Holy Roman Empire. A closenit group of countries together with a leading country (starting with Austria in 1440 AD) where the emperor may defend the countries within the Holy Roman Empire. Spain is divided into four countries, Castile, Aragon (where Aragon owns the east side of Spain), Granada (Four provinces South-East of Spain) and Navarra (Small state at the top border between Castile and Aragon).Now, the game is about getting your country to be the best country in the world. You can make your own goals about what you want to do. Conquer the world, become the great power, colonize a continent or form a specific country. If you want to conquer the world you can't just declare war on everybody and take over their provinces, you get penalties for conquering provinces: overextension, aggressive expansion and province penalites like wrong religion and culture group. There's a lot of diplomatic thoughts going into the game and it's supposed to have some real-life mechanics. This is something that Civilization serie doesn't have. A lot of stuff in Civ is independent and you can't any benefits from being behind or penalties from behind far ahead. Civ5 is very flawed when it comes to the diplomacy. The easiest way to win there is by war. In EU4 the easiest way to win is by a good balance between everything depending on the country you're playing as. If you want to declare a war in EU4 you most surely want a Casus Belli. A reason to declare war on a country. Be it for a trade dispute, or conquest. If you don't have a Casus Belli you will suffer a stability cost in your country (stability goes from -3 to +3 and gives a lot of bonuses to you if it's positive). If you have a truce with a country you get a higher stability cost and if there's no Casus Belli they stack. So you can go from +3 to -3 stability if you're doing a dumb move. That alone has cause you to lost a lot of benefits and started to get penalties, revolt risk and a lot of wasted administration points (which you can use to boost your stability. admin. points is mentioned below)You need to have advisors to get special benefits for trade, production, diplomatic reputation and military bonuses. There's also administration, diplomatic and military points which you have to spend on idea groups and technologies. Administration takes care of coring provinces, which reduces overextension, and improving stability. Diplomatic takes care of changing culture groups, reducing war exhaustion and is used to do multiple things in working out an agreement in a war (like taking multiple provinces). Military can be used for harsh treatment to lower revolt risk in certain provinces or to get forced march on your regiments. The points may also be used for building improvements on your provinces. Using up admin., diplo. or military points for certain improvements. Every improvement is different and every province has a different base tax.There's a lot more to the game, there's a trade system, honoring wars, vassalization and there's terra incognita (places you can't yet see in the world). So the game itself has a very harsh learning curve. But some countries are easier to play than others which makes it easier for new players to jump in and learn it without getting run over too much.As I've played 179h of the game for multiple small games and one big game one should think I'm bored. Yet there's so much stuff to do in the game. No country can survive on their own and you need alliances to survive. I will continue to try and play as many interesting countries as I can and see if I can conquer the world or see if I can take care of taking certain continents or taking europe as american natives (like Aztecs)._Sounds_The sounds effects in the game fits in very well and the music as well. You can definitely play for whole day without getting tired of the music or sound effects. Although, the more you play the move the music becomes repetive. I would've liked if they added a bunch more songs that plays._It's not all amazing_There are some issues, that's for sure. The game doesn't display some things and you have to calculate it by looking at the country or looking up equations on the wiki or how the game calculates some stuff. It could've definitely displayed a lot more information somewhere just to make it easier to play the game. And just like most games with player vs. AI the AI has the upper hand. If someone declares war and wants you to join them in a war, you can choose to join or not to join. By not joining you get a -25 prestige penalty and a -5 distrust with some countries. But if you declare war on someone and they won't join you they won't get that penalty. Likewise other stuff. You can't try and buy provinces from other countries but you can sell them. There's a lot more I can't think out on the top off my head but they are not game breaking. It's just small issues that I would've liked to be fixed.When a country declares war on someone else you can't easily see why they declared war or other information about it. You can't see how the war turned out when it ended but you have to look in logs to see if you can find it (which may take forever as a lot of stuff happen in the log).The bugs in the game are almost non existant though. There's one I keep getting from time to time is during the peace offer window if you select the vassal country option the game may just close. But the devs keep updating the game so it might've get fixed in the last update or so._Summary_EU4 is a good strategy game that runs on a speed based system. You have speeds from 1-5 and can pause the game to do stuff while being paused. There's a lot of mechanics in the game for doing certain things like declaring war and gaining the war goal or to get trade power in a trade node. Albeing the game has some issues with not being able to display some things and having some equations that you need to guess yourself up to know what it is and so you know what you need to reach to get a certain value. The wiki is your big help and so is the steam community posts. There may be things like you can't conquer a certain province but it won't tell you why and stuff like that.But all in all, there's a lot of good elements in the game and you can play however you want and get big in some way or another. If you feel like playing a good strategy game with a lot of elements to it with semi-realistic diplomatic systems you should definitely pick it up as you may spend as much time as I have to play the game.

												I have 2,500 hours on this game and I haven't even played all the major nations, let alone half the minor ones. I spent around 200 of those hours playing Mongolia and every single one was great fun, albeit it all resulted in failure.However, this game is not only a singleplayer game. The multiplayer community, somewhat crippled from Stellaris now (but still standing!) is the best aspect of this game. If you ever wanted a good grand strategy multiplayer experience, you have to buy EU4 and go onto the paradox forums and sign up for one of the many readily available games in various timeslots.			"

												You pick a country. You change history. It's fun.In all seriousness, Europa Universalis IV is an amazing game. It's variety of gameplay allowing you to be a one-city merchant nation or a nation that can potentially conquer the entirety of the inhabitable planet allows for many strategies and play styles. The game has streamlined since EU3, but for the better. When most games claim to streamline they really just mean dumbing down mechanics to reach a broad audience, but Paradox knows that wouldn't work. Their playerbase is far too devoted to allow that. In fact, the game expands in many important areas, such as ideas and warfare. While there isn't many surface layer improvements from EU3, the game definitely did a lot of much needed tweaking under the hood. This game is a must-have for fans of grand strategy.			"

												This is one of the greatest grand strategy games out there along with CK2. Basically you pick any country (that exists) in the world from near the end of the Middle Ages in 1444 A.D. to 1821 A.D. at the end of the Napoleonic age and you play them until the game ends at 1821. Everything is historically based and of course there are hundreds of countries to pick from meaning you'll spend hours and hours of this game just playing a new and different country each time. Each game length varies, but I'd say at least a full twenty four hours each if you really immerse yourself. Every single experience for each country is not the same, as most countries have unique ideas that affect the way you play each country, and they all aren't equally powerful, meaning different approaches and strategies have to be used in order to be successful. Want to change history? You could save Constantinople from the Turks and restore the Roman Empire, or you could even take over Britain as Ireland. The possibilities are endless. Downsides? Not much, however the game and UI can be overwhelming to some at first.			"

												In the year 1542, when the Kingdom of Lithuania conquered the Crimean peninsula and vassilized the Duchy of Muscovy, the Ottoman Empire attacked Lithuania, along with the forces of Novgorod and Poland. On the other side of the world the Kingdom of England, ruling over the french, got into a war with Castille. And only Asia was at relative peace. For the time being.You can change history.

												It's one of the most awesome strategies i've ever played. Now reasons why it's the best one:1st Game is connected with steam, so we have working multiplayer mode here, which works great2nd Another reason about steam, we have workshop connection so there is no problem with having even more awesome entertaiment.3rd It's still great Europa Universalis but even better than older parts of this serie 9/10 'couse bugs sometimes, anyways i love you paradox :D			"

												欧陆风云四是一款天体太空模拟类游戏作为玩家，你需要随时随地与各种外来不明飞行物体进行对抗游戏开发商称之为“扫帚星”相比于普通的彗星来说，这种扫帚星的可怕之处在于一旦它们经过地球上空，那么你的国家的子民就会产生极大的恐慌然后民心不安、政局动荡、甚至于国家分崩离析。更可怕的是，这种扫帚星是完全不能被预测的，在带来如此重大危害的同时，却只会被你的子民所看到，你的敌人会对它视而不见。想想看，在强敌环伺之时来一颗甚至成群的不明飞行物是多么有挑战性的一件事啊，所以欧陆风云四对于那些天体爱好者来说一定是一个非常棒的选择。————————以上~是开玩笑————————欧陆风云四和前作的主题一样，都是选择1444-1820之间的一个国家，然后操纵它一直玩到游戏结束，整个游戏围绕着外交、贸易、殖民、建设、战争、以及各种丰富的随机事件进行（就像之前所说的慧星划过天空事件、、、）欧陆风云四总得来说比起前作，画面精致了很多可操作和需要考虑的地方也多了很多，当然，限制也多了很多，和前作比起来，它更加贴近真实就像Paradox所宣称的那样，我们做欧陆风云4，就是要让游戏自动运行的情况下重演历史对于历史控很有吸引力，虽然对欧洲以外的国家设定非常偏颇一些想玩东亚国家的人会在初期受挫，不过这个游戏的MOD众多，并且有一大批玩家正在不断地制作新的MOD（我就做过一个不过后来半途而废了、、、）画面质量：★★★游戏乐趣：★★★耐玩程度：★★★★★上手速度：★更多可能：★★★★			"

												Epic.  This game is a history buffs drug of choice.  In depth trade system, war, global domination.....  you really have to be up to the challenge but you will love the scale of it if you are in to challenging historically accurate gaming.  The music is great and you can just relax and play for hours - save the game and come back in a couple of days or weeks later and be ready to pick right back up and learn about how events unfolded in the world while attempting to design the world in your own vision.  Love this game!!			"

												Probably one of the best games ever released. Please mind that you need to spend ATLEAST 15-20 hours before this game actually becomes enjoyable, trust me. The learning curve is pretty steep and you'll struggle to understand anything at all the first few hours. If you have a friend playing, force him to help you. If you don't, check out the EU4 Wikis. But when you learn how to brutaly conquer your neighbouring nations, it will be worth it. You'll look back and suddenly realize why you that one time lost all your stability, because you declared war on your own vassal. I do think this game is for everyone, if they just take their time to learn it. But will mostly apeel to people who are somewhat interested in history. Despite a bunch of bugs leading to several game crashes since the Art of War patch (Which are mostly fixed by now), this is probably one of the most polished and well developed game out there. The historical accuracy is on point, the cheer amount of playable nations is insane and there is just SO much to do, almost every nation is unique in atleast some ways and you'll face different problems as each one of them.

												This is a really nice game and I recommend it to all of those who are passionate about history, geography, and love dealing with diplomacy, economy, politics and military in real-time strategy games.I've played it for more than 500 hours already, and I plan to play it much more. You can play with virtually any historical nation from 1444 to 1821. Just about every nation and every game will give you a very unique experience. For instance: playing with Songhai is very different from playing with Granada, Portugal or one of the daimyos (in Japan). Even if you start two new games with the same nation, you're likely to experience some very different challenges as relationships with other nations can easily turn the table to your advantage or disadvantage. Big empires can crumble like a deck of cards or they can shine and get virtually unstoppable. An obvious tip: Pick your allies carefully. Having some very powerful allies can definitely guarantee an unlikely survival (as my game with Granada taught me).As for complexity, I think EU IV is complex enough to be a turn off for many players who prefer simplistic mechanics, without all the strategy that's inherent to a game like EU IV.It's not a game for those who want a ton of action. It's not that type of game, it's not fast-paced, it's a game for those who are patient and enjoy using their intelligence. It's not about how fast you move your mouse or how fast you press your keys. It's about how smart and lucky you are during each new decision. Poorly planned wars, economy, diplomacy, technology or bad national policies can lead to catastrophic results for your nation.It's a rather difficult game to play unless you pick one of the big empires (France, Spain, Ottomans). And even then there's a learning curve if you don't want to get ruined quickly.Replayability is great, since each new game you start produces some very different outcomes and challenges. Oh and I almost forgot: Objectives. There are no fixed objectives, you set your own personal objectives or you can try to get the Steam achievements, some of them are pretty challenging such as the ""Re-Reconquista"", in which you have to conquer the whole Iberian Peninsula with Granada. Achievements are available only in the ""Iron Man"" mode, which is basically a ""hardcore mode"" (very difficult) since you can't use multiple save games, you're stuck with a unique save game per game that gets automatically updated with everything you do, there's no way to go back and so you ""can't fix stupid"". :)I totally recommended this game for many hours of gameplay.

												This has become my top most played game over the past number of years, with about 300h of play logged. It took me the better half of that to just learn the game (not to mention re-learn after each expansion), before I could appreciate and really enjoy it. Its still a struggle to ""master"" the game to this date. Despite this, it is by far one of my favourite games and I think I know why. This game does NOT baby you, its brutal to the core and doesnt let you get away with any mistake. So many games these days hold your hand, guide you down a path, re-load right where you fell off that cliff..... so when you actually ""achieve"" something, it truly means nothing at all. So long as this is the type of game you enjoy and you take time to learn / understand it... You will love EU4! Its the type of game you keep saying ""one more turn"", most rewarding when you create that ultimate power play. Really I could talk about the mechanics of this and that...but all around for ME.... this is a 10/10 game beyond any doubt. TIP FOR BEGINNERS:  Load up a scenario and watch a YouTube ""Lets Play"".  Listen, study, learn by watching those who know how to play.  Its the best way and its ok to fail (because you will, a lot!).			"

												This game offers a brilliant strategic experience. The game excels in intricate strategy, giving you an exciting experience of planning and delivering the decisive strikes that allow you to demand the provinces of your choice in a peace deal. Careful consideration on how to optimize your relations with other nations is an important part of the game, so you can't have action all the time (especially if you're starting off as a weak nation). You have to construct a good strategy for expansion, or else separatists and coalitions can become a real pain the♥♥♥♥♥ Patience is also required. EU4 is one of my favorite games, but can end up taking too much of your time. I strongly recommend this game.Success story from game:It took me 50 hrs/130 years to integrate Norway and Sweden as Denmark, but it was worth it. Now I'm planning to dominate Østersøen and take England. France finally decided that I wasn't their rival and now we're best mates. Not so success story:I played as France, took Venice, gained too much Aggressive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and all of Europe entered a coalition against me. I got rekt. End of story.			"

												I bought the Europa Universalis IV Collection which is normally about $110 because it was on sale. The game was actually really fun although very complicated. When I looked online for help, I found out that some of the features of the game that are required in order to win are locked because there are 115 DLC PACKAGES. It would be one thing if these DLC packages unlocked playable factions but it's frustrating that they unlock what seem like necesary features.			"

												This game is fantastic for any strategy player, the game is unique and every game is different with every country. The only real problem with the game is the difficulty in earning achievements, to earn them the game must be played in Ironman Mode this would be fine but this becomes a Steam cloud save, I know many who also have issues with Steam cloud on EU4 this is frustrating and eventually means I rarely try to reach achievements. Overall the game is brilliant apart from the achievements and a few bugs.			"

												This is one of my favorite Paradox games. Like most of their games it is extremely complex but unlike other Paradox games it seems a little more streamlined. It's servers for multi-player (while not perfect) are much better and hold stronger than others. They do a good job of updating content and trying to fix problems that arise from new updates. This game is amazing fun and addicting and as a fan of history made me look even deeper into specific time periods I didn't know much about. This is a great game to learn and play if you have been looking into getting into a grand strategy game.			"

Like, ever.It's honestly a really fun but sometimes frustrating game. Ironman is sometimes a true challenge if one happens to bump into France or the Ottomans in the mid-game, and France or Prussia/Germany/HRE in late game.			"

												I love Europa Universalis IV, I really do, so not being able to recommend it pains me. But the cost of this game is just ballooning to ridiculous heights. I don't mind all the cosmetic DLC. I didn't the cost of content DLC, when they were reasonably priced and added significantly to the scope of the game. But I can't accept paying $15-$20 every few months for incremental changes.At this point I haven't played the game for months. I keep holding out on playing it, hoping the costs of the last few DLC will drop to sane levels so I can purchase them and have a proper gameplay experience that'll mesh well with the free updates. But I'm finally realizing this is ridiculous. I love EUIV, but it's not worth this stress. I have better things to spend my money on than mediocre updates that cost half of what I spent on the whole game itself.			"

												Spent nearly 2500 years building up a the Salish as a north and south american superpower. Everywhere on both continents were in my position... then the spanish showed up and crippled my economy, took south and central america away from me and force-fed their religon to my nation. Then the british and dutch showed up to take everything else. The year was 14 B.C.E. when we began, by 1400 B.C.E. we had complete dominance over half the world. Then came 1633.... now the year is 2004 and Im the forced vassal of canada living in a tiny Yukon enclave. Welcome to EU4 everyone. Best game ever. Only one problem.... the DLC. I love this game but I will join with the rest of the community to say this, dont buy the game unless you want to end up spending 40 bucks every few months to feel like you own the full experience... They might as well just force a paid subsciption service into it.... seriously... not cool Paradox...			"

												I would recommend, but one of the more recent patches has placed in the completely unwanted ""corruption"" mechanic, which punishes you for being small and growing, and rewards you for being large and imperial. It sucks out your meager funds and makes 2/3 of nations frustrating and unplayable. No one asked for this, and there are no mods I know of that get rid of it. Shame.			"

												Paradox makes the most immersive Grand Strategy Games for the PC and Europa Universalis IV is no exception. Start the game any individual day you want from 1444 to 1820 and from the moment you click unpause, history is forever re-written. If you want to play with accuracy, great. If you want to conquer the world as Albania, also great. If you want to be Venice and just hoard trade, wonderful. Yes, the game has flaws. Yes, the game has bugs and exploits. It's not the most perfect game in the world, but it delivered what it promised to be as one of the greatest Strategy Games in a long time. 9/10			"

The answer is no, just look at all the dlc, nearly 300 dollars. Just ridiculous. I wish I could give a positive review, it really is a 10/10 game, but if I have to pay 300 dollars to not play the game, then I cannot in good conscience. Even if I could play the game, it isn't worth the amount of money you have to pay for it.It's like you're assembling a puzzle, but you have to buy each piece.			"

												Europa Universalis 4 is a great game. Some of my favorite things about this game is that it is super easy to learn how to play. By playing as the recommended nations at the beginning and limping your way through the game, it is very easy to figure out the basic mechanics of the game. By watching channels such as Arumba, Quill18, Shenyyr2 and others, you can get an a good taste of what is going to be in the game. Watching the most recent videos is a must because the game updates frequently and changes are constantly made to the game to help improve the playability for new and experienced players. The game also offers a lot of different paths in which you can take your country. I personality have played 5 Brandenburg->Prussia-> Germany games and three Russia games courtesy of this. The game also makes you want to achieve more the next time you play and each time you play you will learn a lot more about the games properties that you can take into the next game.In comparison to other strategy games such as the Civilization Series and others, this game offers a lot more to newer, and more experienced players. In Europa, the game makes it very hard for you to ""lose"". In Civilization, there are cases in which your entire civ can be eaten at once because of the broken happiness mechanics. In Europa, game mechanics such as over-extension prevent other countries from eating you in one gulp. Keeping this in mind, it is important to select countries that cannot be annexed in one war so you have wiggle room. Castile, Portugal, England are prime examples. All have relatively stable borders and have relatively easy neighbors to conquer. This makes it easy for you to first learn the basic mechanics. The game includes more in depth methods of controlling income, trade, military and diplomacy among others. One thing about the game that puts it above others is that the game is epic without DLC's. Civilization falls into the trap that it is completely necessary for you to spend $90+ dollars on expansions to make the game balanced. In Europa, the expansions that come out are accompanied by giant updates that add the core elements of the expansions into the base game. The game also has tons of music packs and lots of unit reskins to help customize the game. There are some problems with the game however. The game has a very long play time. In a game as France, a country that requires a small amount of micromanaging because of it's god troops, it took me five hours to go from the standard 1444 start to the 1495 with wars against England and Burgundy. The game also has some broken mechanics as well. The French get really good troops, early on in the game when historically, they only had really good troops towards the end of the captain. France can take on half of Europe in a war and win because of there national ideas. Prussia and Sweden also have really good ideas but they start in precious positions, on has three provinces and on with low force limit and manpower respectively. There is still a lot changes in the game being made and some should be addressed eventually however. The game also suffers from graphical glitches as well when zoomed out and late game it also has performance issues for people with the minimal requirements.If you get this game, you are in for a lot of fun. The community is really good. Paradise Plaza has hundreds of posts that explain how people made there country into powerhouses. The wiki includes detail descriptions of all the game mechanics and formulas that will help you calculate certain modifiers in the game.Final Score: 9.2/10 A great buy.			"

												A very great strategy game. Totally not sexy in looks or gameplay (battles are always autoresolved), do not expect dynamic explosions of pixels or adrenaline rushes. Having said that, it is one of the most balanced strategy games I know of. Forget world domination, forget blitz krieg. It is slowly, ever so slowly building up your empire, crawling forward in time, watching numbers go up and down, and micromanaging. It is basically a spreadsheet game with a map, numbers are all that matters. Soothing music that carries the feel of ages, though a limited number of songs.This is a game for patient people, for those with affinity for history, and for hard core strategy lovers. If you like heart pumping action, skip this.I did buy most content DLC, and I can very much recommend the one allowing you to form cutom nations. That really prolonged the joy I had from EU IV. The extra music DLC is a definite no no.Did not try out the lastest DLC seriously yet, it seems to make quite a difference in the way wars are fought.			"

												i'll be honest i haven't played as much as i'd like to have but there is a very simple reason behind that. When i played for the first time i tought that this will be the best game i've ever played but then i came into contact with a few features that seemed odd, missing or out of place. I ignored it at first but then i made the mistake of looking at the DLCs. It was disgusting in short not only did features that should have been included in the game upon release or in patches but  some of the core games mechanics and features were set up so you had to buy DLC in order to enjoy the game for more than two playtroughs. I really hope that this isn't a persistent sales trick because i really have enjoyed all of Paradox's games i've played but if it's the same with their future games i sure as hell ain't buying s**t from them and would ask of others to do the same so we don't get another EA.

EUIV has a great ambient to it, whether it be from the detailed senery in it, to the general complexity to the game. In my standards it really lives up to the bar of Sid meires Civilization Games.   The historical accruacy of the game helps tie the game together as you take the role of any of the worlds previous (or current) civilizations starting from the year 1444. For better or for worst, you control you country from start to finish, altering time as you go. Overall, good game... Until you get beat the life out of you by France.			"

Keeping this in mind, it is important to select countries that cannot be annexed in one war so you have wiggle room. Castile, Portugal, England are prime examples. All have relatively stable borders and have relatively easy neighbors to conquer. This makes it easy for you to first learn the basic mechanics. The game includes more in depth methods of controlling income, trade, military and diplomacy among others. One thing about the game that puts it above others is that the game is epic without DLC's. Civilization falls into the trap that it is completely necessary for you to spend $90+ dollars on expansions to make the game balanced. In Europa, the expansions that come out are accompanied by giant updates that add the core elements of the expansions into the base game. The game also has tons of music packs and lots of unit reskins to help customize the game. There are some problems with the game however. The game has a very long play time. In a game as France, a country that requires a small amount of micromanaging because of it's god troops, it took me five hours to go from the standard 1444 start to the 1495 with wars against England and Burgundy. The game also has some broken mechanics as well. The French get really good troops, early on in the game when historically, they only had really good troops towards the end of the captain. France can take on half of Europe in a war and win because of there national ideas. Prussia and Sweden also have really good ideas but they start in precious positions, on has three provinces and on with low force limit and manpower respectively. There is still a lot changes in the game being made and some should be addressed eventually however. The game also suffers from graphical glitches as well when zoomed out and late game it also has performance issues for people with the minimal requirements.If you get this game, you are in for a lot of fun. The community is really good. Paradise Plaza has hundreds of posts that explain how people made there country into powerhouses. The wiki includes detail descriptions of all the game mechanics and formulas that will help you calculate certain modifiers in the game.Final Score: 9.2/10 A great buy.			"

												Paradox have literally just stolen back this game from users who dont want the ironically named 'Common Sense' DLC.For those who don't know, the latest patch introduced something called 'development' to provencesThe idea being to develop your own infrastructure through the game.. fine, right? ... They then kept the ability to increase this 'development' for the paid DLC - which itself introduces a whole new can of horrible worms you can see the reviews for on that steam page.Imagine buying an RPG and not being able to develop your character without giving the developers another wedge of money, or trying to go through the game on base level stats. Rolling back to the previous version disables achievements.Pardox have just held all their players to ransom. Put a gun to our head and asked for more money to keep playing.If they want to introduce 'development' i'm fine with that. But either put it all in the patch or all in the DLC.. or hell, make EU5 maybe? the value of all the DLC is probably over the value of the original game by now.			"

												Hands down the best Grand Strategy game out there.Try the game and play every campaign you start to the end, I dare you.Cons-Expensive with all the almost required DLCs (Conquest of Paradise, Wealth of Nations, Res Publica, Art of War and El Dorado).-Playing as a random HRE minor nation and bringing it from barely making it to really prosper. And then looking slightly west and seeing the scariest thing of all, the blue blob.Pros-Historically accurate game which gives you a awesome sense of world geography.-Very well supported game with regular updates and new DLC.-Playing any nation and beating France in wars and ultimately reduce them to a 1 province minor as a vassal.

												I love this game. There's no other way around it. In 3 months I've played this game more than I played Civ V in 9 months. It's so much fun. At the beggining it might seem complicated and over your head (""stability""? ""manpower""? ""monarch points""?!?!) But the game's core mechanics are very easy to pick up. You pick a country in a year between 1444 and 1821 (and they're all historically accurate) Pick a OP country like France, Austria, England/Great Britain, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, The Mamluks, Lithuania, Spain, Ming, or the Ottomans for your first playthrough. The real fun, though, is in playing the underdogs, like Norway, Scotland, Saxony, The Teutonic Order, Byzantium, The Papal State, and the like. No matter what country you pick, the goal is to have fun as you try and expand and guide you country to glory over the years and not get conquered. There are history inspired events, countries to form if you meet the requirements, and an easy to mod, though very in depth file structure. The modders are crazy, they think of everything. So, I suggest you buy this game when you have the chance, and maybe you can try your luck in a MP game against me? You'll probably win, but we'll have fun. Oh, and watch out for the comets ;)			"

												The game is fun, but the UI is way too small for my computers resolution and is completely unplayable. Not to mention that the only fix was in a MOD. Does paradox even care? The answer is no, just look at all the dlc, nearly 300 dollars. Just ridiculous. I wish I could give a positive review, it really is a 10/10 game, but if I have to pay 300 dollars to not play the game, then I cannot in good conscience. Even if I could play the game, it isn't worth the amount of money you have to pay for it.It's like you're assembling a puzzle, but you have to buy each piece.			"

												I recommend this because this is the best currently available war/conquest simulation. No, it does not offer exiting real-time-strategy actions because you cannot actually control anything in the battles. But you need a lot of planning. Will your war declaration anger other countries? Can you afford to take heavy losses in the battles that will leave your country vulnerable for a couple of years? A couple of years translates to about 5-15 minutes in the game, depending on your speed acceleration setting. And yes, if you took heavy losses in a war, even if you won it, this means you cannot do much other than waiting for your manpower to recover. And if a rival country exploits this opportunity and declares war on you while you are recovering, you will probably lose wars. Yes, the AI does this, especially if it does not like you, which is almost always the case when you are too successful in conquering other countries.The pros:+ realistic global stratgy simulation+ nice level of complexity+ no features are actually bad+ decent presentation for this genre, I like the music, although it gets a bit repetiveThe cons:- too much micromanagement in large empires (construction, recruiting...), some automatisms would be really nice for colonies- hard to keep track of wars that happen in multiple places, because there is no ""enemy army approaching"" indicator and you cannot have the whole world on your screen (you can, but then you cannot see your armies)Not really a con but still sometimes annoying:You can easily get into a stalemate, where all your enemies have formed alliances around you and there is not going to be any visible progress for a long time. I had some sessions where nothing happened for over a hundred years, which translates to over one hour of staring at the screen and clicking on stuff (such as papal/cardinal support) that you do not really care about. Realistic, yes, but still frustrating.So yes, I do reommend this game, but not to everyone. If you love Crusader Kings II (which is build on the same engine), then you will likely love EU4 as well. If you are generally into the 4X-genre (such as the Civilization series), then you will probably like EU4. But keep in mind that it does have some flaws.			"

												790 hours currently put into this game, including lots and lots of idle, but nonetheless...LOADS of time.This is, a fantastic game. Its one of those games that i always refer to if you have been playing Total War, and auto completing the battles for example, i mean...Total is a terrible game packaged with pretty battles. EU4, is the opposite. Its heavy on content, heavy on strategy, good and fairly believable AI.Stuff generally makes a good bit of sense (don't attack someone on a mountain, beware of really good generals etc.)Civilization is another example of a game that just feels a lot less grandiose once you have played EU4 - it simply sets the bar so much higher.You can play any country on the planet (in the timeframe of the starting date you have picked), you can even make your own if you don't like the ones that are.I'm not sure how do describe it accurately, but if you like heavy strategy games, this is *the* best game out there - bar none.

												So, here is this little nice expensive game with like 15 DLCs each the worth of one individual game. When I got into Paradox Games and saw this, I got scared by the huge ammount of DLCs, but I decided to buy the Deluxe Edition-Whatever crap, and I got like 7 DLCs with that and other small packs. As usual, I skipped tutorials except the very first, and what a grave mistake I done. I get bored by tutorials, but holy ♥♥♥♥ing god, I'm currently at 400 hours and I am still learning the mechanics. Don't let their DLC policy scare you off, it's worth it so much. Awesome game, historically accurate, with tons of flavor and can be even very dynamic with mods. PROS	-Very good replayability due to a wide selection of nations to choose from.-A run-through can last for 50 hours, so you can enjoy this game for a couple of hours a day for about a month, without starting over.-A ton of historical flavor, especially with the DLCs.-Dynamic choices and events, letting you to customize your nation.-AMAZING modding community and Steam Workshop. The modders deserve all the appreciation possible for their further development of the game.-Cool multiplayer-Well-made diplomatic and espionage systems.-Various buildings, resources, powers, and development options. CONS -Specific nations are overpowered. Might be historic but gets annoying for Austria to have 25% more morale than a elite Roman Empir- I mean Papal State army.-AI tends to ally with small, puny states which can stay in your way of total conquest.-Expensive DLCs-Not sure if this a con, but colonization can get crazy and moments and natives tend to advance very well.-Non-western civs are slighty grindy to play as it's hard to advance in tech. My conclusion is that this is an awesome strategy game. A must have for grand-strategy lovers out there. If you are tired of the stupid TW and Civ diplomatic and cultural systems, this game is for you. It very beautifully made, and the world feels very large, so your total conquest will take you some time. Also there are a lot of mods out there to make the game even better than it is already, some awesome examples would be Beyond Typus and The Idea Variaton.Blue French Blob forever.			"

I was angry, but ultimately my response to this massive betrayal by Paradox was to give them £11 more of my money for the new DLC. That should tell you how addictive this game is.			"

												Other people have reviewed this game in more depth and detail than I care to get into. Suffice to say, Paradox was once my favorite game company once upon a time. I loved their games ever since the original Europa Universalis got me into them. This game, is sadly the final straw for me. It's a prime example of feature creep and greed gone wrong. What was once a darn good game near when it came out, is now a hot mess. Honestly, stick with modded EU III over this garbage.			"

												This game isn't for everyone, it is hard to get into due to having so much to learn and take in, but once you get past that, it becomes an addicting and enjoyable experience, yes there can be lots of waiting around for things to happen, and it can get boring after a while, but just like with a board game, it's fun to pick up and play again.This game is like a battle of wits and tricks with all the enemy nations next to you, every choice is up to you, and how you shape history in this period is your choice too, so you can have England succeed in conquering France, or Russia conquer all of Europe, anything can be possible.The game is also super flexible with what nations you can play and the difficulty it presents to you, it is strangly fun to play as a small nation lagging behind in tech than the rest of the world that could be devoured by the larger nations at any time, only to turn the tables and become a great power in your own right, or you can just pick a large nation that suffers severe religious and cultural divide like the Timurids or China. Or you can go crazy and choose one of the native american nations and try to survive being enslaved.This game is argulably the best simulation of history i've ever played, it goes way deeper than Civ 5 ever did, you feel like you are part of history, especially when it comes to later events like the 30 years war and the French Revolution.If your in any way into history, warfare, played Civ 5 and are looking for something more meaty and immersive, EU4 is up your ally. My only advice is give the game paitence, and never rage quit when defeated in war, it's never the end of the world.			"

												First thing: In this game 1444-1821 AD is the time period, unless you use mods. (Just in case you thought it was like Rise of Nations where you start from the 'Ancient Age')I played through the Spanish tutorial where the cheap infantry build in 10 days and then picked Gujarat, where all my units took 60+ days to build (presumably because no westernization yet). Then, all my provinces start out Hindu, but it starts Gujarat out as Muslim. There is no option to change state religion directly. I wanted to change it to Hindu rather than convert every one of my provinces to Islam. Apparently, you can do it by inciting a Hindu rebellion and agreeing to change religion, but I started losing a war against Mewar and stopped playing after that. I probably should have learned the game using a European country first, but I didn't really want to anymore. Non-western countries are completely gimped because they have to ""Westernize"". It would have been very easy to just call that option ""Modernize"". Yes, Europe ended up dominating historically, and I know it's called *EUROPA* Universalis, but in games like this history always unfolds slightly differently each playthrough. It's easy to act contrary to history as a European country, but not as most others (people say Ming is really strong?). As others may have mentioned, technological feats of non-Western cultures are barely acknowledged if at all. Also portraits for advisors for Gujarat are of Europeans. That didn't bother me as much as being forced into hard mode, but for those who want to know, the further you get from Europe, the more the country feels like an afterthought (It's EUROPA Universalis, okay, but it also has Universal(is) in the name).If you're a Western history buff, I guess you'll like this game despite the narrow historical focus. If you were looking to play as your own country and have fun, be aware that your country might be really hard to play.The graphics are alright; it's a menu driven game so I base that on the details on the different map views and how the interface looks overall.I paid $25 for the game with a bunch of bundled DLC/expansions or whatever during June 2015's summer sale. I woudn't spend more than $15 if I got to make the choice again.			"

												I once would of rated this game as positive. But then Paradox decided that it wanted to nickel and dime us and made it so that we can't actually play the full game unless we buy Common Sense. I think they see it as ""common sense"" for us to buy it, but I don't. I'm sad that I have to give this a negative review, but until they fix it I just have to.			"

												This game could use some replay ability. Luckily the $20 DLC content injectors keep me coming back. I hope PDox  follows the same business strategies they used for CK2 by slowly ruining the game and making people buy more DLC in the hopes it un♥♥♥♥s their experience. Another hope of mine is that they will add more interesting yet pointless features like random new world and custom nations to add to make the nation selection screen more cluttered and complicated for new players. One gripe I have is the lack of historical accuracy. Why is the Egyptian culture not connected to the West and Southern African cultures? Don't Swedish people know that the pharaohs were black? The production of slaves in non African province is also very inaccurate. All slaves where only black and only Europeans enslaved people. Being able to convert the Jewish province of Semien is very anti-semetic and I was shocked when I saw the option come up. If they could fix these problems, the game would become more accessible to the urban crowd.I hope Johan will follow my pointers to maximize their shekel output. "

												With their latest update to v1.12, Paradox broke the game for anyone who desires to utilize mods. (They also semi-broke it in 1.11.x).With their latest fix to v.1.12.1, Paradox broke the game even more.  To use any mods, they must be direct downloaded and auto sync disabled.  Based on these (it seems as though they dont really care about making the game playable anymore, and just about money), I would no longer recommend this game to anyone.  It wastes more time trying to get it to run than actually playing it (and playing it is if you are lucky).DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			"

I got to admit it is one of the best strategy games I've played so far.Update:I have 850hours of EU4 on the record. And still there is so much to discover and different angles to the game - it's an unbelievable gaming depth.Everytime I start a new game I lay out a plan on how to adapt and proceed with all the learnings from my last game. Just to find out that there are so many other ways to play it ""right"". The fun part is that I always wind up in a totally different situation than I expected it to be in the first place.This game evolves so much over time especially when you take all the DLCs into account!

In Total War: Rome, we got many desny problems. But compared to this game this is nothing. You won't be able to play EU IV in multiplayer for more than 15 minutes straight.Looking at the net you will see that this problem existed since the game got out. Or even before, hell, even CK2 had the problem. FIX THAT! And it is the best game! I just cannot beliebe that it is so damn hard to code a functioning netcode for this game.

												I love this game, and I want to recommend it but like many others the problem is the DLC. I like the DLCs and if there were 2 or 3 that would be fine, but every month or two they make you shell out ~$20 for stuff they should give for free. The only thing in DLC I could think of that should stay DLC is the random new world mechanic. I would recommend this game if they changed the way DLC worked, maybe half the price, or keep the price and release less often, because right now they give you half a patch and make you pay 1/3 of the original game to get the other half.

												3/3 A well-made and glorious game only with few technical and visual flaws.First of all, the size and the visuals of Map is utterly glorious. It's a sight to see. There are tons of map types for easier control.Core of the game lies in critical-thinking and making quick but crucial decisions about the politics and economy of your country. To sum up, in this game you will be controlling an empire or a small wanna-be empire an you will need your quickness, time management and critical thinking for the future of your nation.Diplomacy and the possibilities of ending a war is almost limitless and also much enjoyable. The best part about this game is not waiting  for ""sieges to end"" or clashing of armies , it's how you end the war. Take your time and make the best choice for your nation.The Multiplayer system is not very good technically but plays almost exactly same as singleplayer and gives much more fun based on count of players.Only bad aspect for me is that this game is too much text-based. You have to imagine some events and even imagine your rulers face. Portraits were there in March of the Eagles for even generals but why not here ? And how bout the absence of voice acting and events with videos (maybe) ? Lack of high-popularity is due to this, in my view.Here are my thoughts, thank you for reading , I recommend this game to all casual,hardcore or average gamers. Strategy gamers should be already playing this. ;)			"

There are almost no redeeming factors in this game anymore. I could list ever issue or thing I liked but I'd really be wasting my time.			"

												If you want to own a complete game this is not for you. If you want to have gamemechanics change on you for the worse three times a year like in a early access title and a 8-dollar-DLC-on-sale (normally 20$ each DLC) pushed to you, then this is for you.EU4 thanks to failed DLC policy and a generally clueless direction in developement is very fast approaching the point where EU3 is better than EU4. It's been out for years but the devs keep changing core game mechanics with every ""patch"" so you actually never can be too sure about the rules. It feels like an early access title to be very honest.			"

But in all honesty, just buy the game! Its fantastic! It has roots from Strategy-based games such as Civilization(Which is also a fantastic game), but at the same time, its something completely different from Civ. What are you waiting for?

												Finally doing a review of this game after a LOT of time playing it and I have to say if you are a strategy game fan this is a must buy.  At the release of the game there were some pretty big problems with balance and bugs, but as of now (February 2014) the game is pretty well polished with a sizeable dlc under its belt.  Basically you can play any nation in the world from 1444-1821.  This means you can be a european country and colonize the world, or be a tiny little tribe in north america trying desperatly to survive the hoards of europeans coming to your shores.  Every nation can be played multiple ways, and you can pick idea groups that give you bonuses to things like trade, income, or military.  This means that (for example) you could play as England and instead of colonizing (as they historically did) you can upgrade your country along a military line that lets you steam roll other european countries and never even touch the new world creating a british empire on the european continent.  And that is just one of several interesting scenarios you can try out, and there is lots of replayablility in that you can play a country over and over again and try new ways to play.I do admit though, when the game first came out playing anyone that was not sufficiently advanced technology wise (i.e. western europe) was a major challenge and sometimes just not fun at all.  With the recent patch native tribes and other ""uncivilized"" countries have a chance in the game and can more easily become westernized creating some crazy scenarios, like say the Cherokee becoming westernized and dominating north america.  As the game stands now though almost every country is very interesting to play and has at least some form of ideas and bonuses unique to it.One draw back though for someone new to these ""grand strategy"" games is that there can be a learning curve involved.  While this game is much more accessible and has much better menus and tutorials then previous games in this series, it can still be a bit overwhelming at first.  This is not so bad anymore as the game now provides a more or less guided tutorial you can play as portugal which will teach you all of the basic mechanics for the game before you play your nation of choice.Above all though, the reason I really like this game is because it does not hold your hand and let you win like many games today do.  It can be extremely challenging and just because you can pick a country does not mean you will win.  This is especially true in ironman mode, which is a game mode where the game constantly autosaves and overrides meaning a bad choice is a permament bad choice.  This makes playing smaller countries extremely challenging and fun (in my opinion) and can lead to some epic wars and come back victories.  The AI is not merciful at all and will gang up on you if they sense weakness (just like would happen in real life) and you can easily lose some wars from time to time if you are not careful.  Overall though, it really adds to the tension, and leads to much more meaningful decision making.The last great thing I want to bring up is the mods for this game.  There are a lot of them and some of them are really really good.  There are mods that add earlier start dates. later end dates, custom countries, completely made up countries, mods that completely change game mechanics, and many many more like skins and music packs.  And since a good majority of them are on the steam workshop it is as simple as clicking subscribe and downloading the mods to play on your game.I would definetly recommend this game to any big time strategy fan, or anyone just interesting in a really challenging and fun game with a great modding community and the potential for more great updates/dlcs to come.EDIT:  Oh and for anyone who likes/plays crusader kings 2 there is a save converter which allows you to put your save game into Eu4 and continue to play as them.  The save converter is pretty awesome because it means there is the potential to play almost 1000 years of history between the two games and create some truly incredible empires/countries.			"

												Starting from the start, I won't spend too much time on the positives, as they're just everything that isn't negative: Really great game, though maybe not as open as it could be, for newbies. Of course, it still is far more approachable than most other Paradox titles. But I felt that the tutorial is lackluster. I learned more from the loading screens than I did from the tutorial and tooltips. It's like; the tutorial teaches you all the basics which are pretty obvious and/or already explained via tooltips - but if you want some of the more hidden factors or components explained, you might be lucky enough to hit a loading screen which explains it, or you learn it given time. (As an example I spent a long time before I learned what shock and fire modifiers did, besides from obviously being the higher, the better)Another annoying, but far more subjective part, is the timeline. I've personally installed a 58-9999 timemod, because I feel the main game is too short; and even though it likes to brag about its replayability, it quickly turns into ""something you have already done"".The nation-creator from El Dorado feels like it should've been in the basic game. Paradox releases far too much DLC, it's getting scary. While I do realise most of these are flavour packs, the basic game just feels too barebones to not buy most of it.With those things out of the way:When you really understand the game (and again, I mean REALLY like, find a collection of the loading screens and read them all, because the tutorial does the game no credit), and if you have enough flavour packs and expansions to keep it varied, this is by far one of the most time-consuming and entertaining games. This is a wealthy man's videogame, make no mistake. But it is by far worth all the money.			"

												Europa Universalis 4 sometimes known as Eu4 is a grand stratergy game that covers the mid 15th to early 19th centuries. Unlike most games you have played Eu4 has no set goal. You can control any historical nation from the times above and craft it to your will, controlling the economy, trade, politics and most importantly warfare. I have only had the pleausure of  playing two games in this series. Eu4 and Eu3 and I must say that Paradox interactive have done a great job of making this rather niche genre more accesible to the casual gamer. Eu4 is much more fast flowing and has a much beter help system than its predecescors and has much more depth in terms of trade and diplomacy. overall i would probably give Eu4 a 7/8 out of ten the only reason I wouldnt put it higher is due to occasional bugs that i and other players have noticed. But still a great game for lovers of the stratergy genre. (If any new players want a game co-op or competitive please post below or send me a friend request.)			"

												My friends and I started up the game as 3 nations right next to each other. I had no idea how to play the game. Slowly, as the virtual years passed, I built up my army. There was a low chance of a rebellion occuring so I ignored it. I spent quite a bit of time gaining a good reputation with West Francia. I was going to use my allies to help me in a war over disputed territory. Finally, I declared war, and things started to look bad. I didn't include my most powerful ally and my other allies were slow to enter combat. I was having serious issues fighting off my enemies. And then, British troops, and other scrubs from some allies of the fools in my disputed territory I was in the war against started to come in. Things appeared better, we had just won a battle. But then, a rebellion occured in my country, and the last of my soldiers were defeated. My friends had already gotten peaces treaties and about 1/3 of my country was occupied by my enemies. It was over. I couldn't even make peace with some of my enemies. Just then, my friends told me we were going to start over. I clicked quit, and eu4.exe crashed. It was a fun time though.Overall pretty fun and not too pricey when on sale. Can't wait till I actually learn the game.			"

												NOTE- As of the writing of this review, I have only 12 hours in the game, may update the review if my feelings change. Would have ~3 times the amount but I acquired the game during the summer sale at almost the exact same time as Kerbal Space Program and Bastion, both also incredibly good games in completely different ways.Beginning stuff: Europa Universalis IV is one of the best games I have had the pleasure of playing. If you are willing to take my word for it, just go buy it. Otherwise, read the rest of the review, and I'll be reviewing a number of its aspects separately and offering some advice.Music stuff : Starting off with the basics, the music in this game is very good. It is rarely intrusive, but always seems to fit what you are doing in the game. The war theme in particular is stuck in my head forever. Depth stuff: This is the area that I feel makes EUIV shine the brightest. To the best of my knowledge, the depth this game offers is only rivaled by other paradox grand strategy games such as Crusader Kings, Victoria, and Hearts of Iron. The game holds a massive complexity that lends a feeling of weight to every decision you make. For instance, in my second, first non-newb game, I played the Ming (basically china circa 1450). Now, as the Ming, you have a number of unique modifiers to your country. First, there is your unique system of government, called the Celestial Empire, which basically means you NEVER have to worry about rebellions within your borders so long as the people believe in you, but as soon as your ruler's legitimacy or your country's stability drop, the people believe you have lost the mandate of heaven and must be overthrown, leading to a far greater level of importance of these facets than in, say France. Second, you have a very VERY irritating country modifier called Inward Perfection, which leads to everything good in your empire being dropped by large amounts, keeping you static. However, lastly you have various factions, each of which more than offsets one part of Inward Perfection. However, only one faction can be in power at a time, leading, at least in my game, to a play style where you can outclass your neighbors in one area, like technology, but as soon as you go to war you have to support a different faction, which crashed your economy until you have your old faction back, or requires that you cut spending in the old area and focus on the one supported by your current faction. This then leads me directly to my next point,Variety stuff: This game has an IMMENSE amount. Instead of having the Ming system, you might choose to become a horde, which gets massive armies and army bonuses, but a ticking drain of other countries opinions of you, or you might play a member of the Holy Roman Empire (Which is, amusingly, not holy in the least, with only the most tangential connection to Rome, and is not in fact an empire), tangling you in a web of diplomacy and allowing you to potentially accrue massive power through alliances and espionage, or maybe playing as England, a country getting wrecked by France in the hundred years war but capable of becoming the largest naval and colonial power on the planet as Great Britain with a bit of shrewd play. Sandboxyness stuff: There is no win condition. You play to achieve whatever goals you would like, and have no restriction in fulfilling them. Want to start a game as Portugal with the sole goal of annihilating all African nations? Convert the Pope to animism? Start as a tiny insignificant one province island with no military or navy and conquer the entire world in 400 years? Go ahead! There is no reason not to!Bad Stuff: Now, despite what my gushing for the past ~ 600 words may have lead you to believe, this game has its fair share of problems. Bugs and glitches abound, with one in particular where having a laptop with an external mouse will cause minor graphics glitches whenever click-and –dragging to select multiple units. None I have encountered are game-breaking, but bear in mind you are not purchasing a bug free game. Another is UI and tutorial. Although I believe the UI is actually quite good, there is just SO much information you have to know how to read that it is often insufficient to the task of filling you in on what you need to know unless you have a few hours experience with it. This would not really be an issue were it not for the tutorial. From what I saw in the tutorial, it is nowhere near adequate to show you how to play properly, and most of your first game is going to be trial and error, and error, and more error. However, sandbox, so that is fine. Quick note, if I convince any steam friends (Or anyone else for that matter) to buy the game, feel free to ask me if you have any questions about the game. If you ask me soon, we can learn together!Other stuff: DLC. There is a lot of it, and it is expensive, especially when added to the $40 price tag of the main game. However, the only ones which you need to worry about are the Wealth of Nations, Conquest of Paradise, and Res Publica when it comes out. The rest are entirely or mostly cosmetics, with some game alteration that won’t affect you at all unless you play the specific nation and won’t affect you much even if you are.Final stuff: Really good game, you should buy it if you are willing to have a steep learning curve and very complex game. The learning curve should be no problem for my Dungeon Crawl and Dwarf Fortress playing friends; it is way smaller than those games. If this review hasn’t convinced you, go try the demo, or maybe wait till it comes on sale, which it will probably be doing in the next couple of months for the Res Publica expansion. Hope you enjoyed the review! EDIT: Holy crap, that is over a thousand words. I was not expecting that…			"

												I think it goes without saying - I've really enjoyed this game. For anyone who likes a great empire builder that focuses on the nuances of creating a sustainable military, economy, and diplomatic relations, this is for you. Opening the entire world up to conquest and play is what makes this a real hidden gem in my book. I was so used to games like Empire: Total War that only gave you a small portion of the world stage to play on, but here you can literally go anywhere you like.Some of the game feels very simplified to avoid confusion, as there is a ton of overhead. So much is happening at once that it's easy for players to get lost when first diving in, but a slew of YouTube video tutorials have been helpful is getting me up to speed. In-all this has been a rewarding experience for me from start to finish!			"

												Europa Universalis IV is the fourth installment of the EU series. In this game you play as one of the many nations that existed during the time span after 1444 up until the early 17th Century. The game is functional, fun and quite challenging on higher difficulties. I reccomend that anyone who grabs this during a sale to also grab the major expansions for it. Those expansions add a lot of options and new mechanics that add more diversity to the game. I'd give it 9/10			"

												At first, it seemed a bit tedious. The game has mechanincs that can be hard to learn. I tried the tutorial and couldn't glean the information I needed out of it. I decided to jump right in. I got it while it was on sale for ten bucks, and if you go to the Paradox Interactive website, they almost always have most of the stuff for it on sale. It's an all around fun game. It can put you in place of any country, whether it be an Indian Raj, a Scottish Brus or a Native American chief. Once you learn the mechanics, the game itself is wonderful. If you're into grand strategy, this is the game for you. It almost never gets bored, and I dare say I'd compare it to Crusader Kings II in playability. If you've got the money to spare, get this game!!!			"

												Toskana, 1780. Owns Italy, Switzerland, southern Germany, and has colonies in the Carribean, Canada, South America, some Pacific Islands, and ALL of Australia. Wow.Similar unexpected scenarios happen with every new campaign you play. Get this game, it's fun :D+ side:- complex and therefore not boring or repetitive gameplay- you can play with ALL nations existing in 1444- many historical startmodes (although I prefer the 1444 one)- campaigns ar NEVER the same- cool diplomacythe issues:- a few bugs (not serious, but somewhat  bothering at times; e.g. fleet with an explorer cannot enter unknown sea territory although it should be able to)- the price ...- you aren't able to fight battles yourself like in TW games8/10 & buy at 50% off. It is an awesome game, that be said. But the downsides pull the rating down a bit, and honestly: Even being the most well-thought-through and coolest campaign-rts in the world. Is a series - how numerous they might be - of 0s and 1s worth 40€? I know peope who would spend that money on this game, and I frankly understand them; but if you end up not liking this game (which might happen due to the bugs) ...Still. If you see it at -50%, BUY IT NOW :D			"

But I was recommended to play this game by a good friend of mine which paid off.The amount of detail in the game and width is just amazing and mindblowing. It's refreshing from all of the triple A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥zzle these days to play a game where you have to think just a little and plan your moves. As a newcomer to this series I can't recommend relying on the games tutorials alone. I'm pretty certain you can find a good amount of guides on Steam but I relied on help from my buddy, but also watching some online tutorials by user ""quill18"".Would definitely restore Denmark to its former glory again.

												This is probably the best strategy game that is currently available. Coming from the Total War series, I've played many different Strategy games but I have to admit, this has the most functions. Surely, the game is pretty complex and hard to get into, but once you've sought all that into you, you can't escape the magical power this game brings. Should I annex my enemy or rather vassalize him? Should I focus on trade or on colonisation? The game offers so many variations, you can play it again and again and still find some new feature.From my side, 10 out of 10 points.			"

												A brilliant and fascinating game! It will take some time to get used to everything. Hell, I don't even know everything yet, but once you do get the basics you can jump right in. I love how this game gives you the possibility to play however you desire.For new players: don't let this game scare you once you first play it. Play through the tutorial to grasp the basics. Once you do, just start playing and enjoy your exploring through the game mechanics. If youy don't understand some aspects yet search on the awesome wiki that contains thousands of articles which really help, or if you prefer watch some YouTube vids where they explain it. I recommend playing a normal game first instead of ironman mode, just so you can reload and save at will so you can learn what your mistakes were. After that however, activate ironman mode immediately! Run the game like it's supposed to. Ironman mode is really a thrill and it makes you think about your choices more, becaus after all the choices will be permanent.This game has everything I wish for in a grand strategy game (if you can even call it that, I think it even surpasses that genre)!9/10			"

												Woud I recommend this game? Yes; yes I would.Though complete world conquest (i.e. owning the entire world) is likely near impossible, it shouldn't be the reason you play this game. Especially as a smaller and/or harder-to-play nation, surviving and expanding definitely still fun, even if you don't even get close to owning the world. If diplomatic action is the name of your game (though I can't say it's mine), the you won't be disappointed either.Things I like about the game:1) Having played EU3, teching is a lot easier in terms of being able to understand and manage how you tech. The simlicity of saving up monarch points is balanced by the idea trees, the advantages of investing in idea trees, and the disadvantages if you don't. Investing in ideas, which ideas to get for which country (and when), and westernising (if the tech group for your country isn't 'western') can be difficult at first (it certainly was for me), but after a few hours of trial and error and some advice based on other people's playthroughs, it is does make sense and it becomes easier. You shouldn't be distressed by this; you just have to put a little time in to learn the ropes.2) Economic actions are easier as well. Even if you're a relatively large empire who has ""control"" over a trade node, getting more than 75-80% of trade going through any given node can be quite difficult, depending on how many countries are competeing for it. Having hated and being baffled by trade in EU3, this was another big step up, and if you're new, something you will also find easy to pick up, but hard to master.3) Though the infamy system in EU3 was arguable quite a good system, I do think that the over extension and and coalition systems are quite good. To briefly explain: over extension is what you get when you own territories that aren't considered core provinces; and coalitions are groups of nations that would all go to war with you if you got in a war with any one of them. OE is managable, but as you get bigger, it does get harder; but there are ways around it (which you can quite easily learn through playing the game). There are two things that bug me, the first being that there can only be one coalition agaisnt you, and as a result, the most unusal countries can be in the same coalition against you (I once had Inca, Mali and Savoy all in a coalition against me). This just shouldn't happen; they should be separate coalitions. The second is: since one of the more recent patches, having coalitions of more than one nation is really difficult to get (not that you want one!) unless there are a lot of little countries right around you that you manage to annoy. Despite this, the OE and Coalition features are definitely good features.4) Vassalising and Personal Unions are generally well done. I can't really say more than that without writing a full essay, but this feature really adds to the game and has made my gaming experiences that much better. Personal Unions are also another neat little feature which adds to the enjoyment as well as the challenge of the game. Again, I can't say more without rattling on, but these features were definitely worth mentioning.5) In terms of multiplayer, I can't speak for how it plays online (because I've enver tried), but LAN play runs like a breeze! Never had any major problems. I have been put out of sync two, maybe three times, but for 50- 100 hours of LAN play, that's far from a bad record!I could rattle on about a lot more little features that I like about this game, but there are too many for me too list.Are there any features I don't like? Definitely!1) There are a couple of nations that can very comfortably expand in particular directions (depending on the nation). I put this down to a couple of things, one of which is how much a difference of 1 in any tech (especially military) can make on the outcome of wars or someones ability to vassalise somebody else. Another is that small nations can quite easily be swollowed with almost no effort, which doesn't seem quite right.2) I can't really explain what it is in this review, but the concept of a nation being a 'Protectorate' as opposed to a vassal is really, really annoying for me, expecially considering there is no way to annex a protectorate. I'm nor sure if you can cancel protectorates, but if you can't, that's another crappy feature of theirs. So all in all, it's a bad feature.There are a few other niggling little features that annoy me, but I honestly don't think they're worth mentioning.So all in all:It is a game that can take a few hours to get the feel of, but it is so much fun! It has an extreme amount of re-playability and is awesome fun with mates. It has so many great features and there are so many ways you can play it, from the nation you choose to the ideas you invest in to war vs diplo. It is an amazing game which is well worth buying!My Score: 4/5			"

												I'm really not sure what I can say about this game, apart from that it, and its sister game Crusader Kings, are the best Grand Strategy games that you can buy. Civ? Total War? These are nothing to the scope and scale of Europa Universalis. You WILL sink hundreds of hours into this game (I believe the average playtime is 100 hours)You will not regret this game			"

												It's a really fun game with 258 countries to play as and you can have up to 258 players so if you have 258 friends this game is for you. This game take a while to really get in to the heat of it so I'd start the game at like 2:30 - 3:00 if you want to finish it. The game goes from 1444 - 1821 the game has many features such as keeping your countrys stability up or an uprising could start, there are pirates the will block your port and stop trade so keep and eye out for that and rebels may uprise if you choose something they don't agree with during an event. There are also DLC (Downloadable Content) that add more feature to the game ;for instance, the Eldorado DLC allows you to create your own country, pick it's ideas, name the ruler and heir, Etc., Anyway this game can provide you with hour upon hours of fun. So stay strong and conquer the world.			"

												An incredibly deep strategy game, with strong roots in history. This game lets you play out your global domination fantasies, starting in Renaissance Europe, in a fully simulated geo-political sandbox. The AI acts very rationally, in terms of their diplomacy and tactical decisions. When I lose, I curse Austria for outmaneuvering me instead of the developers, and that's a very good sign.One warning though, the learning curve is incredibly steep. I'd recommend this most to people who feel that games like Civ V have very simple mechanics - otherwise you may have some trouble picking this up.			"

												I played this game A LOT. In fact, this might be the game i've played the most in my entire life. Paradox is a top developer who strives to deliver great gameplay experiences. If games like Civ are starting to become boring or unappealing to you, EU4 scratches the empire building aspect itch in the 15th century very well. Word of warning: Be prepared to spend time to learn the game basics, like a couple of hours for some, 10-12 for others. YMMV obviously. Luckily, Youtubers are your best source to learn the game. Also the game is constantly patched and changes regularly, which can be somewhat frustrating. But there are ways to rollback to previous versions.  Obviously, i recommend it. Don't be startled by DLC's, the base game alone can provide HUNDREDS of gameplay hours.As for price, it's worth buying at full price. If you can't, there are frequent sales!			"

With several intriguing (but over priced) DLC expanison packs, that add ever more and more interesting mechanics, it brings me back with the same thirst for loot and land that will always make me yearn for more.

												First got this game back in 2013, never read the manual (no surprise there) nor did I have any background knowledge of the game. After being frustrated by the steep learning curve, I gave up on the game and didn't revisit it until a good two years later. The second time around I did my homework prior and boy did the game really open up. Ask me two years ago if I would put 500 hours into this game it would be a hard no. Ask me today and I'll tell you how surprised I am I haven't reached the 1000 hour mark yet. The beauty of the game lies in its complexity and choice. Once you master the basic mechanics its really up to you how you want your run from 1444-1821 to pan out. You can go with the historical route and try to recreate history, or do something radically different and watch the world adapt and become something that could've been. You can focus on expanding militarily, diplomatically, or not at all. You can build empires from conquest, colonialization or trade. Every aspect of the game is well fleshed out and continues to be refined, with each patch more exciting than the last.Not gonna lie, Eu4 will take a long time to master (if indeed that is possible) but in all honesty the game is so diverse in its offerings that you will feel a sense of accomplishment every step of the way, regardless of how many hours you put into it. But I can promise you if you can put in the first 5 hours, the next 500 will come soon enough.			"

The development this game has gone through during these last years is remarkable, and no matter what people tell you: it can be enjoyed without the latest DLC.As you can see from my playtime and that of many others, there has to be something that keeps us in there. I think I didn't spend this much time on a single game outside youthful MMO exploits.			"

You take control of a specific nation, slowly becoming stronger or weaker with every decision you make.  And once you are bored with the vanilla game, enjoy new sessions of the game with game- changing DLC.  This is a must have for Grand Strategy Players.			"

												Overwhelming, I start of saying this as the game has so much going on.  I was lucky enough to have a friend to play with show the ropes.  Base game does feel like it is missing out on some of the features without the DLC but is playable. If I didn't know about the features from friend I wouldn't have noticed(may have asked what that button did in a screen).  If you enjoy micromanagment and strategy games this game should be a great fit!  I am waiting for sales to get the DLC of my own as of right now I only have access to them when I play with friend who owns.  Some complain of DLC price but they do add alot with each one and will give you that much more gameplay out of it as they will add a whole new aspect to the game. DLC comes regularly and keep eye on when that happens because if you update it will break you save files in my experience.			"

												Are you ready to abandon your family/pet/friends/girlfriend/life? Yes? Then hop in and try out Europa Universalis IV also known as the most addicting game in the history of games.When I started playing this game I thought to myself:""Okay, it's another 4X Grand strategy game from Paradox. EUIII was perfect? What can THIS offer?""And honestly... This is EUIII on the new version of Clauswitz. Literally. I could call this game EU 3.5, but I can't. Why? Because it's fun. Really fun. Even if it's just an improval over EUIII.The main thing for me about EUIV is that with the ammount of patches, DLCs and god-knows-what installed, you can really run your country the way you want. Enjoy being a diplomat rather than a warrior? No problem. The game gives you a right ammount of tools with which you can still expand your empire without even firing a shot.The great variety of gameplay styles and countries offers enormous replay value, uncomparable to other Paradox titles. Want a challenge? Start up as an indian nation and experience a completely different game! Instead of colonizing, sailing on the great seas and exploring, you are trying to defend your tiny nation against the foreign invaders. All of this said, EUIV is just a fun game. If you enjoyed previous Paradox titles such as: Europa Universalis III or Victoria II, EUIV will be a perfect title to fulfill your dreams of creating the Swiss Empire.			"

												Some of these negative reviews are hilarious, and it's blatently obvious how butthurt some people are about the new Common Sense DLC. I have every major DLC except Common Sense, an I can say that my playing experience has not been deducted one bit. The game was not ""chopped up"" or ""hidden behind a paywall"" by Paradox, I have three different games running in EUIV, one in Europe, one in Asia, and one in Oceania. In all of my games I am a medium power, and I do not feel like not having Common Sense has put me at a disadvantage. The development system is nearly irrelevant, and is used mostly as a way to sink Monarch Points if you hit the cap.Europa Universalis IV is an amazing Grand Strategy game that cannot be ruined by one measly DLC, and I do recommend buying this game.

												Europa Universalis 4 sometimes known as Eu4 is a grand stratergy game that covers the mid 15th to early 19th centuries. Unlike most games you have played Eu4 has no set goal. You can control any historical nation from the times above and craft it to your will, controlling the economy, trade, politics and most importantly warfare. I have only had the pleausure of  playing two games in this series. Eu4 and Eu3 and I must say that Paradox interactive have done a great job of making this rather niche genre more accesible to the casual gamer. Eu4 is much more fast flowing and has a much beter help system than its predecescors and has much more depth in terms of trade and diplomacy. overall i would probably give Eu4 a 7/8 out of ten the only reason I wouldnt put it higher is due to occasional bugs that i and other players have noticed. But still a great game for lovers of the stratergy genre. (If any new players want a game co-op or competitive please post below or send me a friend request.)			"

												Over two years ago a friend recommended an ""in-depth grand strategy game like no other"" (based on his experiences with EUIII) and I was very sceptical at first, but eventually bought EUIV. I had no idea what I got myself into... Today, shortly before the new patch ""The Cossacks"" and almost 600hours of gameplay, I have to say: it is a fantastic and true grand strategy game! The guys from Paradox have done a fabulous job and the player-community whether it be on the forums, wiki, reddit or youtube and twitch is as vast, friendly and supportive as in the best way possible.In my opinion every buck spent on EUIV is worthwile as you get superb value for money. The exhaustion you feel after playing an entire campaign, the satisfaction you gain out of completing a challenging achievement, the entertainment-factor you get from watching the AI building the craziest empires - all that and more, makes EUIV an unique game. Every (major) DLC was great so far in adding more depth to this masterpiece.			"

												My friends and I started up the game as 3 nations right next to each other. I had no idea how to play the game. Slowly, as the virtual years passed, I built up my army. There was a low chance of a rebellion occuring so I ignored it. I spent quite a bit of time gaining a good reputation with West Francia. I was going to use my allies to help me in a war over disputed territory. Finally, I declared war, and things started to look bad. I didn't include my most powerful ally and my other allies were slow to enter combat. I was having serious issues fighting off my enemies. And then, British troops, and other scrubs from some allies of the fools in my disputed territory I was in the war against started to come in. Things appeared better, we had just won a battle. But then, a rebellion occured in my country, and the last of my soldiers were defeated. My friends had already gotten peaces treaties and about 1/3 of my country was occupied by my enemies. It was over. I couldn't even make peace with some of my enemies. Just then, my friends told me we were going to start over. I clicked quit, and eu4.exe crashed. It was a fun time though.Overall pretty fun and not too pricey when on sale. Can't wait till I actually learn the game.			"

												In my experience, if you really try to learn this you will, since the game has such a good GUI and tells you everything you need to know. There are alerts for things you should notice/take care of, and you can always pause the game. Only battles and war can be somewhat  hard to learn since there are so many factors affecting them. The game is good. DLC is quite expensive altogether but all of it is either cosmetic or  extra mechanics. I recommend this game, it is one of my favorite strategy games and I have personally never had bugs, glitches or crashes with it.			"

												As a white, christian male from the United States living in Europe, I feel that it is my duty to endorse this fantastic genocide simulator. I've searched long and hard for a way to relive the glory days when those annoying natives HAD to speak English to you, like any civilized person, and in this game I have found it. Do you want to know the thrill of fighting a real drug war against those pesky dissidents? Harsh treatment on an opium producing province has never been more satisfying. Looking for a way to spread the one true faith to all? Just kill any who disagree; its not like they have souls or anything. There is no other way to fulfill your fantasies of European world domination once and for all, or at least no legal one.Of course, there are flaws. For example, them thar' muslims and chinese can eventually westernize, which means that they can actually get on an equal footing at a certain point. Since we can't let them get all uppity, its highly advisable to ""intervene"" in their region quite quickly. On a similar note, the Indian tribes (I mean the ones with the casinos) are actually represented with full blown nations! Imagine my outrage, when playing as that most surpreme of empires, the United States of America, I actually had to declare war on the Sioux to expand westward. Can you imagine? When General Custer gets there, I expect to teach the savages a lesson they never forget.Finally, you can all rest assured as to the developers of the game. Their offices are based in Sweden, so there is no doubt in my mind that they are all blue eyed, blond germanic men of pure blood. That, more than anything else, makes this perfection incarnate. ************THERE IS A LOT OF SARCASM IN THIS REVIEW********FEW, IF ANY OF THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED ARE HELD BY THE AUTHOR OF THIS REVIEW, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE QUALITY OF THE GAME********************** "

												While I enjoy EU4, it can be extremely frustrating.  Combat  is always a crapshoot unless you outnumber the enemy ten to one.  Even then there is a chance the enemy will just hold you in place while more enemy troops march across the continent in two weeks to join the fight.  Sometimes the AI will focus on you while their neighbor becomes immensly powerful.  Its always a crapshoot if France will become too powerful and ruin a game.  Coalitions are supposed to address this, but France can laugh off most of these.  If by chance you manage find enough allies to fight France, then they always have 6 stat generals.  That combined with the constant zeros being rolled by your armies turns any advantage you had into mush.			"

												So I have always considered myself a strategy game junkie, and having played most of the total war series I considered myself to be quite the strategist. Then I found this game, and my mind was blown.  The depth of this game is incredible.  The learning curve is a bit harsh, but the reward is well worth it.  There is so much you can do too.  You can become the Holy Roman Emperor and become a super power, you can dominate europe with the French army, or you can be Portugal and colonize the new world.  There are so many different ways to play and I can't see anyone getting bored with this game.  The replay value is incredible.  I love this game, and if you are a fan of grand strategy then you will too.			"

												A grand conquest like no other. In my opinion, the best of the Paradox interactive series, as it is set in the perfect timeframe, allowing any nation you choose to leave its mark permanently on the world. The interface can be somewhat daunting at the start, and it is very much a numbers game, but it manages this role so perfectly it can lead to hours of entertainment. Nothing is quite as satisfying as going into multiplayer with some friends and fundamentally altering the course of history. In my opinion, the pinnacle of grand strategy.			"

You can choose endless of paths to glory for your country; through trade, war, technology or colonization.

												Europa Universalis IV is an excellent historical grand strategy game set during the Age of Discovery and Colonial Era.  One of my all time favorite games, EU4 should appeal to history buffs and fans of other grand strategy titles like Civilization and Total War.Pros:Immense Replayability:  Every one of the hundreds of nations present on the game map is playable with unque and historically accurate starting conditions and goals.Significant Attention to Detail and Historical Accuracy:  Most of the nations in the game have unique events and decisions taken from that nation's history.  Countries that were great powers during the time period (Ottoman Empire, England, France, Austria, Spain, etc) often have entire chains of special events that add flavor and unique gameplay.Engaging Diplomacy:  The diplomacy mechanics of the game are quite strong and create a fun challenge even against the AI.  With helpful allies, generally competent enemies and a coalition mechanic to balance aggressively expanding powers, the diplomatic game is an essential component of any strategy.  Developer Support:  Paradox is known for providing content updates to their titles for several years following release.  In addition to the purchasable DLC there have been numerous free updates providing balancing changes, new historical flavor events and reworked mechanics.Cons:Steep Learning Curve:  The in game tutorials only cover the basics of gameplay and many of the deeper mechanics are never expained in detail.  I would highly recommend that new players watch some Youtube videos to better understand trade, colonization and aggressive expansion.Updates Occasionally Break Saves:  While not a frequently encountered problem, the large free updates that Paradox releases along with purchasable expansions can make older saved games unplayable.  This can be frustrating if one has invested many hours in a particular game. "

												Want to be Spain and colonize Canada?Want to be Ireland and take over England?Europa Universalis IV takes the best of other grand strategy games and incorporates it. Imagine the diplomacy and interface of Crusader Kings 2, the building and expansion of Civilization V, the war and fighting of Victoria II, and the production and micro managing of Hearts of Iron III all in one huge world domination game.In this game you can be anyone, anywhere, at anytime. This huge grand strategy game will consume you as the hours slip away. Europa Universalis IV is a huge improvment on the third one by making it easier to play and understand the mechanincs. The mechanincs of this game are coated in many layers of programing, when you figure out how to do one thing, there is something else behind it. After hours of playing this game new things popup everytime, you learn how the game judges manpower and how ideas change the game only after you play for centuries. 2 games of Europa Universalis IV can never be the same even if you play the same country dozens of times, the Clausewitz engine finds new problems to throw at you through every playthrough, Paradox outdid themselves constantly updating and implroving this game as more and more players give ideas for new mechanics and playstyles. Anything can happen and you can do everything in Europa Universalis IV.			"

												10/10 Another triumph for paradox! I've had this game for close to 3 years now and it just keeps getting better. This like other paradox grand strategy games is as complex as it is rewarding. My first stubling steps into running my own early modern state, were hard and I was regularly destroyed by the ai even on easy difficulty. But through time I learnt how to run the economy, how to pick my fights intelligently and to control my expansion to small, managable chunks. This game requires a bit of practise but is amazingly brilliant to play. The singleplayer is as far as I can see completely bug free. Though, like all paradox games, there are some bugs when it comes to multiplayer. These are not terrible and are easily resolved with a quick rehost. The mulitplayer community is brilliant. There are hundreds of people, some casual and some serious, for whatever game your feeling. Marathon games lasting weeks are a particular fun exploit. Paradox are one of the few companies that do not milk their fans for dlc. Regular free patches improve the game, and DLC is what DLC should be: Expansions that change the game significantly. They are not overpriced either, cosmetic DLC costing around £1 and Expansions around £15 on release. For any lover of strategy games, history or even fantasy (through the excillent modding community, or custom nations dlc) this game is a must have!!! 10/10			"

												Great! Knowing the former titles I-III, but # IV comes with much better playability. Easy to start, hard to master, but all time fun changing or replaying the history.'''Little update after checking some gameplay videos. Seems I didn't catch how trade nodes work in first place. Now I'm a bit wiser and managed to have a positive bank account...well, most times. Still investing into depth features, like tech and upgrades to maximize benefits. You could surely find many ways to your personal goal...which is the main task for you to name it. There are pretty much 'walk-throughs' and suggestions out there. But that's not the thing. Choose your country wisely, then have a seat, lean back and think where you want to be in the other century. Then you hit the start button and try to get there. The more you play, the more different, challenging and wonderfull ideas will meet your eyes. It's kind of growing and sculpting an entire nation over the times....Still not tested multiplayer, but am curious about...			"

												First got this game back in 2013, never read the manual (no surprise there) nor did I have any background knowledge of the game. After being frustrated by the steep learning curve, I gave up on the game and didn't revisit it until a good two years later. The second time around I did my homework prior and boy did the game really open up. Ask me two years ago if I would put 500 hours into this game it would be a hard no. Ask me today and I'll tell you how surprised I am I haven't reached the 1000 hour mark yet. The beauty of the game lies in its complexity and choice. Once you master the basic mechanics its really up to you how you want your run from 1444-1821 to pan out. You can go with the historical route and try to recreate history, or do something radically different and watch the world adapt and become something that could've been. You can focus on expanding militarily, diplomatically, or not at all. You can build empires from conquest, colonialization or trade. Every aspect of the game is well fleshed out and continues to be refined, with each patch more exciting than the last.Not gonna lie, Eu4 will take a long time to master (if indeed that is possible) but in all honesty the game is so diverse in its offerings that you will feel a sense of accomplishment every step of the way, regardless of how many hours you put into it. But I can promise you if you can put in the first 5 hours, the next 500 will come soon enough.			"

												It's a really fun game with 258 countries to play as and you can have up to 258 players so if you have 258 friends this game is for you. This game take a while to really get in to the heat of it so I'd start the game at like 2:30 - 3:00 if you want to finish it. The game goes from 1444 - 1821 the game has many features such as keeping your countrys stability up or an uprising could start, there are pirates the will block your port and stop trade so keep and eye out for that and rebels may uprise if you choose something they don't agree with during an event. There are also DLC (Downloadable Content) that add more feature to the game ;for instance, the Eldorado DLC allows you to create your own country, pick it's ideas, name the ruler and heir, Etc., Anyway this game can provide you with hour upon hours of fun. So stay strong and conquer the world.			"

												A great game overall with the depth of simulation you would expect from a prominent example of the grand strategy genre.     This game like the others from paradox have the ability to keep you returning for ""just ten more minutes"" that then turns into ten hours, I have approximetly 75 hours into the game and there is still so much to learn and this is what gives the game its endless replayability. However I would not reccomend this to the average strategy gamer as the depth of this game, at times, can be a little overwhelming but overall  I cannot reccomend this game enough.10/10 The best money I have spent on a strategy game since I bought Medieval:Total War Gold Edition.10/10 Endlessly Replayable.

												The lack of a connection to reality in games like Empire: Total War or Sid Meier's Civilization somehow led me here. That was about a year ago, and now, if I start up those games, they feel just... very boring. No reality, no in-depth diplomacy, it just doesn't feel like fun anymore.Well, there are times when this game drives me crazy, because RNGesus can be a... difficult companion to say the least. There is a lot about this game that is just based on pure luck, but that is actually the only real bad thing about this game. It delivers what it promises: A ""grand strategy video game"", and that just scratches the amount of things you can do in this game, it's one that will practically never end, unless you want it to. And even after 400 hours, which is nothing compared to other players, I don't want it to end.If you are looking for an easy description of the gameplay of this game, then this is not a game you want to play. The learning curve is very steep, and even highly advanced players sometimes struggle with the things that come up. To compile this game into a small collection of words: Diplomacy, War, Peace, Stability, Instability, Expansion, Decay, Life and Death. You are playing as a country you choose, and try to expand as fast as possible. But careful, this isn't your average Total War game, you cannot expand left and right, because if you do that, you will get in major trouble. And there are a lot of different factors to calculate into the survival of your country.If you ever wanted to see Europe ruled by the Albanians, or wanted to create colonial nations as Austria, or maybe you want to do the (nearly) impossible and conquer the world? Maybe you even just want to look at the AI fighting over Europa while you just watch? Sounds a bit sick, but in EU4, you can do that.Another major plus point is the constant stream of updates released by the creators of the game, sometimes changing the game completely, or just adding new features. Some of those are in DLCs only, but many are completely free, including the bug fixes, a bit incredible since we live in the times of EA and Ubisoft. The pricing of the DLCs are, compared to other games, a bit higher, but the content you will get with them is very detailed, and totally awesome. More so, if you are hosting a multiplayer game with the DLCs active, but your friends don't have them, they will still get access to all the features of the DLCs, which is another amazing thing.Additionally, the modding community offers a multiplicity of different mods, both to enhance the vanilla gameplay, and also to change the gameplay, some of them even completely. If you are, for some reason, running out of reasons to play EU4, the modding community will help you.400 hours into the game, and I still expect more to come, especially with the coming update changing many game mechanics completely. If you are interested in history, or in military strategy, or diplomacy between 1444 and 1821, you have come the right place.			"

Since playing both CK2 and EU4 I now have a lot more knowledge about history and how the world existed from years 800 and beyond.I cant wait to see what Paradox bring to the gaming world next. I just throw my money at them.			"

												Europa Universalis 4 is a very complex game with an unbelievably steep learning curve, initially this game sat in my library gathering metaphorical dust, with a single brief play session that left me bemused. However after watching several videos about the game I summoned the courage to try again. Boy am I glad I tried again as I quickly became familiar with all the game mechanics and started to enjoy this truly phenomenal and unique gaming experience, the attention to detail is nothing short of breathtaking with detailed history at every historical bookmark. With the new expansion ‘the art of war’ on the horizon now would be a perfect time to delve into this masterpiece. To conclude Europa Universalis 4 is one of the best games I have played this year and with a thriving modding community to keep the game exciting. I would advise anyone who plays this game to watch videos on YouTube as the tutorials leave a lot to be desired otherwise this game is an utter waste of time. Overall however, this game is easily worthy of a purchase.			"

It will crash, your files will corrupt, but you will love every second of it, until you hit regency of course.			"

												My only previous experience with Paradox's grand strategy games was Victoria 2 and I loved that game. So seeing the reviews for this game I thought I'd pick it up.This game is a whole other beast than Victoria 2. This game has complex poitical and diplomacy systems that would make Civ 5 and Total War fans turn green with envy. And don't get me wrong, I love the Total War games and Civ 5.If I was completely honest I do prefer Victoria 2 because I love the era of history more. But in terms of the mechanics as with only a little bit of game play and hours of watching instructional videos so I would know what I was doing, EU4 is a more impressive game than Victoria 2.There are some things like imposed force limits (which you can ignore because Paradox strategy games are awesome that way) that I don't really like, but I understand that it's meant to balance the game, add challenge, and reflect the time period since giant armies of hundreds of thousands was more of a 19th and 20th century thing.I don't know how much religion played a role in previous EU games since I didn't play them, but coming off Victoria it was a steep learning curve having to learn to deal with political entities like the Papal State and the Holy Roman Empire. The more I play the more I want to master this game and like many strategy/management games (like Railroad Tycoon II) I love this game, but it doesn't love me back. And I really am enjoying seeing what mechanic the game will throw at me next as I really start to feel like I have to do more than keep my economy from going bankrupt and invade my neighbors.I recommend this game whole-heartedly and now look forward to what I hope will be the announcement of Victoria III, which I hope uses a lot of the ideas and mechanics employed here so I can die happy.

												EU4 is a fantastic game with great potential and an excellent addition to the strategic gaming community. EU4 is more of a micromanaging game then a game where you just ""paint the map"" with your countries name, which is what makes it very challenging, and fun. With a great community, new and veteran Paradox players will feel very welcomed if they attempt to play EU4. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy, history, and micromanaging.

												After many, many hours of playing this, I thought I should give a review of the best game I've ever played. Don't mind the playtime, it's actually 3 times more, just played offline a lot.So, for starters: if you have a hard time getting into a game, don't buy this. You need at least 30 hours of playtime to not die in the first 50 years, no matter if it's rebels, alliances you didn't know about or simply a coalition against you. You fail in every way possible. It's just something you have to get through. I personally played tons of Castile games over like 2 months, because I got bored after a while. I still came back every time, because I could see what this game had to offer when you put time in it.The next country I played was Ottomans, because in one of my first games, when I finally got past the year 1500, I declared war on Ottomans because there was a crusade against them, but that made me realise how strong they are because it didn't take them long to destroy me. Especially when they are allied with Commonwealth (unbelievable but true). Ottomans is one of the easiest, maybe the easiest, country in the game, but still I needed many games before I understood how the gameplay worked.Furthermore I've played Holland, England, France, Portugal, Poland, Japan, Hamburg (realised it was a republic, so I couldn't become HRE emperor, which means that game was useless af) and Austria (why is Spain getting the Netherlands when I'm playing Austria, and Austria getting the Netherlands when I'm playing Spain?). All of these countries had a different gameplay. It was so different, that most of the time you play a country, you notice the standard events that happen and the gameplay and you think of a good way to reach your goals, then you start over, but this time for real.And this was all in normal mode, kind of the 'easy' mode. When I played this game for like 250-300 hours, I had played all these countries. Some were a succes, some weren't. At this point I could at least say that I'm decent at the game. I knew the basics, I knew how the HRE system works, trading, colonizing, but still there were many things to learn. Right now I'm in an Ironmode game, which is the other gamemode this game offers. In this gamemode, you can't go back to your last save, instead you have to go on, no matter if you're losing or not. This is where you get the achievements. This is my first Ironmode game, playing as Austria.I guess that instead of telling you what I all played, I should tell you if you should buy this game or not. Well, all of the above was done in 300+ hours of gaming. In addition, there is probably 500+ more hours of gameplay with other interesting countries, times 2 because you want to play countries more than once (trust me, once you're addicted, you do). That means there is at least 1600+ hours of gameplay in this game without getting bored one second, for only €44,99 (yes, you should buy the extreme edition. Not many dlc's are needed, though these are a few dlc's that come in really handy). So, you there: if you like history, strategy games, endless possibilities, real time singleplayer and multiplayer and murdering your unwanted heirs by putting them in the front line of your armies, I say WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!? GO BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!			"

												If you're looking for long-term, deeply complex strategy, it's hard to go wrong with this game. While it's definitely lacking in transperancy and could benefit from some UI refinements, there's a lot to have fun with here. Once you figure out the game's general flow and how its parts work together (which will take some time), you can start experiementing with different play styles, starting scenarios, and end goals. The open-ended nature of the game really lets you explore how you want to play and what you  want to accomplish. It's a fascinating kind of game, and, to my knowledge, there aren'y many others like it.			"

												An incredibly deep strategy game, with strong roots in history. This game lets you play out your global domination fantasies, starting in Renaissance Europe, in a fully simulated geo-political sandbox. The AI acts very rationally, in terms of their diplomacy and tactical decisions. When I lose, I curse Austria for outmaneuvering me instead of the developers, and that's a very good sign.One warning though, the learning curve is incredibly steep. I'd recommend this most to people who feel that games like Civ V have very simple mechanics - otherwise you may have some trouble picking this up.			"

												It's a really fun game with 258 countries to play as and you can have up to 258 players so if you have 258 friends this game is for you. This game take a while to really get in to the heat of it so I'd start the game at like 2:30 - 3:00 if you want to finish it. The game goes from 1444 - 1821 the game has many features such as keeping your countrys stability up or an uprising could start, there are pirates the will block your port and stop trade so keep and eye out for that and rebels may uprise if you choose something they don't agree with during an event. There are also DLC (Downloadable Content) that add more feature to the game ;for instance, the Eldorado DLC allows you to create your own country, pick it's ideas, name the ruler and heir, Etc., Anyway this game can provide you with hour upon hours of fun. So stay strong and conquer the world.			"

												Absolutely awesome in co-op / multiplayer, still awesome in single player. One of the best grand strategy games around - and plays much more fluid than Crusader Kings 2. Love the pace, love the mechanics. And with the modding system, anything that doesn't completely tickle your fancy? Mod it!			"

												This Game is extremely addictive and if you are someone looking for long games such as civilization, but want something 10 times more advanced in complexity then this is the best game to get. The alternate history for this is Amazing, and the modding community adds all new levels of fun for this game that are out of the minds comprehension. Like owning asia as scandanavia, or settling the new world as the ottomans, even forming italy and taking over the world.All in AllI rate it a 10/10 would IGN again.:P  "

												Paradox has been making solid Grand Strategy games for a long time now, but I feel that they really have struck gold with EU IV! As always you have the opportunity to control any country between 1400 to 1800, and change the fate of the world, which I find much more satisfying than similar games where nationality only grants bonuses on an otherwise randomized map. Here you start with the historical political and economic situation instead of a blank slate. A neat feature of EU games is that you can pick any country in the world when you load a saved game as well (many don't know this). So you can win as England against France and then save/load to continue playing as France!Two points make EU IV unique, first all countries have their own agenda with matching quests, each time you complete a quest you get to pick a new out of three availible, and national bonuses which unlock over time, e.g. Portugal gets better at colonization while Spain also has a tendency to convert others to Catholicism! My final point can not be overstated, in previous versions of Paradox Grand Strategy games one often had a multitude of currencies, one for each type of action (get 1 colonist/year to colonize, get 3 magistrates/year to build in provinces etc). In EU IV there are only 3 different currencies: War / Internal Politics / Diplomacy, which are used for buying technologies, hiring leaders, developing provinces, changing cores, colonizing etc. This allows for a whole new level of flexibility since you can put e.g. all your diplomatic points into one field. As Portugal you can chose to ignore Europe and really focus on getting that colonial empire going early, something you could not do in EU III!If you have the patience to learn and play these kind of games I highly recommend EU IV. And the coming expansion with randomized ""New World"" will likely make it even better.			"

												My only previous experience with Paradox's grand strategy games was Victoria 2 and I loved that game. So seeing the reviews for this game I thought I'd pick it up.This game is a whole other beast than Victoria 2. This game has complex poitical and diplomacy systems that would make Civ 5 and Total War fans turn green with envy. And don't get me wrong, I love the Total War games and Civ 5.If I was completely honest I do prefer Victoria 2 because I love the era of history more. But in terms of the mechanics as with only a little bit of game play and hours of watching instructional videos so I would know what I was doing, EU4 is a more impressive game than Victoria 2.There are some things like imposed force limits (which you can ignore because Paradox strategy games are awesome that way) that I don't really like, but I understand that it's meant to balance the game, add challenge, and reflect the time period since giant armies of hundreds of thousands was more of a 19th and 20th century thing.I don't know how much religion played a role in previous EU games since I didn't play them, but coming off Victoria it was a steep learning curve having to learn to deal with political entities like the Papal State and the Holy Roman Empire. The more I play the more I want to master this game and like many strategy/management games (like Railroad Tycoon II) I love this game, but it doesn't love me back. And I really am enjoying seeing what mechanic the game will throw at me next as I really start to feel like I have to do more than keep my economy from going bankrupt and invade my neighbors.I recommend this game whole-heartedly and now look forward to what I hope will be the announcement of Victoria III, which I hope uses a lot of the ideas and mechanics employed here so I can die happy.

												A brilliant and fascinating game! It will take some time to get used to everything. Hell, I don't even know everything yet, but once you do get the basics you can jump right in. I love how this game gives you the possibility to play however you desire.For new players: don't let this game scare you once you first play it. Play through the tutorial to grasp the basics. Once you do, just start playing and enjoy your exploring through the game mechanics. If youy don't understand some aspects yet search on the awesome wiki that contains thousands of articles which really help, or if you prefer watch some YouTube vids where they explain it. I recommend playing a normal game first instead of ironman mode, just so you can reload and save at will so you can learn what your mistakes were. After that however, activate ironman mode immediately! Run the game like it's supposed to. Ironman mode is really a thrill and it makes you think about your choices more, becaus after all the choices will be permanent.This game has everything I wish for in a grand strategy game (if you can even call it that, I think it even surpasses that genre)!9/10			"

												Incredible game for fans of strategy, history, or empire building. It's a complex game, but the tutorial is good and blundering around aimlessley teaches you very quickly. If you've played crusader kings (or any previous installment of the series) then this game is easy to pick up. id give this game a 9.5/10, only neglecting the 10/10 because i have this pipe dream that the timeline would progress into the 20th century with ww1 era technology.

												Generally quite an excellent game. I really enjoyed most of my playthrough. However, the game is really eurocentric and that can be quite annoying when playing as a non european nation. Plenty of non european nations had technology that rivalled the europeans in real life, and the europeans won simply due to logistics. This is my only complaint about the game, and I believe that this is easily fixed using mods			"

												Great game. Pick a nation, paint the map your colour and create your own version of history. Probably the easiest Grand Strategy Game to get into. You don't really need any DLC from the start, it's good enough without them. If there's a deep sale, or maybe a bundle, then their importance goes something like this:Common Sense- allows you to develop provinces so you have something to do when not conqueringArt of War- a lot of quality of life improvements for all warmongersCossacks- estates, new diplomacy systemRights of ManWealth of Nations- trade, trade, tradeRes Publica- if you enjoy playing as a republic (or the Dutch)El Dorado- for meso and south american natives gameplay and Nation DesignerConquest of Paradise- north american natives and Random New World Generation which is still mehMare Nostrum- I don't even know what it addsOther than that you might consider Purple Phoenix (it's part of the pre-order bonus package), Star and Crescent (part of DIgital EXTREME Edition) and American Dream. They add some cool events and missions/decisions for Byzantium, Muslim Nations and USA respectivly.Rest of the DLCs add skins, music, some monuments on the map and one portrait pack so your muslim advisors aren't white anymore :).

												One nation offers you several types of gameplay. There are so many nations that are fun to play that one would never grow bored of this game. Singelplayer is all well and good, but the true fun is the multiplayer. You start off historically correct, then you shape the world in your imagine. England conquering Europe instead of colonizing, Castille/Spain taking provinces in Scandinavia, Native Americans repelling the colonization, An early Germany, A Polish Emperor, The ressurection of the Roman Empire. All of this can happen in one game. You would not regret buying this. The learning curve is quite steep, if you have not played EU III or CK2. But once you get it all down, it is simply amazing.			"

The possibilities are literally endless with playability of any nation between the mid 1400's and the mid 1800's at any point of time between there all while the AI and the world around you follows strictly to history.
