												As you can see I have barely any hours on this title, but I can assure that I have played EVO RTS for many years since it was in its early stages. I can understand how the lot of you have never heard about this game, and how the game and the engine behind it, is the most robust and next gen in terms of gameplay and mechanics. and can do almost anything. The maps are completly deformable and the tactics that can be used are limitless. Not to mention the dynamic soundtrack. and the amazing unit models that make other big time devs look like amatures. and the effects and how intense the battles can get, are staggering. Now all we need on Steam that also uses the Spring Engine is NOTA and Zero-K ad I'll never need to by another RTS again. Thats my two cents, and congrats Forboding_Angel on making it to Steam and showing steam users that games can kick some major♥♥♥♥♥ and still be completly free, Thats the power of open source.

												First off a few misconceptions, You are not actually downloading the Evolution RTS right away, you are simply downloading the Weblobby, which is a very simple barebones lobby, from there it is automatically filtered to Evolution Games. The easiest way to acquire the content is to join a multiplayer game, the rest should be automatic, you will download the map, the mod, and the engine.There are many things about the engine and the game that you could like and certainly join, esp. if you love all sorts of RTS. The biggest issue is the weblobby, hopefully they will make it user-friendly over time now that it is getting rapid feedback. If you can get past over the Weblobby into the game, your going to have a good time. But if you can't its not your fault either. Anyway have fun gaming!And Remember if you can get past the lobby, you can have a good time, always ask for help in main lobby chats and there is a good chance somone could help you.			"

												My review is just a word of caution in case you are interested in single player only. In single player you are given a short grace period to build before the AI starts spawning units all over the map. Even the very easiest AI defeated me 100% of the time within the first 20 or so minutes. If you enjoy the RTS genre do check this game out but don't expect to play around in singleplayer. Perhaps grab a friend for multiplayer if you want to learn at your own pace.This game has a lot of potential if you find you enjoy it. You can check out some of the VODs on YouTube to get a feel on how to play it. Also the developers are active in the community which is awesome.http://www.youtube.com/evolutionrtsgame "

												UPDATE 4/20/14In light of the recent update, it's necessary I update my review with it, to maintain accuracy. The original contents are below.The layout of the game lobby has improved dramatically. I was actually able to start a game through Single Player mode, fairly independent of the multiplayer lobby. That doesn't mean I actually had any idea how to play the game at that point, but it was a start.	I received comments that the issues in my previous review were resolved; they weren't. Not the main ones. I need to say, the lobby still doesn't seem user-friendly enough for newbies to join right in. The major unaddressed problem was the absence of documentation or instructions for the lobby, and now that I can start a game, a lack of game rules or a tutorial came into play too. If there are rules available somewhere, they aren't visible enough for me to find them. (If there are instructions on the Spring site, link 'em to me please.)	With the new update, the game has really upped its... game (snort). It’s much improved, but only relative to its ease to start with. There are legit unresolved problems that even the new update didn’t address, and are probably keeping the more inexperienced off of their doorstep. It's difficult because I really want to give this game a shot- but I've spent over two hours messing around with the game and lobby settings, and haven't even been able to blow anything up. I really need some direction for me to recommend this game, but for now it's too undeveloped for me to stick a “yes” on it.UPDATE 5/4/14I'm holding true to my promise that I would update this further.So, this review has been getting reviewed pretty good. It attracted enough attention that even the developer came to my page! (This was my initial impression, before realizing that every negative review on the game was downvoted by this individual.)To start, the first thing even close to help I received was the developer finding my review and labeling me as “not using my noggin” when dealing with in-game commands. I'm not holding grudges, our issues are resolved. However, nothing is laid out, and the service I've received by a helpful community member (and only a community member, that is, someone not responsible to the game itself) has been the only clarification. The lobby is scary, in-game less so, and it's all expected to be figured out by the player, as made evident by the developer. Apparently it was not just me who wasn't able to build something so simple as generators, which was seen as obvious and common sense during development and doesn't require explanation (however, the developer did design a very helpful piece of video tutorial, just for me, that can be found in the comments or here: http://www.twitch.tv/evolutionrts/b/524601270 – I feel loved).So the service is garbage, if I can sum it up.Shout-out to Paladin, for the help I did get. :)--ORIGINAL TEXT-- 4/8/14Note: This is not a review of the gameplay itself, and you'll find out why in a second.The download for the game is simply a download for a game lobby.OH GOD WHY.I hung around for around 25 minutes trying to figure out how to just start a game. The Terms of Service for the Spring Engine lobby were easy to read, props for that. Other than that, there was no documentation/instructions for  getting you familiar/set up/started, and the layout of the lobby featured tabs and whatnot that remained completely unexplained because of it. Apparently I needed to downoad game files from an obscure site location to start a game. I found this out after I made a feeble attempt at starting a match. DENIED. What's even worse is that, for some reason, you have to join a multiplayer game to get the downlaods available to you. If this all sounds vague, it's because it was. I chatted with another equally confused player (probably from Steam as well) who was just about to head out when I beat him to the door.Granted, I would need longer to experiment with the lobby and learn how to start a game, but that was time I didn't have (a LOT of time I don't have). I instead spent my time writing a review. So there.Overall, gameplay not included, this is not designed for casual gamers who do not posess preobtained knowledge of how game lobbies work. This game won't be worth it to me until the setup is unobscured and clarified.			"

												Evolution RTS is really complicated. Especially if you are playing this by yourself. It has no tutorial what so ever and just trying to launch your own game is just as difficult. If you ever want to try this game out, I would most recommend playing / starting out with a person who's played Evolution before. There can be more than two people in each game.                                   When you do play the game, it's really fun. You build structures that give you more energy and metal, which are used in making your troops and other buildings, Kinda like starcraft and other RTS games. I reallyl ike this game because near the end, you get to build nukes and there are forcefields (called protectors) that stop them and you could build as much of these if there is space to place them. There are several maps that are different from one another and most rounds take about half an hour (unless you realy want to finish the round, you could beat it in maybe 10 mins if you are good)All in all, it's good if you know how to play it. Most of the time, almost everyone I know that I reccomended this game to has quit the game in minutes before anything really happened or actually played the game (like only 3 people out of the many that i recommended to has played properly) I reallyl ike the game. It's one of my favourites and is one of the games on the top of my list to play when someone wants to play with me.			"

												A great game if you want to race... HARD. I say ""Race"" because if you do not put the bots down within 20 minutes they get this... THING... that one-shots basically your whole base. Even the ""Very easy"" bots. It is a neat game though. The only problem I really have with it is its lack of naval warfare and the overall complication of the game at its core. The complication, however, is easily overcome by doing some research into the mechanics after every win/loss to see exactly why you won/lost, provided that you didn't just do something dumb like build hovercrafts on top of a mountain that they can't get down like I've done ^^; With the right knowledge though, it is amazingly rewarding.

												Well worth the $0, at first i was skeptical about the price, but i was reassured because it matches my credit card balance and i like to keep things equal,  i find it likely that about 80% of the negative reviews didnt actually put real effort into learning the mechanics of the game(played for .5 hrs), or even set up the game :) not to fear, its good :) im still terrible at it, but enjoy it thoughly, i reccomend it to anyone willing to take the time to learn, not exactly casual... but not like anyones gonna care if you dont know what your doing, especially early on, it helped that some awesome guy, who was the only other person in a chat room was willing and friendly enough to help me figure out the basic mechanics, by starting a game and saying, learn or die.... that was a false statement, in the act of dying i was also able to learn! :) over and overuntil he left me with a CAI bot to play against, which works 70% of the time, so its awesome8/8 m8, jk thou      like 8/10 itll be more fun when im better, atm i enjoy it alot anyways			"

												This is a really fun and underplayed RTS game. Fast paced and action packed unlike many other games of this genre like which focus on base building and economy. Evolution RTS has a bunch of quality maps that are official and hundreds more spring engine maps that are compatible with the game. It is a bit confusing at first while you figure out how it works, but the outcome is very satisfying. The large number of possibilities in-game feels like all-in-one RTS which gives you control over everything in the game and it makes crazy number of strategies possible.Evolution RTS is rough around the edges and far from perfect, but I'm sure a true RTS fan will enjoy this game.

												Is this game good? Yes.Is it difficult to actually figure out how to get the game running? As of when I write this (9/4/2014), yes.Don't expect to download the game off steam and have it working immediately. You'll most likely encounter issues figuring out exactly how to get it running. There is information available on how to fix most issues, but you may need to do some reading. The server is also over-run with noobs atm which makes it difficult to get a lobby into the end-zone and actually start a game. Since yesterday when I started playing, there have been substantial quality of life improvements in this regard, but it's still rough around the edges. The pre-release community have all been very nice and patient, and the devs are obviously working very hard to remedy known issues. Conclusion:You may be too impatient to get this game working. I think it's well worth it, but if you are not the patient type, it may be worth coming back later when the devs have had time to respond to community feedback. In the meantime, Ima do a training montage and shatter your scrubby nerd ego across my doombringing knee come the time when you finally  man up and get around to playing this awesome game.  "

												Most of the people whom write reviews for this game dont recommend it, and here's their reasons.1) They rage quit against a bot, or a player.2) They say its gonna be a bad game based on the tittle screen. 3) They're not good and refuse to get help, so after a while they quit cause of consistent losses.On another note, This game is awesome. The Balanced annihlation mode, as well as the default Evolution RTS mode, have smoth gameplay and great music. The developers are active all the time constantly fixing bugs, and teaching willing players. The developers are also quite interactive with the community. The community is pretty small but nice, welcoming, and willing to help or play.			"

												Its the dirty brother of supcom FA. The game itself is damn good. Although more depth and polish is needed.However it is let down by the UI.Very much still a work in progress.Personaly I think releasing it in its current state was a bad idea.simply because Its going to push people away.As good as the game is once you know whats happening it does not make for a pretty first impression when you have to go through the spring lobby.Hoards of people were comeing and going simply because they could not understand what was going on.or get into a game. Couple this confusion with a buggy lobby, failing downloads, many others newbies asking questions and a lack of direction and what you have got is chaos. "

												In simple terms, if you have played supreme commander and liked it, you will absolutely like this as well.However, if you did not enjoy playing supreme commander or despise micromanagement RTS games, this isn't for you.For those who are interested, some free tips upon joining the game...First, what you are downloading from steam is just a server platform. Not the game itself.Secondly, once you join a server room (in the multiplayer tab, duh!), you are automatically allocated as a spectator. You will not be allowed to pick a team and play until you have downloaded the game contents and its map for the particular match (all of which will be done for you automatically so do not worry, just wait a bit once you've joined).Thirdly, after you have completed the download process, join a team or create a team.Lastly, click start and enjoy. It will play the same way as supreme commander so it will come to you naturally. Only difference is that the buildings and units names are different.My final advice for newcomers - Join as a spectator and take a look at how others play. You have free movement as a spectator.			"

												Free and open source. Evolution RTS does everything right. It runs very smoothly, has very nice music that as far as I can tell from other reviews is somehow being dynamically generated. The units look a little bit samey from a distance, just different looking SCV-ish looking robots. Upon zooming in however you do realize that they are indeed varied and have varied robotic exoskeletons. The graphics are effective although it could still compel more more immersion by adding more scenery elements and whatnot. There really is no reason for you not to have this into your library. It is a fine addition... except for one thing...It somehow manages to feel extremely generic still, I do not know who I am controlling, why I am fighting, I do not know what the unit does, how the tech tree is meant to work, and a lot of numbers are on screen I am not sure which are metal and which are energy, or why I am making those thingies in the ground. It was more or less painless for me to use the lobby to make a single player game but after scouting around with a random robot army sustained by my low supply count and not finding the AI... I simply was too disengaged to really invest more time in it. This game would strongly benefit from single player scenarios that give context, introduce the player the game's concepts, and give some reason to idenfify, care, and have fun. A lot of the fun from strategy games is the sense of control you end up having from implementing strategies and seeing their outcome and I am sure that with a basic storyline, with gradual introduction of units it would be a lot more immersive. And maybe make the rest of the lobby and the multiplayer components separate from it. A simple artwork menu with Tutorial, Single player, Multiplayer buttons goes a long way.In any case I do think this is at least a 6 out of 10. It looks average, but it could become much much much more. And since it is free and open source it should be treated as greater than average. I'll come back to the game in the future and see how it came along. In the meantime I will catch up on playing some of those other RTS's I own that have all I mentionned and that I never got to play or finish.			"

												The game is very much like Supreme Commander however with much more simplified graphics and sound. It has potential but the game is let down with punnishing set ups and terrible lobby systems. Be prepared to manually download game modes and specific versions of each of them and manually placing them in the game. This is very off putting and this put me and my friends off playing it. The game also suffers from the lack of explaining on how to use the lobby system and even how to play the game, it shoves you in expecting you to know everything about it.Pros:Decent gameplayIn depthHas potentialWorks well on low end systemsCons:Painfull to set upLobbies are designed poorlyTime consuming to playNothing is explained on how to play or use the lobby systemThis game is recommended to those who like RTS games and have a lot of patience, especially if you like Supreme Commander.

Evolution RTS online is dead, but if you install Spring Lobby (google it) you will see many people  still play other Spring RTS mods (better mods) such as Balanced Annihilation, and Tech Annihilation.  These mods have full servers playing them in the daytime of every day of the week and all day/night on weekends. Population is mostly Euro players so servers are usually dead on weeknights  if you're in NA. Again Spring RTS ONLINE is alive and well, just install  Spring Lobby and join a server with people in it (will prob be a balanced annihilation server)			"

												In theory, the String Engine is a pretty decent engine, and given its modding capacity what with it being open source, it's not bad.  It's also clear that they are inspired by or the engine was copied from the same guys that made Total Anihillation, Supreme Commander, and the like.Unfortunately, this doesn't really belong on Steam.  While I am glad that we are getting more RTS variety, most of the games on here don't work, the AI difficulty is all hardmode despite the labels, and despite how good everything is I lost interest after my first successful match...that I actually took seriously.  As players have said, this enigne has no tutorials explaining anything, and it's only thanks to my previous knowledge with Supreme Commander that I could go anywhere.In short, no, I don't recommend it...not on Steam at any rate.  If this engine interests, you, play it on the original website.  It's got a ton of more features and even games based on other franchises...which, for legal reasons, may never be seen on the Steam version.  If you're really looking for a fun free RTS based on the TA games, go to their website and you won't be disappointed.  Otherwise, fork up cash for SC and PA.  I can't under good conscience recommend this on Steam.			"

												A decent game when you manage to get past the clunky and over complicated lobby. It features a Starcraft feel with very sharp looking maps and decent gameplay.Good graphics and interesting buildings/units can be created, making it daunting to someone new to the RTS genre. It is very unforgiving to even veteran players, and I would recommend playing with a friend in custom games to figure out what your doing, or you will be quickly destroyed.When you begin the game, you choose a location on one side of the map, depending on where you start and quickly need to build as a large amount of people love to rush and end the game quickly. When the game tends to last longer, if you happen to win a decent victory, a lot of people choose to leave early as its just easier to hop into a new game, where you have a fair chance at winning.I personally do not like the lobby system and how confusing it is to learn, I am probably just used to WC3/SC's easy to use matchmaking systems, so take a shot at it, try and learn how to find a game and enjoy yourselfs, its free, so you can't lose by trying it out.Personal Rating: 1.5/5			"

												Really fun and underplayed RTS game. Fast paced and action packed unlike many other's like it which more focus on basebuilding and economy. Has a bunch of quality maps that are official and hundreds more spring engine maps that are compatible with the game. Well worth your time to try considering it costs nothing.			"

												Not a bad game, Although it could use more maps and be a little less confusing.When i first started this game i noticed there was no single player mode which its a free RTSso i can understand but i would like to see a campain mode for people like me who dont have very good internet.i think this game needs, 1 to be less confusing just to enter a game, ui's need to be changed to be a little more noticable, more units need to be added along with better descriptions for units, it also needs to have less free android app looking tabs, besides a few chainges and bug fixes this is a great game and i would highly suggest it.

												A really great RTS game. I play this with my friends anytime we get a chance. It has many different units you can pick and choose to fight with. There are different strategies you can take such as either waiting and building up a defence/attack or just going all out and attacking from the very beginning. I have not encountered any bugs as of yet. The game seems to be very well made. The graphics are really great and yet I am still able to play it on a low quality laptop. In my time playing this game, I really enjoyed how you can get these huge units that can take out nearly everything. This is a great game so get it today!The only downside is that there aren't enough people who know about the game who are playing it.			"

												Evolution RTS is one of many RTS built on the Spring engine. It's also one of the more casual games in the bunch.For me it is much less stressful than your average RTS. Battles are relatively quick, fun, and flashy. It may share some similarities with other games in the TA vein, but it is not nearly as long winded as some can get.It has some rough edges, yes, but give it time. It is very  playable as is but with the amount of feedback it's getting  (more than ever before) it will be even better shortly. Forboding Angel (the main dev) is a dedicated individual and I'm sure he is loving the chance to make a game you can also easily enjoy.As a side note: If you're an RTS fan and this game didn't catch your fancy; Turn off the filter in the match lobby to check out the other spring RTS games. One of them might be what you're looking for. "

												If you are looking for a Finished and Polished AAA RTS PVP game.  This is NOT it.Evolution RTS is a free Open Source RTS game.  Could be compared to Total Annihilation.It does has a wiki website with some help pages and videos.  You can find many youtube videos for help and gameplay.When i tried to test this game, i could not get a working AI match running and there was no new players playing.  It works on Win 10, looked ok, sounded ok, played ? CONS:- No Matchmaking.- No In-game scripted Tutorial.- too complex for New simple players.- Not many people playing. Try it, if you like Total Annihilation-like games.For more info:

												Control formating is horid and the game gives no tutorial whats-so-ever so your shooting blanks in the dark when you play the game. There are random lag spikes (Massive ones at that from 150fps to 12fps) The camera is very stiff and no control of it such as rotation (As far as I know since there is no tutorial) There is also another annoying bug where the camera would have a mind of its' own and take you across the map. The resource based gameplay is comfusing and stale. I'm a major fan of RTS games but this is a poorly made one. I hope this is an alpha because the developers have a long way to go if they want this game to be successful (This review is based on a couple minutes in game and already I see bugs, glitches, crashes and poorly designed UI system, which makes it very confusing to get around in this game. I've had a horrible time with this game and I hope in the future they will fix it and I may change my point of view on this game I would give it a 4/10 for an RTS and a 6/10 for being indie)			"

Hit ""Start"" as I couldn't an ""I'm ready"" button.

You need to make sure you have the proper windows updates, and it's about as intuitive as brain surgery.   I'm used to having to jump through hoops for games, but this is ridiculous.  Since I refuse to update my Windows, I can't play the game, and it took me a while to find that out.  Nothing about it is intuitive, and the description on the page doesn't give proper instructions on what or how to do it.   Why do I have to go to forums to get your game to play properly?  Open source doesn't mean it has to be a lazy mess.  I'll go back to older RTS games, they look as good if not better, and quite frankly, they're developed much better.  This thing is just a mess.

												The one reason I do not enjoy this game, is the fact that, well, I haven't played. I downloaded it, very excited because I love rts games, but it will never work because of the fact that it refuses to download the launcher. And now, I am updating my review because, I went and tried to download the stupid engine, but this game hates my computer, and so it does not work, so for that reason alone, I do not reccomend this game			"

												Terrible game, is extremely vague and needs many many changes. It seems like it's in alpha state, completely unclear what to do or how it all works.It is hard to even get a game started. The interface of the game is a scrambled buch of icons and buttons, and after spending two hours trying to get a normal game running, I still don't understand how to place the enemy on the game map. The enemy isn't there (except for an idle builder unit) when the game starts, but just appears out of nowhere after several minutes.Aside from all this it's chuck full of bugs.Please guys, I don't mean to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but at least provide a guide or help page or something. The game's mechanics look very promising, but it's all in vain if it doesn't work.			"

												A very good free RTS game, common to SupCom. BUT the menu is very confusing, and there seems to be no way to make a private lobby. The only way to play online is to join a pre-made lobby that is empty and play from there. The AI seems to be broken so I do recommend to play with friends!Would give this game 7.5/10Confusing menu, boring without friends or when playing offline. But a surprisingly good gameplay.			"

												I really enjoy this game. There is a large variety of maps to play on and the gameplay is very versatile, with many unit types and play styles to choose from. I learned the game within 2-3 hours by playing multiplayer. At first it was very confusing but in multi-player the community is very helpful and if you have played any other RTS you will catch on very quick. The community is small which I really like, there is always multiple games going but you run into familiar names a lot which I enjoy.			"

												When the game works you have a selection of different ""games"" to choose from. I say games because they each have different units, buildings, and overall different gameplay. For example one is similar to starcraft whereas the other is similar to planetary annihilation (how they play, one is smaller whereas one is bigger). The launcher is very buggy but when you start playing with your friends or someone it is very good.			"

Make an account, its easy free and takes literally seconds.Step 2. Find a server with a game mode/map that looks interesting, you dont need to play on that server, just join, it will save the map to your computer so you can use it in singleplayer, the game mode as well will be savedstep 3. click SINGEPLAYER and start it upRecommended game mode for starters is imperial winter, it is essentially the best one out there, all game modes are free, same with the maps.as long as you follow this list and do some digging and trial and error, you'll do fine			"

There was a ""Start"" button, so clicked that and was told that I'm not allowed to issue a start command.It might be a cool game, but if you have me guessing from the get go on how to actually start a game, then you've completely lost me.

												TLDR ""Free or Not your time is better spent on literally anything else""Evolution RTS is a free real time strategy game based on the open source Spring engine.  The Spring engine was originally created as part of the TA Spring project which sought to bring Chris Taylor’s cult RTS “Total Annihilation” into full 3D.  Spring has since spawn a myriad of new games from TA inspired RTS games to a WWII RTS boasting multiple factions and 300 unique units. Evolution RTS uses the Spring Lobby to setup single player and multiplayer matches. So not unlike steam games with DRM from the publisher or developer launching Evolution RTS does not start the game but actually launches the Spring Lobby which acts as a platform for playing spring engine games. During the initial Steam Release of Evolution this caused a lot of confusion since clicking “play game” didn’t actually install or even launch the game.  Obviously this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off a few steam users who got lost trying to navigate Spring Lobby to play the game.  It’s the same complaint that is leveled at DRM software like U-play (Spring Lobby is not DRM), it puts an unnecessary layer between the user and the game.  Certainly it doesn’t fit within the framework of the Steam platform where uses expect the game to launch from their Steam library page.Fortunately, the developers took steps to rectify the issue by having steam load Evolution RTS and some if its popular maps in addition to the Spring Lobby. Unfortunately this still leaves users with a barrier: Spring Lobby itself. Spring Lobby isn’t terribly unintuitive and anyone with moderate computer skills should have no issues navigating it despite the fact that some UI elements are missing good tooltips. It does however move like a worm through bedrock.  It took me several minutes to setup a single player AI bot match because the interface would simply freeze each time I tried to add an AI and then again when I’d change the AI’s difficult. I honestly thought I wasn’t going to be able to pick a map, but then I typed the first few letters of the maps name and was able to select it.  The drop down menu doesn’t appear to work.  The gameplay is obviously inspired by Total Annihilation.  It uses a dual streaming resource system requiring metal and energy to construct units and buildings It deviates a bit in adding a supply system.  The game currently has a lot of the staples from the “TA Genre” including radar, land, air, and amphibious units, nukes, super units etc. but unfortunately there is only one faction to pick meaning each match feels a bit like a mirror.Each game starts by selecting your start position.  I choose the top right corner of the map badlands because it looks like there is a lot of metal there.  I press ready and get a count down.  I start with one unit the “Overseer” which I use to construct some basic economy buildings.  The art assets, the graphics, and the animations all feel dated.  The Spring engine is no spring chicken, but there are other Spring offerings which do a far more serviceable job. Once I build my factory I get the first sign of something wrong: all my offensive units are in red like I cannot construct any of them despite having available resources.  I am unsure if this is a bug or not, but I had to restart the game 3 times before I was finally able to construct units.  In every match I played the AI parked its Overseer or commander unit in the middle of the map and never moved it when I attacked.  Fortunately it appears the AI actually knows how to build and attack.All buildings are available for construction from the start of the game.  There doesn’t appear to be any research, upgrade, or tier system.  The constructor units don’t get an “advanced factory” to build.  Unfortunately the bad unit and building design makes this freedom pointless, I have no desire to see what units I can build.Combat doesn’t thrill me either.  The sounds (when you can hear them over the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dubstep soundtrack) are pretty generic, the units explode leaving no wreckage. Units don’t seem to have much in the way of hit points meaning your army won’t last very long before exploding.  .  I tried building defensive towers but found them destroyed quickly by even light scout units.  It’s obvious the game lacks any semblance of balance.  At this point in my play through I couldn’t handle another minute of the soundtrack which felt completely out of place in an RTS game, but right at home in a 12 year olds Call of Duty video.  When I saw that the options menu was devoid of any content and I couldn’t shut off the direct feed to some wannabe-skrillex’s soundcloud page.  I had to stop.Do not play this game. Amateur doesn’t even describe it, early access doesn’t describe, it isn’t worth the 5 – 10 minutes it takes to set it up.  Free or not pass on this one.  If you’re feeling nostalgic about Chris Taylor RTS games there are plenty of better Spring offerings, TA on GOG, and an active community around SupCom FA called FA Forever. If you’re looking for fresh RTS blood move along, you won’t find that here either.  To anyone who says why are you knocking a free game?  Well because the developers are offering it to people as a way to spend their free time.  This is a commodity as much as money is.  Trust me on this oneYour free time is better spent elsewhere.			"

												Evolution RTS is trying its best to be Total Annihilation. Unfortunately, the web lobby and game's GUI are very poorly designed, slow to respond, and impractical. The buildings and other units look like low poly chunks of fisher price vomit. The projectile effects are 2D sprites from the 90's. The terrain is composed of featureless flat planes of rough sandpaper - no animals,  vegetation, rocks, telephone poles, roads, cars, buildings, or anything. The only good thing I can say about the game is that it is categorized correctly as an RTS, its free, and its still better than C&C3: Tiberium Wars.			"

												Evolution RTS feels very unfinished, there is a reason for this. The game fails to explain what you need to do to make units work. The graphics are fine for an RTS game.The AI of your units is the only thing keeping them in combat until you figure out the attack system which the game does not tell you about, if you don't force them to attack, they just sit looking at the thing you told them to attack, making air units near useless. The lack of a reload time indicator makes bombers extremely underpowered as you have no idea when to force the next attack and it appears that when you do, the timer resets.The AI players are based on tower defense or survival games meaning that the AI constantly throws unit at you, and you have to defend. On both games I have played with AI players, the AI on my team appeared to do nothing but the truth is that it was spawning units to fight the spawned units of the enemy!The description of this game states that it fits ALL skill levels. I disagree: Play this game if you are extremely good at RTS games or can pick up a new skillset with no linked tutorial!From a gameplay standpoint:The amount of unique units is very slim and it is very easy to rush nuclear missiles, by far the most overpowered weapon in the game. When I played with a friend he had 2 nuke silos up and ready to fire within 15 minutes! I have been informed that this is because the game is supposed to be played in 15 minutes and at most, 30 minutes.The game runs quite well and I've kept a steady framerate for the time I've played.The 600 MB download is a joke, you download a matchmaking system that is hellish to use as it provides next to no help and is extremely old fashioned in looks.If you want to try a very difficult survival-based RTS game without a commitment of money, give it a go and as long as you understand that the AI is based on making you defend your base more and more, you should find this game very entertaining.If you have enough friends to play without AI, (2, 4, 6, 8.) Then this game can be played as a standard RTS game and, after you understand the control scheme, you will have a lot of fun.(After reading the information from the developer below, I have changed my opinion on the game.)Thank you for reading. :)			"

												It has a decent concept like many other RTS games out there ... However it has several negative drawbacks ... the number one killer of this game is the negative attitude of some of the developers (or people claiming to be developers).Next is the balancing in the game ... It is way off ... and they think thats the way it is supposed to be ...if you like doing the same thing over and over and over in a very limited pvp style RTS then you will like this game at least somewhat ... If you like real RTS ... chances are very high you will not like this game at all ... there is no real strategic function other than making sure you produce more units than your opponent ...			"

												The game lobby wasn't as difficult as some other reviews have stated.  But the game seems buggy.  My rig can play every game I have ever wanted to, yet this game crashes to lobby every time I tried to play.  And the only reason given is my graphics ""Just aren't good enough"" I doubt this, too bad I was looking forward to trying this out.			"

												Alright, so i played this for about 10 to 15 ish minutes and well the game itself is ok as far as i got, but the god damn camera fought me multiple times stoping me from playing for around 20 seconds. Now that might not seem much but in that time my base was wiped out 5 minutes into the game by the ""Very Easy"" A.I. How is anyone supposed to fight off all those units when the camera is fighting them and they dont have the resources yet for it.The game's units are pretty cool, and the learning curve isnt that steep if you have common sense and such. My advice, for how little it means, is to maby tone down the A.I so i can stop rushing the player as fast as possible so the player can actually be ready to fend off 5-6 units instead of being completely swarmed.i'll rate this game a 4/10 with the camera problems and rushing A.I			"

												Evolution RTS feels very unfinished, there is a reason for this. The game fails to explain what you need to do to make units work. The graphics are fine for an RTS game.The AI of your units is the only thing keeping them in combat until you figure out the attack system which the game does not tell you about, if you don't force them to attack, they just sit looking at the thing you told them to attack, making air units near useless. The lack of a reload time indicator makes bombers extremely underpowered as you have no idea when to force the next attack and it appears that when you do, the timer resets.The AI players are based on tower defense or survival games meaning that the AI constantly throws unit at you, and you have to defend. On both games I have played with AI players, the AI on my team appeared to do nothing but the truth is that it was spawning units to fight the spawned units of the enemy!The description of this game states that it fits ALL skill levels. I disagree: Play this game if you are extremely good at RTS games or can pick up a new skillset with no linked tutorial!From a gameplay standpoint:The amount of unique units is very slim and it is very easy to rush nuclear missiles, by far the most overpowered weapon in the game. When I played with a friend he had 2 nuke silos up and ready to fire within 15 minutes! I have been informed that this is because the game is supposed to be played in 15 minutes and at most, 30 minutes.The game runs quite well and I've kept a steady framerate for the time I've played.The 600 MB download is a joke, you download a matchmaking system that is hellish to use as it provides next to no help and is extremely old fashioned in looks.If you want to try a very difficult survival-based RTS game without a commitment of money, give it a go and as long as you understand that the AI is based on making you defend your base more and more, you should find this game very entertaining.If you have enough friends to play without AI, (2, 4, 6, 8.) Then this game can be played as a standard RTS game and, after you understand the control scheme, you will have a lot of fun.(After reading the information from the developer below, I have changed my opinion on the game.)Thank you for reading. :)			"

												I genuinaly enjoyed this game, though it shares many similaritys to ""Planeteary Annihalation"" The ability to make resources makers if your trapped in a small corner has proven valuable durring survival games. the only problem i've run into happens when people begain to spam small troops- create huge amounts of the same sall units. When someone does this, my computer begains to slow to a crawl, allowing them to win because of Lag.			"

												I dont get this game! why isn't there a tutorial? why do you have to start a multiplayer map before you can play single player? why do the help menus not have any information in them? so in my opinion this game is not user friendly. I am sure if you are familiar with  games very similar to this one then it is probably a  good game. but my knowledge of games like this I find this game unplayable			"

												This is a very fun game. First off, i'd like to say how intuitive it is. The format is similar to many other RTS games, most notably supreme commander. While it doesn't compare in content, quailty is on par.Starting the game is just like Gary's mod, wherin you have to download new content before you can play it. The controls are basic RTS and the game pace is moderate (5-50 minute games)When there are a lot of units on the board, the game tends to slow a bit, but that's common for a massive unit count game like this.Overall, exceptional game. too bad there aren't many players on :/			"

												TLDR ""Free or Not your time is better spent on literally anything else""Evolution RTS is a free real time strategy game based on the open source Spring engine.  The Spring engine was originally created as part of the TA Spring project which sought to bring Chris Taylor’s cult RTS “Total Annihilation” into full 3D.  Spring has since spawn a myriad of new games from TA inspired RTS games to a WWII RTS boasting multiple factions and 300 unique units. Evolution RTS uses the Spring Lobby to setup single player and multiplayer matches. So not unlike steam games with DRM from the publisher or developer launching Evolution RTS does not start the game but actually launches the Spring Lobby which acts as a platform for playing spring engine games. During the initial Steam Release of Evolution this caused a lot of confusion since clicking “play game” didn’t actually install or even launch the game.  Obviously this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off a few steam users who got lost trying to navigate Spring Lobby to play the game.  It’s the same complaint that is leveled at DRM software like U-play (Spring Lobby is not DRM), it puts an unnecessary layer between the user and the game.  Certainly it doesn’t fit within the framework of the Steam platform where uses expect the game to launch from their Steam library page.Fortunately, the developers took steps to rectify the issue by having steam load Evolution RTS and some if its popular maps in addition to the Spring Lobby. Unfortunately this still leaves users with a barrier: Spring Lobby itself. Spring Lobby isn’t terribly unintuitive and anyone with moderate computer skills should have no issues navigating it despite the fact that some UI elements are missing good tooltips. It does however move like a worm through bedrock.  It took me several minutes to setup a single player AI bot match because the interface would simply freeze each time I tried to add an AI and then again when I’d change the AI’s difficult. I honestly thought I wasn’t going to be able to pick a map, but then I typed the first few letters of the maps name and was able to select it.  The drop down menu doesn’t appear to work.  The gameplay is obviously inspired by Total Annihilation.  It uses a dual streaming resource system requiring metal and energy to construct units and buildings It deviates a bit in adding a supply system.  The game currently has a lot of the staples from the “TA Genre” including radar, land, air, and amphibious units, nukes, super units etc. but unfortunately there is only one faction to pick meaning each match feels a bit like a mirror.Each game starts by selecting your start position.  I choose the top right corner of the map badlands because it looks like there is a lot of metal there.  I press ready and get a count down.  I start with one unit the “Overseer” which I use to construct some basic economy buildings.  The art assets, the graphics, and the animations all feel dated.  The Spring engine is no spring chicken, but there are other Spring offerings which do a far more serviceable job. Once I build my factory I get the first sign of something wrong: all my offensive units are in red like I cannot construct any of them despite having available resources.  I am unsure if this is a bug or not, but I had to restart the game 3 times before I was finally able to construct units.  In every match I played the AI parked its Overseer or commander unit in the middle of the map and never moved it when I attacked.  Fortunately it appears the AI actually knows how to build and attack.All buildings are available for construction from the start of the game.  There doesn’t appear to be any research, upgrade, or tier system.  The constructor units don’t get an “advanced factory” to build.  Unfortunately the bad unit and building design makes this freedom pointless, I have no desire to see what units I can build.Combat doesn’t thrill me either.  The sounds (when you can hear them over the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dubstep soundtrack) are pretty generic, the units explode leaving no wreckage. Units don’t seem to have much in the way of hit points meaning your army won’t last very long before exploding.  .  I tried building defensive towers but found them destroyed quickly by even light scout units.  It’s obvious the game lacks any semblance of balance.  At this point in my play through I couldn’t handle another minute of the soundtrack which felt completely out of place in an RTS game, but right at home in a 12 year olds Call of Duty video.  When I saw that the options menu was devoid of any content and I couldn’t shut off the direct feed to some wannabe-skrillex’s soundcloud page.  I had to stop.Do not play this game. Amateur doesn’t even describe it, early access doesn’t describe, it isn’t worth the 5 – 10 minutes it takes to set it up.  Free or not pass on this one.  If you’re feeling nostalgic about Chris Taylor RTS games there are plenty of better Spring offerings, TA on GOG, and an active community around SupCom FA called FA Forever. If you’re looking for fresh RTS blood move along, you won’t find that here either.  To anyone who says why are you knocking a free game?  Well because the developers are offering it to people as a way to spend their free time.  This is a commodity as much as money is.  Trust me on this oneYour free time is better spent elsewhere.			"
