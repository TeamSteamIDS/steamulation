												To me, it's hard to make a 2D Cartoony style like this entertaining, and honestly I laughed a lot as I discovered the cows along the seasons, the aliens' animations, and of course, Barney ! This toilets cabin makes him so alive, and yet we never see the guy ! Now, imagine that all the 'towers' you put in the fields are alive too... Man, this ambiance is soooo fun ! It's actually a part of the machine, but it's also its eyes. It's a vent, but it's also its mouth. Just love the design of these characters/machines ! Mobs have suits, costumes, cohesive animations, and their abilities are related to their appearance. You could guess what it can or cannot do by just looking at them. It's very pleasant and made me feel like I was watching a good old cartoon from Tex Avery/Hanna Barbera. So alive !Then came the game... I really don't like Tower Defense game type. BPE is the first one I DO want to complete ! God, I felt entertained all time long ! The first levels were clearly designed as tutorials. That's why all the people who got used to play TDs may be bored, but I think their experience will allow them to complete these levels very fast, to finally get to...... THE ZAPPER !Here is how you can turn a simple TD into a frenetic game experience : developpers managed to give you this intense feeling of being overwhelmed, without simply adding mobs, and mobs, and a new wave of mobs... The ZAPPER ! They also played on mobs' resistance, and finally managed to balance mobs' speed, defense, zapper's power, machines' utility and player's actions so that you have a lot of things to setup, manage and use... but in a very effective way ! Everything is damn simple to understand and use, and provides a lot of fun ! Don't... forget... to use... the ZAPPER ! It's your best ally all game long !And finally, a new dimension came to my attention: mobs' transformations ! You think you killed it, it turns into something else ! Hard Rockers turn into ""Berserk Hard Rockers"", Zombies turn into graves, where new smaller zombies emerge, ... but I won't spoil everything ^_^ I found these game mechanics very inventive !A lot of TDs should take example on this game. It's simple, yet effective and terribly addictive, fun and easy to play, and includes a very well balanced challenge.I should have given feedback on the 'charismatic' fields, or on the growing number of aliens' spawn points as you progress in the game, or maybe on the evolutive environment (mushrooms and their spores, ice forming on your machines during winter and the zapper's utility at this moment of the game,...), and maybe I should have told you about the bosses, the drill, the gears or the cow bell... but I really have nothing to say about it, because everything was part of the fun, and very well thought !Play this game, it really worths its price !

												Cute little gem of a game! It's Plants vs Zombies in space ! Well on earth, tehcnically xDDon't be fooled by all those colours: there is actually quite a bit of depth poured into the gameplay, and the zapper makes sure you basically never sit idle (on the contrary, you must constantly decide if/what to boost or explode), and that's where it differs from many other TD's (and from PvZ, specifically): apart from building towers and picking up ressources, you are always active with what is basically a multi-tool, there's not much waiting involved.Veteran mode is also quite handy, and I'd recommand tower denfense... veterans ^^ to actually enable it. I'd even say it's worth to turn it on from start. You won't get to make many mistakes and get away with it, but the difficulty isn't offputting either, and as long as your strategy is sound, you shouldn't get stuck wondering what went wrong. ""Normal"" difficulty I didn't try so I can't really comment, but it sounds nice to be able to play with less focus, or to enable less-hardcore players to fully enjoy the game I guess. Plus, you can always switch between Normal/Vet with the flick of a button apparently.There's a whole bunch of animations, graphics, easter eggs, you name it. You get everything from ninjas, to secret agents reading news papers unsuspectingly, to Martian ladies filing their nails and cleaning up the alleys :DGameplay wise, there's something I found rather odd at first for a TD: compared to mostly every other TD I ever played, the maps are rather small, and towers have very limited range (basically just 3 squares). I was afraid of that at first, but it turns out that it just makes you think about placement and synergy even more, instead of just spamming long ranged OP towers everywhere like in some other TDs. Speaking of which : the game starts slow, but it's kind of a tutorial even though it doesn't officially says so. You gotta hang in there for the first 4 or 5 levels, but after that you get the zapper and get to occupy yourself with it, and start seeing more diversity towers-wise.All in all, much more fun that some random movie, at the price of a movie theater ticket ;p			"

												At first the game starts pretty slow, but the pace really cranks up a notch after the ""tutorial"" levels. Everything's explained in great detail (maybe too much for some people?), but after those explanations, the fun really begins and boy does it get hectic at times!The main originality is the ""zapper"" (a raygun you get at level 6 I think), and it's used pretty much everywhere: you can shoot down creeps with it (although it's quite weak compared to your actual towers and traps, and it breaks down if it overheats, so you have to manage that too), and you have lots of interactions. For example, quite early in the game, you have G-men like martians that your towers can't detect until you blow his cover with the raygun. You can also zap away the forcefields the mad scientists cast around other martians.It really adds a great deal of action to the game, it's unlike any other tower defense game I've played so far (in which you basically deploy your towers and wait for them to do the job until you get enough money to put some more).The graphics are cute and really fun and the music is cool too. It look like PopCap's ""Plants versus Zombies"" and is every bit as good (although quite different when you get far enough in the game).The demo is good but don't be fooled: the learning/difficulty curve is actually smoother in the game (although the beginning is still quite slow). Oh also, you have two difficulty modes: normal and veteran. Normal is pretty easy, Veteran is the opposite and will have you yell at your computer, only to come back for more right away :p			"

												While I liked the cartoony gfx of the game, I was reluctant to play a TD where the tower are designed not to get the job done (yes, on purpose). And in the end this game was not for me. I get the fact that people are trying to reinvent the TD genre, but honestly, isn't designing a solid TD hard enough? Usually, when features are added the towers are left behind. Beware planet earth is a good example of this. Towers are lackluster and their range is minute. If you like frantically clicking in a TD then this game is definately for you. If you are an oldschool TD player, who likes to sit back at the end of a level and see waves pulverized by a well designed tower setup, you might want to pass on this game.			"

												This game is both cute and has depth. It will appeal to casual players who want to see cute / funny things on the screen (think plants vs zombies crowd) and also to the players who want depth of strategy (think defence grid players). I have finally found a game that will appeal to both me and the girlfriend. Easy buy after playing the demo. Try it. I bet you'll like it. And don't let the laser gun turn you off, like it did me at first. I thought it was just a tedious laser to shoot stuff with while trying to build defences etc. But it actually adds a layer of strategy, as it doesn't just damage the bad guys, it does things like lower shields and other status changes, and supercharges particular towers.

												If you're a PvZ fan then you'll definitely like this game. This game requires much more planning and strategy, and it has a Veteran mode which is quite unforgiving.I will point out I experienced some glitches in the game. For instance there's a problem where intermittently the game won't allow you to pick up the zapper, cowbell, and the detonator. And sometimes it freezes when you exit full screen. Overall, give it a go. The pros definitely outweigh the cons.			"

												No recommendation for this game. It's not that it's bad, it's just that it's another tower defense game that does nothing to distinguish it from any others.None of the towers feel like they have any weight behind them, everything is just really generic and boring. Fast+weak enemies, check. Slow+tough enemies, check. Regular peashooter towers, check. No damage slowing/freeze towers, check.It's a reskin of every tower defense game you've ever played. The current sale price of 2.74$ is barely justifiable let alone the regular price tag of (LOL) 11$ CAN. I got this in a humble bundle so I don't feel so bad but, don't waste your money here.			"

												This is a VERY GENERIC tower defense game, which is almost identicle to ""Go Home Dinosaurs"" You place down ""income generators"" and then use your money wisely to buy varios types of towers to defend your base.+ Great art style+ Challenging (on Veteran)+ Humous levels / enemies+ Easy to learn- Can not upgrade towers- No Abilities- No health bars on enemies- Very repetitive and slow paced- Story is lacking (basically martians are trying to get your cows...that's about it)- Level Design is pretty basic, and lacks variety between stages.- Not much user input or user interaction besides picking up ""money"" and placing towers.Reccomended Price:  $3I paid: ~$1 (Greenlight Bundle)Overall Opinion: This game has nothing new or unique going for it, but if you are a fan of Tower Defense games, and don't have anything to compare this to, then this may be pretty fun for a while. It's good...but has been done so many times before. (Suggestions: Kingdom Rush, Defense Grid, Go Home Dinosaurs)			"

												Can't. Stop. Saving. Cows!This is totally not my type of game, but the demo was so entertaining that I just had to put it on my wishlist, and then get it when I saw it on sale for 1.99 euro. It's well worth more than that (and I'm stingy). The graphics and humour hits the right spot for me.It was great fun until I tried to get those stupid achievements, then it turned into frustrating no fun on the Veteran play through of Winter level 5. After far too many attempts on the previous levels each time until I got lucky, too. (Achievements only ever get in the way of enjoying a game for me, and this game was where I finally decided to say 'screw them all'. I'd really like a button in Steam to turn them all off.)Back to just playing for the fun (screw veteran), it's entertaining me still, replaying the levels in order and the challenge and bonus ones I like.There are plenty of levels, hours upon hours of play time! The progression is good, starts easy and gets slowly more difficult. There are some different types of challenge levels throughout the Story mode, where I would like to just skip the one that I find no fun at all (Maid Raid), and get more of the one I like best (Back to Basics). They each unlock a few more levels of the same type once you've beaten the one in the Story mode, which is nice. There are also bonus levels where the aliens and playing area look different, and some have somewhat different special abilities (with no way that I know to read up details about them, unfortunately). I'd have liked a way to re-check the aliens while playing in a normal level, too. My memory isn't the best anymore.And I'd have liked a way to go to the next level in a second play through, rather than having to go back to the main menu and pick a previously played level just to get to the one after the one I just played.And I'd much prefer the game to remember that I unticked Fullscreen, rather than having to do it again every time I launch it.But overall, great fun. Try the free demo, it has 7 or so levels from different spots in the story mode, so you get to see easy and somewhat tougher levels in shorter time, giving you a good idea of what to expect in the full version.

Alians do variaty of things, make portals, rocket jump, destory your defense, shields, and play music.You must be active thoughout the whole battle to keep the alians from taking your cows to do unspeakable things. The added challange modes and the TF2 and zombie maps were fun change of pace.Overall a great TD game, not real easy, not really hard. (on hard difficulty)			"

												i got this game in a humble bundle and so did not pay full price. I enjoyed my time playing beware planet Earth. It's a fairly standard tower defence game but it does justice to its genre. The main twist (in lack of a better word) of this game is that as well as letting your towers kill the aliens you also have a laser that the player controls which must be use tactically to avoid overheating, It adds a degree of control to the player that you don't see in most tower defence games. There are a lot of levels across different environments and many different enemy types to keep you busy. Beware planet Earth isn't anything special but it's quite a fun game to pass the time.			"

												This starts out as a solid yet typical tower defense game. The game really begins to shine when the gun becomes a primary element that performs many different gameplay functions. Having this 3rd major element to compliment the standard towers and resource management makes this one of the most hectic and action based TD games in the genre. Fantastic presentation, solid level design, unique enemy units, fun themes and great bonus levels make this a great package for fans of the genre. GG!			"

Also, this version has a mode where the map is Portal themed and the martians are dressed up like Valve characters8/10			"

												Now here's a curious one: a Tower Defense actually published by Bandai Namco. It's just about the only indie thing in their catalogue from what I can tell, too. Surely the game must be pretty good if that's the case, right? Well, I'd say no sadly.Like some other games Beware Planet Earth has you fighting aliens, in this case 50s-era little green men coming to abduct your cows - well, someone else's cows, but you're being a nice guy and helping them with that while he's stuck in the outhouse. You do this with some tricked out appliances and other tools to fight back the invasion through the four seasons. That sounds well and good, and the game was appealing to me at first, but it quickly became apparent the it just doesn't stack up to others in the genre.As you can see, the campaign starts off with only a straight line for enemies to go down; while there are alternate entrances later on it takes a while, and they still have to go back down the path to the main exit if they make it to your cows, since the game has a Defense Grid system where you can potentially get them back (but often can't). To compensate for this, the range for most of your towers feels pretty short, which makes it hard to place things efficiently. You need to as well, since all the towers are on cooldowns. This needs to be the case, since to get resources you need to build resource generators, and then actively click on the cogs they produce to get more. By the end of a given level you'll often have tons of cogs you can't spend, since all the really useful positions are covered and you can't upgrade your stuff in this game.The cog thing is only one aspect of why I grew to dislike Beware, as its way of involving you in the proceedings is just clicking or holding the mouse button down on things. In addition to the cogs, not long into the game you get a ray gun you have to use to burn away certain debris, or get past the defenses of certain martians. You also later get a cowbell that will make the cows walk back to their pen quicker. All this combined turns the game into a bit of a plate-spinning simulator, where you have to be everywhere at once in some levels. I tried some of the challenges the game offers, and they seem designed for someone with incredible reflexes and APM, or I guess two mouses.Besides that, though, I might have stopped playing regardless, as the game just seems blander and more simplistic than others in the genre. For ten dollars you could get either Defense Grid, Kingdom Rush or Chasing Shadows, which are just better overall. I do like Beware's graphical style but it doesn't make a game on its own.			"

												TL;DR: Rather simple cartoonish inoffensive tower defense game. Martians are coming and you must use a bunch of mechanical contraptions (fridges, grills, ...) to stop them from abducting the cows.I've played this game for about 14 zones in Veteran mode (Summer, invasion 4).BPE takes some cues from Plants vs Zombies: having to click currency icons to collect them (cogs in BPE), cartoonish visual style with rather silly enemies (Martian maids, crazy scientists, ninjas, ...), pre-mission selection of towers, no tower upgrades, a chance to look at the enemies in the incoming wave...The biggest difference is that the Martians move along a single route, from the crop circle to collect the cows at the pasture, after which they will haul the cows to the circle to be abducted. In this sense, it's a bit like Defense Grid: dropped cows will (slowly) walk back to the pasture.With no actual tower upgrades, after placing the towers the player ends up mostly using a ray gun to cause additional damage to the enemies. There are some enemies that actually need player input to defeat (energy shields, ninja Martians who replaced themselves with logs, undercover Martians), but together with the ""need to click the cogs to collect them"" mechanic feels a bit like a means to give the player something to do. There hasn't been a chance of designing the enemy path (mazeing) either.It's inoffensive, but nothing spectacular. Just get Plants vs Zombies or Defense Grid instead.			"

												People make comparisons to Plants vs Zombies. I'm only a couple hours in and found it frustrating. On Veteran Mode, your towers feel miniscule compared to the enemy hp pool. Winning on some level requires taking exactly the right towers. Towers are overall very boring, the first 5 you get (compared to Plants vs Zombies): Sunflower, Incredibly Weak PeaShooter, Frozen Pea Shooter, and then you get the two worst, a Bomb and a Landmine. I keep waiting to unlock good towers but the only ones I've gotten are an Ember-shooting Grill and a Fire Hose. Everything else makes me want to wait till the next good thing comes along. Developers seem to care about the game but I don't know how much they've actually played it on Veteran......Hope this helps.			"

And i was quite sad, and have been so ever since.But suddenly this game, that ive heard nothing about, pops up in steam. I look at bit at it, it reminds me of PVZ. i then give it a go. and im back, im freaking back!. Its like that first night i played Plants Vs Zombies. Oh yes, the only thing you need to know, is that if you love the gameplay, the humor, you will love this, and dont let it fool you, the veteran mode, will give you give a run for your money. it starts out real nice and slow. but soon those DAMN ALIENS, will steal your cows!. and you will be frantic about trying to stop them.JUST BUY THIS GAME, and lets hope we get expansions or a sequel.P.s i still miss Crazy Dave. nobody will ever replace him. But the Barney character who lives in a toilet seems pretty funny.			"

												“Another tower defense game,” I thought to myself. I will at least give it a shot.My low expectations were blown out of the water after playing the demo. I grabbed the game at full price, which is something I very rarely do, and have now beaten it and all the bonus levels. If Plants versus Zombies and Defense Grid had a love child, this is that game. Do not let the cute graphics fool you, the aliens will hand you your butt on a platter if you do not plan carefully. I have played and beaten a variety of tower defense games, but this one still challenged me.On top of actually requiring you to use deft strategy, you are never left sitting and watching the screen as your towers do everything for you. Early in the game, you are given a zapper gun that you must use to help fight off the aliens. If you do no use it, the aliens WILL beat you. Unlike other tower defense games you have to actively participate the in the action every second of the stages. The aliens can disable your towers, get rid of your traps, and even destroy your defenses if you do not use the zapper wisely to counter their offensive.The only thing that holds the game back from getting a perfect score from me is that there are a slew of game closing bugs during the extra missions.  There are also a couple of sections (particularly with the Maid challenge they throw at you) that take the game from being challenged to downright frustrating since you have to feel out the strategy that the developers want you to use through trial and error rather than make one of your own.I have to give this game 4.5 out of 5.

												Just another boring tower defense game. Graphics are nice, sound is fun, the gameplay is somewhat interactive (you have a laser gun that you may use whenever you like albeit it overheats when you use it too much). Still the game is really slow paced - some levels go on and on and on. To be honest - I've played this game for about two hours. Rest of the time it was working as a background process just to drop some cards.---------- For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ "

												Let's get one thing clear: This is a Plants Vs. Zombies rip-off. The second thing to make clear is that this game has the worst music I have ever heard in a videogame, going all the way back to the Commodore 64 era. Seriously, it is so astonishingly awful that I doubt anyone will make it ten minutes without shutting it off and leaving it there. Now the good news: this game is actually well-balanced and pretty fun. The levels are challenging but not impossible in standard mode (veteran mode however is off the chain.) So if you're a PvZ fan and are sick of waiting for PopCrap to get its sh*t together and release a sequel to their staggeringly successful PC game (on PC, ahem,) then heck, this is $9.99 well spent. Every dollar this game makes is because EA totally dropped the ball. So sorry, PopCrap. I hope the guys who made this make a Peggle rip-off next. It's absurd that there aren't 50 Peggle clones out there already.			"

												A rather uninspired clone of Plants vs. Zombies, emphasizing action rather than strategy. The pace becomes quite hectic in later levels, even in easy mode (playing in veteran mode becomes ridicolously hard in the third season at the latest), since you constantly have to click various objects and enemies with the Zapper gun. Selecting and placing turrets and refining your strategy becomes a minor matter then, also due to the fact that the turrets themselves are rather boring (single target damage, area damage, slowing targets ...), luckily the enemies are more varied. Beware Planet Earth is not a bad game. It's quite stylish and entertaining for a few hours. It's just that I liked Plants vs. Zombies better in every single regard. And Kingdom Rush. And Defender's Quest. And Sol Survivor. And Sentinel. And Defense Grid. And iBomber Defense. And Field Runners. Did I say Beware ... is not a bad game? Well, it's not a very good one either. Only recommeded if you're really desperate to play a new Tower Defense game.			"

												6/10 I'm recommending this, but barely. While it is creative and somewhat fun, there's far less emphasis on strategy than in most tower defense games. There are many times when the determining factor on whether you beat a mission is almost purely luck. You might have to play the same map several times, until you get lucky in the way things turn out.			"

												A cute tower defense game with an artistic style almost identical to plant vs zombies. You place towers on a predefined path stopping aliens from abducting cows. The game features plenty of different enemy types, some are standard to the genre while others enemies are unique and interesting. In addition to placing towers you will also have to constantly collect resources, zap enemies shield, place bombs etc. The harder difficulties will require precise planning. The game also has challenge and bonus levels to further your playtime.The game does nothing new for the genre but still provides a lot of fun and can be very challenging on the hardest difficulty.

												This is just an initial review for how far I've got with Beware Planet Earth.Beware Planet Earth is a strategy type game with very similar to themes to Plants vs Zombies. Its different in the sense of rather than having enemies come down lanes you have a pathway, later levels can be more pathways that lead to the same thing which is that at the end of the path are some cows (moo) you have to make sure the aliens don't steal your cows in which they have to get all the way to the cows and then back to where they spawned from. If an alien does pick up a cow and dies the cow will be dropped where it dies and have to walk back to its pen(I guess thats what it is). You have enemies that have different characteristics like PvZ and you have different turrets (flowers in PvZ) to proect your cows. You unlock more stuff as you progress through the game. But thats basically the core mechanics of the game I doubt it'll change much as I've just completed the Summer invasion levels.In theory this game sounds quite fun it has the same cartoonish style of PvZ and tries the same humour but its just not the same it doesn't quite pull it off, its a game that started off as pc and was converted to mobiles and I have no problem with that I have enjoyed some other mobile games. My problem with Beware Planet Earth is that its just not that fun, there's alot to get your teeth into as it includes any dlc that the mobile port had as well as the full game and it isn't even that expensive. But I just haven't enjoyed myself its just felt like a chore and because I've set myself the goal at making sure my completion is 50% or over, I can't just put it down and accept that I don't enjoy it.All in all I'd maybe recommend this game if its included in a bundle but there are better strategy games out there like Sanctum 1, Orcs Must Die (either), Dungeon Defenders, PvZ, Defense Grid and many others that are more worthy of your time.

												It might be a decent game on mobile, but the clickfest-based mechanics don't translate very well to PC, and there's not much backing it up to begin with - most levels are extremely tedious, and in many cases you've filled up the map with the best available tower before the map is halfway through. That's aggravated by the fact that for quite some time, you have access to exactly one tower that deals damage. The enemies at least have a bit of variety, but it mostly boils down to ""you have to click in the right places more to handle this properly"" - as do most of the other mechanics (the only 'income' you get is from a tower that you build that you have to click on each time it produces resources). Every level feels basically the same, and when the difficulty spikes at the beginning of fall, it just isn't worth it. As far as what the game provides outside gameplay - it seems bizarrely unoptimized, the attempts at humor are painful... apparently some people think the art style is cute?			"

												If you're going to clone Plants versus Zombies at least throw in some tower defense. Beware Planet Earth is the most basic, simple, straightforward, uninspired, copycat, utterly tedious game on Steam. It's not really a tower defense game because the levels are puzzles (if you can call iGame obviousness with almost no failure possible a ""puzzle""). Be prepared to sit and watch in boredom as aliens march across the screen and you hear PVZ ""splot"" noises and spawn noises the developers made with their mouths. There's no fast forward, next level, or other regular tower defense staples, because this is another worthless mobile game. Adorable cows, but how is that worth human money? Money totally wasted.

And then something happens and the game just stops being fun and becomes annoying, just like the 12th-20th beer at a party. Then you hit that wall and just wonder what's the point, like trying to consume that 30th beer so you do not have a lone survivor to haul home and be lonely in your fridge.Not saying to buy it, but not saying don't buy it.

												If this game makes you think of plants versus zombies, you're not far off.  Although it doesn't have as much gameplay variety, It is fun to build up your ""gear"" economy (like sunflowers in PvZ). There isn't nearly as much building freedom, which functionally makes building placement slightly more strategic than PvZ.  Like PvZ it slowly introduces more and more to you until you finally unleash the ultimate part of your arsenal on the last level.This game is super fun.  I got it as part of a bundle, so I can't really make a comment on pricing.  One of my greatest disappointments with this game is that, aside from the ""challenge"" levels, there is very little replayabaility.  PvZ lets you go through the game on a harder difficulty, has a massive number of mini-games, and even has the crazy Zen-garden.  This game has the 40 or so single player levels, and then a few challenges that are just like levels you play in the single player game.I've thoroughly enjoyed this game.  I hope you're able to find it at a reasonable price and enjoy it as well.			"

												This is by no means a bad game, its just unfortunate that there is little balance in the game. At certain points in the game, veteran mode feels impossible, and with veteran off it feels like a childs game. Most of the game boils down to you frantically clicking to win. If you want a hectic tower defense thats really interactive where you need to click something every second to win, you'll like this game. Don't buy it though if you enjoy normal Tower Defense games where you build, upgrade your towers, and sit back and watch things play out.			"

												It's fun, it reminds me of plants vs zombies. The towers and mobs are more boring than that, the general pace of the game is also slower because the towers are pretty weak. I got it in a humble bundle and i think it's fun solely because of that, I'd buy it when it's under 5 euros or something. It's a nice pastime though.			"

												This is a pleasant entry into the tower defense genre. Nice graphics. Nice gameplay.The style reminds me a little of the cute style of Plants and Zombies.Don't expect too much mileage out of this game though. After a while, it does not have enough content to keep you interested for long.			"

												Reminds me of trying to drink a 30 pack of your favorite beer. The first 10 levels or so are fun and enjoyable, just like the first 10 beers at a party. And then something happens and the game just stops being fun and becomes annoying, just like the 12th-20th beer at a party. Then you hit that wall and just wonder what's the point, like trying to consume that 30th beer so you do not have a lone survivor to haul home and be lonely in your fridge.Not saying to buy it, but not saying don't buy it. It is fun at first and then it changes, like the devil herself is in control.			"

												Fun tower defense/time management game. A bit too much of a click fest for me, but that's probably because I'm not that good at that part of the game.Certainly challenging enough, after the first approximately ten levels I had to adjust the difficulty from veteran to normal.Well worth the money, lots of levels and some fun bonus levels.

												I picked up this game because it was a cheap tower defense with positive reviews.  It feel very similar to Plants vs Zombies.  They use some of the same mechanics with their defense units.  It's more interactive but I don't really know if that add or takes away from the game play.  That said, this game isn't nearly as good ad PvZ.I picked it up cheap and my kids enjoyed watching me play it.  I think it's worth playing.			"

												(07/10) - Nicely ExecutedIt is a great TD, tho my standarts for that genre are sky-high, as it´s one of my favourite.It has brilliant ideas of how to mix things up a little, looks very nice and has good designs meaning you can´t rely on building the same tower against every enemy and sit back.For everyone not being a super-fan of this genre: stop reading here and buy this game if you are interested in TD´s. For everyone else:The reason why i can´t recommend it is it´s difficulty. There are two modes: non-veteran and veteran.I played on veteran ofcourse, as i think TD´s are usually way too easy and still have no problems in them while most people scream out loud that they can´t beat it.Well, my part i guess...I´m not saying it´s unbeatable, but it is so rediciulously hard to save all the cows (lives), i´ve never seen anything like it.After (only!!!) 1/4 of the story, it get´s from having-to-play-a-level-twice-to-save-all-cows to impossible. I tried the same level over 100 times, using all strategies i could imagine with the towers i unlocked till then and i didn´t even come close to my goal.As i said, it´s a really nice TD, but if you´re not looking for antoher pre-patch inferno of diablo 3, i´d advice to play another TD...

												It's a fun tower defense game, similar to Plants vs. Zombies.Basically you have to set up various kinds of towers and traps to defend against various kinds of Martian invaders.Early in the game you get a ""zapper"" which lets you attack the Martians directly, or overcharge your towers, or respond to various obstacles that will pop up. For example on the winter levels your towers will slowly start to freeze which will cause them to shut down. So you have to take your zapper and periodically knock the ice off them to keep them functional.So the zapper actually makes this game superior to tower defense games in which you only have towers -- like iBomber defense. In iBomber Defense there are times when you're just sitting around with nothing to do after you've set up all your towers. In this game there are constant threats that need to be handled with your zapper, so there are no ""boring"" lets-wait-for-this-wave-to-finish sections.			"

												There isn't a great deal going on with this one, it's your standard tower defense with an alien/cow kidnapping conspiracy thrown in for a plot. The mechanics are solid and it's a good looking game with at least a attempt at humor thrown in. I don't think I'd recommend it at full price, it's no Orcs Must Die, but if you find it on sale it's ok.			"

												A nice Tower Defense game with a relative funny setting and some nice ideas.It is quite easy and nothing for the ""hardcore tower defense experts"" around us but rather aimed at children and ""casual"" players.The current 8 bucks price is a bit high though, it should be down to 4,99 or less already.
