												If you're a fan of match 3 games and is looking for a little twist in your usual gameplay, this game might seem appealing to you. It'll probably be fun for the first couple of minutes, while you still think there's more to the game than it seems, but then you'll soon find out that there isn't.You have 4 heroes on the left side of the screen, and colored runes come scrolling towards them (with each color representing a hero or the enemy). If an enemy rune hits the end of the line, the hero on that line gets damaged. If all your heroes die, it's game over.At this point you'll think that each level will have something different besides an increasingly rune-cluttered group of lines that scrolls faster and faster, but nope, that's it. And while it's fun for a bit, the lack of variation gradually becomes very boring. There is no story, no interesting quests or goals, just few very ""meh"" achievements.To make matters worse, the thing is incredibly buggy, specially on level transitions. Pausing is a dangerous choice as chances are that the game will bug instead of really pausing, leaving you stuck in a weird limbo in which you can't do anything but see your heroes dying, which can be very frustrating if you've been playing for a while. You'll then have to start from 0, and hope not to get caught in a bug again.The controls are at times a little wobbly, giving the impression that the game was designed for a touch screen and poorly ported to the PC. So at times things won't scroll as they should, and you'll fail to drag runes around, very often leading to death.If you're looking for a fast and mindlessly repetitive buggy match 3 game, however, you've found it.

												Dungeon Hearts is a match-3/RPG crossover that fails under its own ambitions of trying to recreate the wheel. It's bursting at the seams with original mechanics and a fresh take on match-3 games, but seemingly forgot to test if any of the ideas it presents actually add anything to the experience or makes for a game that's worth playing. It continually tries too hard to insert itself as something unique in a broad spectrum of derivative peers, that it forgets that the reason those games bare such a resemblance to each other is because the formula works, leaving it standing awkwardly on the sidelines like an odd kid who has been ostracized at his own party.Broken down into its simplest elements, Dungeon Hearts plays like a combination of Collapse and Guitar Hero. Colored gems come horizontally across the screen toward your characters, and you must combine three like colored gems to form a power gem that allows you to clear away skulls which hurt your character if they make it all the way across. This basic system is continually and rapidly expanded as you play, with unique levels for your four characters, blocks that can't be moved, skulls that take multiple hits to clear away, and so on and so forth. It all combines to make for a game that starts out simply enough but quickly becomes entirely and utterly overwhelming. There begins to be so much constantly happening on screen, that it's nigh impossible to begin to keep up.I kept hoping that maybe if I just played another round or two Dungeon Hearts would finally click for me, but the longer I stuck with it the more annoyed I became at its cumbersome controls and incessant need to constantly throw more at you than you can handle. There are undoubtedly some really neat ideas hidden in Dungeon Hearts that could potentially be spun out into a better game, but what Cube Roots has done with them feels more like they threw everything at the wall hoping something would stick, than careful and deliberate design. And even then it almost works, which makes the colossal waste of a game that it turned out to be all the more disappointing.			"

												No.  Just no.  This is nothing but a port of a mobile game.  It may work well with a touch screen, but with a mouse it just sucks.  The mouse often doesn't respond as you want it to.  For instance, you have to drag the runes or whatever around to place them by matching runes.  This is sometimes seen as a click.  The same goes for when you are trying to click.  It sometimes responds as if you are dragging.  You are definitely going to run into problems once the game speeds up.  Just a mess.  Game looked promising and for .74 I thought it was going to be a great bargain.  Nope.			"

												It would have been a good game if the quality was important for the developer. Forum are filled with bug reports since the day it came out. Some people can't run the game at all, achievements are not unlockable for a lot of users, graphics / sound is broken ... nearly everything you can think of. Having bugs is inevitable but the lack of communication / support only shows that the developer cares more about creating a sequel (money) than fixing bugs (quality).It heavily feels like this game is designed for a touch screen and that the PC port was done in a hurry as far as controls are concerned.If I overlook all the bugs and only focus on the game I would simply say this:  it`s extremely repetitive as you only do one fight after another, no ""world"" / ""story"" to discover, nothing. It's a mindless loop of fights from start to finish. Buying it is like rolling dice, it might runs on your system if your lucky enough.			"

												for once, i don't think I agree with the negative reviews on steam. Although it is entirely possible that I came into this expecting a wreck when I saw most of the negative reviews. I feel like it's a pretty decent match 3 game. It tries to do something a little different and it feels very fast paced and keeps you on your toes. I weirdly like the music fairly good amount and it is satisfying to get big huge combos and chains on enemies. For 3 bucks (and I know it goes on sale waaaaaaaaay cheaper) I think it's worth it if you like simple stupid match-3 games. Plus the cards are worth like 40 cents which is what this game goes on sale for anyway toodon't expect any deep gameplay from a match 3 game for 3 bucks obviously though			"

												Game ranges from stupidly easy to completely unfair based on the random number generator.  While the match 3 mechanic is mixed and matched in a number of very interesting ways, the game goes on for far too long without adding anything to the player's ability list.  Match that with a poor attempt at using an in-game currency for character passive ability unlocking to generate replay value and you've got a poor player experience all around.			"

I have lots of frustration with ""dropped clicks"" where I try and click and drag a block but it doesn't register. This really hurts later on where things get quicker and more hectic. Game also doesn't play with with dual monitors on Linux.

												Alright match 3 style game. I played for a few hours and thats all I need. Shapes scroll from right to left on screen and you need to move them around to make a match of 3 to form a jewel which you use to attack the monsters. After killing each boss you hav a match 3 of each color to level up the character of that color. I certain levels characters will unlock a power you can build up for to use. I felt like this game would be a lot better suited on a phone or tablet. I got annoyed and frustrated trying to move shapes sometimes while they scrolled by. I would click on them but just barely miss I guess and not pick the shape up to move it. This happened quite often and would screw up trying to match them. Not a game I would recommend to my friends.			"

												With the proper input method, Dungeon Hearts might not be a bad experience. The game is played by matching three like-colored objects to build attacks that are used against a random selection of monsters. Sliding objects around the playing field is cumbersome and often unresponsive with mouse controls. I can’t play more than a few rounds before my wrist starts begging for relief. Chaining together attacks is especially difficult. I was constantly scrambling to clear out poison blocks with no time to consider any sort of strategy. It is rather rewarding to pull off a massive combo, but all of mine were complete accidents. The RPG elements in Dungeon Hearts are all fluff. I like the idea of incorporating an upgrade system into this type of puzzle game, but it wasn’t implemented in a very effective or interesting manner. You gain experience points by playing a mini game between battles, and your characters automatically level up to be stronger and have more special moves. I would have felt like I had greater influence over the game if there had been a simple skills tree. Dungeon Hearts isn’t terrible, it just doesn’t seem to belong on PC.			"

												A frustratingly action-packed take on the 'match-3' genre.Pro:- Replayability ( Upgrades ; Gameplay ; Modes such as Endless )- Graphics ( Style ; Bright ; ColorBlind option )- Intensity ( Dificulty gradually ramps up )- Low requirementsCon:- Control ( Game is obviously meant for a touch-screen ; 'Swipes' don't register well with a mouse ; Dragged items get stuck on others )- Strategies ( Repeat: Save up Red's and Green's abilities and decimate a boss fight before they can use specials )The game itself is an absolutely charming and solid experiance. The Pros outweigh the Cons - because the cons actually build up the frustration and relief that any action game should acquire.Dungeon Hearts is fun! It is perfect for anyone utilizing a touch-screen PC, but for those of you without one? Try it before you buy it, because controlling the game with the mouse is an absolute pain.			"

												If I told you that Dungeon Hearts was a match-3 puzzle game, RPG hybrid, would you dismiss it as another Puzzle Quest clone? Well, it is, but you shouldn't, because it isn't. Let me explain...Dungeon Hearts puts you in control of a party of four adventurers who rush headlong from one battle to the next in an unquenchable thirst for glory that doesn't end until they're all dead. As the adventures race in place and the world scrolls past them, monsters appear in a steady stream from the other side of the screen. Defeat one, the next appears, and the battle begins anew.During battles, which account for about 99% of the gameplay, four lines are drawn horizontally across the screen, each aligned with one of the adventurers. Colored stones scroll along these lines, fate lines as the game calls them, from the right edge of the screen and make their way to the adventurers on the left. Using the mouse you need to drag these stones to place three of them of the same color together either horizontally or vertically. When you do they combine to form a gem that will damage the monster when double-clicked. The gem will also trigger other gems aligned with it either horizontally or vertically to explode, and the more gems in the chain reaction, the more damage is done to the monster. Include gems of different colors in the chain and you'll score even more bonus damage. The gems are also used to trigger the other types of icons that travel down the fate lines. Skulls represent the monster's attacks, and if they're not eliminated before they reach the end of a line they'll damage the adventurer that they hit. Spell and buff icons, for both the party and the monster, are also triggered or destroyed by the gems. If an adventurer dies during a battle, the corresponding colored stones become grayed over and can no longer be used to build gems. This gives you fewer opportunities to make gems, takes away some combos, and puts more obstacles on the fate lines. If you manage to win the battle, the adventurer will be revived for the next. If you lose all four in a battle, then it's game over. Defeat a monster and you'll get to play a fast-paced version of the game in which a tightly packed run of colored stars make their way down the fate lines. Matching three of the same color will level-up the corresponding adventurer, one level per every three stars matched. The game's fantasy theme and level-up bonus levels are the extent of its tie to RPGs, and it's far more of a puzzle game than it is an RPG. The background graphics are colorful and evoke memories of JRPGs of a console generation gone by, but you have to stay so focused on the fast-moving fate lines that you won't really be able to enjoy them. There's no persistence between games, so after your party is all dead you'll begin the next game from the beginning with a group of level one adventurers. And if there was any doubt left about the game's primary nature, at the end of a game you're given a score.So it's not much of an RPG - no big deal as long as the puzzle part's fun, right? Well, Dungeon Hearts is a fun puzzle game, but also one that's more geared to those with quick reflexes than those who want to carefully setup and execute their gem combos. The game is fast moving and will keep you so focused that you won't be aware that a game can last twenty minutes or more unless you check a clock (luckily, the game will let you pick up where you left off if you need to leave early). My biggest complaint with the game comes from the controls, specifically that the mouse has a tendency to drop a stone as you try to move it around another stone, particular when you 're trying to turn a corner around another stone.Dungeon Hearts is a fun and challenging puzzle game, but I can see it disappointing gamers looking for more of an RPG element in the game or those who will find that the fate lines move too fast for their tastes. It's certainly the kind of puzzle game you'll come back to now and again. Since it's an indie title and can be had for a relatively low price, it's easy to recommend adding this to your game library.Recommended "

												IF YOU LIKE ARCADE-PUZZLE GAMES WITH HINTS OF RPG MECHANICS BUY THIS GAME     Dungeon Hearts is a high octane puzzle games with a simple premise of matching colors. This concept is dragged in every single possible direction; it steadily develops as the game continues. Three circles make a diamond, which allows one of the 4 color-coded heroes to attack. Three diamonds make a super charged attack that clears the que. Every time a new type of puzzle piece is introduced the game stops to inform you of what it does. The 4 party members have appealing designs with their own set of subtle passive abilities and stylish super techniques. The red knight uses timed mouse clicks to deal damage, they yellow mage manipulates the que and puzzle pieces, the blue wizard uses rapid mouse clicks to heal and protect the other team members, and the green archer uses skill shots akin to M.O.B.A’s to inflict status ailments. A beautiful aspect of this game is the fact that it is packaged with multiple sound-tracks; each carrying their own theme. Dungeon Hearts is the highest quality puzzle game at its very cheap price range. The title is well done and offers plenty of re-play value. "

												I saw this game on the humblestore site for 50 cents so I figured I'd pick it up. At first I thought it would be a good game for my mom to play, since she's taken a recent interest in casual gaming, but I wanted to test it out first. It's actually a decent challenge, it took me a few tries to get to the final boss and even then I couldn't beat it (each time you fail you have to start over from the first level). It's not the greatest puzzle game and it definitely has some problems, for example you have to get through the game and fail in order to gain XP for the permanent upgrades, but even getting to the boss doesn't get you enough for the most basic ones. I think my biggest gripe is that the save and quit feature only works until you close the game out, since there's no actual save feature. But, for 50 cents it's given me a good enough value to recommend it.			"

												I'm not saying this is the worst game I've ever played, but I AM saying that I have never ever hated a game quite this much. The so called ""RPG element"" is pretty much totally pointless, and I would say that it's not a puzzle game at all, since the only difficulty in the game is that you will be stressed out and not be able to make your moves in time - the moves themselves are more or less obvious. So, this is more of a reaction game. Which I guess could be fun if you're into that, but they just keep upping the speed AND throw in more and more blocks that are in the way of your moves. That is the only way they are ""controlling"" the difficulty. Combine this with controls that don't always understand that you want to drag the thing you are click-and-dragging (I'm guessing it's a sub-optimal touchscreen port) and you have a game that is all about frustration and not at all about having a good time. Buy this game if you like to be stressed out without having fun, if you love being pointlessly frustrated, or if you would like to try how it feels to get a cramp in your hand. Everybody else, stay away if you value your sanity.			"

												Considering that I enjoyed 10,000,000 to a fair degree, I had reasonably high expectations when I heard Dungeon Hearts was a mixture of puzzle and role playing games as well. Much to my disappointment, I instead found myself bored to death within 20 minutes of starting. My biggest gripe with Dungeon Hearts overall is that the RPG elements feel very tacked-on and unnecessary. Character skills are poorly explained and feel clumsy to use due to generally poor interface design. Above all, there's very little feeling of actual progression and very little done to break the general monotony of the gameplay. Every enemy is fought in more or less the exact same manner - form attacks by combining 3 of the same color piece, move the attack gem onto a line that contains an enemy attack gem, and click. Repeat ad infinitum. Combined with the total lack of story,  the ""epic journey"" feels like little more than a slight occasional change in backdrop scenery. When you strip away the façade of supposed RPG gameplay in Dungeon Hearts, what remains is the puzzle game aspects. Unfortunately, as stated before, the puzzle game core is incredibly repetitive and comes with a click-and-drag system that feels incredibly choppy and awkward to use. In the end, the only redeeming factor to be found is the surprisingly solid soundtrack.In summary, Dungeon Hearts pretends to be a unique blend of the classic ""match-3"" puzzle type game and an RPG, but at the end of the day, the RPG aspects are little more than a shallow veneer coating an even shallower game.

												I wanted to like this game- I usually like variations of match games particularly with an RPG aspect, but this one was just too frantic for me. Even on normal, its an endless stream of split second dragging where precision must be maintained. I may have forgave it a little if there was a break, but it just keeps endlessly going until you die which gets stressful quickly. There needs to at least be level breaks to pause and mess with your characters.This game probably would be better on a touch-screen interface rather than mouse so you could have faster input.It also didn't run correctly on my computer- it would run, but it was at an incorrect screen size so that the edges were all cropped, and I couldn't figure out a way to fix it.

A few moneters, mini bosses, and the ""DarkOne"" at the end to kill, once you beat the game you unlock new music to listen too. 14 achievments to unlock to keep you busy for a while. There is an easy and hard mode to give you some challenge. I recomend getting this game if you are into puzzle games like bejeweled.			"

												While I enjoy the concepts a lot I don't think this game is meant for a pc release, or even a console one.  I see now that there is   a version for touch devices and I think that's where it belongs.  I say this because a majority of the gameplay involves moving different colored blocks around a DDR/Guitar Hero-esque track.  You only have a limited time to make matchs (before they hit the end) and it gets very hectic very quickly.  Mouse controls just don't work very well for this, and I think a touch device would work better.Anyway, the gameplay is cool and the ideas are unique enough that although they don't really work that well in practice, I recommend checking out Dungeon Hearts just to see this gameplay.  I really want to get good at it but it's god damned hard, and I think the difficulty comes largely from the limited means by which we can play it.Oh, the basic idea is to order colors together before they reach the end.  You want to stop enemy attacks from getting off while building up your own combos via hitting multiples of s color.  By hitting your colors you do damage to an enemy.  Your team's skills aren't the best explained in game, so that's annoying, but yeah.			"

												Wayyy too difficult, even on Easy! D; It looks harmless enough, match jewels up just like Bejeweled, but with an RPG twist, right? I'm not the best gamer out there, but I can't even beat the first mini-boss in this game no matter how hard I try! And if you look at the achievement statistics, most other people who have the game haven't beat it either! And sometimes after using a special attack, there's no space left to move jewels, which is really sucky since we have to attack manually, but the monsters can attack whenever we let a single jewel slip by. I could go on and on, but TL;DR version is that this deceivingly cute game simply isn't worth the frustration. :/			"

												It seems like it would be fun, and maybe using a touchscreen it would. An iPad would probably be a great way to play this game, but not with a mouse. Not to mention there were so many times I clicked to move one of the pieces and it wouldn't move. If you weren't fighting against time to get them into place it would be fine, but you are and once those pieces hit the left side, they're gone. Sure there are special abilities you can use after some time, but who's got time to do that? I certainly couldn't seem to afford the time to move my mouse away from the main area for long enough to click on them, not to mention they're all the way at the bottom of the screen, not right where I would need them to be: At my literal fingertips (ya know, press button 1 or 2, or something else. Add in the 'instructions' for what each ability does, shows up when you click the ability, and lasts for what seems like a second and a half. The game has a terrible problem with wording, having to read things a couple times to get what it's trying to tell you, it's just not very clear.			"

												There needs to be a so-so maybe button.  It's a fun game with great music and cute graffics, but the controls can be unresponsive.  Sometimes I grab a peice and go to move it, but the game doesn't register and I have to click a few times.  By that time the moment has passed and I need to get a new combo going.  Some times I'll go to move a crystal to make a combo and accidently activate it, ruining my set up. If the control issues can be resolved, I'd recommend it, but for now, I'm Removing Local Content.

												Was really looking forward to this game, then I started playing it.... Normally I dont have a problem with ""ports"" but this game just really doesn't work without a touch screen.  You need a touch screen, or the developers need to 1) slow it down, 2) make your mouse scroll with the rest of the board.  Until then its just a very poorly implemented port.  -edit- #3, you can see that its a port in the incredibly shallow ""experience"" awarded, and the extremely high cost of ""upgrades"" that do incredibly little in the overall game.

												Despite its cute graphics and bouncy music, this is a tough-as-nails game: even on the easiest difficulty level, you'll quickly find yourself hard-pressed to keep up with the tide of blocks being thrown at your heroes... But if you want even a chance at winning, you'd better! The game gets monumentally more difficult if you let even a single status effect block through: At best, one of your heroes will 'just' bleed health (possibly healing the enemy at the same time) - at worst, your 'fateline' will get spammed with enemy blocks or start moving even faster.You’ve got 4 heroes (fighter, mage, healer, and archer), each with their own health bar, and the game only officially ends if all heroes fall. However, realistically, if you lose even one hero you’re going to be toast, since not only will you not be able to use that hero’s abilities, but all of the blocks that would normally be in that heroes color will also be unusable – making it that much harder to clear oncoming enemy blocks. Ultimately, the game is an exhausting experience. Although each enemy has a different feel – throwing different status blocks at you and typically having different mixes of blocks - each fight boils down to doing the same thing, just at faster and faster speeds; and you're forced to fight far too many enemies before you finally hit the final boss. The ever increasing speed also works against the game – early on, you have the time to plan ahead, moving your blocks into position to get big combo attacks. These are not just flashy, but they also inflict much more damage on the enemy, allowing you to finish the fight faster. Later fights, however, where the enemies have more hit points and nastier attacks, you’ll find yourself desperately throwing out single attacks just to keep enemy blocks from raining down on your heroes, which means that the fights seem to take forever.It’s a cheap game, and it goes on sale frequently, so it’s not hard to get your money’s worth (especially since the game has cards you can sell to make it even cheaper.) However, is it fun?I managed to beat the game on easy, and will be calling this game complete. I feel absolutely no motivation to try to beat the game on normal or hard… so take that as you will.

												Where to begin. If I wanted to treat this game punitively, I'd say it takes the standard Final Fantasy team line-up (warrior, black mage, white mage, archer) and they've thrown in a puzzle game). I can't be that punitive. This game has complexity, and depth you'd struggle to find in some of puzzle games you'd immediately think of.You have four lines across the screen, gems will slide towards you, if they reach the end, they disappear. If you move 3 of the same colour in any pattern except diagonally, you can make an attack gem. Which, when clicked, will attack the enemy you are fighting. The enemy has their own gems too, if you can't move them quick enough, or can't use your attacks to remove them from the bar, they will attack your characters and drain their health.And I'm only getting starting. Characters level up between runs, learn abilities, monsters, mini-bosses, runes that make the game move faster, or randomly freeze different runes, or make you take more damage.Oh, one thing I didn't mention. This game is tough. It starts deceptively simple, but it works through it's mechanics like Neil DeGrasse Tyson blows your mind.It has different modes of play, an easy to grasp tutorial level, and a very FF-esque art style (think DS remake FF games).The only thing I can even think to ping this game for, is the soundtrack is incredbily repetitive. You might do better to listen to your own tracks and turn the music off entirely.The best part? This game costs under a dollar. Seriously, less than a small fries from McDonalds. If you've been looking for a rich, deep, and challenging puzzle game. I implore you, pick this up. You will have an absolute blast.			"

												I like puzzle games quite a bit, so on the surface Dungeon Hearts looks like it would fit pretty well for me in that Candy Crush/Bejeweled corner of my game library.  Heck, even the anime characters don't even phase me that much.  They're pretty harmless and fairly low key as far as such characters go.  The thing that landed Dungeon Hearts is the game play. The puzzle style of Dungeon Hearts is not hard to figure out.  In theory, it's actually a pretty decent puzzle system.  Match 3 or more colors to clear gems off the moving game board, each color representing a different character who then does damage to your enemy.  Combine gems of different colors on different levels, double your attack score!  My frustrations come mostly from my self;  I just don't feel fast enough to be any good at the game. The learning curve starts out simple enough, but it doesn't take long before you're in the full mix of battle and for me, I started to fumble my gems very quickly. This led to frustration, which led to resentment towards a game I wanted to be casual and ultimately lead to it's being removed from the hard drive. I'ts not a bad game by any means, it's just not for me.			"

												Dungeon Hearts really is able to capture my attention.A seemingly simple turn based RPG with a twist, yet very fun. If you have played Magical Drop or pattern-matching games, you'll be familiar with this one. You need to match tiles, and explode them to do damage to enemies. Chain more special tiles to do moar damage. Yes, reflex and quick coordination are necessities to progress.Your team consists of four characters, each has personal special attacks and abilities that you can invoke after reaching certain levels. Enemies can also attack you using their special moves, poison or hex that weakens your char. That's it, RPG style.Graphic is great and can please my eyes. I'm kinda selective when it comes to graphic quality, but hey for this one I don't even complain. Not hi-tech like that of Diablo 3, but it does its job. Background graphic is kinda boring and repetitive, but during battles who gives a damn looking at background?Soundtrack is included, much to my joy! And what's more, they're not forgettable. These OSTs are your typical RPGs' OST, fast paced and intense. Bosses' OSTs are even more awesome. My personal fav: Troublesome Foe.Normal campaign has 3 difficulty levels. If you want challenge, start no less than normal. Hard is for experienced players. What's more, if you've beaten the game and want more, we have Endless mode.Overall, you can't go wrong buying the game. Someone mentioned this is optimized for mobile devices, but who cares? The Developer is active and listening to suggestions, worth every penny (and it's cheap!).			"

												Dungeon Hearts is a decent-enough cross between a RPG, a rhythm game, and a puzzler--but your patience may be tested by the ridiculous hoops this game puts you through. All modes of this game are a gauntlet where, in short order, you will find yourself swarmed by negative icons, straining to keep up with the pace. You earn a pittance of EXP during any of the modes, making progress a total chore. Also, for a musical game, there aren't many great tunes.The visuals are charming enough, and there is promise with this game's Match-3 setup. It's also nice how every character can affect battles in different ways, from the warrior dealing direct damage to enemies to the ranger dealing status ailments. Consider this game--provided it's on sale.			"

												This game feels like it was designed and intended for a touchscreen interface.  And probably with that setup it's a fast-paced, fun, and engaging game.  But I played it with keyboard and mouse on a desktop computer, and in that more traditional situation it felt like playing the worst level of Bejeweled quest mode imaginable.  Everything has a short and punishing time constraint, including collecting XP to level up after a level (or failing to do so!).  The basic gameplay is simplistic and boring -- yet actions that should be the simplest, easiest, and most basic fundamentals of the game are awkward.  Difficulty comes from bad ergonomics, not from a true skill requirement.  There is a lot of interesting complexity to explore, but it's set up to remove rewards for actions several steps from good play, so even the best parts of the game design make the experience less compelling.

												Ok so people might be giving this a bad review but this game isn't meant to be played for long periods of time, which so people who bought this game have which might show.Since this game may have been ported over from a mobile device app it still is fun to play even for just 10-15mins. Even though the mouse draging in the game might be a bit annoying for some, I found it fun and some what quite interesting to play with as it keeps you going keeps you thinking too (well at least for me it did).For the price you pay (even though i paid for it when it was £0.49) you shouldn't expect all singing all dancing game for such a small price. Sure the GFX of the game isn't in a 1920x1080 or higher res for the average user but still feeling like a game people shouldn't mark down so harshly (in my opinion).If you want to test you mouse pointing skills or improve how fast you can do this (depends on what you want to do) then this game is ideal for the once a day play sort of idea. I might be talking rubish for some but thats what I see in this game. Nothing too much, just straight play of the mouse and see your reaction are to the movements of your mouse. Great game and I spent 21mins on my first go and enjoyed it.Recommended for people who just want to test their skills on moving objects at fast pace with just the mouse as for those who prefer to use WASD (if thats how you would prefer) then its not intended for that use.10/10 I probs being playing this once a day to keep me going :DDDD			"

												Dungeon Hearts really is able to capture my attention.A seemingly simple turn based RPG with a twist, yet very fun. If you have played Magical Drop or pattern-matching games, you'll be familiar with this one. You need to match tiles, and explode them to do damage to enemies. Chain more special tiles to do moar damage. Yes, reflex and quick coordination are necessities to progress.Your team consists of four characters, each has personal special attacks and abilities that you can invoke after reaching certain levels. Enemies can also attack you using their special moves, poison or hex that weakens your char. That's it, RPG style.Graphic is great and can please my eyes. I'm kinda selective when it comes to graphic quality, but hey for this one I don't even complain. Not hi-tech like that of Diablo 3, but it does its job. Background graphic is kinda boring and repetitive, but during battles who gives a damn looking at background?Soundtrack is included, much to my joy! And what's more, they're not forgettable. These OSTs are your typical RPGs' OST, fast paced and intense. Bosses' OSTs are even more awesome. My personal fav: Troublesome Foe.Normal campaign has 3 difficulty levels. If you want challenge, start no less than normal. Hard is for experienced players. What's more, if you've beaten the game and want more, we have Endless mode.Overall, you can't go wrong buying the game. Someone mentioned this is optimized for mobile devices, but who cares? The Developer is active and listening to suggestions, worth every penny (and it's cheap!).			"

												Insanely difficult match 3 game. Dark Souls is nothing with this. Controls are unresponsive sometimes where every second is important and makes the game less enjoyable. I have to admit that the soundtrack is amazing, like you would expect in a fairy tale. Again, the controls are unresponsive especially if you want to remove the unecessary blocks makes the game more hectical than ever. There is no info popping up that the powerups are ready. Achievements dont work either i guess the developer left the game here.			"

												Do I dislike this game? No. Can I recommend this game? No.This is one of those many instances where there is a great idea, with bad execution. If this was simply a ""match three"" type of game, mixed with combat I don't think the game would be so bad. It's the ""rythm game"" type of structure where everything is flying across the screen that ruins the gameplay. Not only are you trying to manage your own attacks and combos but juggling or preventing your enemies attacks make this a chore. If the game speed could be slowed maybe 25% or more, this would be a more enjoyable experience. I've beaten the game on all 3 difficulties and can't say I've had more than an ""okay"" time playing it. Again, the speed of the game is the biggest issue. It might be okay for touch-screen devices but it is not good for a standard mouse and keyboard PC.As a final note - I will say that getting the soundtrack with the game is worth the asking price. The soundtrack is pretty fantastic. (It's hiding in your game's folder if you're not aware).			"

												Well, I feel ripped off, and I only paid like a dollar or so. I cannot stress this enough, but if you lose, you start the entire game over with no progress kept. None. You don't have unlocked ships like in FTL, and you don't keep stats/money/equipment like in Rogue Legacy. You can't just learn like in FTL or get more upgrades like in Rogue Legacy. In this ""roguelike,"" colored pieces go whizzing by and there is no stopping. Even if you win a battle, whether or not you -get- to level up is based on more puzzle pieces moving by. If your reflexes aren't quick enough, you're royally screwed and will lose, never making any progress. Unless you win the game, you have to start over completely. I'm happier with $60 purchases that turned out to be disappointments than I am with this game I paid less than $2 for. Avoid at all costs unless you have really fast reflexes.			"

												It's a cute combination of match 3 and RPG. Your four characters are running through a dungeon and must match scrolling colours to generate strikers, which are then used to attack the enemy.It's a little too frantic for my taste: the game scrolls by quite quickly, even on easy mode (am I playing on easy mode? The game isn't really clear on that...). I would prefer an extreme casual mode so I can at least beat the game. The buttons aren't clear if you've selected that mode, or it's the next one available. I would like a quit option so if you feel like starting over on the easy stuff, you don't have to wait and watch your characters die first. Having to generate the strikers feels like an extra clicky step that frustrates me.There are plenty of flaws. But for $3, it's worth the look and see. Buy it, try it, then put it away when your wrist hurts too much.			"

												I didn't think much of it at first, but I actually enjoyed this game.  It's a little more complicated and strategic than you might expect.Since people are actually looking at this review, I figured I'd update it.  This game is simple, and delivers as advertised.  To clarify, it's a match-em game with straightforward mechanics, but it's difficult to optimize the skills you're allotted and the matches you need to make.  I suppose it feels almost a bit like a bullet hell match-em.As you can tell, I didn't spend much time on this game because it's not really my cup of tea, but it's a cute little time waster and it would require an inhuman amount of focus and reflex to be ""perfect"" at it.  It's a great challenge.			"

												Whilst the game is fast and nippy, and the concept is good, this game lends itself well to consoles and computers which have a touch-screen interface. Trying to play this game using a mouse or touchpad is very frustrating and repeatedly means mis-clicking as you try to keep up with the fatestream. As such, I am not recommending this game, for that purpose. I would recommend it if you were intending to run it on a tablet, or phone, or similar device with touch-screen. Otherwise, stay clear of this game.			"

												Whether you are a fan of fast-paced, challenging puzzle games or an old-school RPG fan, Dungeon Hearts' charm will rub off on you. And if you are a fan of both of those things, you won't even mind its shortcomings, in time.Long story short, Dungeon Hearts is a viciously difficult match-three puzzle game that loosely resembles RPG battle mechanics. And while it hints at other RPG elements such as questing, leveling up, and story progression, it does not truly offer them in any real way.			"

Higher levels throw other things into the mix, such as skulls and curses. 6/10			"

												I had this game on the iPad for quite awhile so it was simple transitioning to the PC version knowing all the mechanics and psuedo-strategies. Which is probably why I got half of the achievements so quickly within the first hour of playing the game, hehe.Now, where to begin... This game is no ordinary RPG, it's really a mix of somewhat-RPG mechanics and a constant score attack. Even during the leveling portions you're required to be matching tokens all the time, and the best advice is to stay on top of everything. Like any match-3 game, match 3 regular tokens of the same color to create an attack token that when tapped, will do an attack with that hero. The player can store these tokens by sliding them along the constant stream of tokens that fly past, and you can accumulate them to do huge combos. These attack tokens are more for just attacking however, as they also remove any gray tokens and regular tokens of their color in their current column and row thereby eliminating the chances of the enemy being able to attack the player's heroes. Enemy tokens can even be moved as well, allowing the player to set up combos while removing the enemy's method of attack. While the levels start off easy and slow, the game picks up in pace and sets more roadblocks as the game progresses through status aliments and enemy tokens that require multiple hits to get rid of. Enemies also do increasing damage, and hits become nearly fatal in the last 5 levels. The enemy variety is based on random elements, and each has their own set of hexes and even altering the speed of how fast the tokens come at the player.The graphics and music fit the game very well, and the soundtracks are amazing that I'm sometimes coming back to the game just to hear the music. Its streamlined well, and makes progression eminent throughout the levels.My only qualm about this game is how the mouse/finger can be inaccurate in moving tokens due to how the Fatestream is continously moving, but then the game wouldn't be hard if it wasn't that way. Definitely a recommend.			"

												A swiping/tapping match-3 game where matches equate to attacks in classic RPG battles. The concept of having a party of characters with interesting special abilities makes this match-3 game far more interesting than others of its kind and the levelling mechanic also being a match-3 is a clever touch. The music choices and unlockables are also pleasant. Easy is exactly that. Normal is reasonable, but challenging. Hard is ludicrous. All in all, it is a briefly fun experience, but is clearly designed for the mobile systems from which it was ported.Using a mouse to swipe and tap is awkward at times and much more challenging than it would be with a touch-screen. To truly succeed on the hard difficulty and win the last achievement is an extremely hard task. You can improve your odds by purchasing upgrades which were likely micro-transactable in the mobile version because the cost to get those upgrades versus the effort required to earn that currency is very unbalanced, leading to a long grindy haul only to slightly improve meager chances at an exceedingly difficult trial - the game would have benefitted greatly from rebalancing the cost gain ratios to make it a bit more reasonable for this version. Like many such arcade-style games, chances of success are highly based on random number generation as a few badly placed pieces or of the wrong color in a few places is all that it would take to completely ruin your attempts in fairly short order.

												Requires more mouse clicking than Diablo.Stretch out those finger muscles because you'll need to use them! This match-3 game is about an hour long (there is an endless mode) but retains it's replayability through difficulty, achievements, and an in-game store in which to spend XP for constant buffs.Match 3 of the same colour to create a special tile you use to attack the enemy whilst simultaneously trying to stop the monsters tiles reaching your hero's.Relaxing for the first 10 battles, then it's a quick descent to crazy unforgiving and just plain manic battles requiring 110% focus. ✔			"

												Puzzle Hearts is a very good game. Don't dismiss it thinking that low price means it is some junk. What may appear like a rhythm rpg is actualky a match three puzzle, which feels almost like something entirely different. As you start playing and pass some easy levels you will begin seeing different shapes, new types of blocks, and ability blocks. All of this is happening with the playfield moving to the right quicker and quicker. Gameplay becomes even more fun because of the shorter time available to move your blocks, and having to decide which blocks to match. Based on that last decision you may perform any of the number special powers each of your character has. As can be seen in screenshots, each character has 3 powers fo ra total of 12 when you have all 4. Basically the premise and the gameplay are excellent.In regards to graphics and art direction, Dungeon Hearts does not impress too much. Character models are 3d cartoonish characters with large heads. They are not very impressive. Their animations are very basic and sometimes repetitive. It could be annoying or irritating. The models of enemies and their animations are much more interesting. I am not sure how many there are, but they are pretty well designed, diverse, and since they circulate and you see new ones a lot, it maintains interest. Backgrounds are great. Pretty good on the eyes, but they don't mean much contextually. there areBut all of that depends on importance you give to those things. Different for everybody.Sound is alright, and I do not have much to comment about it. Maybe one area that deserves commenting is the music. It doesn't play a big role in the game, and you do not hear a bunch of unique soundtracks. It may give that impression perhaps because the playing field looks like the screen of a sideways Guitar Hero screen. It is just techno action, somewhat generic tracks.I recommend the game if you want a very cool battle match three game, which involves rpg elements and to a lesser degree strategy. If you want to be impressed by music and fancy graphics, this game appears to never have aimed to impress us with those features.			"

												First and foremost, THIS IS MORE OF AN ACTION GAME THAN A PUZZLE GAME!I wasn't especially excited when I got this game, but I thought it could be fun. It was true, but only for something like 10 minutes. Then it gets waaaay too repetitive, even with the changes through the stages.Maybe it's just me, but the game is way too hectic. Although it doesn't seem to have any major flaws, it's just no fun. I like my puzzle games a bit more relaxed. You're just end up dragging spheres and diamonds around almost aimlessly. THAT'S BASICALLY ALL YOU'LL EVER DO, OVER AND OVER. And sometimes there's a lot going on on the board and you can't move things around properly. Also, dragging things around is not as smooth a task as it should be.Some other things that bugged me:- You're always in such a hurry that it's easy to forget you have skills to use.- Each battle takes way too much time.- You should be able to keep better track of the enemy's HP.- I didn't get the achievement for reaching stage 7, although I got the one for stage 15.I didn't like the game. But I think some people might. Would you like to play a fast-paced match-3 game with an RPG setting? Would you enjoy dragging pieces around a moving board, always in a hurry? If you answered yes to both questions, then go ahead and grab this. Otherwise, stay away like I should've done.			"

												Dungeon Hearts has a lot of game potential but some of the design choices suck the fun out of the game.There's no control on Dungeon Hearts. Unlike like other match three games like the incredible PuzzleQuest I never felt incontrol of the action. Instead I felt like I SHOULD be in control of the action. The scrolling speed is too fast for one thing. Moveing the gems is maps to the mouse click and drag style and that's horribly inaccurate. By the time I've seen how to make a match the gems are half way across the screen. And this in a game where the gems are basically free form.I'm still under an hour and a good chunk of that was spend trying to understand the tutorial which doesn't actually tell you that you can drag the gems by the way. I sat there trying to figure out how to make a match for seconds before i realized the thing wanted me to drag and just didn't say so. Yet still I feel no progression. There's no level end, there's no tally up. Just a temporary detour between enemies where I'm supposed to do what looks like a bonus round but is instead just more of the same tension and frustration of trying to see gems and then move them and then click them.I'm not a fan of the double click either. Part of the reason the game feels too fast is that you can't just match three gems and then fire them off. That oly generates the actual attack gem you need. Which you can then drag and drop and THEN click to perform an attack in the background you never notice and in the foreground that you can never care about because you're too busy trying to find your next trio.It's late I'm going to bed and I Dungeon Hearts was a terrible choice for a good night game. I have no idea where I'm supposed to stop. It isn't as if I had to run through X more enemies to complete the level. As far as I can tell there are no levels. You just run and run and run each time adding new gems to the mix. The double hit gems are bad enough. I can't make combos i can barely hit the single baddies. Unfortunately I just can't say I had any fun with the game. It looks fantastic, It runs smooth, I'm sure the soundtrack is banging but at the end of the day.. the game is something I don't want to go back to. I don't WANT to see if there is an end to the level because I don't feel my characters getting better I don't feel anything but annoyance that the gems won't go where i want them to go as fast as I need them to go without getting it and it feels unfair.

												No, this is not the game you want. The concept is ok but the controls do not work with a mouse. This game is made to play with touchscreen, i guess it would be good on a I0S platform but not on your pc... Sorry but even having paid 0.50$ for it is too much. Why sell a game that is not made to play on pc, you can make a few buck but then people  will not trust the next game you try to sell to them. Pass it or play it on ipad/iphone.

												Dungeon Hearts is a fun and face paced spin on the match 3. Where your 3 characters will fight against enemies in battles dictated by your ability to match gems. The game itself is simplistic, albeit not intuitively straightforward, as such even after playing the tutorial you will still struggle with some of the mechanics. The core concept is simple however, match up gems to initiate attacks of your characters (based on color) and counter enemy attacks/disarms etc. The game is visually stunning and although the gameplay starts off slow, it becomes horribly complex and fast paced shortly. The casual appeal of this game is great however it doesn't have much more long term value than all match 3 style games. Despite this I fully recommend this as a fun casual game to pickup and play. Kill monsters and time!			"

If you are going to play this game, you NEED to go into the bestiary first thing and look at the heroes page. The character skills are timed and the game doesn't explain how to use them, you can figure it out in the beastiary... The graphics in this game are truly charming and the game is super easy to run. In the game there are bosses that mark the end of the levels (obviously) each level throws a different obstacle in front of you, forcing you to adapt and find new ways to play. It gets really hard the further you go. The fact that it only costs $3 is great. TRY THIS GAME OUT			"

												Like it a lot!  Absolutely worth a look if you like puzzle games, and maybe even rythm games like Rockband, DDR etc.  TL;DR- I find it to be fun and addictive, in the good way.  Buy it; it's like $3.It's a fusion of your match-3 type puzzle games (Columns, Bejeweld, Candy Crush etc) with a timer aspect like the rhythm games have, mixed in special moves and an RPG aesthetic- something like an RPG version of Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo.  As with many puzzle games, the things speed up during the course of the game/match, which ups the level of excecution required- unlike just using a keyboard to move directions and a button to rearrange like your classic puzzle games (Tetris, Columns, Puyo Puyo etc), you use your mouse to move around tiles of the same color together to form gems (chargers), which allow you to destroy the tiles/runes of enemy monsters.  This gives you more freedom, but also allows for a challenge, since you have to figure out what to move where, before things scroll offscreen, resulting in either the loss of assets, or taking damage from an enemy rune which was not destroyed or moved.  From a design standpoint, there are a lot of good touches here- aesthetically it looks pretty good, (simple is good), and there are actually an additional three soundtracks, each of which you unlock by beating the game.  When a character is low on health, their color of tiles in the timeline (fatestream) will show cracks, indicating that they are on the verge of death.  The RPG aesthetic works very well.  It took me a while to realize that the various monsters seem to have different styles and skills, which was a nice thought.From a gameplay perspective, I like that there is some element of excecution allowed in the special attacks- to poison an enemy with the archer, you have to swipe your mouse in the direction of the enemy monster and hit a target.  Healing spells heal more the more frequently you click the appropriate color after choosing to use that skill, etc.  If you want to level up to gain access to skills, there's a bonus stage between battles- but this is also timed, and your ability to level up is dependant on your ability to match special star tiles before they scroll offscreen.  These things help keep players, or at least me, more actively engaged, and I dig it.			"

												Dungeon Hearts is what it was set out to be; a different match-three puzzle game with intensely strategic elements added in with the mix. For $3, I definitely can't complain, and anyone with decent hand-eye coordination and a durable trigger finger probably won't either, since the game does require both of these, especially on the higher difficulties and further in to the story mode.There are only two things I can possibly make a negative remark about. The ""XP rewards,"" which one uses to buy rudimentary upgrades for each of the 4 individual characters, are very stingy (there are tens of upgrades in the shop, and they all cost between 20-110 XP, while a full story-mode completion, which takes usually around 50 minutes, only gives you 11, 22, or 33 xp on average when finishing on easy, medium, or hard difficulty, respectively). There is also the fact that if you do the entire story without a break (saving and resuming later is possible, however), you'll probably feel like you have carpal tunnel in whichever hand you hold the mouse in for several minutes afterwards, as playing the game does require many precise clicks and rapid mouse movements.However, neither of the negatives impact the actual gameplay, which is fun, intense, and both simple and complex at the same time. Not to mention the game comes with up to five soundtracks, which are all absolutely amazing and go perfectly with the theme of the game. I personally can already tell that I'm going to get more hours of entertainment out of this than some of the games I've spent $10-20 on simply because of my love for intensive and strategic puzzle games, and anyone else with similar interests in gaming genres will probably be able to say the same. $3 well spent!

												A fun little game to aste time, though perhaps not initially designed for a PC control scheme.Bejwelled was never like this. A pretty middle of the road game so it's a YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary) situation. I will say that the control seems a little 'stilted' on PC's . Between the speed required and what not, it's rather clear to see that the devs were developing for a native touch screen interface. This isn't a bad thing and again YMMV .I suspect most while playing it will innately wish they were playing it on a tablet or touchscreen device instead of a pc  with a mouse or controller. Again, this is not a bad thing , being designed for a touch screen is not bad and it shows great thought though as said it comes across as stilted on a PC. I'd liken it to playing an RTS like Starcraft with a controller instead of mouse and keyboard,.I will say I like the concept and the challenge so far and with time one can probably overcome the control awkwardness Give it a try, you might like it			"

												Dungeon Hearts fuses the strategy and pattern matching of puzzle games with the kinetic pace of action games. Align magical runes as they flow along the Fatestream to attack, defend, and conjure magic in frenetic battles against a bestiary of fantastic creatures out to use those same runes against you. Chain together multiple attacks and unleash powerful combos or call upon each hero's special attacks to devastate your enemies to survive the twists and turns of Dungeon Heart's evolving gameplay. Strike down all that stand in your way and level up your brave warriors as each foe grows more powerful than the last, culminating in the final battle with The Dark One himself! ""Four spirits race across the land, burdened with tragedy. Within each lies the specter of guilt and fear, which The Dark One bends to his will to enact his resurrection. They realize the deception too late as the promise of salvation turns to betrayal. A black wind washes over the planes, turning all to ash. As the fallen heroes face the engulfing void, a spark of hope clings to life. When the demon peered into their hearts to learn their secrets, so too did they learn his...""			"

Fast, frantic, fun.  Dungeon Hearts is a unique take on the match-3 battle type game.  I especially like the level-up mechanic - after each battle, an additional short fatestream appears, and each match you make is a level up+partial heal for the corresponding hero of that color.  My only criticisms are that the mouse can be sometimes clumsy when you're trying frantically to move pieces around.

												Twitchy, Action-Puzzler/JRPG? Yes please!The Dark One has taken over the land, and it's up to these guys to stop him! My description for this might seem really odd, but it's actually a pretty fantastic blend of the match-3 puzzler and RPG genres.Using your party of 4 heroes [Fighter, Mage, Healer and Archer, of course], you manipulate the Fatestream [the game board] to drag, drop and click incoming hero tiles in groups of 3 to create attack tiles that you can click again to attack the enemy you're facing. Set up combos of these tiles and unmatched hero tiles to do bigass combos to deal extra damage [which means clearing a stage faster]. Once you beat a baddy, you use the same techniques to level up your characters, building your way up to skills that can affect your enemy or even the Fatestream itself, depending on the character. Keeping with the JRPG theme, your characters all have HP as well, that you have to keep an eye on. If a character gets killed, their tiles will still be generated on the board, but they'll be useless, and just get in the way of your other tiles.It's this kind of interaction between the player characters, the tiles coming at you and the board itself where this game shines. Enemy attack tiles will slide down the board toward your characters along with the color-coded hero tiles. You can counter them with your own attacks, of course, but some enemies may have higher defense than others, which means that more grey, neutral tiles are in the way of your hero tiles, making it harder to position your attacks right to break those nasty attack tiles. Or they might be particularly speedy, throwing tons of attacks your way, or they might be a mage that freezes your characters on a hit, rendering those hero tiles immobile or whatever flavor your enemies have on your run to get to the Big Bad.It can get pretty crazy in the later levels. With unlockable soundtracks and hero upgrades you can purchase, there's a lot of replay value in it too, so you can keep going back for more and appreciate the gameplay with powerful rewards.The only question I have is why in the hell is your hero information stored in the 'Beastiary'?

Fast, frantic, fun.  Dungeon Hearts is a unique take on the match-3 battle type game.  I especially like the level-up mechanic - after each battle, an additional short fatestream appears, and each match you make is a level up+partial heal for the corresponding hero of that color.  My only criticisms are that the mouse can be sometimes clumsy when you're trying frantically to move pieces around.  Also, the games should earn more XP than they currently do - as it is now, it takes a little too long to buy hero upgrades.Overall though, it's a surprisingly addictive game.

												This game is fun.The problem is that it wasn't designed to be played with a mouse. This won't become noticiable until you get to the first boss or beyond however, and I'm sure there are a few savants who can play this just fine, but unless you have a particularly gifted mouse-hand please take this into account.That said, I got it on sale, and it was worth the price, and it's probably even worth the $2.99 regular price - but - it'd be so, so, so much better if they implemented keyboard support, and replace swipes with clicks.Edit: Also, Don't plan on wiping your computer - this does not use Steam Cloud, so you'll need to figure out how and if store purchases can be saved if you ever need to format/install on another computer.

												This game, as others have said, is a mobile port that should have stayed mobile.  The screen moves too fast to be able to think and act with a mouse vs. a touch screen, and you can't slow it down.  While I do see more of the RPG elements and such being useful than many other reviewers (skills help and I can see a visible increase in ""strength""), it doesn't help if you're basically at the mercy of whatever shapes and colors the game decides to throw at you, and at times, even in low levels, it might present you with what appears to be an un-winnable situation.  (I say ""appears"" because I found it un-winnable, but perhaps someone with better skill or faster hands... or a touchscreen... could do it.)  On a similar note, the difficulty seems to spike really quickly.  You'll get through the first two or three stages no problem, but then it ramps up heavily, throwing everything it has, from poison to shielded ""strikers"" to un-movable pieces, at you all at once.  Might be good for a mobile platform, but not for PC.			"

Its fast pace and constant introduction to new boons/curses keep you on your toes, and you'll get probably a few hours of entertainment. The RPG system is interesting, as you need to ""level"" your heroes at the end of each battle with another puzzle sequence before you advance, but the appeal does kind of get jaded afterwards.

												I have one main reason not to recommend Dungeon Hearts. Controls are bad, I mean really bad. This game is fast and you must be really quick to win matches. Basically you move scrolling gems with your mouse to attack enemy (according to some rules). I constantly misplace gems and I am pretty sure that I release my mouse button in the right moment. After a while I started to hate it. To be fair, the game cost just under 3EUR, maybe someone will like it, but certainly not me.			"

												Dungeon Hearts has a great concept that's executed....fairly well. The theme is well-integrated with the mechanics, the artwork is cute, the music is catchy, and the mechanics are intuitive. But I played it for about ten minute before uninstalling it, because on a laptop it's basically unplayable. What Dungeon Hearts really, really needs is controller support. I'm not sure why it doesn't have it, because it seems a natural candidate for a controller-controlled game, but it definitely needs it. On a trackpad, and even with a mouse, it's just troublesome to actually play the game. I really like this game, but I just can't play it...which makes it pointless. I really want to recommend it based on concept and mechanics, but until it has controller support, I just can't.			"

												Kind of a bummer this game has mixed reviews, but eh it's understandable.This is a super cute match three strategy game, and I definitely enjoy it a lot. Admittedly I only really play it as a time killer, but it's kind of perfect for that (it's great on lunch breaks). I like the implementation of skills that you can unlock by leveling up, and I even like the whole 'mini game' to level your characters up. I think the pacing is pretty decent, and the character/monster designs are nice to look at. Also there's something so satisfying about lining up combos in this game that I can't really describe, but it makes me feel awesome.My one gripe, as others have mentioned, is sometimes it gets a little hard to control with a mouse. Trying to drag and drop can be a mess, and during hectic battles this can really screw you up. I tried playing with a drawing tablet before, thinking that would make it more managable, but that's not the case. Not much of a problem to me, but the dual monitor issue where it seems you have to have the game in windowed mode can be kinda bothersome, but it's not a super big deal imo.Overall, I think it's a decent little game, and hell, it's pretty cheap, but if you catch it on sale, you may as well buy it.

												I've play this game for about an hour, here are my thought- Great representation of the game as graphics are kind of irrelavant in the puzzle adventure style- Adrenaline rushing moments everywhere- Hard mode is HARD, like bs-ingly hard- Normal and easy mode introduce each concepts in the game nicely- Get boring after a bit of time goes by ( your hand will be numb from all the click and dragging )- Need HEAVY concentration ( not for casual play )- Not the best save system in the world. - No pause for your brain and arms apart from actually pressing esc. First impression : 8/10 Depth : 7/10Gameplay : SOLID 9/10 ( the game mechanism are extremely well thought out, would hit 10 but the skills are a bit too random and not too well explained )Music : 6/10 ( enough to not get bored since you will not have time to listen to it )Graphics : 7/10 ( good enough for the game of this genre )Story : NA ( puzzle game ... no need for that )Enjoyment : 6/10 ( though it's a little too hard D: and it's not really stage-like so you will have to play all in one go )Challenging on hard mode : 10/10 ( bloody hell ... this game is ROUGH )Pros : - Great game mechanics and fun rpg style gaming- Not the worst music to listen to- Great time sinker ( if you didn't get bored )- Many runes offer challengesCons :- No time to rest D:- Punish you really hard for losing a character- Skills are either op or just horrid ( imbalanced )- Save system sucks- Require too much attention and concentration while playingOverall, a fun game to pick up for cheap, challenging and fun to watch!

												I really enjoy match-3 games, but not when the game was designed on for a touch screen and I am playing on a PC with a mouse and keyboard.  The instructions in the tutorial are  not clear enough on certain aspects of the game, in my opinion.  The mouse often times fails to grab the piece it is pointing at cost time and usually leading to hero damage. Thankful I paid less than a $1 so I got at least that much fun from it, but not much more. "

												A pretty simple match-3 game that requires very fast and precise mouse movements and reactions.Since I don't have that level of mouse mechanics (I don't play FPS well, etc.), the game felt frustrating because I'd become overwhelmed and couldn't pull off any nice chains or combos. It would end up where I would just make single attacks, trying to clear the board of enemy attacks and hexes. And when you lose a character, it just goes snowballs from there because you lose attack/ability options and need to clear the dead hero's chargers to move things around. I wish there were lower difficulty settings to slow the pace down a little so someone of my skill level could execute plans a little easier. Right now, I just try to clear everything bad with 1-2 attack strikers at a time and hope that the upcoming gem sequence isn't impossible for me to clear. And I only use abilities to clear the board when I'm overwhelmed instead of offensively. It's like being only able to play Tetris or Tetris Attack/Puzzle League on a hard difficulty- things go by too fast to really have fun chaining and comboing things unless you're already good at it.Eventually, if you grind it out, you can unlock upgrades that make the game easier. However, I cleared 24 levels (beating the final boss) and only got 24 xp. There are about 9 upgrades for each character, scaling from 20xp to 110 xp (adding up to ~2095xp total). You'll need to clear many levels to unlock everything.You'll need to clear many levels to unlock much of anything.I would have liked your attack strikers to automatically fire when they reach the end of the screen (instead of disappear and be wasted).Maybe it would be easier to control with touch screen or keyboard/controller controls? The former would probably be better, the latter would probably still be too slow for the game.If you have high mouse dexterity (required) and rapid thinking (more instinct than movand enjoy challenges, this might be for you. If you aren't at that level, prepare for a frustrating experience where you can't do what you know needs to be done in time.			"

												Dungeon Hearts is a clever puzzle game with charming aesthetics, and a game at which I have slung countless epithets and morbid death threats as an endless cascade of little skull gems slid to the left along a hellscape dotted occasionally with primary colors and shattered, each one multiplying my rage.I am not very good at Dungeon Hearts.

A few things could have saved it and made it playable, but having only four lines, long distances to move the scattered bobbles to make matches, and a somewhat jerky execution both of player input and the scrolling made this game a waste of the bandwidth it took to download it as well as the time spent trying to play it.

Simply move the colored shapes to form combos that will deal damages to your opponents while avoiding getting mauled to death by preventing the dangerous icons to cross that line where your characters stand.I must tell you this game is far from easy and mastering it takes time and dedication.

												Dungeon Hearts is an RPG/RTS/Match-3 game in which the colors represent each hero and you have to match their pieces in order to perform an attack.  There are several other mechanics included to make the game more difficult, but that's the gist of it.The game itself is innovative and promises to be a fun time-waster.  However, the main problem with DH lies with the fact that the game is near-unplayable on the PC.  It's immediately evident upon playing the first level that the game was optimized for a phone or tablet, and replacing that with a computer mouse just spells trouble... or carpal tunnel syndrome.  The earlier levels are still bearable, but as the pieces on the ""Fatestream"" pick up speed, you'll find yourself struggling to keep up.Overall--no matter how cheap this game gets, don't bother getting it.  Why pay for a game that you can't even play?			"

												Quick puzzle game. It has some small RPG like elements, but the focus is puzzle. The game uses only mouse for gameplay. Chain same colored dots with a time limit before it reaches the edge of the screen.I love the RPG theme for this. The music is great and reminds you of those great JRPG battle themes. You feel like you're in the battle. At the beginning the enemy might rarely attack. So in a cosmetic way, it looks like the enemy is doing nothing.I think there is some audio bugs when beating enemies with skills. It doesn't change to the ""exp mini game"" version of the music. Other than that, It's a great game.Recommended if you like puzzle and fast-paced games with similar-color style gameplay.			"

Luckily you might buy this at a sale and take away your money’s worth of fun before you get bored and store it away. At least I did…  I intended to play it again later on, but I do have better games to play.I still find this a good game.

With an S because theres five(?) to select from as you complete the game each time.+Interesting use of rpg elements+Fun gameplay- VSync tears a lot, I think the framerate might be locked?- Sometimes the gems don't grab when they 'shift' spots on the field.

												Buy? Maybe. This game caught my eye because I'm looking for the next good Puzzle Quest style game. This is a Puzzle RPG of sorts, requring you to drag matching gems to create diamonds to attack the enemy. The gems are constantly sldiing to the left screen, where they disappear on the player party. Use your own attack gems to destroy enemy attach gems, preventing them to attack. There are other mechanics here with gems that can't be moved or cause debuffs to your player. It get's really tough after a while, I can get about 10 enemies or so with normal, but I have to play on easy to get really far. Level ups work like this as well, where defeating an enemy sends you a slew of star gems to line up to get experience, which in my opinion is often annoying to deal with. I'm not a big fan of the 'YOU'RE ALWAYS RUNNING OUT OF TIME"" to make a good move mechanic, so this game starts to bother me after a while, but I apprecaite what they were trying to do. I really like the ""battle"" tunes and you can simply copy the OST from the soundtrack folder, which includes the cover image.			"

												Out of all the games I've played that have controls specifically designed for mobile phones / tablets, this is probably one of the worst. I rather not play this on the Hard difficulty as to save myself from harm.. if not a hand injury then It would be from harming myself out of frustration. Yup.. that's how awful the controls are.If it weren't for that, the game would be a lot more fun on the PC. I'll still give this game a 'thumbs up' because I'm not one to condemn it solely because of the controls, frustrating as they may be. The game in itself is pretty fun, a match 3 puzzle game with a bit of 'strategy' and RPG elements to it. Not much else to say, as a mobile game you shouldn't really expect anything out of the ordinary. It has a great soundtrack, that's for sure.My advice.. if you're looking to play this and have fun, you're better off getting it on your phone or tablet if you can. If you want this game just for the trading cards, save yourself the pain and get it on a sale. It may not be much but I still don't recommend buying it full price, unless perhaps you really want to injure yourself.. and for that purpose there are tools you can buy IRL that cost less.			"

												It wasnt a horrible game..but after a few minuets it gets boring, its really more of a mobile game than a pc game.			"

												+Awesome sound tracks. With an S because theres five(?) to select from as you complete the game each time.+Interesting use of rpg elements+Fun gameplay- VSync tears a lot, I think the framerate might be locked?- Sometimes the gems don't grab when they 'shift' spots on the field. I think it has something to do with the weird way the mouse works on a grid. Just speculation.I still love this game and come back to it from time to time. A run through on normal takes 30-50 minutes.  "

												It’s a nice casual game. But for your game to be played right you do need to level up, and you do this with several play troughs, and failures, and that’s not very fun. Luckily you might buy this at a sale and take away your money’s worth of fun before you get bored and store it away. At least I did…  I intended to play it again later on, but I do have better games to play.I still find this a good game. And I do think people should support good game developers, the difficulty ramp is just too steep. "
