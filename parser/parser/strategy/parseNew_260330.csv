Early Access Review
								Flockers is a wonderful early access game. The game feels like you are in the sheep factory of a Worms game - training the sheep to become the fluffy little murder machines they are. However, the gameplay is very reminiscent of the Lemmings franchise of the SNES generation. The levels I played were not over the top difficult, but do take planning and a few retries to get 3 stars. It is a great thinking game that kids and adults both could enjoy. If you are sensitive to sheep blood and gore, there is an option to turn off the blood spray.If you would like to see my first impression video, here is a link:

9/10""How funny cruel & addictive.""Flockers feels like the long-awaited sequel of Lemmings. For the ones who don't know - it's the game with the many little green haired fellas, your daddy used to rescue when you might have been too little to know and pixels were bigger than big :)The goal in each lvl is to bring your sheep flock to the safety vacuum with the help of some few ""tools"". In the end Flockers is a brutal, funny and complex puzzler which is very well done. A very honorable Lemmings successor!Pros:+ great gameplay+ great lvls+ great (&later tough) puzzles+ great controls+ good graphics+ good sounds+ replayability+ 66 lvls + lvl editor & workshop support+ world wide highscore ranking+ brutal & funny+ great value for money, BAACons:- Alt+Tab freezes game- the feeling when one, two, three,... flockers die ;)Lemmings of the 21st century.

												Can't recommend for technical reasons.No idea about gameplay apart from tutorial. Reason #1 : Mouse accelleration. Yes really: They implemented an always-on mouse accelleration with no way to turn it off.On a PC game.A MOUSE based PC game.In 2014.A game where you have to fast pinpoint specific sheep.Seriously?! Reason #2 : Performace My PC has about twice the power than the minimum specs.With that I get a stable 18-20 FPS in the first two levels.With deactivated VSync and AA.In a game which, although not quite as fast as a shooter of course, heavily relies on fast reaction.And does not have THAT huge content/unit count/... which could explain that. Reason #3 : Tutorial I started the tutorial level.It told me, to explode a sheep.I did that.Apparently that was too early: Sheep did not explode where it should.Could not continue the level.The TUTORIAL level.Guess I'm stupid for doing what I read in a tutorial level right away.(okay would not be enough to not recommend the game - still: fail!)Sadly, I cannot return the game, as I got it through HumbleBundle, not Steam :/			"

												Flockers is an action puzzle game in much the same style as Lemmings, created by Team17, makers of Worms, so you know the pedigree is good.


YouTube™ Video: Flockers - A First Look 

			Views: 159		

			A first impressions gameplay video of Flockers, a modern Lemmings style game made by Team17, well known for their Worms series of games.		

For those who don't remember the classic Lemmings, it was a game in which a number of ""lemmings"" (which looked more like human workers to me) were released and would walk through the landscape, following each other like the archetypal lemmings, blindly walking off cliffs to their death. Your job as the player was to guide the lemmings by giving specific instructions to them, for example to build bridges or dig into the landscape, in order to guide as many of them to safety as possible.Flockers uses essentially the same concept, but with sheep instead of lemmings. Appropriately so, since sheep also have the habit of following one another. This time around, rather than natural landscapes, you have to help them navigate through extremely dangerous factory complexes, filled with saws, spikes, hammers and other nasty objects, often with gory results as your mindless sheep stroll blindly into them.Each level is a puzzle. They're large, and get progressively more complicated as you progress through them. You can zoom in and out to get a better view of the puzzle you have to solve. Sheep may wander off in different directions, you may meet more sheep along the way, transporters teleport sheep to different locations and it can sometimes be a bit confusing to understand what's going on the first time you try a new level.As you go through each level, sheep step on buttons which activate machinery, sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a very bad way, so you have to be very careful what you let them step on. They also encounter crates, which when opened give you new abilities that you can assign to your your sheep. It may take a few attempts to figure out how to get through a level.While you often need to get only one sheep to safety (in the early levels at least), getting more will score you more points, as will doing it in a faster time. You also get a bonus for using fewer abilities. You can retry levels to get a better score, and you can compare your score to your friends.The levels are very detailed, perhaps overly so, which can make it tricky to figure out how to solve them. But maybe that's the point, distracting you with unimportant details. Fortunately, although it's an action game, you can pause it at any time, giving you the opportunity to study the puzzle at your leisure. You still have to solve it in real time though, giving commands to your sheep as they move. Pressing the right mouse button gives you a bigger ""brush"", enabling you to give commands to multiple sheep at the same time.The graphics are very good, and very gory as sheep get smashed and sawed, spiked and gored, with blood splattering everywhere, which is rather amusing if you find that sort of thing funny. For this reason the game has an age rating. But if you don't like that sort of thing, you can simply turn off the gore in the video options.I haven't played this game for very long yet, but my first impressions are very good. I'm finding it both challenging and amusing, an enjoyable casual way to pass the time. The price is very reasonable and it's on sale at the moment, so this is a great time to grab it if you're interested.			"

												Despite appearances Flockers does not play much like Lemmings.Lemmings is primarily a puzzle game, not an action game.  Flockers is primarily an action game, not a puzzle game.  The difference is whether you put the emphasis on difficult reasoning or reacting quickly.Flockers plays more like some sort of strange platformer than a Lemmings clone.  Unlike Lemmings, there is no way to assign tasks while the game is paused or even slowed down.Assigning tasks is made more unpleasant by the design of flocker tasks.  In Lemmings assigning a single lemming a task typically affected the behavior of the entire stream of lemmings, or terrain, such as blocking their path and turning them around, or building a staircase until an obstacle was struck.  In Flockers you usually need to give the same task to each flocker at the right time.  Too late is fatal.  Too early may also be fatal, depending on the task and environment.  The only concession the controls make for these demands is to allow you to use a larger or smaller 'brush' to assign tasks, and due to the timing constraints a large brush is not very usable.To make matters worse, there is no way to predict what the level elements will do.  This reduces solving the level to trial and error, rather than planning.The constant trial and error gameplay is grueling since you will need to start the entire level over if you  mess up badly enough.If you want to see what it would be like to play Super Mario Bros. with awkward controls, a stream of Marios, and random cheap deaths, then play this.  If you want to play something like Lemmings, you need to look elsewhere.Some are making comparisons to Worms as well.  There certainly is no similarity between Worms and Flockers gameplay.  Both Lemmings and Worms had destructable environments.  Flockers does not.  While Worms was violent, and Lemmings had a task that made all the lemmings blow themselves up (used to restart the level), the violence was cartoony.  Flockers is gory.  So Flockers is not very comparable to Worms either.			"

			Flockers first look and gameplay. Flockers is a strategy game by Team 17. The Flockers reviews, first impressions and thoughts.		

Flockers is a big chunk of fun. I was hoping for the same mood and humor of Worms and it has it. I'm also suprised that it's so cheap. For a good number of levels and more available in the future I think it's a no brainer. There's also the level editor which should allow people to create infinite new levels. Recommended :) Watch the video for more info			"

												I love this, its like a little mental workout, I just drop in between games and enjoy a level or two. The mechanics are fun and you really care if the sheep live or die. Comparisons to lemmings will be made but this has a lot more in it with sophisticated physics contraptions instead of just cutting chunks out the landscape. Graphics are lovely as is the audio.Definately worth a go.			"

												Fresh take on Lemmings :)   Think Worms Landscapes that are more diabolical, and Lemmings type of Game Play.I loved playing lemmings when I was a child, this is the more grown-up version of it, with sheep instead of little pixilated men! Can be as gory or non-bloody if you so choose. The new environmental aspects are great, Tellaporters, gravity reversal, mines, sharp bone blades and, Worms driving Death Machines with saw blades and spikes ready to take out your flock without hesitation. Guide your Flock of sheep through the map using ability box's you either start with or pick up along the way, to the trumpet looking exit vacuum. Making sure to do it as quickly as possible without losing too many of your sheep. Sacrifices are usually a necessity, except for rounds where you only have 1 sheep. Knowing that this game is still in Early Access stage, it's one of the best functioning ""Alpha's"" I've played in quite awhile. The only thing I have issue with is moving the camera around. There are times when you move or Pan the camera up, down, left, or right it becomes semi choppy and can be difficult to get the camera where you want it without taking extra time to adjust. I'm pretty sure the DEV's are aware of this issue and are working on it. Visually this game is very appealing, Content is still being added, and it even comes with a level editor and, Twitch Streaming features in game.  Other than more levels, and perhaps more Hazards to navigate, you can't really ask for much more.  I wish more early access projects were this ""completed"" upon steam early access release. As it stands, as long as the DEV's don't introduce and major game breaking issues in the future updates, this is a Great Game worth every penny.  Would and will recommend to friends. "

												I loved Lemmings, and I wanted to love this. I thought it would be fun and hilarious, but it turned out to be quite frustrating. The learning curve is quite steep due to how easily the sheep die. Traps are everywhere, and you need to have sheep jump over buttons in order to prevent the release of the traps. These buttons are also used to progress, so you need to find a way to manage your sheep getting to the next area before allowing them to progress so that the sheep in front of the group doesn't release a trap killing all the sheep behind it. You also have to hope that the next area doesn't have more traps, otherwise you will need to find a way to let one sheep sacrifice itself first. You have very limited number of 'resources', and if you make one mistake, you've practically failed. There is not too much freedom of choice as to how to solve the very linear puzzles. It's unfortunate that there is also just so much going on at the same time that it becomes almost impossible to save all your sheep on any given level. It's a game of 'how many sheep can I prevent being killed by the traps in their path?', not 'how can I use my resources to overcome a challenging puzzle?'. In Lemmings, you could pause the game to assign commands to the Lemmings. In this game, you cannot. Timing is more important than the puzzles themselves, which is dissapointing. Also, you generally have to assign commands to every single sheep in the line, or else they will die (eg. failing to assign the jump command to every passing sheep will cause them all to fall and die.). You had better hope too that you have enough time to manage the sheep that have jumped already, and on their way to their doom and the sheep that you haven't assigned yet! Completing the early 'puzzles' didn't give me any feelings of joy or achievement, so I stopped playing this game quite early. I may come back again to it... but I'll give it a rest for now.			"

												Bought Flockers yesterday and I fell in love instantly. The sheeps have more cuteness factor than any cat video on the internet. The worlds are very detailed and have many active elements. There are some big advantages over Lemmings:You need to collect boxes to get features for your sheeps. This was also something that got introduced with Lemmings 2 - The Tribes and Lemmings 3.So far i cannot see a drawback. This game I bought for about 5 € but it is worth more definitely to honor the developers.If there is anything I can complain about after a few levels, than that the music is not that good and repetitive compared to the ol' Lemmings tunes.Flockers get a 10/10 out of the box!

Early Access Review
								The potential for this new generation Lemmings is incredible. The concept is very similar to the loveable green haired creatures but features a greater emphasis on environmental hazards which produce gloriously violent results. The added golden fleece objectives in levels increases the challenge for a perfect score and I can only imagine this going further and further using the editor in the future.Right now it feels like the overall choice of special effects you can add to your sheep is limited but the heavy environmental interaction makes up for that. Established studios using early access might not be totally ok with everyone, but Flockers comes at a reasonable price and is in a relatively polished state for what it currently includes so you can already see Team 17 is taking this new franchise seriously. We've been without a game with as much charm as the original lemmings for a long time and it's great to return to something so familiar with the current generation of polish.			"

												I'm about 3 levels into this game and, having bought it on sale, I had to wonder what all the complaining about the controls is all about.  Well, I did try the demo, and yes, the controls there are a hot mess.  It continually lost my customizations and there were several other really bad bugs during the demo.  By all rights, I shouldn't have bothered with the game.But, I did.  And the full game has none of these issues so far.  Sure, it's not as tight as Lemmings was back in the day.  If it's possible to finish a level in Flockers without losing a sheep, then I haven't seen it so far.  It could drive a perfectionist nuts, I can see that.  That said, this is a more than playable and fun game which for the current price of $2 is a no-brainer. I'll update this review as I get a little further, but I just wanted to relate that because of the other reviews.  At the very least, I'm not going to return the game.			"

All you really need to be aware of is getting your sheep safely to the vacuum. of course you have to have the right mechanism to do so and those tools really come in handy. If you're like myself and relate to anything that is a puzzle solving game that includes best game-play, then check this game out. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Even though DMA design had a great go with Lemmings saga in past decades, someone has to keep the good spirit up and, at the same time, confuse everyone with Team17 aka ""the Worms team"". I remember Lemmings being absolutely terrifyingly difficult. Though, being 12 at the time, its not a huge accomplishment in and of itself, but I remember most of the puzzles being pretty damn ruthless and you could usually just and just sneak one single lemming out. Then you had to continue for bunch of levels with increasing difficulty to get those small snickers out. Flockers basically feels really nice. It usually seems to have an easy setting to get minimum sheeps out, and then have an extra challenge to really cross the rules.			"

												This is basically lemmings...with sheep, but unfortunately it's not nearly as good. The graphics are muddy and ugly. Well, it's understandable, cause you're in a butcher factory or whatever, but I mean they're really detracting from the actual gameplay. The camera is sluggish. The game runs poorly on a modern rig and the overall gameplay is just not satisfying enough to carry it forward.Your task, just as in lemmings, is to guide as many sheep to the exit, while sacrificing some on the way. For that you have various tools. Sorry, did I say various tools? Nah. Actually there are only 3 (jumping sheep, flying sheep and exploding sheep). The rest of the kit consists of ""blocks"", i.e. your sheep can be used as stepping stones (1, 2 or 3) like a staircase or as a soft block (2 sheep high), which means only flying sheep can cross over that. You can also release your sheep from stair or blocking duty. That is it. That is the game. At least that's what it's been for the first 10 or so levels. You get access to all the tools from the start.To actually use these blocks you have to gather them in the level. The levels consist of different traps and teleporters, walls and gaps. Honestly, it's again, boring. There's nothing to really differentiate the levels from each other. They look and feel the same. Maybe this gets better later on, but if your game doesn't progress anywhere after 1 hour it's not worth my time anymore. There are also boss levels...the first one is you being chased by a giant ""something"" on wheels. Your sheep will die...horribly...and bloodily. And I guess this is the main selling point of the game. Since it is enough to get even a single sheep through to beat the level there's not much strategy involved, unless you want to go score attack...which with the amount of levels in there (a ton) sounds like work and not fun.The controls are also kinda wonky, especially since you can't use the pause mode to actually plan stuff. In Lemmings you could assign individual lemmings to important roles. Here it's more like ""paste that♥♥♥♥♥♥over every sheep to make them fly"". Personally, I find this game to be dull and dreary. Maybe get it at a steep discount. 18 bucks is way too much for the level of polish you get here, though it does offer a decent amount of levels. Too bad the levels aren't interesting.			"

								if you think this will be ahealla cute game, you will learn that you where dead wrong as that thought crossed your mind.i don't know what to say, sure the sheep are pretty cute and their sounds are even more cute but the death of your sheep, if you can't keep them alive will be literally heartbreaking ;v;even i love sheep and don't wanna see them dead it's a great game and i don't regret that i bought it :3			"

YouTube™ Video: Becks Plays - FLOCKERS #1 

			Views: 29		

			Beckie tries out Flockers, a lemmings style game where lots of sheep die!! Thanks for watching		

Flockers is like a blast from the past. Reminds me heavily of Lemmings but with better graphics and more content. The cartoon style and delightful sound effects are in keeping with the loved Worms theme which makes this even more of an incredible game.The first few Levels were fairly easy, thankfully as it took a couple levels to work out what to do! As you progress from level to level they increase in difficulty as you would expect, eventually at level 12-13 we struggled and ended up taking 10 tries at a particularly difficult level.I really do recommend this game for any Lemmings or Worms fans!

Early Access Review
								From the Creators of the award winning 'Lemmings' and 'Worms' Series of games comes another classic in the making from Team 17. I first got to play this awesome and addictive game at 'EGX Rezzed 2014.


YouTube™ Video: ➜ A Quick Look @ 'Flockers' 

			Views: 48		

			PD recommends Cheap Games here: https://www♥♥♥♥♥com/r/paradisedecay Massive Thanks to the Developers for the Review Copy!		

If you're a fan of the classic game 'Lemmings' from many moons ago or the recent 'Worms' series of games... then you're in for a treat. Flockers feels like a perfect blend of both styles of game. In Flockers your aim is to guide a flock of sheep to an exit in the safest way possible, along the way you will be met with seemingly impossible obstacles and plenty of gruesome death and you will be laughing all the way! As in 'Worms' you have to collect crate's to aid and help your journey. All in all this makes up for a highly enjoyable and addictive game. Team 17 have not skimped on the gore either this time round and you'll be in stitches and shock at some of the death scenarios. This is already shaping up to be 'Game of the Year' material. The game may still be in 'Early Access' but it doesn't feel that way. It's extremely polished and already has a ton of bonus content with the introducing of 'Steam Workshop' - Highly Recommended!

												A bit of lemmings with the charm of a modern puzzler like world of goo put together by the team that makes the worms games?  That's what I hoped for.  What I got was a game that plays awkwardly with an unpleasant difficulty curve that is frustrating even in the tutorial levels.  Maybe the game just isn't for me.  It does support the 360 controller somewhat though which is a nice touch, even if it's somewhat clumsy.  It's not a bad game idea, just needs more polish.  Maybe Flockers 2?			"

												It's like Lemmings (those of you who are old enough will understand) and it is a greatr contemporary clone. After some introduction levels it gets really challenging and demanding, so you better bring some time to figure out the solution. I did not make it that far but maybe I overlooked a part in the game mechanics or I'm just not patient enough. If u knew and loved Lemmings (or Lemmings Revolution in the post-DOS era) this might be something for you.			"

												A decent enough game if you can get it cheap and enjoyed Lemmings. Strangely it seems to lack a lot of the charm of Lemmings despite being almost exactly the same game. I think the problem is the physics engine, it makes the game more about getting the timing bang on right rather than trying to solve a puzzle. This makes it very unforgiving and it's easy to lose all your sheep because you were half a second off the pace required for the level.Unfortunately there is a massive problem with the controls for the game. Even with the mouse sensitivitly turned right down   the game pans from one side of the map to the other in the blink of an eye and zoom seems to be all or nothing.			"
