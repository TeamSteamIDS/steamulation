												As some have said, this game has an extreme learning curve. But if you want a game that is super detailed in how much control you have over every aspect of your empire/kingdom, this is a game you want to try. From deciding who marries who to pass on good traits to their offspring, to what buildings each province has, to what type of armies you want to command.  I thoroughly enjoy this game from time to time. WARNING, game does tend to crash when using cheat codes, so save often. Also, upon loading a game, you need to wait at least 6months game time before going to war so your troops lose an unknown coward/flee debuff.  All in all, great game for the cheap price I paid during Steam's summer sale.			"

												The Grandness of Paradox Grand Strategy titles is not a misnomer. Shame the grandeur tends to also come with a small helping of bugginess. Crusader Kings 1 is perhaps the poster child for that. The title was initially developed by an outside studio, with a similar style to Europa Universalis but in the Middle Ages with a focus on families instead of nation states. Unfortunately, the outside studio kind of screwed some things up. Even with all the fixes eventually given to the title, there are still random quirks that don't work like they should.Still the grandeur honestly makes up for many of the blemishes. It is a pleasure to lead a family of small time counts to the head of the known world. Unfortunately, once you know the mechanics, you really have to hold yourself in line to not use them all. It's extremely easy to min max your way to a thorougly boring second half of the game. Don't give in to temptation, and you're treated to stories that can be great fun to remember and share, like the count who went mad, killed everyone, then just sort of sat there with no heirs til you inheirited from the people who were grateful to not have to put up with him or his heirs. Stories that grow out of the gameplay are really the draw from this title.Also try looking up the Dynastic Glory program. It lets you parse your save game, and compare your family tree to those of other great families. It opens a whole new way to make a mark on the world, spreading your seed far and wide to have your namesake, if not yourself directly, as the top of all the houses of Europe.Overall, Crusader Kings represents a really interesting game style that should be experienced at least once. You may want to go for a less buggy or more accessible model though. Try Europa Universalis 3, for example. 3/5			"

												Crusader Kings in many ways is a biographer's wet dream. It has mechanics of Europa Universalis 2, the warfare, the economics, the diplomacy but unlike that grand strategy epic, this grand strategy epic portrays you not as some nameless entity ruling your nation through the ages but as the head of a noble medieval family, your faith not tied into the success of the nation you rule but the rulers themselves.You start the game by picking which family to control, you can start off as a great King yes but you can also choose to play as a powerful Duke or even an impoverished Count. You then set about forging alliances, mostly through marriage, produce offspring that can one day take over the mantle of leadership and assert your claim to various noble titles. As you grow in power and influence new challenges will arise. Conquer too quickly and others will see you as a warmonger, your vassals may grow too powerful and seek to claim your titles for themselves and should you have too many children they may differ over who should rule when you are dead.Each character has a set of characteristics and traits that wouldn't feel out of place in an RPG. Some traits are purely positive while others make you an inept ruler. Each trait also has an opposite, brave to cowardly and so forth and characters with opposing traits will often dislike each other and this all works together to create a great web of intrigue that makes holding together a great Kingdom a real challenge.This great seat of intrigue and dynasty building is not without it's flaws however, the lack of any sort of proper tutorial and the rather extreme wealth of information you get showered with from the moment you start up the game makes it near impossible for newcomers to get into the game and even veterans of Europa Universalis 2 will find themselves struggling to keep up with the flow of information.All in all Crusader Kings is an extremely complex dynasty building game that more often than not throws you into the deep end and see if you can figure out the diplomacy of marriage politics before you die without an heir or have to resort to incest. It is a fun game, once you learn it but unfortunately most people will quit long before that.			"

												Crusader Kings it's a good old classic game, for a 2004 game, it still holds up very well. In the last month and a half I've been playing CK for about 100+ hours (initially purchased in GoG), and this game got me hooked so bad that I have not even touched the new StarCraft Legacy of The Void expansion, and by the looks of it, I'm going straight to CKII after I finish at least one full game, from 1066 to 1453.In CK you manage a royal dynasty, a Monarch and his blood line, and of course his kingdom, and his religion. You can conquer as much land as you want, bringing the Catholic faith to the heathens at the same time making sure they have the ruler they need, that means you and your descendants.CK is a Grand Strategy game, players from the Civilization series, or Total War series, won't be having hard time enjoying it, but this doesn't mean the game is just like those games, or any other game for that matter (well, maybe except for Crusader Kings II or Europa Universalis), The blend of strategy, royal dynasty simulator and the random events create a unique and fun game, even the story telling that is created every time you play a game is a big part of the fun. One time I got my father and my grandfather beatified and sanctified, and later on the pope made me Emperor.The game sessions are not shorts, and this may be a turn off for some people, you can easily spend 80+ hours in one game, specially if you start in 1066 AD, but this kind of games can create a very deep story of your royal dynasty.The game plays much like a board game, you will be looking at a big Europe and its surroundings A LOT, looking at your lands and the lands of your enemies and possible targets, you will be spending a lot of time looking at your family, making sure your successor is a worthy one, because when your current monarch dies, the successor will be having th time of his life trying to hold together the great kingdom that just inherited together, some of his vassals may find they don't like him very much and will try to declare independence. These are the times you will know the meaning of ruling with an iron fist.Even if there is Crusader Kings II, this game deserves the chance of being played. Even if you just play ONE full game, with all its faults and weird design decisions, CK is worth playing.8.5/10.			"

												I love this game. Im unbelievably addicted, even play it at work. So with that, here is a review:The Positive:If you love politics and decision making this is a game for you. Decide fates, earn gold, persteige, and religious traits, each decision effects your ruling. Improve land, grant titles, assasinate your compitetion! Every thing you do WILL have an outcome to be thoughtful. Civilization, Total Rome, and Fable 3 all mixed together.The Negative:This game has a hard learning curve but totally worth it. Some outcomes dont make sense, some traits dont seem fair, AI is kinda corky, some laws give you too much and others too little in a way that really doesnt give the game balance, no real tutorial, and chracters look funny, graphics are so 2009.In a Nut Shell:Love the game, cant wait to buy Crusader Kings 2 which I heard is amazing. Highly recommend to straedgy RP lovers who are ok learning a game on their own. BUY IT!			"

												Historical gaming primarily focused on family management (yes, there is war and conquest but I end up spending more time managing family affairs than managing armies and territories.) It feels very ""Darwinian"" going through the list of brides in the general ledger, searching for the stats and traits that will improve the descendency for your family and your courtier's families.Having played this and CKII I have to say I find the original more enjoyable. The graphics are less polished and it is simpler but this simplicity can actually be an advantage in terms of how much fun is it to play.			"

												If you enjoy intrigue, war, and political skulduggery, this game is for you. In my most recent game, my ruler's youngest illegitimate son and steward (and a fine one at that), attempted to install himself as the king's successor and failed. Last night, he assassinated the king, but the crown fell to the eldest legitimate son (more powerful than even the king), making him King of Aragon, Castille, Navarra, and Portugal. Of course, all this happened after a round of strategic assassinations, opportunistic marriages, and timely wars.Pros:-Tons of events (good and bad) in your realm that make each game special-THE PAUSE BUTTON (so helpful)-If you have the money and prestige in-game, you can do pretty much anything you want.-The game is pretty balanced.-It rarely gets boring. First, you have to claw your way to the top, which is difficult but not impossible. On the other hand, once you're on top, the game may throw something your way that can cripple you. You're ALWAYS on your toes.-Relatively few bugs (mostly a few graphical ones with troops being shipped overseas).Cons:-No instruction manual or tutorial. (Although, there is a fantastic series of tutorial videos on YouTube.)-It's difficult to play at first (but that will get easier with time).It's a great game with near endless possibilities for only $9.99. If you don't feel like shelling out the full amount for Crusader Kings II, get this game instead. You won't regret it.			"

												Learn, Conquer, And Have Fun!Not for the impatient this one! There is quite a steep learning curve when you first start the game, there is no instructions, no manual, but that’s what makes it fun. Crusader Kings is a perfect example of one of those games that gets amazingly good after you have mastered the arts of playing, and it excels in both storytelling, and depth. Whatever you do in CK will affect all aspects in what happens in the moment, but also in the future also. Its set in the Medieval ages, so lots to do and a hell of a lot going on also, whether you are introducing new religions, waging war, or managing finances. What makes this game so unique and unlike other games in the genre, is the weird, and quite strange happenings that occur in the game. Some according to your actions, some dam right peculiar! Besides the diseases, random suicides, and acts of war declaration from your vassal, you wife will threaten you and try to make you buy the latest fashion fad. However, I just told her to go to church instead, that little quarry rightly resolved if I may say. I could write up a load of other little events, and often pleasurable instances which occurred in this game, but you really must try it for yourself. In the end really I must conclude to the fact that Crusader Kings truly is a good grand strategy game, but not one of the best, and due to the amazing success of its spiritual successor CK2, a game that often is forgotten. Its worth a buy for sure if its on sale, but I wouldn’t go out of your way to purchase it, as after all Crusader Kings 2 is soo much better I must stress. Nice to play a game that led to CK2, or the likes of Sengoku, but not a game I would spend too much time on I guess.For me though, it will be forever in the shadow of its successor..Crusader Kings is a rather “Grand” Strategy game indeed, it may be pretty old, but even in its age it still offers a good play through.Overall:+ Solid Campaign To Work Through+ Very In Depth+ Easy To Run+ Grand Strategy Classic- Steep Learning Curve- Often Confusing- Has Not Aged Well Good 7/10That goes it for my short Crusader Kings Steam ReviewThanks,The-Sentinel-Gamer			"

												The original grand strategy game that I can't get anywhere in, Crusader Kings is a....well, grand strategy game, but unlike other games in which you take the helm of a nation, you sit in the big-boy (or big-girl) chair of a noble family in the era of the crusaders, this being medieval times, that is.Plot murders, sire children, eff your neighbors out of provinces, get effed by their bigger, better neighbors who like them more than you, and get back stabbed by a baron for not paying him enough attention. A deep learning curve is involved in mastering the politics and management of both a family and a burgeoning empire.However, the game has no over all ""goal,"" so it is up to you to decide a win condition. In one game I played as a minor noble in Holland, and through a series of events that not even I understand, I ended up as king of France. Not dying and ending up as a king seemed like a ""win"" to me, even if, if memory serves, we ended up being invaded and facing rebellions such that France was destroyed anyway.For: people who love deep simulations, politics, game of thrones, and haplessly watching the Holy Roman Empire eff you for fighting someone inside the empire.Not for: people who don't like deep simulation, sensitive to the idea of murdering an idiot son that's going to inherit over a more qualified son, impatient people.

Dynastic simulation and strategy with the ability to immerse yourself in the initially historical characters, and invest your hopes and dreams in your randomly generated progeny. While the sequel CK2 has improved almost ever aspect of the game, and offers a lot more roleplaying potential than this first installment, CK1 still stands up as a streamlined experience with genetics playing a larger role in character stats (if you want to play the ""breed the perfect dynasty"" game). The graphics have dated however, so that narrows the appeal.			"

												This is an older game, but excellent.  You choose to play as a count, duke, or king in Europe and the surrounding era during the Great Crusades, and rule over your family for the next several hundred years.  It has a lot in common with other Paradox Grand Strategy games, however I found this one more engaging and easier to jump into.  It's less about war and more about building a dynasty to last while protecting the faith in missions from the church.  It's absorbing in the way only strategy games can be, but a little buggy and crash-worthy, and a few mods come in handy for fixing the questionable interface graphics, particularly the minimap.  Already becoming one of my favorites games.			"

												I am fairly dissapointed. Even though the game seems pretty complex, many of its mechanics don't work very well. For example, I tried to conquer some pagan tribes in the Eastern Europe, sent my armies there, but as I declared war on them, after some bigger battles, which they lost, they just kept trying to fight me with diminishing number of forces and even though I crushed them repeatedly, couldn't really defeat them. On top of that, they kept ""spamming"" peace negotiation proposals every few seconds and, as I was a vassal to the ""German king"" (I know there wasn't such a title in this era), he just kept accepting the proposals and all my sieges were repeatedly broken, even though they had 10 troops left against my armies of thousands. The funny thing is that in that situation, I could decline the peace proposal, but, only if I was FASTER than the German king when clicking on the popup - and then the siege wouldn't be interrupted!So in the end, every few seconds I got a popup for a battle, a popup of the pagans offering to cease hostilities (which I had to click really fast or risk the German king accepting it) and several random popups for various events. Add to that the fact that armies have something called ""attrition"", which means that a number of your troops diminishes over time, depending on various factors - which sounds great and complex and all, but combined with the situation mentioned above, it's just... stupid. I could have probably solved that by picking a different faction, but it's still pretty lame.No, this is definitely not complexity, more like poor game design.			"

												I wish I could recomend this, but I can't get it to work. After the intro video, there's a black screen and nothing on the official forums say how to fix this - even after several people complained of the exact same situation. What's worse is: this is the second Paradox game that I bought and can not play this week.			"

												I've played many games like this. Games like this seem to confuse ""difficult"" with ""cluster-♥♥♥♥"".As soon as you press play, the game goes full speed ahead without you. In order to stop this, you have to click this tiny banner which does not even look like a button. The game throws out notifications all over your screen before you even know what is going on, and even then it is difficult to ascertain what it is trying to convey. The UI is not even remotely intuitive. The AI makes decisions that make no sense at all. Controlling anything is totally unintuitive. This game is perfect for people who like to feel superior to others because they spent the time fighting the design, rather than playing the game. You can actually lose before you even started getting into things and then lose over and over again after having your first ruler die because they could not produce offspring. There is nothing you can really do to control this besides going ""please respond"" to every ruler on the map when looking for a wife. Even then, you can screw yourself. Not like it matters since your ruler will start to gain vices for no explicit reason, impairing his or her ability to rule. Again, you have NO CONTROL over what happens. You want to simulate the trait rolls in this game? (DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS YOU WILL DIE DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS) Get a jar of used medical syringes and some rusty nails you found on the side of a construction site. Smash them on the ground and roll around and see what kills you. It does not really matter, but it's an accurate depiction of what it is like being a character in this game. (DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS YOU IDIOT DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS)Just get CKII. There is much more to do and it's just as ""difficult"" without being as obtuse. You won't have to deal with the resolution issues either. Still, if you absolutely love these types of games, I suppose you can get this one.Also, it's pronounced ""DOMAIN"", not ""DEEMEENZEE"".			"

												I never played this game and I just can't get into it now. It's wa-ay to outdated. The only reason I bought this is because I love CK2. CK2 is my favorite game and I wanted to see how the franchise started. For me this game is just a novelty game, the one you purchase and immediately put on the shelf to dust - just to check the check mark.

												While Paradox typically makes great games, and this is one of their older titles, the steam version has some bad crash to desktop moments.  As it is an older title for them, the UI is lacking and the game is a lot of waiting around, with poor design decisions like going to the options menu to change the game speed.  I highly recommend most other Paradox titles, but not this one.			"

												I wouldn't recommend paying more than $2 for this. I think I got it for $1, & I guess I got my money's worth of play out of it, though the 1st few hours is exasperating trying to figure out how to do everything. Dislike that pop-ups appear on top of each other; many times I clicked something I didn't want to or even see what it was because it popped over something I was currently clicking. I cheated every way possible & it's still barely playable(albeit strangely addictive). It's funny how the creators must hate kids...every one in the game is always being annoying, just like real life.  Battle is atrocious, & moving troops is painfully slow. Also, you lose huge chunks of your army as it moves so it's , at best, 1/2 the size it was when it arrives. Army of 50k leaving England will have maybe 10k when it gets to Jerusalem. Add to that the annoying Pope telling you to crusade against  behemoths like Egypt or the Seljuks. Yes, as Denmark with my small armies that will be tiny before I get anywhere near the hundreds of thousands of Turks whose armies never seem to diminish. I wish I could turn Deus Vult off, then maybe it would be almost ok. Warning to nuubz, NEVER ally with anyone. This is just a nuisance, as they will continuously drag you into petty squabbles, or worse, war with a monster country like Germany, England, or France.(I was England allied w/Scotland & they tried to suck me into war w/ France & their ally Germany) Never ally w/Hungary, they're ALWAYS at war. Best countries to be, crusadewise are Croatia & Sicily, as they are centrally located.  If by some miracle heathens take Rome, conquer it, it makes large armies (6-12k, iirc). The other best places to hold are Alexandria & Byzantium(these 2 get 20-30k troops), Giza's not bad , most of Sicly has decent numbers, Cordoba & Valencia are ok. Most places 3-4k troops is alot, many are under 1k or even 500. I've never made it to the endgame, my empire just becomes unwieldy at some point & I quit & start a new kingdom. My best was 13 Kingships, I forget all of them but Byzantium, Jerusalem,Croatia, Serbia, Italy, Germany, France, Sicily,Lithuania, Burgundy, Africa(either Ireland & Wales, or part of Spain) were among them, that was when I started as Croatia(Ithink duke thereof). Overall I'd prefer ANY Total War. Mostly the things that happen in the game , though ""realistic"", are just annoying, mostly.			"

												First of all I want to say that I enjoy to play the game considering the time when it was launched.I love the games when you need to consider the very little details of your party or kingdom. You need to elect counts, weddings, bishops, counsils, dukes, etc. and I love that but the game lacks of everything else, when you are at war with someone the war decides by two things: numbers and type of armies. I am not saying that needs to be a Total War kind of game but could apply something of the Civilization series.The game is very simple you can go for hours without doing nothing! And that was something that I hate from the game.My qualification will be 5/10 so it's out to you to decide!			"

												Невелика проте потужна компанія Paradox Interactive не робить поганих стратегій.  А ця гра є не лише захопливою, але й  унікальною. Поки, що жодна стратегія, навіть наближено,  настільки досконало не передає політичні та економічні особливості середньовічної феодальної системи. Не сподобалась музика та графічне оформлення гри (зображення нагадують «пласкі маріонетки» з радянських мультиків).  Оцінка 9 з 10			"

												It was after many hours I decided that this style of 4x game wasn't for me. Which means up until then I did enjoy it, but it doesn't make me want to replay it over and over again like Total War.This game has more emphasis on dynasty building and managing unruly members, eugenic breeding of decendants, marrying of children for political gain. You won't however get to control your armies on a battlefield, they resolve themselves. Technological improvements are hit or miss, you choose a focus and improvements happens on their own depending on what neighboring counties have compared to yours.I selected not recommended but if the game absolutely looks interesting to you give it a try.

												Right. I've played this game for 10 hours now and have come to several conclusions. Firstly, the lack of manual or even a tutorial is a bit of a disgrace, especially for such an unintutive game such as this (I had to download a manual from the internet and even that was pretty thin and not 100% useful). Secondly, the game seems to go on for much, much too long, even on high speed (those 10 hours I've played are almost entirely on the first game and I'm still probably not even half way theough). Oh, and lastly, I still don't really know entirely what I'm doing or why i'm doing it because everything is just so poorly explained. Add this to the seemingly monumentual length of the game and you have something which I now just find boring and don't want to continue anymore.Of course it's perfectly possible that I'm mistaken in some of these criticisms but I just don't know because I wasn't given a tutorial and the manual was rather inadequate.

												4 Hours.  Spent FOUR HOURS trying to get this to run.  Bink Video causes the first problem, right at startup.  Then once you get to the Main Screen and set up a game and try to start it, a Fatal Error ends all attempts.Surfed the web, posted pleas for help, tried this, tried that, and four hours is long enough.  If you put in four hours into trying to get a game you bought with your hard to come by cash, then I'd say that's giving the game a fair chance.Don't waste your money.Or your time.Hope this saves some future grief for others.

												I love strategy but I never played this game when it came out. I was excited to give it a try. Instead of a tutorial, though, you get a splash screen with hundreds and hundreds of words that don't mean anything to new players. I started a game and I kid you not I had like 10 immediate pop ups with offers of marriage and alliance and no time to figure out what each meant and what my decisions would entail. This game is way too complicated to play without a clear tutorial and a pause between each offer with a clickable help/ FAQ. Quick delete and I'll go to another game thanks.			"

												Now, I understand that this game is old as dirt but I feel I was tricked into buying it due to the phoney release date set on the Stream store page. I would also like to point out that the publisher of this game has a new game out called Crusader Kings 2, As it happens they were able to release about 20 different DLC packs for that game to nickel and dime you to death but are incapable of updating this game to work properly with a modern PC. One word comes to mind here and it is ""lazy"". What else can you say about a game which lists it's specs as requiring an obsolete operating system such as XP? I would like to play this game but I can't in it's current state without putting myself at great inconvenience. I have a duel monitor Windows 7 setup and every time I want to play this game I have to disable one of the monitors to prevent the game from putting my main monitor out of range for me when I try running it. If you run it with a multiple monitor setup it'll send one of your monitors out of range forcing you to restart your PC just to regain your primary display. Another thing I would like to make note of is how the game seems to never fully install because each time you launch it from within Steam It'll popup a UAC warning due to the fact that it wants to update DirectX EVERY. FREAKING. TIME. I bought this game to demo Grand Strategy games in general because Crusader Kings 2 was on sale and I was interested in buying it, I consider the money I spent on this game wasted because I cannot enjoy it fully on my desktop. I hear good things about Crusader Kings 2 but will not buy it now as a matter of principle given the fact that the apathetic developers of this series care only about money and push incompatible garbage like this game on the public without so much as a warning on the store page. Don't bother with this outdated and incompatible game and get the second instead.			"

												Watch a youtube video on how to play the game.... Learning curve is tough otherwise, but after the videos its smooth sailing.Picked this up for 1.99.. PLayed 11 hours straight after selecting a difficult starting position. First Ruler Dublin: Ive produced about 13 children, trained them to be men, sent them off to be vassals, died leaving the youngest alone to rule during the conquest of Ireland at 6 years old. Second Ruler Ireland: My leader has now managed to play the percentages and porducing offspring with good traits which allow me to produce bettter offspring when they marry their cousins, only inbred seems to randomly steal away my children. In this world when you marry your cousins you get better dna at times. Ruler commits suicide after going crazy and murdering family members. Third Ruler: 15 Kids, lustful prick, everyone hates him. Rebelions and assanisations. Got greedy and attacked English rebel states... Died from sickness. Fourth Ruler: Learned that killing your own offspring could potentially save thousands of lives, refused. Englands claims led to full scale invasion and ended my reign by sending vastly superior marshals and tech to put me down. Lessons in leadership, its better to kill your son than create a war.. Will consider that next game.However, if you can jump on Crusader Kings 2, the experience only multiplies expotentialy.			"

												Not for the Casual strategy player, easily worth a play if you like a relatively slow paced game and complexiety. If you have a low end PC and can't run CKII then you might want to pick this up.  Started as a Count in the Duchy of Munster. Spent forty years plotting the eventual downfall of my liege. Took over the Duchy of Munster then killed off my powerful neighbors to co-opt more land. Became King of Ireland in 78 years and then married into the Scottish Royal family and assassinated the 5 people ahead of me in the line of succession. Fought a 15 year civil war with the Scottish Nobility. Assassinated my 4th son and reclaimed his titles after his rebellion. Spent the rest of the game attempting to control multiple kingdoms.  0/10 I'm pretty sure I had friends before I started playing this.			"
