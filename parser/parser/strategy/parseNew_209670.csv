												One of my men jumped out of a crashing dropship and lost his arms and legs due to the resulting explosion, he then jetpacked into the air and used the force of his descent to crush two enemy soldiers with his torso. Afterwards he flew into a landing enemy dropship and made it crash before bleeding out.A true hero that will never be forgotten.			"

												some people might not get the importance of mods in this game,you shouldn't expect to have a lot of fun with this game if you dont play with mods on, because they add so much content and interesting scenarios to the game.in my honest opinion, it's a pretty good game, you'll probably get a few laughs and good times out of it, also seeing as how you can play with buddies split-screen, but you will definately also rage at it once in a while.here's the website of the devs and where you'll find the mods (mods are in the fan forums section); http://datarealms.comi'll list a couple that people should definately check out if they want to play this game here;there are two kinds of mods that you'll find in the fan forums; mods and scenes. scenes are general scenarios, such as a base assault or an entirely redone campaign. mods are, well, mods. factions, weapons, you name it. someone even made a filter to make the game dark and gritty, and someone made tiberium from command and conquer.-Mods-http://forums.datarealms.com/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=25544Warhammer 40K imperium of man: a massive mod that adds pretty damn overpowered soldiers and weapons into the game, but not so op that it's no fun to play them, you can feel very powerful with the soldiers, but they're not indestructible, and they're fairly expensive. one thing i should note is that with the soldiers with jetpacks you can do a dash in the direction your mouse is pointing by pressing shift+up.there's additional instructions for how to make the individual factions other than the standard blue space marines available on the forum page.http://forums.datarealms.com/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=11062Unitec: *note: it's very important that you download the 1.05 compatible version that weegee posted on page 136 of the thread. otherwise it wont work, unless you're using an older version of the game.*the unitec mod is really amazing, it adds 3 inredible factions into the game which each have a big variety of weapons to use, it's really incredible how much this mod has to offer. i'd like to note that you can enable hidden weapons in Unitec.rte/Devices/Weapons.ini and change the ones you dont see in the in-game menu to either 1 or 0 (depending on what it's already set to)http://forums.datarealms.com/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=17247Darkstorm: very cool mod with quite a few interesting devices that will light your enemies ablaze (the fire on them will light other units that walk into them on fire as well) or freeze enemies to death. the warhammer mod uses this fire mechanic as in their mod as well.http://forums.datarealms.com/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=18120SAW: you should really just take a look at the thread, the artwork that's been done of this is incredible, and it's fairly satisfying to use as well.http://forums.datarealms.com/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=20028Kettenkrad's wehrmacht: this mod. this. mod. it's nazi and absolutely fabulous. i've seen tanks and artillery as well in this mod, but i think they were in earlier versions of it. it's worth a try to install earlier versions of it and see if they still work. i'd also like to post and additional mod for this one, since it fits very, very well. yes indeed, 'tis undead hitler.

												This is the best game with a Metacritic score of 44 I've ever played.Hell, this is one of the most compelling games I've ever played, period. I never got into the metagame, but the individual battles -- where you're digging for loot so you can buy wobbly inverse-kinematics-y troops who arrive in unreliable crashy spaceships and stomp uncertainly across a mushy, shifting battlefield (partially composed of the corpses of previous troops) and then blast off in jetpacks, sometimes splattering against walls, so they can have a chance at maybe putting a bullet in the head of a flamethrower-wielding crash test dummy -- are CRAZY and WONDERFUL.No description can do justice to the joy of crashing a tiny high-speed rocket full of bombs into an enemy stronghold, or sneaking a lone, powerful (but, again, VERY wobbly) robotic commando through a labyrinthine base equipped with nothing but a plasma pistol and a grenade launcher. This is one of those games where failure is every bit as exciting as success. And the mod community is very active, so if you want to play as a wobbly, two-dimensional Gordon Freeman or Emperor Palpatine, those options are available to you. Cortex Command is a game about physics and glorious stupidity. It's a game about ricocheting a sniper rifle shot off a set of doors and accidentally knocking the rifle out of your own hands. It's a game where, when you're sent to retrieve an object, you sweat the ENTIRE TIME because you're afraid you'll drop the object down a hole or accidentally jetpack yourself right out of the level while holding it.This game is bliss.

												Don't be fooled by my hours, I played the Non-Steam version quite a while.A lot of people seem to be confused by this game. They probably expected some epic story mode or intense multiplayer battles, and end up disappointed because CC doesn't have these features. But it has something different: An incredible sandbox experience. Do you want to know how I play it? I load up a map of Skirmish Defense, enable unlimited gold and that my brain can be placed anywhere, then build an unbreachable subterranean bunker and start the game. Now the real fun begins. Wave after wave of enemies will try to tunnel a way to my brain, but this task is a bit complicated by the fact that I constantly drop crates filled with pineapple grenades and molotov cocktails on their heads and watch their bodies explode into gore.Soon, the whole battlefield is covered in body parts and debris. The never ending waves of enemies have to crawl trough a horrible mess of blood and flesh from their fallen brethren, only to be ripped apart by the next crate bomb. If this gets boring, I set up a Sniper with a high powered Anti-Vehicle rifle on a hilltop. It is just too damn entertaining to shoot out a drop ship's engines and then finish the remaining crew with a single, multiple-body-penetrating shot. The completely desctructible environment is just so awesome to mess with. When you fire bullets at the ground, you can see them traveling through the dirt and coming to a halt. The game even takes into account what weapon was used - bullets of rifles will bury much deeper than the ones of pistols.This also introduces some interesting mechanics in terms of bunker design. Depending on the angle from where the shot was fired, a bullet will either bounce off a wall or penetrate it.Exploding grenades produce shrapnel that rips apart even the toughest enemy. There is even a Chainsaw Gun. Guess what it does. Yes, it fires Chainsaws.The only problem with Cortex Command are the lazy developers. This game has been in development forever, and nothing significant has changed. The devlog is updated twice a year max, and it's been ages since the last release. This makes the 20$ pricetag feel like a rip-off, since you're buying an unfinished product that probably will never be finished. If you can pick it up at sale, though... go for it!			"

												Jesus, this game is amazing.It's like that time when you were a kid, and you had your action figures and were all like ""OH NO, ROBOT ALIENS!"" and you had one in your hand and made it cartwheel in, making swoosh noises as it smashes into the ground and looks up all like ""ROAR! Robot Aliens are here to destroy you."" And then you grab the Master Chief action figure and he's all like ""Not today, Robot Aliens!"" and starts laying waste to a horde of aliens with a big laser machine gun, but then a grenade blows up next to him, and you pull off his legs and you're all like ""Oh no, Master Chief!"" and he's all like ""Don't worry, I don't need legs to kick♥♥♥♥♥"" and you're all like ""You kinda do..."", but by that point there's a bunch of space marine drop pods all coming down to back him up so it doesn't even matter, and then a bunch more robot aliens start coming in and the space marines and Master Chief are just pumping lead into the main doorway, but then the bullet casings start piling up in the doorway behind them and Master Chief is like ""You guys need to get out of here, or you'll end up trapped by bullet casings!"" and the space marines are like ""That's a ♥♥♥♥ing stupid♥♥♥♥♥justification for a epic sacrifice scene..."" and Master Chief's all like ""I've definitely had worse."" But by that point there's a bunch of AT-STs lumbering for the doorway, so the space marines are all like ""later, brah"", and Master Chief starts an epic hold out in the room, and a bunch of laser fire blows his left arm off, but he pulls out his pistol and he's all like ""SUCK ON THIS, ROBOT ALIENS!"" and starts shooting at the AT-STs, which is super useless but it looks really cool. Then, just when it looks like all hope is lost, an inbound robot alien dropship accidentally bumps into a wall as it tries to drop off more robot aliens and it spirals out of control, smashing into the AT-ST's and sending chunks of them everywhere. One of them hits Master Chief in the face and tears off his helmet, and with 5 HP left, as he quickly bleeds out, Master Chief gets one final moment of peace before ragdolling facefirst into a mine and getting blown to ♥♥♥♥ing pieces.10/10(Check the system requirements because the physics modeling is CPU intensive, $20 purchase might leave you a little salty, keep an eye out for summer and winter sales, as it routinely goes down to $5, anything $10 or below will leave you with no regrets purchasing.)

												Awkward, Clunky, and often doesn't work as expected. Normally this would make it a bad game, but you just haven't lived until you've seen a drop ship veer just a little bit too far to the right and cause a 15 man allied platoon to break out into a Decapitation Conga Line with the power of its white-hot main thruster, then immediately thereafter crash into the pile of corpses it just created, explode like it was full of nitroglycerin, AND THEN launch one of it's blast doors across the map, over the mountains of gibs and fallen friends and foes alike, right into YET ANOTHER allied dropship, which then starts the whole process all over again.Mix in mods and add rains of refrigerators, cluster-nukes and even your very own custom gun that presumably will fire a wall of bullets that creates so much recoil that the guy who fired it instantly sublimates for extra fun. Also it's got some neato mechanics and gameplay, but you likely won't notice past the endless downpour of dropship parts and chunks of clone-torso.			"

												Down to my last guy, missing half my health and completely unarmed, facing an armored Coalition soldier with a minigun. I rocketed into him with my jetpack, knocked the gun from his hands, and then picked it up. We stared at each other for a moment just before I emptied the whole clip into him. Then I hid on a tower top with a scavenged grenade launcher, and used it to take down a whole platoon and a dropship before I finally bled to death. It was a good day.Most of my hours playing this have been offline or with a standalone copy. As a physics sandbox, CC is unmatched. The campaign is fun, but just starting a skirmish and dropping bombs on things never gets old. Unlike so many titles nowadays, there is nothing to unlock, no experience to gain, no hook to keep you playing, and yet I keep coming back to it because it's just enjoyable. Like playing with toys when you were a kid. Not since the original Unreal Tournament have I spent so much time on a game simply because of the moment to moment fun factor. Also, the workshop is populated with great mods. If you can stomach a certain amount of wonkiness and the occasional crash, the game is absolutely worth it.			"

												So - Its a side on, 2D, sandboxy, RTSishy....shooter...?  I think.You build a bunker, bung your brain in it, then call in troops to defend against / attack an enemy who's generally doing the same thing.All i know is one of my troops took a pot shot at an enemy dropship that crashed on top of him, its engine flew off hit another enemy dropship that promptly exploded sending its explosive contents flying accross the map which flattened many of it's own troops one of whom sent body parts flying back accross the map before cutting a number of my troops in half and flying towards yet another enemy dropship....you get the picture - pure awesomeness!Even nice rigs seem to struggle when the map gets a bit full - but its still playable :)Load skirmish defence - give youself infinite gold - then cackle inanely as the health & safety nightmare begins....and the body parts start to fly  >=)			"

												This is a game you'll either love or hate. the controls can be frustrating, the ai stupid, buggy as hell, and unpredictable. BUT! if you can stck with it through all the hardship it is a very rewarding and hilarious game filled with loads of chaos and laughter. The modding community has been slowing down of late, but there are still many great mods which add exponential replayablity to this great game.  The steam community feature is a bit bugged on it though, and I didn't always run it directly through steam so my time on it is actually about several hundred hours more than that.Also for you modders the game is very basic LUA and sprite graphics so it is incredibly easy to mod. I have hardly any script experience with lua and even i can do it.So if you have patience, and don't mind s little bit of frustration you might enjoy this game a lot.			"

												Okay, so...I love this game even though I have not modded it. I must have played the tutorial mission well over 70 times. Using the various weapons to destroy the enemies body part by body part is something I recommend putting on your bucket list.Controlling your own personal fedex space rocket is something that never gets old. Flying your fedex space rocket into the enemy hover ship is also something that never gets old.I would not use the word ""strategy"" to describe Cortex Command. This game is not about strategy; it's not about much of anything as far as I can tell. However, if any of you are interested in the physical and scientific behavior of rocket propelled chainsaws, this game will answer your questions.			"

Getting a few buddies together in the same room on the same computer on the same monitor (my monitor is a 52 inch television) playing either together or against one another. That's right a split screen game for pc! Which is a huge rarity these days. The game lacks in randomization for the maps but if you enjoy familiarity then the maps will always be enjoyable. How the matches play out are always different, which makes it so exciting to play. If you can afford the game it is easily worth getting.			"

The campaign seems ambitious but it's supremely confusing and clunky, and the only multiplayer is local.It's more of a tech demo and sandbox, and I'm glad I got it cheap in a bundle ages ago. I don't see how it's worth $20.Thumbs Up if it's on sale though. It IS a fun sandbox.			"

												I feel like this game could've been so much better if there was a ""soul"" to it. It has other more important flaws, yet still I had fun playing it for the first few hours, but it got old very fast. While playing I thought that some small things could've been added to make the player care more. For a ""war"" game, there's actually no deaths, no characters. Everyone is a robot, nobody seems to care, so why should the player care for casualties, losses or individual unit? I enjoyed the idea of the gameplay, but I think that story and world immersion matters the most in games. I think a story mode should be added, because no matter how good or bad the gameplay is, as long as there are characters/people for who the player starts to care for, the game will be loved. There are games out there that have basically no gameplay at all, but just a very good story ... and those games are a success!

												First of all, don't let the Metacritic score decieve you, it deserves waaaay better than a 44.This game reminds me of those good, old flashgames where you pick your clunky, pixelated troops and let them roam around the map to invade and destroy the enemy's base, i loved those!Well this game is one of those, but sooo much better in every way!This game focusses on building your own bunker to protect your dissembodied brain from the hostiles invading it.You pick your rooms, walls and barricades from a wide variety of different models and easily place them down.Then you choose your starting units from a large list, ranging from zombies to T-1000-ish killerbots which you can customise freely to wield a huge amount of different weapons.Once you've done that, you can switch to any of those units and controll them untill it gets eliminated or you switch to another unit. You can also put it in patroll mode to guard your base, sentry mode to guard a specific area and brain hunt where it will go towards the enemy's bunker and find its way to the brain. And if needed, call down a V2 rocket piloted by a drunk pilot who will probably crash, but still deliver your fully-outfitted troops roughly where you wanted them (or you just lob them from space in a box and let it crash a few metres deep in the sand, forcing them to crawl out of the gaping hole while hostiles throw molotov cocktail inside, fun times!)I must say, this game is very fun to play, Its simple, creative and action packed!Hell, i had a soldier once who faced off agains three other robots, his legs got shot of and his rifle got destroyed, so he switched to his pistol and killed all three of them before bleeding out.It's these awesome moments that make this game so great! Shooting down a dropship and witnessing the soldiers under it getting flattend by it or a squad heroicly fighting off hordes of crash-test dummies while trying to block their entrypoint with a concrete launcher, and all of this happened in those few hours i've played!Worshop makes it even better, adding in units from other games like Warhammer 40K or Halo makes it much more interessting, even adding in a few new maps is always fun!The only downsides i've encountered is the clunky menu, the poor UI, lacking tutorial and the fact that there is no Free camera mode.There barely is a UI besides the circular hold-the-right-mousebutton one which is a little confusing at first, the tutorial is very minimum, but you learn the basics of the game pretty fast anyways. And the camera, well, thats permanently focussed on the unit you are using, so no looking around the place, which is annoying if you hear a dropship nearby, but you can't see it.But for my final verdict, this game is a must-buy for people who like customising their own troops individualy, who like games that tell stories about how badass the units were in that one battle against those 100 crabs and for those who just like building giant, trap-filled bunkers for the CPU to breach (which it will, he'll just dig into the brain's bunker right away)I give it a score of 8.5/10, take that Metacritic!

												In a world where humans have transferred their brains into robot husks and an interplanetary gold rush begins, players must make the choice of either flying a rocket filled with bombs into the enemy brain or simply rush in with a dude with a very large gun.Cortex Command is one of those oddly unique games that are just meant for modding. 80% of the game's content is stuff you'll find in the workshop and on the data realms forums. As for gameplay, it's interesting to say the least. The game is definitely not a realistic combat simulation, but it definitely uses jetpacks in ways they've never been used before. Keep the throttle on for too long and you'll find yourself zooming across the map at the speed of sound. As for actual combat, it's thought out and entertaining. Things such as bullet weight and velocity play a good part in battle; a pistol's bullets will literally bounce off enemies if they're too far away, while a sniper rifle is heavy to carry but can penetrate armor from a good distance. You'll soon find that when you build your base you'll be putting down heavily armored juggernauts with rocket launchers and LMGs since you don't need them to move much (you'll also find weight is a real hinderance since jetpacks are the only real way to move) while your assault troops will probably just have that one remote-detonation-grenade launcher you think is really cool. While most battles have the simple objective ""kill the enemy brain"", there are alternative game modes available in the base game, like surviving with one troop for a set amount of time or holding down a base being attacked by dummies.Cortex Command isn't for everyone, but if you don't mind a random decapitation becuase you hit the roof from time to time and you're not super serious about realism then this game will be worth the money.

												Good but still unfinished and meaninglessly expensive. Also the game being stubborn about tell you nothing about the game. There is a tutorial but not enough. You can only learn how to move and pick up your weapon. Also reloading is on the menu, sooou stupid. I've tried this game last year and still the same in my opinion.Even though there is some lag and unpolished game experience, especially if you have HIB #2 or HIB #3, give it a shot. Really decent platformer with some tactics and strategy. It has a great potential too. I hope Data Realms will improve Cortex Command quickly (i don't think even the fans of game wouldn't wait for another eleven years).			"

												I've had a hell of a time with this game. I've sent many troops to their untimely demise, won wars, lost some, found true love (Dummy Expansion mod), and mercilessly and slowly killed an unarmed enemy troop with a weak pistol, just to see him suffer. In all my playtime is probably double what it says it is, due to me playing the **** out of my brother's copy before I got the game myself.The physics are quite pleasing, as is seeing an exploding drop ship door take out one of my men on the other side of the map (Fun fact! The doors are actually programmed to have a small chance to aim for your men... Scary.). The pixel art is superb, not to mention how pleasing it is to kill someone. And the mods will probably entertain you for many more hours. In all- in my opinion anyways, this is a pretty damn good game.Shame that the developers seem to be a bunch of jerks who made a bunch of empty promises and then left this game to slowly die with the only thing it has to look forward to is a couple of 'okay' mods due to the legendary modders leaving with the developers. I still recommend it though, but wait until it goes on sale, it's not worth 20 dollars anymore.			"

												Cortex Command is conceptually excellent, and decently functional, but still needs a lot of polish to properly express the creative and interesting gameplay mechanics that it offers. It can be difficult to work with at first, and the tutorial could really stand to teach how the shop/build mechanics are used.I'm optimistically voting this up for now. I'm really, really hoping that this game continues to get updated. This really is a great concept, and I'm excited about that.			"

												The AI is clunky and buggy, the faction weapons are unbalanced in terms of price and damage, the maps can get repetitive, and it can be laggy at times.Through all of that, the game is amazing. You can have great fun bombing the enemy with crabs, sending your troops on suicide runs, or surviving against waves and waves of enemies assaulting your base, with your gold supplies dwindling and your troops dying by the second. And don't even get me started on how much mods make this game even better.Once you get the hang of it and get past its many quirks and bugs, it's really enjoyable. The physics are good, you can destroy literally everything in the game and shoot limbs off of enemies. With certain mods the replay value can make you want to play it over and over.Note the game IS buggy and lacks a lot of polish which might err some people.			"

												This game to this date is one of my favorite games.  The physics are mind blowing---debris from ships/vehicles can rain down after you destroy it, and mess up your base/units.  It's hilarious to watch as well as intense at times.  The issue is that this game has been in developement for somewhere around... 10+ years?  And it's looking like the devs might be focusing on a new game instead.  Hopefully they keep adding to cortex command, because right now the feature I'm dying for is multiplayer over steam, instead of just local.  Right now all that's offered is split screen on a local machine.			"

It is very unfinished and lacks multiple promised features, but it has be declared finished, because of this it has lost  many of the most talented modders.  Even while still in the alpha stage it would sometimes be years between updates. After abandoning this game the creator has already started work on a near clone of this game, but which sells for 39.99$ though it of course is still in the alpha stage with no release date planned.

												Although the foundations of the game are solid, the developer abandoned the game before the large number of issues were fixed and the initial scope of the game was fulfilled, leaving it to a number of very dedicated community members to make the game stable and feature complete. Though I find it understandable that he wanted to move on after working on this game for a decade, this move wasn't appreciated by the community.By no means vaporware, but 19 euros is too much for this game and therefore I don't recommend this game.

												There are a lot of 'Boo-hooers' and 'nay-sayers' in the review section because of a number of reasons over the course of this game's development. I won't say they're wrong to hold those opinions but I will say they're wrong for trying to sink this game when it needed their support the most. The game is fun, no one will deny that. I would even say $19.99 fun. I spent a lot of time messing with the engine, the scenarios and conquest modes and that was even before it was on steam. There's plenty to do and you can even do it with couch co-op. That comes standard. Then there's the modding and that takes you to a whole new level with added mechanics, ships, characters, factions. I highly recommend the game despite the rocky development due to a miscommunication between data realms and the consumers.This was one of Steam's first Early Access titles as the video tries to describe. It wasn't a good move and many people starting blasting the game with negative reviews which hindered the game's development. Data Realms is a business and it costs money to run it so when the cash flow slows it becomes a vicious cycle of bad reviews, slow profit and slow development. I've been following the game since way back in early stages of development. I know about all the promises that couldn't be kept and sure it's a bummer, but at it's core it's still a great standalone game. The modding community is solid, the local play is solid. You're going to have fun and, since nothing can be done about the fanbase drama, that's all that matters at this point. Who knows with a resurgence of interest Data Realms could finally give this game the TLC it deserved Don't let the reviews sway you from a unique experience that no other game hits quite like Cortex Command. Enjoy the features it has now, then get pleasantly surprised if new stuff comes down the line.			"

												When I first grabbed the game, I was expecting so much more. I had watched videos and done a little bit of research, and the game simply looked amazing for what it was. A unique side scrolling take on RTS.When I actually got to hop in the game however, things went bad fast.First off, learning the controls, even with the assistance of the tutorial was a pain. They only explain the bare minimum in how you can switch out to other units under your influence, and how to control them on a basic level. They tell you nothing of how you're supposed to actually use the unit, or how to activate its various AI scripts and what they actually do. The UI is bare minimum, you have to dig and test everything out on your own just to figure out things that should be presented directly, or have better in game descriptions.While actually controlling your units, you'll find they are slow and terribly clunky. Even the faster/lighter units feel that way, and there's simply no way around. Heavy units are a literal nightmare to move around the map. With heavier units you'll find it almost impossible to reach certain areas, forcing you to use easily killed light units for everything, and only equipping them with the absolute bare minimum to assault the enemy. Attempting to use the AI scripts usually just forces them to saunter off to their deaths, they end up firing into the air blindly or never returning fire, while the enemy computer controlled units decimate your forces from half a mile away with a pistol.While all the equipment and units you can call down are interesting, you'll find yourself most times just calling down basic units due to the cost to protect yourself, while the opponent seems to have near infinite resources he can call on. Even when you have a ton of money it seems to run out in seconds, where there's seem to have no end, even on the easier settings. That and the fact you'll notice the enemy AI is quite crafty in going after your controller unit/brain. Assassinating him from impossible angles, or simply just scuicide bum rushing you, while your idiot AI forces stand there and watch slack jawed, even is they are on sentry/defense mode.There are a number of mods out there that can expand the gameplay, adding modes, areas, new factions and weapons and other things. Some of them are quite excellent, and it's to bad there was such a great modding community for this game, but the developer half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it for about 10 years. Yep, that's right. This game was 10 years in development before seeing a ""full"" version launch. Looking at the game now you'd probably be wondering where the full version is. It feels much more like a late alpha build, or very early beta. Like I said, it's such a shame there was such a passionate modding community, their talents and time went to waste on a devolper and his half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game, when the modders could have put their attentions elsewhere and made something amazing in a game people actually care about.If you can get the game for dirt cheap on sale for like 90% off go for it. Simply to check it out, and see ""what could have been"". The potential you can see in videos and in the game itself is amazing. But, the deveolper simply never capitilized on it, and now it sits as pretty much abandonware, festering here on Steam, where the deveolper is still asking money for a dead and rotting corpse of a product he will never patch, update, touch, or even look at again.If the source code gets released, and others pick it up and do something with it, the results might just be amazing. So keep your eyes open if or when that happens.Until then, stay away from this festering pile of abandonware garbage.			"

												Cortex Command is a game I really enjoy. It has complex strategy, great game mechanics, and replayability. The biggest draw of CC is it's sandbox like nature, allowing you to play around, or give yourself a challenge. The biggest flaw with CC is that it really doesn't have much to do in it, it's more of a game that you'll pick up and play from time to time than a deep game you'll spend hours with. That said, it never really gets old unless you play really often, it has dedicated mod support to keep things interesting, and a great multiplayer mode. It may not be deep enough to be worth $20, but if you are willing to pay that, you'll find a solid game that will stay fun for a long time, so long as you don't wear it out.

												There really isn't much game here. Some cool mechanics are present, and it feels like the beginnings of a good game, but honestly there's nothing to play. There's no real campaign, and the scenarios are interesting only a few times. Years ago, when the game was still in heavy development, it was exciting, and there were at least semi-regular updates. Then, one day, the devs simply declared the game finished - despite being far from it.Don't buy this tech demo.			"

												I couldn't honestly recommend spending money on this game.  I believed the latest vid from the developer, stating that a lot of previous issues have been fixed etc, and so picked it up for $6 in a steam sale, but to be honest it must have been pretty bad before if this is supposed to be significantly improved.  It definitely has potential: the combat could be fun if it wasn't so unbalanced, and the destruction/debris is nice.  The split-screen mode is one of the main reasons I picked it up.  A friend of mine who loves quirky indie games was coming over for the evening and this looked perfect.  We're used to playing a fair share of alpha/beta/unfinished Public Domain games where bugs are often part of the charm, but even this was too much for us and we gave up after about an hour.  I've since played it a little more on my own to see if we missed something, but as hard as I tried I couldn't feel anything but frsutration when playing this.If you can figure out how to work around the weird bugs, the swampy controls, and the terrible GUI, then you might like it.  In the interest of fairness, I should say that I haven't tried any of the mods.  I read the other reviews on here and they all seem to agree that you need to try mods to get the most out of this, but my issues were with core things like controls and the single player campaign, which I doubt any mods would address,			"

												Got this game in a Humble Bundle. I really wanted to like it, because it has a lot of originality. Unfortunately it seems to be very unoptimized, with lots of people having trouble getting playable performance on many hardware configurations. It also lacks focus, with each of the game modes (campaign, sandbox, challenge) being fairly thin on content. Worst of all, it is full of game-breaking glitches.To top it all off, the author seems to have abandoned it to work on another game (Cave Vehicle Engine or somesuch) and has in any case been extremely poor at communicating with the game's community. The only fans left of this game on its forums are suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, and flame anyone who criticizes the game or the author's lack of devotion to it and/or the community.This game will not be worth playing until the author releases the source code so that the community can do what he doesn't care enough to do.Update: They've finally performed some optimization with Build 32, but now it crashes a lot when trying to do scenario battles.

If not, you should probably think twice before buying it.If you enjoy immprovizing in combat, mods, gory battles with explosions everywhere and cool retro graphics, you'll definetly love how stuff in CC works!

NO!!!, Just read the other reviews about CC Staying in development for an age to then be barely released and then another similar game put out for early access.Please dont fund Data Realms so they can just spew out Beta-Content games over a decade and charge top whack for them then move on to another - lets face it - scam.

												Simply put: Cortex command is very small. It is not a complete game, and it never will be complete. Although it isn't particularly buggy, its lack of content does not excuse its price. This is really too bad, as it is very fun! The physics may not be realistic, but flying at high speeds across the map whilst blasting everything you see, including your own troops, with the various weapons the game offers is crazy fun. That combined with the satisfying way bodies blow apart and bleed powdery blood all over everything makes for a very promising start. Sadly, it does look like the game is dead.Pros: -Very satisfying: Messing around with the in game modifiers and with weapons can create some interesting results, and the gore is very well done despite its simplicity. The mechanics are Cortex's strong point by far, as they offer very comical over the top explosive action that remains organic.-Surprisingly, crate bombs. Simply learning the best combinations of grenades to fill a crate with before scuttling it and blowing half the map up is very fun. Although its technically not really a feature, it was a happy accident. I wont spoil any of the different crate bomb effects, but try them out. (Just load a crate with a LOT of grenades.)-Campaign. I couldn't decide whether to make this one a pro or a con. The campaign is a fun way to add somestructure to the chaotic gameplay, but dont expect much in the ways of strategy and story. In fact, dont expect any. Take this as you may.-Factions: The factions are quite varied. Even if they do all work off of the same rules, they all do the same thing differently. The Coalition combine well rounded and armoured troops that aren't particularly expensive, with sub-par weapons. Their main advantage is their minigun drones, which, despite being practically immobile, can mow down enemies with incredible effectiveness. When used in a group, you can punch through bunker walls with streams of bullets.Then there are the Dummies, who die in about 1 hit, are super cheap, and have better then average weaponry. Good for swarms, has good guns. Their Dreadnaught is next to useless as anything but a hallway defender.The Ronin have better troops then the Dummies, but they still die fairly quickly. They have a heavy which will actually sustain damage and has a helmet, so I recommend using mostly heavies. Despite this, they have arguably the best guns in the game - their heavy machinegun is fantastic, their m16 packs a punch, and the RPG is basically a giant explosive sniper that one shots most things, and sends everything else flying off into the horizon.The Techion have all the coolest guns and the most advanced stuff. Their heavy troop, instead of being beefy, never bleeds. They are light but expensive 0 very expensive. And their soldiers are overpriced. They do, however, have the most broken gun in the game. The Nucleo Swarm can kill anything from pretty much across the map. The Browncoats are gigantic, pricy, and have okay guns.In fact, they are so heavy they dont really need guns. Just crushing people with your face will win the day. Despite this, arming every single Browncoat you deploy with a flamethrower makes for a lethal force, as that flamethrower is... Scary.The Imperatus are not quite as heavy as the browncoats, but they have the most variety in the game. Their scout bots are like dummies, and ought to be used like them. Good for quick deploy snipers, etc. They have an all rounder, and a heavy. Their guns focus on damage, and are thus usually unreliable but effective. Their running theme seems to be load times and single shot weapons.-Excellent semi-retrosoundtrack: It kind of feels like it should be retro, but it isn't. -Charming: The game has a neat visual style and tang, its more then just yet another lazy pixelated ""stylized"" game, it uses its pixelated style to achieve more then just a retro look, it has its own very cool sci-fi flavour. The backgrounds are well done, and the spaceships and maps do have style.Cons:-Lack of content to keep you playing: If you want to play Cortex Command for any longer then a week, I hope you like mods. -Crazy pre game load screen: Though its not as bad when you dont download any mods, I strongly recommend you download mods, sooo...It can take up to like 5 minutes just for the game to start up with mods, which is bad.-Unbalanced: Whether or not this game really needs balance is debatable, as its more focused on action then anything. But I mentioned the Nucleo Swarm - there's more. Browncoats pretty much trump everything, and the Dummies are hopelessly underpowered, even with their devastating guns. Plus, I also mentioned crate bombs. You can win the game with them, without even paying much money. Not to mentioned, just stacking 10 soldiers with heavy weapons in one place and forming a squad will allow you to erase the map with bullets. Dropships can fly into things, killing everything, meaning you can win every game in campaign if you just kamikaze the enemy brain with your dropship at the beginning of the game. Luckily, the A.I. does not partake in such horrors, so you can just play honerably and ignore the imbalance.-Lack of strategy and skill involved: this can be forgiven for the games focus on action and stupid situations, but it is true that the game isn't hard to master. The only difficulty you'll have getting in to it is the controls (get to that in a sec), and mastery doesn't go much farther then learning how to control the jetpack and how to melee. (By flying into people at high speeds and using your face to merge them into the ground, gibbing them, spoilers.)-Controls: They are... Incompetant. Though after my time through the game (dont get me wrong, I actually love this game) I have learned them, beginners will have a hard time figuring out the questionable menu wheel. The WASD part is easy enough, though you do have to get used to the physics, (its a bit like playing octodad at first, expect to spend most of your time in the tutorial hurdling out of control) its the command wheel thats the problem. In order to do simple stuff like reload, you have to right click and release on a certain point on a wheel. This can be tedious, especially before you start to learn to do it naturally, and even after.-Terrain issues: Anyone who has played Browncoats ona snow map knows my pain - you will get stuck. A lot. Especially when tunneling, which is a big part of this game, you will spent most of your time hopelessly trying to get you face out of that pile of dirt. Single floating pixels and stop you dead, making you have to squirm to destroy them and move on. Every unit moving like they wet themselves doesn't help, and if you dont have a jetpack, god help you.Overall, I have a hard time recommending it at full price, BUT - do not pass this review as pureply negetive! If the game is on sale or you have extra money kicking around, its worth a weekend of hilarity and fun. Its really too bad, becuase despite its numerous issues, the game is fun to play. So if you want it, get it, but like I said, its not quite worth the money. With mods it can be pretty fun, especially the joke mods that just add stupid stuff. I did recommend simply becuase its got too much good going for it for me to say its bad. Its not ""potential,"" it is a good game as it is, it just lacks content. 6/10, worth a look, but rarely keeps you for long.			"

This game has received inredibly unfair press and reviews due to the game being reviewed in an unfinished state. Data just recently announced that they have NOT in fact abandoned the game and will continue to update! I don't know what people are complaining about, the gameplay and gunplay are unheard of anywhere else and the enjoyment that comes out of a 4 player is magnificent. Cortex Command is an amazing game, and now that the dev's are back in throttle mode for this game and can polish it to the extreme, i'm incredibly excited to see where it goes! Worth the money!			"

												I bought this game off humble bundle back in early alpha.  I loved the promise of wacky robots fighting, blowing up in hilarious ways, procedural destruction, all that jazz.  I've waited a very long time for that promise to become a reality, and I am officially bitter.  Fast forward to today and you have the developer in his snazzy new video making more promises and explaining how he was the inspiration for Minecraft and how the steam launch was a miscommunication and he's getting back on track, all while wearing a tee-shirt marketing his next game to you at twice the price.  Here's a thought:  Demonstrate that you *can* make a game by actually finishing the first project before taking on an even more ambitious project and overselling that.  At least they're telling people on the PP forums not to buy it if they don't like bare bones engines, and I'd tend to agree and recommend the same for anyone looking to buy this.			"

												This game reminded me of Soldat and a bit of Liero upon first glance which led me to putting it on the wishlist. The concept delivers interestingly enough but some players will feel empty after the game is done. It does have its perks playing with friends as any game does.Cortex command is a two-dimensional strategic and action game that requires the player to make decisive decisions in building a better offense and defense. The goal of the game is to keep your brain alive as this brain is the control center for all the robots and AI that work around it. The brain is either in a mobile suit or is hidden away in a cavern inside a base. There are a few game modes in Cortex Command such as skirmish/mission battles and campaign. Skirmish you can set your own conditions whereas mission battles have objectives (such as retrieve the chip and put it on a rocket then fly it away). The campaign is pretty cool and interesting as it let's you build up a base, conquer and expand your empire. The campaign starts with a few selected places where gold deposits are found. Upon finding these deposits, the player is asked to choose where to go. You may only go at one place at a time but can manage multiple places given you own more.Once the player has chosen a location, the player can blindly jump into the area (which a fog of war will be on) or can actively scan and place their ship as they are scanning to try and get a better location (for defense or for more gold). Players should be wary how much they plan to spend on their expedition though. The one resource that runs this world is gold. Gold is used for everything so your job is to make sure it's distributed evenly. Going on an expedition will cost as well as scanning the surface. If you didn't allow for enough money to start-up, you could be very well losing land quite quickly. Overspend and leave future endeavors and other locations without a defense budget. The computer may attack two locations (as in one may be  your base and another may be a location you're looking to acquire). It is important to leave some money for base development in places you have settled. This lets the AI portion of the game take over and build for you. If you do like building yourself, this is also possible as well as placing objects and especially other units. Having more units will make your location a lot more secure. Just don't forget to arm them! To dig or construct, players need those specific tools to do the job. AI can be assigned to automatically do tasks if you tell them to by holding the right mouse button (which brings up a wheel) and choosing with the left. Players can build in-game and with the designer out of a mission. On the battle-field, the player orders new units or supplies by buying them and shipping them in VIA rocket. These rockets can also be controlled and can be used to blow up other units after dropping yours off.Movement and controls in the game are decent. The movement is a bit weird as the terrain will rip away slowly whether you walk, fly or jump on it which makes moving itself a little weird if you're on the ground. The ""loose-body"" impact is pretty cool but fly to quick and land with a crash can take some hit points away from a unit (and possibly make him drop his weapon). You can crouch and fly but there are no other action movements or dodges to perform. The point of the game is to make a nice balance between units that mine for gold, that attack and that defend (the brain). You can do this all manually yourself and even form squads or assign certain tasks for individual units. The brain unit (if in a mobile suit) can also perform these tasks. Careful though as I failed some missions due to my brain guy digging outside of the map area and killing himself. This has only happened on scenario maps not campaign maps as they do a full circle (meaning the player can attack from the left or the right).The graphics are decent and are mostly pixelated. This is not too much of an issue if you've played games like Terraria, Nidhogg, Soldat or Liero. I personally like the theme chosen as it suits the environment well. The sounds are varied but can become very familiar after playing a few games.Overall, not a bad game and worthy of a purchase on sale therefore I will recommend it within those conditions. For full price, it's a little steep I'd say unless it really appeals to you. If you have friends, I'm sure you'll find it worth it. Playing solo and finishing the campaign will leave you wanting more. Problem is, you'll have to restart the whole process again. For some players (especially ones that like to build-up like in Terraria), this may turn you off. Good concept, just needs a variable X to make it that much better.RATING : 6.85/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ "

												I had the early alpha version of this game from humble indie bundle 2 in 2010. I thought it was a great game. It only had two levels, no full screen (or generally 'settings' of any nature), and skeleton gameplay mechanics, but it was very fun and I played it for weeks. It is now five years later, the game is STILL in an early state (even though its official release date was a couple years ago), and aparently all it does now is jump around for a moment, freeze up and crash.I'm not recommending this game because it is clearly an abandoned project. It is a great design, really, but unfortunately also not happening, so you'll just be throwing your money away. I'm lucky I got it in the steam winter sale for only a couple bucks. We'd be luckier still if another company would take over and resume development. Unless that happens, you're betting off skipping this tragedy.			"

												If you're looking for a single player game, do not buy this. While it can be fun alone, it doesn't offer enough content in the base game to justify a $20 purchase. That being said. Cortex Command is best played with at least 2 people, all with controllers, on a large screen. Featuring somewhat janky but suprisingly tight platforming and even-jankier base-building mechanicsOn top of that there's tons of mods to choose from to make it more challenging, or more funny, more hectic, mostly in the form of faction mods. If you do buy this, do me a favor: buy a few dozen crabs (they're free), throw them into a drop crate, and plop it anywhere.  "

CC is extreamaly fun and funny to play, and because its hillarious to play makes multiplayer just that bit better. the mod comunity for cortex command is awesome, as there are so many add-able factions and weapons to make it better. i highly recomend CC, especialy if it is on sale.

												I really like this game.While still technically an alpha, or beta, it's still pretty fun. Multiplayer can only be played using the same computer, (with gamepads, or a wonky keyboard system).The balance, while still being tweaked, is pretty good, you have a faction for everyone, too. even if they aren't finished yet.The modding community is wonderful, adding new missions, different campaigns, new factions, new weaponry, soldiers, blah blah, really good community for modding.Overall, yeah, I'd totally buy this game again, although, please note, the game is probably gonna be ""finished"" in..like, 2031.Still, would buy again.

												Cortex Command is a fun little 2D shooter where you play as a disembodied brain and control remote controled bodies to shoot things and dig for gold. It can get somewhat repetitive and boring after a while since there's not really a large scope of play, but it's the kind of game you keep around just to mess around with every now and again.			"

												This is an extremely amped up 2D game that depends on the modding community. The metacritic score was likely formulated in an early build and without considering the mods. For example Gamespy said, ""In a way, Cortex Command seems like it's asking for a lot of concessions because, for the most part, it still feels like an unfinished game."" Another example is what IGN said, ""Not COD. 5/10."" Just kidding. But seriously screw IGN. If you played only what IGN said was worth playing -- could you imagine? To explain how ridiculous it is to review this game without taking the mods into account I will say this. If I recall back when I played on Build 23 the game itself was like 50-60 MB in size and the mods were nearly 3 GB. That's like playing Skyrim with 700 GB worth of mods. This is an Indie game that has it's own standards and priorities that diverge, tremendously, from that of AAA titles. There are so many games that seek to limit the player into a narrow and limited vision that a couple developers had. This game is not like that. I think if all you play is the currently popular games then this game will be an empowering experience for you. This is a game that is wide open for you to change. Play this game. Mod the hell out of it. Learn how to mod the mods. There is so many little things that are just so satisfying about this game, so jump in and find what satisfies you.			"

												Movement is awkward, but as you play the game that becomes less of a problem. The sad thing is the Meta score doesn't do this game justice. At the time of its review alot of the features were not polished thus resulting in a horrible score. This game is great for those who like games like Battlezone and Mount and Blade. A combination of strategy and action. Very similar Battlezone(limited resources and the ability to control any unit) for you old timers looking for a game of a similar flavour. Problem is without someone else around to play splitscreen, you are pretty much limited to just singleplayer which just gets repetitive(even with the mods).In short I recommend this game only when on sale for less than $5, as you can buy much more in depth games for the same price. And only if you have an affinity for games that mix strategy and action.			"

												its a platforming rts, shooter game with mining and if you play the campaign it drops you in pants or not expecting you to know how to do things and the tutorial doesn't tell you how to build or protect yourself other than buying guns and doesn't give you any sort of explanation on how to do what you see the enemy AI does in the campaign mode which kind of sucks, I used to play the demo version of it every day and it was never like this. I love it to death but if its not going to show you or teach you how to play it then its just kind of seems lazy and causes frustration for me but there was a warning at the start of the campaign that said the game was not polished and needs work. I sincerly hope that they fix the game and help the player understand what to do in the future.			"

												This is a good game for maybe 2.50 but the controls are a nightmare. I just came from playing a match where you have to evacuate a brain from a base. This would seem simple enough, exepet for the fact that with the reload action being the same as the pickup action youll be picking up worthless weapons that way you down. This gets extremely annoying because there is always loose guns from dead people everywhere. The ladders mixed with the jetpack are also terrible because the mechanic for the ladders is like glue and the jet pack pushes you forward into it so you always get stuck in a small corridor trying to just fly about a meter up to get to the next section. If you try to use the actual ladder, it seems your guy will just get tired and randomly fall off of it. I didnt know they uped the price to $20 (seeing how I got this in a humble bundle a while ago) but the fact is that this game isnt worth the $20... at all.			"

												I love this game! Its like worms with soldiers in real-time plus some strategic elements. However its hold back by the lack of updates and performance issues when there is a lot of action. I heard that this game is awesome when playing with a friend (thus avoiding some AI issues). I haven't yet, so I talk about single-player only here!Sadly campaign mode with AI enemy seems broken. AI is kinda hard in an unpleasent way. You should build a bunker but realy the best bet is to raid the enemy as soon as possible taking lucky shots at his commander. Also the enemy can do multi-tasking (build base and attack you) while the player can only do one thing at a time. Its sad but the campaign mechanics seems broken to me because of this (or better - the campaign mechanics do not play well with the games strengths). It is still fun, especially the missions, but I can't keep looking at the issues and the fact that the game seems abandoned by its developer.Like said, I love this game but unless it is updated to address the issues I can not recommend it for the price of about 19$.If anything, grab it on a sale and try to enjoy the better working missions - you'll either love or hate it.

												Eleven years in the making and the game still isn't finished.Don't get me wrong, it's -playable-. Fun, after a fashion. But it lacks focus. The AI is infinately better than human players in the battlescape screen because it cheats*, and the human controls are badly implemented. It is far better to set the AI on your robots to attack, then step away from the controls, and occasionally buy new ones to throw into the grinder. As a person to person multiplayer, it could be good, but it also loses a lot of the building elements, simply because human players are not going to stick around to micro-manage base building, so again, better to let he AI decide on base structure. Also, there is no online option. It plays only in split screen on controllers. Last but not least, it also does not recognize victory conditions (All except one player eliminated). I bought this in a Humble Bundle while it was still in production. I do not feel ripped off, but would not buy in its current form.*100 percent accuracy, knows where all resources are, is able to control multiple units at once.			"

												having played 118.1 hours on this game I can safley say that this game is fun and entertaining and a perfect blend of combat, strategy, and constructionsome of the things I like about this game- degradable/destroyable terrain, construction, and rubble- the factions all have unique weapons and units that make each one original and a different playthrough every faction- the multiplayer helps entertain friends/guest, but it isn't the main focus of the game and the ai is compitent which makes playing alone just as fun as with others- I like how if you aren't great at building bunkers, there is an auto build in campaign mode that takes your avalible reasorces an builds a base for you, and in skirmish (quick game) mode building isin't always the main focus-lastly the game is nolonger extremly glitchy, in fact I have never encoutered a glitch in all my time playing-the game is realistic in the sense that if you get shot to many times, without a med bot you will bleed out, instead of running away to a corner and wiping the strawberry jam off your face like in most war gamesand so I would rate this game a solid 12/10			"

												If you like worms armaggedon than Cortex Command is for you.  If you like RTS's you should consider CC. This game is incredibly buggy but it has a very impressive sandbox style approach that lets you play pretty much however you want. There is a healthy amount of Mod support from the community and I would love for this game to have a sequel that builds upon and improves the quality of life CC.  I know a lot of people who do not enjoy this game for a variety of reasons but I love it and I know that buried inside of Cortex Command's brain bunker there is a virulently enjoyable game that PERHAPS could use more polish but it certainly DESERVES more love and attention.

The physics are hilarious and it's a blast to just play endless defense with infinite money with the AI at max spawn-rate. You can also come up with mini-games such as rocket chainsaw gladiators to play with your friends.			"

												Fantastic little gem that's easy to pick up and play. With a super dedicated modding community, busily porting over all of the Data Realms forum mods this is a game that if you're not sure on to pick up on sale but you'll always find a fun time.			"

												While people complain that it is ""missing"" core features, I believe not so. The game, itself, is very simple, containing mostly of factions, and modern to futuristic weapons. The downside was that it was not enough to satisfy the audience. When BUILD 30 came out last year, the game basically added the best feature (so far). Steam Workshop, which includes mods so strange and epic, has filled those ""missing"" gaps. The mods can range to a crab army to a super smart computer that can rupture brains, build structures, and more. Also, the physics are another thing people don't look at. Some moments in the game are like movie moments and that they are NON SCRIPTED. Now that just blew me away when I first played it. Now, if I had to have one downside to this game, it would be that if you install TOO many mods, the game will take forever to load. You should take my word instead of others and get this game, you will not be dissapointed and if you are... Refund it.			"

												I saw my enemies dropping from a done so I used a grenade launcher to knock out the left engine. It cirlced in the air and flew down into the soldiers, killing them. The parts flew and killed my solder. I came back and that wreck didn't disappear; it was part of the landscape. This game has 100% (100% is not an exaggeration. It is one hundred percent deformable) deformable landscape which means if you're standing above the room where your enemy's main brain is hiding, you can have a squad of your soldiers armed with shotguns shoot a hole through 5 foot thick concrete and wires and rebar where your squad will fall onto the brain-droid and 2 soldiers, killing them all. Your gun can be knocked out of your hand and even broken by gunfire while you're using it. Your legs can be shot off as your arm can be. I spent 30 solid seconds flying around, limbless, with my jetpack when I flew into an enemy and killed him with the impact. Dead bodies also become part of the landscape. I've taken cover behind 3 of my comrades more often than behind actual cover. The command mechanics are *extremely* unique and interesting, and the plethora of mods in 2 days is staggering. I'm sure you've exaggerated the greatness of a game, maybe even said that you couldn't possibly tell someone why the game is so good and they just have to see for themselves but... You really have to see for yourself. I believe it's still 10 bucks but 20 is more than fair. I bought Cortex Command with LEGO The Hobbit, which I'd been looking forward to since March and I've played about 45 minutes of The Hobbit in the past 2 days. Total playtime in those 2 days was 18 hours. Do the math.			"

												Pretty awesome. Controls are a bit awkward, and it could use a more friendly UI, but the gameplay is excellent. It has a good replayability factor, you can design your own forts, and set up multiple scenario types.Multiplay is local only I believe, so you need 2+ usb controllers to really do it. Overall it's a glorious idea that falls a bit short of the perfect experience, but is fun enough that you don't care.			"

												So I\'ve been playing this game before it was on steam and I got it for about $10. For that price, and for what it is now, I think it was worth it. But after hearing that the team was working on a new game, I felt a little dissapointed. I was following this forever and was looking foward to seeing it fully completed. That dream is dead but mods will keep this game going forever.The destruction is amazing, the campaign is okay but it\'s replayable. I\'ve never done multiplayer but it\'s apparently pretty good. This is a sandbox with a limited amount of toys but there\'s enough there to be enjoyable.			"

												So first of all as te devs. say, the metacritic is complete b******t and don't pay any attencion to it, now on to the game, Its down right awesome, there is a mulitude of veriety in this game, the game is just about 2D shooting but also basebuilding, tactics , simple grandstragety and much more. although I didn't spend much with the vanilla units, the're all unique in their own right yet all well balanced, however where the game really comes to life is the modding community which in by far one of the best I've ever seen in any singular game this is also helped by how easy the mods fit into the game, almost as if C.C. (cortex command) was built around mods, and it works, as for the gameplay which can dip in quality especily with the squad commands, as the A.I. can be really stupid in situations such as when you lead a formed squad to the top of a mountian and the squadmembers would just jet up and down instead of droping to the ground.although the ai can be a little stupid  here and there, this game is well worth the price of admission. 8.7/ 10			"

												This is a review in which I list the pros and cons of the game: ""Cortex Command""PROS1) Gameplay: The game has a very unique way of playing, making sure that even if you leave it alone, you will be back.2)Moddability: Cortex Command is very easy to mod, keeping the game interesting and ""new"", so to speak.3) The ability to snipe a dropship's engine: This is one of my favorite things to do.CONS really, I can only think of one.1) Recent errors: I have not played the game in three months, as when I open the game it whitescreens, doing nothing else. This is disappointing, but acceptable as I have so many good memories of the game it does not matter as much to me.If you have a spare $19.99 in your pocket, this is an ideal way to spend it.NOTE TO THE DEVS: Make your game cost $20.00, nobody will complain about having to spend one more penny instead of having $0.01 in a steam wallet.

												Never before have I wanted to give a middle-thumbs for a game as much as I do now. Cortex Command is an incredibly depressing game. It's a beautiful brainchild of a passionate person or people who just did not want to polish their ideas. They game has been in development about eight years now, and it's still in a miserable state. It's horribly bug ridden, there are amazingly careless and obvious mistakes and errors, there's huge balance issues and very little depth, and it's stagnated for a ridiculous amount of time. This game is going nowhere. It's a perpetual prototype, seemingly never to be fixed or improved. A prototype with game-breaking bugs, including the overworld map not fitting on the screen, or fullscreen causing immense lag, or you just getting stuck in a wall all the time. Not to mention the game has prolonged lagging episodes constantly.But what a fun prototype it can be. The game is at times incredibly tense as you try to find an opening to shoot while desperately trying to avoid having any bit of you out in the open, and the game is at times hilarious as drop pods go astray and crash into a squad of troops. It is perfectly viable to win by dropping a crate of crabs on the enemy brain's head. They game is incredibly silly, but also extremely engaging. It takes a lot of effort to take down some of the enemies, and it feels very rewarding when you manage to do so. The base game has incredibly potential.Let's talk about the actual game for a second. It's a 2D shooter with strategy elements. It's very hard to compare, there's really nothing like it. You have your typical base building aspects; you want a unit or two mining for gold, yet you also want a few armed units hanging around defending your brain/HQ. Most of the time you're be controlling a single offensive unit of some sort, kitted out to your liking. You have to make sure your brain lives, and the enemy's brain dies.It's set in multiple scenarios. There are a few separate missions, including a horde/defense mode and a few assualt based modes. There's also a campaign mode, where you will capture points and build bases on them, then try to take over the opponent's bases. Although, that mode suffers from the previously mentioned glitch concerning the overworld map, making it so you cannot see and select some of the base building points, making it impossible to win. And that's it. You got about five missions and a frankly boring and repetitive campaign mode and that's it. There are a few nice mods that add some, but it's just a bit more icing atop an inch-tall cake. You ought experience everything the base game in about four hours, you can add probably add another four to six with mods. It depends how much you can stomach before getting bored.The game has a very robust physics engine which allows you to contort into all sorts of hilarious positions, but it is also incredibly clunky. The menues are a mess, the characters are extremely slow, and you will accidentally kill yourself in hysterical yet infuriating ways. This is a good and bad thing. At first it's novel and interesting, then it's incredibly frustrating. Then it's a bit easier, then it grows fairly boring. There is a huge arsenal of weapons, but a lot of them feel the same, and a lot of them are somewhat disinteresting. Again, the base game is there, and it's great, but there is absolutely no filling, and there is bare minimum content. Your enjoyment of the game will depend entirely on how much you can put up with repitition and how far the bare basics of the gameplay can carry you.In the end, I cannot recommend Cortex Command at the asking price of twenty dollars. That's simply too expensive for so little content and polish. It's also a game that I don't entirely feel comfortable supporting, as it's eight years in development yet still contains crippling bugs. It really feels like the developers just didn't want to bother polishing their initial ideas, they didn't want to do the boring parts. It's like an unedited paper, they just wanted to jolt down all their interesting thoughts and conclusions but they didn't want to spend time making it presentable to an audience. Such a shame.On sale, you might want to consider it. It's got a few laughs and fun moments between the frustration of the brief experience, and it has a lot of toys for the more imaginative players. If you like weird 2D shooters with comically spasmic physics engines with some resource management, wait for a fifty percent sale bringing it down to ten dollars. If you're not interested in that or you can't stand major bugs or you need significant motivation besides gameplay, avoid it like the plague. Also, don't bet on this game ever being finished, or even improving significantly. Eight years of dead air does not bode well.			"

												this game is a awesome game, mods are awesome and there are a bunch of modifications and custom factions. some are OP like the hueg'o pack of mods (I know that ""huge"" is misspelled, but that is how it was spelled according to the mod) and ones that are underpowered, yet have something OP about them. such as the planes from GWTB mods (I am not including tanks, since for me they always get stuck on rocks for some reason) or the UNSC mods. nothing about them is really OP except for the spartans, masterchief and the spartan laser. anyways, great game. love it. also, did I mention? there is 0 MICRO TRANSACTIONS! I love games that have no micro transactions... usually...... not enough to make you interested? well, then it also features destructible terrain (literally, every type of terrain can be destructed with atleast 1 thing) if you don't like this game you are 1: a alien who is against fun 2D gamesor 2: a girl.

												Lets just say, that this game is a carnage simulator. Those that make you want it? No? Well then.Cortex Command, a pixel art game about doing the campaign or some one time missions, what makes it unique for me? Destruction and the ways you can deal them. The game offers many factions by default, but you can expand with the Steam Workshop. Star Wars? Why not. Some plain weird stuff? You name it. The game uses weight of guns and your soldier to determine ""Will you fly or get stuck in the ground?"" The combat is quite challenging and fun. The guns can get detroyed, ships get blow by rockets, and soldiers made into blood with A pulse digger. Bullets need time to hit the target, and rockets are slower and able to shoot off the sky. The maps itself aren't that big in wiidth, but is big in height, so much space for some space or mining action. Many modes to play, most likeable is probably Skirmish Defence aka. ""Make yourself a base and protect your brain with all you have"", just remember to get max money for the destruction :)Well, this review isn't much of an review, but the game is fun as hell.

												Oh Cortex Command a fun game with little soldiers running around while you command them with your cortex :) But Really you are a brain in a jar and you have soldiers you buy with the gold you mined with your digger on a planet with giant crabs  and seemingly no trees. Build bunkers towers sky bases  drop crab bombs in an atempt to stop enemy soldiers from digging into your bunker and in so doing this the crabs blow everything up including your brain becuase you ordered to many. Or play with your friends and fight with as many as 4 friends or enemies drop napalm on a seemingly invincible soldier only to miss and hit your own 5000 ounce gold soldier and ragdoll physics soldiers while you fly around with a jetpack if you do like all above you should probably get this game.

												A great little distraction for during the day, and an excellent time playing 4-way on a big TV - watching the faces and the defeated cries of your opponents under the Ronin M60 barrage is always satisfying. The only downside to the game is that after a while I noticed that whilst the weapons and bodies varied, the AI itself would usually resort to the Imperial Guardsmen tactic of Victory through superior numbers, and can be easily funnelled into reflex action after a while of playing, so this is definitely a game that has more to offer as a Multiplayer game played on a TV with the maximum players.7/10, and look, free crabs included!

												Cortex Command is a reasinably fun game. The controls and game mechanics work well. However, it doesn't feel finished. It  held my interest for a few hours, but ultimately, there just isn't enough content to justify the price. I suppose you could remedy this by going to the workshop, but it would be unfair to judge the game based on content that others created.			"

												If you like sidescrolling shooters, this is probably a choice you'd make. Cortex Command is basically explosions and bullets with deformable terrain simulator - it's surprisingly fun for what it sounds like. If the fact that the Devs abandoned this turns you off of it, don't consider it because you have bigger problems. If you do, however, like a good sandbox to keep your mind occupied for a bit, get it! It's worth it. Besides, there are a lot of mods to check out.			"

												I have been following this game for a long time, since before it was on steam.  The modding community is great and it adds so much to this game.  I love the 2d style and destructable enviornments, however I could not honestly reccomend this game. The issue here is performance, on multiple rigs I have had issues with not only crashing to desktop, but crippling lag as soon as a game runs too long or things start to get interesting.   It's almost to a point where it is unplayble.  Unfortunately, it does not matter what type of rig you have,  because this game only utlizes 1 cpu core and limited GPU as far as i know.  Either way the lag always creeps up and ruins the experience.    I don't know if there is a fix for this because the engine it was built on is old.   I don't see how they can recommend playing this with 4 friends, when the lag crushes the experience with just two people.  There are some tweaks for this online, but nothing solid to get the game running at 60fps consistently even on modern pc's.   All in all it has so much potential but It cant be realized because of the dated engine and lack of optimization.			"

												I wanted to like this game and booted it up a few times. There's definitely a brilliant game there underneath a clunky moving and confusing UI but I didn't have enough time and energy to get to that point. Cortex Command is basically an sidescrolling RTS with full unit control. You can purchase droids and weapons for them + a lot of other stuff I never saw but only read about - while mining more gold to get more stuff. This is definitely a game that you have to ""study"" in order to enjoy and is not recommended for those that can't invest the time to learn all the tricks and tactics after figuring out what you can do with all the options.

The content is so small and it's basically just one battlefield.If this game were to get more work done on it, it might be worth more money, but considering they advertise as 11 years in the making, it seems like this is a same game that was made in 2001 and was ported to Steam in its incomplete state.A few menus also give you placeholder text for certain menus that says ""the developer was too lazy to write a description here"" for a few windows. A warning in the campaign menu says the campaign mode is not yet complete (this is after 11 years).So yeah, 4.99$ game. That is all it's worth.			"

												It's one of the most overlooked games on steam, delivers amazing 2D warfare set in the future, the goal is simple, kill all brains of your enemy, with your units controlled by said brain, by any means available.. Let me just tell you, the amount of ways in which you can kill your enemies? PLENTY, drop a soldier in a crate right on your enemies units, or rockets as they fly in, bombard your enemies with napalm, or other rockets dropped from the sky. Alternatively, just send your units in, and kill your enemies with brutal force. After you kill a brain in one of the areas, you take it over, and build a base, in which your brain will be stored, enemies will try to take over, and will use any means necessary to achieve victory. And that's just the tip, there is a lot more to it, and is best played with friends on a couch. THE BIGGEST FLAW is lack of online multiplayer, which is really sad, and I really see no reason to why that is.. :(All in all I strongly recommend that you play it, and here is a video of couch play I did with my friends, a videos against AI are also available so check them out, they are real fun as well :)

												Worth every penny...Pros:- New and unexplored gaming means that you won't have experienced anything like this before (if you have YOU'RE LYING TO YOURSELF!)-Replayable as it is completely sandbox-Couch co-op & multiplayer so you can rub victory in your friends' faces-Editable files, if you feel something is too op/not op you can change that (look up a tutorial though, if there isn't one just ask and I'll make it)-Moddable, like REALLY moddable.-Runs well as long as you have more than 1.5ghz dual core (with that you can't do much though (not epic battles and such))-Encourages planning and strategy-Encourages shennanigans and good times-Encourages laugh your♥♥♥♥♥♥off moments-Easy to learn, difficult to find a non-modded exploit (unless you edit the pistol to be a laser gun of bullets (like, spewing out insane amounts)-Crabs... so many crabs-Moddable-Did I mention mods?-Oh yea! That reminds me, there are mods.Cons:-Crashes if too many mods-Crashes if too much♥♥♥♥♥♥happens-Couch co-op & multiplayer so you might get punched when you thrash your mates since you've played this for 300 hours... Just me? Oh... ok then.-A bit pricy for the game alone since it doesn't contain that much (but mods and local multiplayer fix that)-No online features, no multiplayer at all, there is a mod for that but it's very broken and never really worked.If you are thinking about getting this game, get it. It's truly brilliant and a hell of a good time. I mentioned mods right? I think I did... Mods.			"

												Some nice ideas on display,and I particularly like the digging for funds and tactical advantage aspect.  But there are so many little things that summed together make a deeply unsatifying play experience.  The movement is clunky at best, the AI for your units is like herding cats through interprative dance, the UI is poorly executed & even the digging I praised before becomes frustratingly slow and tedious.

												Cortex Command (as far as I know) is still in development and it does show. The game works but movement can be very wonky. Movement is also very slow which I feel should be updated in the future. With that being said, this game holds soooo much potential and it's worth keeping an eye on. It has one of the best intros I've seen in gaming. It's a sandbox/strategy/combat game. It's very unique in its appearance and gameplay. You basically have a disembodied brain and with that single brain you can jump between and control different mechanical bodies. You then use these bodies to protect your brain and mount an attack on the enemy. The game lacks refinement but it will be interesting to see where it goes from here.			"

												Thumbs up with reservation. If you can get it for anything less than the 20 bucks they're asking for, than I'd say with the modding ability and all of that, the game is worth it as a curiosity. You probably won't play it too long, but it is a fun sandbox type game with some interesting mechanics.			"

A warning in the campaign menu says the campaign mode is not yet complete (this is after 11 years).So yeah, 4.99$ game. That is all it's worth.			"

												Gigantic quirky sandbox. Has its pros and cons. Movement and derpy AI are the main problems at first. Easily moddable, and even a completely new person can learn to change some arguments on current items to their liking or just to see an explosion with 500 grenade fragments. The mods make this game, so be sure to browse the workshop. Overall enjoyable and interesting, solid 7/10 for me.			"

												REALLY REALLY awesome indie game! Imagine a sandbox strategy game with realtime Worms gameplay and base building: create a base & the layout ( rooms, corridors, doors, defenses), add soldiers (which also can be finely tuned with different armour, weapons, tools) & try to destroy the opponents brain whilst protecting yours, plus mining gold to supply more reinforcements with better weapons.The terrain plays a very important role. It's fully destructable, being able to shoot through scenery & dig/explode a new path, or it can hinder you as when the bodies & debris pile up, they become part of the scenery & will hinder movement & bullets.There's alot of physics involved in the game, so movement takes ALOT of getting used to, & the game is still buggy, but so far it's been extremely fun to play, hope the developers keep supporting it!Overall, if you're looking for a game that lets you fully customise your base, soldiers & gameplay, THIS is the game you are looking for!

												A lot of people these days like to play those games with stellar next generation graphics, and that is completely fine, but games like Cortex Command, styled sort of like Terraria, is in my opinion much better than a lot of games. Although I can barely survive a few waves with my meager heavy marine and his compact assault rifle, I love to see the little soldiers fight and ragdoll all around when they get hit, or crush each other trying to get out of a pit. On top of that its actually in my opinion fun to lose here, so I'd buy this if I were you.			"

												Imagine Soldat, but with fully destructible environments, realistic physics, and the ability to build and man your own bases and command dozens of troops. Excellent mod support for adding new guns, soldiers, vehicles, levels, base components, and even entirely new game modes.Also, there's a rocket propelled chainsaw. :DIt's not for everyone, but I love this game, and you should absolutely try it. If nothing else, get a ""trial"" from pirate-bay, and after 3 days, buiy it if you like it, and uninstall if you don't.It's an absolute blast for local multiplayer, by the way.			"

												My experience with Cortex Command:Attempt #1.Ordered loads of crabs to overload the enemy. Failed.Attempt #2.Tried to take down an incoming enemy dropship. One of the jets come off and smash straight into me. Failed.Attempt #3.Gave myself and others overpowered weapons to take down the easiest difficulty enemy. Flew so fast with my jetpack I smashed into the side of their bunker and died. Failed.Honestly though, this game is sheer fun. 10/10 I love this.			"

												Do u like 3D warfare?...well then this game is not for you, this game is a 2D sandbox warfare game in which u defend/attack a brain which controls troops. The whole game is based on gathering resources (gold) to buy your troops to try and defeat the enemy brain. Theres co-op which lets up to 4 players play in one computer. You can also, if you want you can get a Starwars mod for this game where the lighsabers actually work or many other mods which add tons of content to the game.			"

												tl;dr Fantastic game, buy it now.I bought this game back in '09 after I played it for six hours straight on a public computer in Kyrgyzstan. I've kept up with the development over the years in short bursts, and I'm glad to see it where it's at today. I've watched so many other games take direct inspiration from it's concept in the mean time, Like Mincraft, Terraria, and games from the X-COM series. It reminds me of playing old-school favorites like Soldat and Liero. If you like fast-paced 2D shooters, building bases, strategy, or digging for resources, I highly recomend CC as it's all of these rolled into one.			"

												I wanted to love this game. But I can't.Broken controls, it's impossible to capture any bases in the Campaign because the AI is too good even on the easiest difficulty. They never miss but you on the other hand will always miss because the aiming is sticky and flows like a river of bricks. In the campaign my opponent had gotten every base no matter how much I threw myself at them.But the straw that broke the camel's back was when my enemy hd set up a base on a hollowed-out mountain. I couldn't jetpack up enough and I couldn't dig through because it was hollow. I literally couldn't get to themBroken, and for being on steam this long that is unacceptable. Stay away from this.			"

												This game feels like a game you get for free with something else...and it indeed was in my case as it came in a bundle. I know my hour counter says i sometimes play it, but that is irrelevant as this review is to convince one not to buy it. You can play something you got for nearly free and still advise people to not buy it.Where do i start? Well for starters ""DONT BELIEVE THE BUILD 30 TRAILER"". back when the game did reach steam it was in fact advertised to its community as DONE and ever since little to no news about it was ever shared and now after a very long time. NOW they show some returned interest in a game and defend it by saying ""We should have communicated properly"". they had a long time to explain that point and just now they do it. Thats just unexcusible.Onto the game itself...its a tech demo. nothing more, nothing less and it will NEVER be anything but that.The tech is nice and everything, but there just isn't any depth. At most you may mess around in one of very few levels or the kinda chaotic ""campaign"" now and then with a few modpacks just for the sake of it. but it gets horribly repetetive nearly instantly... There just isn't anything of substance. there was the promise of a campaign with the game's setup (you are a brain on a quest to create a empire on a Free for all planet, neato). but that got shoved aside for the so called campaign currently and only a few scenarios hinting at the original plans remain.Multiplayer is a joke. there is in no way any networking capability and only if you have multiple controllers of any use...only then may you find some enjoyment IF you have the controllers and friends wanting to play...which is more often a big NO.Also the dev shrugged off bugs and ""unpolished"" features on the pretense of early-access. Thing is that most of these bugs have been there for YEARS.In overall this game is something that began with potential and ambition, but now is horribly dated and the dev doesn't seem to put in any effort anymore. I say that unless the game costs a few dollar and you are willing, to just let it pass into history and to let the dev know that he should probably just move on to something else, cause this is a lost cause.PS: Expect to crash to desktop a LOT when using modpacks. Certain collissions can cause crashes apparantly a bit too often			"

												I waited for that game so long, was eager to play with all theses robots in this beautiful environement. I even bought it before it's official release. But once it finally came out...omg, what a disaster.The controls are extremely clunky, i lose robots everytime due to bad robot handlingThe UI is infuriatingly bad. No map or notifications to tell you something is happening back in the base (at least, until it's too late...when you see the red screen indicating your main brain is taking damage, it's too late to do anything about it). So either you constantly jump from your base to your attack force (and pray your attack force isn't doing something stupid while you're not watching it), or you just rush ahead and pray no surprise happens back at the base.The buy menu is full of problems. It takes half your screen, yet is almost unusable. So you will create presets builds to avoid using the menu itself. And then you will find out the presets are also full of problems (can't combine them together, order of items matter, etc...) So the minute to minute gameplay is full of problems, but the overall strategic gameplay is even more broken. It's always very unclear what you're supposed to do. In scenarios, the game may tell you thing like ""load onto a ship to escape""...""how am I supposed to do that game ?"" ""no telling you, figure it out !"". And the campaign is in an even worse, you can't figure out what you're supposed to do, and whether you're winning or losing.On the whole, this game feels completely unfinished and/or broken. I'm guessing the designer just said ""well we've been at it for years, it still doesn't work, let's push it to the store and forget about it"". I'm sadly writting that game off. :(			"

												Looks like it would be fun for you and your friends to play, but it is extremely difficult to even move, game is very unresponsive, and huge learning curve which just ends up making you give up and move on to another game.			"

												This game is a VERY FUN game that is NEVER the same! Fun  wonky destructible terrrain and troops! I love the modding community for this game and hopes it updates more often! ALSO PLEASE add in a way to delete all your mods so the game can load in quickly and a way to put all the mods back in. thanks!The updates are either months or maybe a year apart, none to fear as for the Fresh mods keep it alive... Sorta!  Check out DataRealms' other game coming out April 15 2016 Planetoid Pioneers, the prequel to Cortex Command. Controls are wonky but hey, it adds to the fun and randomness. Also you're are a BRAIN, IN A JAR/ROBOT, controling bodies via microchip signal. Don't blame it for not knowing how to walk but know how to break dance.Matches are very different and chaotic. Needs above decent computer to run it great all the time. Mine gets about 5-20 FPS. 20 FPS when nothing is on the map. 5-10 when killing things on said map. Otherwise Great game if it had updated more often. Mods keep it alive and Replayability is great.			"

												While this game has a really cool concept, it's buggy and poorly executed. Basically the idea is that you conrol multiple units in real time to protect your base and destroy your enemy. There is a good variety of units and the terrain is fully destructible but many of the basic mechanics like movement can be buggy and frustrating. Though I'll admit the music is quite good.If I had any confidence that this game would be updated in the future to fix some of these problems I might change my rating, but as it is the updates are few and far between. If this games sounds like something you might like, pick it up on sale, it's certainly not worth $20.			"

												Kind of hard to believe there a game that's been in active development for as long as this can still be such a crashy mess. Granted, it's a lot of fun when you're able to actually complete a round without the game collapsing in on itself, but it's extremely difficult to suggest that people bother with it when the whole thing is an exercise in frustration.

												Terrible game, can't wrap my head around all the positive reviews.  Very unfinished game with most of the play-worthy content coming from the mod community. Clunky controls, painfully bad movement, impossible ai, deficient tutorial, no story mode, no point.  Do not buy this game for the current $19.99 price or any other until the developer shows siginifcant progress in making this thing more playable and dependent on their own content instead of mods.

												I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this game but GOD DAMN do the controls suck! Holy crap it's completely unplayable! Is it just me? I can't imagine that there are a whole lot of people out there who are able to actually *play* this game. Aside from the awful control scheme, the mouse cursor/arrow does this weird hurky-jerky thing where it doesn't respond half of the time and the other half of the time it moves contrary to where I direct the mouse. I count this game as fifteen dollars straight down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The worst part is, I can't even swallow my pride, roll up my sleeves and reach into the (figurative) muck-filled basin, and minimize the damage by retrieving even some of my money. I'd gladly tolerate getting more (also figurative)♥♥♥♥♥♥on my hands if it meant that I could. Unfortunately, Steam is a toilet of the one-way variety. Once the bowels have been moved, there's nothing one can do to change the situation. All dumps are loose, acidic, and FINAL.			"

												Anyone who has ever, truly cared about the RTS genre should want to play this game because it has every thing going for it. If you loved Steel Soldiers, you'll adore this.The original story line and concepts are amazing, the units varied and creative, the guns are very unique and every unit has a jetpack.The units in particular have sometimes amazing AI (units in squad will go prone if they are in contact and the unit behind them is shooting, stop friendly fire with HE) to not so good (jumping in to a cavern with a squad sometimes ends with an AI unit jetpacking in to a wall and staying there). want to position a sniper or rocketeer on a nice big spot height? Jet pack! In trouble and need CAS? Dropship loaded with bombs or rocket full of bombs as a huge missile!Every time you play, you find yourself wondering where the hell this game has been hiding and why no one came up with it earlier and where there are other devs with ideas this original and colourful.

												Cortex Command reminds me very much of a free-to-play browser based game you might find on Kongregate or Newgrounds, except that the games on Kongregate and Newgrounds are actually worth my time and tend to function correctly. I was drawn into the game by it's promise of destroyable maps and epic robot battles, but what I found instead was a buggy pile of jumbled pixels that seemed to have great potential but fell short of it's goal. I owned the game no longer than three hours and for those three hours I regreted every second I decided to add this ""game"" to my library. I was met with severe graphical issues, I was met with poorly made, buggy gameplay that would make E.T. look advanced, and I was ultimately met with the Steam support window as I asked to have my money refunded.

												I would love to play this game because the concepts introduced in the first five minutes of the tutorial are interesting and the game looks fun. Unfortunately, performance is a disaster on Mac OS X. Frequent bugs, stuttering graphics and a total lack of responsiveness in the controls make it impossible to advance more than a few steps in the tutorial, let alone play the rest of the game.I've owned Cortex Command since it first appeared in a Humble Bundle six years ago, and it simply hasn't ever been playable on my fairly new iMac. Save yourself a headache and don't purchase this game unless it is completely overhauled.			"

												This game is both good and bad. It's great because it has a unique gameplay system, random terrain generation, and a decently fun campaign mode. The bad side is actually playing the game can be difficult and it's tricky to make wise decisions to stay ahead of the AI and be successful. I mostly view this as an extra challenge, but the heavy difficulty has lead to me not playing this game too much. Overall it's a good game and it's a fun to play. I do enjoy how open-ended it is and how you can be creative with equipment and various purchases you made.			"

												Terrible, just terrible. At first glance this game seems to have a ton of potential. You have a lot of weapons to choose from, alot of equipment and a lot of gear to arm your robot avatars with, and the particle and physics effects are very neat to see. Unfortunately it only takes about an hour of play to exhaust all the fun you could have with this game. Every thing becomes to repetative. Small skirmeshes that range from to easy to almost impossible if you miss manage what little resources you have, and an overall unfocused set of game types thrown in almost as an afterthought. The multiple weapon types offer a bit of strategy to an otherwise mindless game, but once you become adept with some of the more exotic guns the game has to offer, you can abandon any strategy the game has in favor of brute strength.Playing against a human oppenent makes things far more interesting, but having only local multiplayer in this type of game seems like a rather silly design choice by the developer. If this game really took a decade to make, perhaps another year on the design table would have done this game wonders.			"

												This game is amazing, yet also a great dissapointement.  If you are willing to overlook a lot of bugs, a campaign that is by no means complete, and have friends willing to play with you:  Buy this game, don't hesitate.Pros:Physics engine combines with powerful guns to create interesting and satisfying killsHeavy moddabilty, adds new factions, weapons etc...Most hilarious and enjoyable game to play with friends thatI have played to dateThe campaign is multiplayerCons:Frustrating lack of depth to the campaign.Bases can be custom built so that they are nearly impossible to assailBugs can lead to long matches being thrown out the window as your commander randomly explodes from time to time			"

												GO AWAY IGN YOU ARE USLESS ONLY GIVING GAMES THAT PAY YOU GOOD REVIEW, anyway back to the review. Cortex command is an endlessly replayable action strategy game and now with workshop corporation it is much easier to install mods and now even more replayability. 10/10 from me ""one of a kind""			"

												This is a game that some will love and some will hate. With dodgy controls and AI, it can be irritating. But if you tolerate those, then you find a gem. A blood soaked, buried in ship wreckage, gem. And it has a modding community, sort of, and some of them are pretty fun. The Imperium of Man mod is fun. Who needs tactical digging? Who needs ""Sending in troops until it works""? Blow a god damn whole in the enemy bunker, then drop in one space marine with a shield and sword. Works every time.			"

												Cortex Command is a great game, lots of replayability.  There can be some difficulty at first when your first figuring out the controls,  but otherwise it is fun.  There are also plenty of mods out there for this game, not just whats on the steam workshop.To note though; be careful about clicking outside of the window when your starting up a match in it. The game locks your cursor to the center of the screen and its an annoyance to that end.			"

												This game is really hard to explain. It's a 2d side scrolling game where you build a bunker, put your brain as your head honcho inside, and call down a truckload of soldiers to protect it. Or you can try some of the other gamemode's, like the one where you call down soldiers to attack an already existing bunker and win by war of attrition.The physics and way people practically shatter after they die makes for some funny scenarios. Like the time when i killed a bunch of people just standing around, and put my guy atop the mountain of dead bodies as he ripped through reinforcements.The controls are awful (so is this review), but you get used to it after 3 hours really.also crabs skeletons and chainsaw rocket launchers ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												This game is a unpolished, buggy masterpeice.  This game is amazing but it doesn't feel like a real game that has been released.  Even with that though, it is so much fun it is ridiculous.  It's physics based, a jetpack is physically on you and directs you from it's point, if you tilt your torso you fly sideways, not up. If your guy's leg gets blown off you hop, both legs you crawl. Arms and legs you sit there doing nothing. You drop a crate full of 2000 crabs(crabs are free to deploy but crates are not) from orbit onto a spaceship and it explodes like a shrapnel grenade and destroys half of the map and leaves crab limbs everywhere. You fill a rocket with napalm and fly it into a cave with zombies incinerating everything. Try it with friends and it's even better. It doesn't feel like a real game but it really is so much fun I have to recommend it.			"

												Interesting ideas, interesting gameplay, nice pixel art, it would have it all...IF it were actually a game.  Alas it is not.Development crawls (to put it mildly) but does actually seem to continue.  But last I tried, it has a main menu, a couple pre-defined missions (which mostly don't work), and a multiplayer that consists of entirely uncontrolled ""buying"" and home-base creation.Unless self-imposed-rules on top of base building and bot-fighting with bad AI and clunky controls is your thing, skip it.  I really want to say something else because they have a good base, but I can't.			"

												This is what I would qualify as a mixed review. First of all, I understand fully that the game is being developed. That, and the very fun elements of the game that I have enjoyed have permitted me to enjoy what I got so far, and hope for more. The game is inventive and seems to be a great piece of work. The problems it has fall into three major categories.1) Streamlining.Its pretty self explanatory here, but when I'm trying to build bases or order soldiers / guns, it takes forever to navigate back and forth between the menus. You'll know how to get from place to place after one good attempt, but the actual act of manuevering is never easy.2) Polish.AI needs some work. The bots are at the same time both lethal to enemies and themselves. They're bad at following you,  but sometimes highly skilled at it. They can't hit anything for♥♥♥♥♥♥ one half of the time, and they're Rambo the other half. Some refinement would be much appreciated.3) Glitches and Freezing.I played this game happily with both previous problems until I was no longer able to enjoy it because the game stopped working. It would freeze during loading for around 5 minutes, then load the menu, freeze for a few minutes loading a game, and then again during play. This is a problem for any game, especially ones that aren't finished, but it needs work.Still, after all of this, you should buy this game. Its hilarious and wonky, and sometimes a little unweildy, but its a great game and its worth your time and hard earned cash.			"

												TL;DR: Great game with a few glaring problems.This game takes the best parts of worms armageddon and Soldat, and then mashes them together in a genuinely enjoyable, frantic RTS.It's not really (at all) balanced, but to me personally that's alright because you'll be playing everything offline anyways.The local multiplayer is CRAZY fun, and there's hardly another game with couch co-op this good.BIG ASTERISK:Programming wise, this game has LOTS of problems. Frame rate drops, crashes, glitches, and more! This can be incredibly frustrating when you've been playing a game a few hours and lose all your progress.Definitely worth picking up, despite its numerous flaws.			"

												Where to start with this game.  I started playing this game long before it got to steam.  It was a far more simple game with just a skirmish sandbox.  The community rapidly grew and the game it self steadily grew.  I wasted so many hours with this game and the many fun mods that have been made for it.  It is really easy to get distracted fighting off a wave of enemies assaulting your brain bunker in wave defense and have a total blast doing it.  It is also very easy to tailor the games challenge level either through built in settings or choosing to challenge yourself with creative set ups.Downsides.  The game can be a bit hard on older computers as the way the engine works requires some decent power to make the game run reasonably well.  Some of the cooler mods have effects and particles flying about in such quantity the game can slow to a crawl.The mod community is normally great.  The steam workshop though seems abit under populated given the overall size of the old community.  Getting updated mods that work can be a bit of problem sometimes.  I haven't played the game as much since it made it to steam but from what I have seen so far it is still the same great game it was when I first picked up years ago.			"

Probably the game I have played the most and that has been with me for the most time in my life, closely followed by the first Starcraft.It's pure genius. The control mechanics are responsive and never frustrating, but give rise to very wonky combat full of madness, gore and hours upon hours of corpse piling. Plus it's highly moddable.			"

												One of the best strategy games I have ever played, if you would call this a strategy game. The unique idea and original story make this game interesting, but it isn't polished enough to be called a finished product.Start with a moderate amount of funds and take over a mining site on the planet. The amount you invest in an expidition is the amount you will have to purchase troops, upgrades, weapons. A small amount is taken right at the start of the battle in order to cover the cost of the brain and remote body. If you play smart and use the terrain and your troops effectively you will win without spending much. Simply pouring funds and troops into a battle is sure to make you lose in the long run.Overall the game runs fine. The graphics are almost dated, but they don't look bad. It almost seems like something from the late nineties. Most players will be challenged, but those who enjoy a unique kind of strategy will love it. Try to start a new campaign and learn some of the basics before you form an opinion. There are some bugs, but nothing game breaking. The devs are still working on this game and there's some great add-on content.			"

												I had this game for a long time whin you could shoot your team mate and it was just red and green hearts. Still i find myself playing this awsome game the updates are slow but do to how much fun the game is the time zooms! Don't think of this game as something to pass the time becase its so much more and im proud to see the game move forward and the mod update is super it just makes the game more fun if possible and as for if you want to buy this game i say its more than worth it and for all you strategy gamers its sure to take you for a spin because in cortex command you never know whats ganna happen.P.S. Hope this helps you look more into the game its worth it.P.P.S People who hate this game only played 2 hours worth and wont take the time to lern the option weel or the movement of the factions whats the point of playing game if you wont take the time to lern it first and yes it has bugs and not bad ones, one man made this, one man so stop hateing, minecraft was a one man game and it first came out lots of people hated it alot but he made updates at first took forever as it became more fun people joined in to help him make the game just like cortex command he is getting help now and has a work shop alredy! So i want you all to give him some time and im sure the game will bloom into a stuning game if you read all of this you are my hero :3.			"

												I know this game has gotten bad press, and that everyone thinks its rubbish...But wait a second... this game has a BRILLIANT gameplay, with scenarios and techs (factions) that will keep you coming back for more. Sure, 'data realms' has all but abandoned this game in favour of some dunebuggy alpha test,but the modders can, and WILL keep this game alive...And i am currently creating a faction myself... but due to its size, don't expect it to be complete outside next year at best...Remember though, that the only reason this game has survived this long (11 years! more than most COD games!) as an active game (in a sense) is because of its great engine and its easy acess to modders...yes there are rubbish mods, but Skyrim (a UTTER favourite of mine) has MANY MORE OF THE SAME SH***YNESS!This game will live on... the real question is when Data realms asks the modders to complete his game for him!

												First of all, the positive review is based on more the idea of the game and the potential. This is because the developer has a great game on his hands here but he does not update frequently (its been in development for 11 years) and bugs and crashes run rampant.It is unpolished and by far perfect but you will get some good laughs and carnage out of it. I recomend buy it on sale. For $20 is not bad (as long as he continues to update) but not knowing the future i would pay like $10 maybe $15And let me just remind you I DO KNOW THIS IS EARLY ACCESS, i know thta has been a complaint thta people tohught it was all finished but it was cleared up that it is not and this review is for its early access, build 31 state.Pros:-Funny-Gorey-Mayhem-Nice 2d pixels and animations-4 player splitscreen-MODDING COMMUNITY!! (would only get maybe a couple hours out of it wihtout the mods)Cons:-Performance-Crashes, Bugs, etc.-Few  updates. Last one came about a month ago, but a year after the one before it...-In general unpolished (Ex: walking sucks, terrain doesnt always get dug up properly, little stuff like that)These cons can easily be fixed so if they do i will delete all of them and give a purely positive review on the game, because thats all there will be left to say.PLEASE FIX PERFORMANCE! My PC should not be having trouble with  a 2d game like this and neither should most other peoples! This is my biggest complaint!			"

												Cortex Command is a game I've been following for a few years now, even before it came to Steam. It's a gem, and I'll tell you why.OVERVIEW: Cortex command is a sidescrolling shooting/sandbox game about building bases and defeating your enemies with superior tactics, skill, and numbers. If you were to take Terraria and Team Fortress, mix in some Real-Time-Strategy and add heavy helping of Sci-Fi, you'd get this game.You control units, (via telepathy from your leader Cortex,) from any faction you'd like, and outfit them with the best weapons and tools you can buy, all in an effort to either protect your leader brain, or destroy your enemies'. You can pilot air vehichles, build bases, give your units orders, or command them yourself. There are many different game modes, each of which are fun in their own right. The combat lets you express your tactical skill in any way you can imagine. Drop a crate full of bombs in an enemy's base, crash a rocket through the front door and lead your troops in for a charge, dig underneath their fortifications and attack from below, scale a gaurd tower with a grappling hook, the list goes on. But don't take my word for it, feel free to watch the gameplay videos.PROS: The pixel art is lovely, the controls are smooth, if a bit wonky at times, (though it is a physics-based game, what do you expect?) The combat is all about your skill and how many bodies you're willing to throw at your enemy, and how creative you're willing to get to slaughter your enemies. Base-building has you express your creative side, and, while it can be tedious at times, the possibilities are endless and rewarding.  The workshop mods come in at a steady pace, so you'll never be bereft of new content. Also, if you've got some artistic skill and a little programming knowlege, it's not hard to make your own. CONS:The controls, while smooth, aren't easy to get used to. It's a physics-based game, so your movements are sometimes a bit clunky and odd. The base building also takes a while, so if you're playing with a friend, be prepared to either let the base be built automatically, or be sure your friend gets a turn designing. The biggest problem I have with the game, however, is that it's LOCAL MULTIPLAYER ONLY. That means you have to have your friends at your house, otherwise you're pretty screwed. But this could change in the future, but that's up to the deveolopers.CONCLUSION:All in all, I love this game, it's right up my alley. If you like sidescrolling shooters or if you like building games like Terraria, this game is right for you.			"

												Genuinely, this game is fantastic. the physics engine is weird enough that you can still be surprised sometimes but no longer buggy enough that its frustrating. with the improvement of the object limit, we're now able to have massive battles that can be genuinely harrowing at times. I have had moments where I've been winning a battle by a landslide and they send in troops that absolutely wreck me. I'd then push foreword and get pushed back again and again. the difficulty slider being seperate from the A.I. intelligence slider is also incredibly fun. You can set the enemies to be bullet sponges, sure, but you can also get them to be intelligent and capable of taking you down. the campaign mode is fun at the higher difficulties, but I do feel that some more content and game modes would be fun. All in all, the game is fantastic and I highly recommend it. 11/10 it has eaten my life.Also, I recommend modding this game. Although do be sure to uninstall the mods you don't want and then check to make sure they're gone in the games files, as sometimes steam won't remove them properly and the game gets clogged at start up from tons of files you're not using.

												Cortex Command-A game where you can stuff 50 crabs into a small crate drop it in from orbit onto an enemy base and watch it slowly sink down into the ground and then explode sending crab insides crashing through the enemy base killing all within its reach.I play this on a pretty crap laptop and yes it does lag pretty badly at times. But so what? I can literally spend hours on this game lag or no lag. I see people complaining about strategy? Ramp the diffiulty up to nuts the enemy A.I. up to unfair and give about 10,000 funds and now you're gonna need some strategy. I've spent ages simply designing and redesigning bases to find the best way to stop myself getting destroyed by the enemy.The only downside I can find in this game is the lack of multiplayer. If it was implemented my hours in this game would probably be much much higher. But unfortunately as far as I can gather due to the way the engine is multiplayer seems impossible. But if it is the last thing that the devs ever did for this game I would be so happy.So, Cortex Command. If you want to give your enemy a box filled with crabs as a gift well this is your game.Also- The mods are amazing for this game. 90% of them are to be found on the forums not on the workshop so make sure you go there too if you're looking for some.

												FANTASTIC GAME!!!!  This game deserves more hyoe than it has. It's unique and easy to learn. We need to stop making more and more games just like other ones(survival games, zombie games, and ♥♥♥♥IN COD). We need more unique and well made games like this.			"

												I initially bought this game when it arrived in Steam, and while I haven't played it actively. I recently decided to give it a try. The game has improved by bounds and leaps from what it was, and wholeheartedly vouch that the game is awesome with four players in good fun. If you remember playing Worms in your childhood and had fun with it. This is the same stuff, but with a sort of campaign and base building involved.			"

												Personally I can't understand the negative critics. Yeah, it is wonky at times but that's what makes this game so great. There's just so much stuff that can happen out of nowhere. For example when you order new equipment but all of a sudden an engine from the spaceship that's supposed to deliver your goods blows up, the whole thing starts spinning out of control and rolls over a bunch of attacking enemies. Love it. Also there are dozens of game modes and also almost infinite playing styles. No matter how you want to reach your goal, you can do it, thanks to completely destructible terrain. And this is what makes the game so great, the destruction is just epic. Plus characters and vehicles are also fully destructible, piece by piece. Characters wear protective armor you can shoot off or try and aim for the fleshy head that explodes in a satisfying shower of blood. Vehicles also wear protective armor and if you aim well you can blow engines off of them so they spin out of control. That's the reason why I love this game. There's tons of details built into the satisfying destruction that this game offers.Yeah, the performance is not the best when there's a lot going on on your screen. But even before the Steam version I have been playing Cortex Command for hours upon hours upon hours with friends and we had loads of fun with it. Definitely recommended!			"

												Cortex Command is a game where you build a bunker to protect your brain, place your brain inside of said bunker, and then place different types of guards around the bunker so that enemies have a hard time getting in. You then start the game and enemy ships start landing on the planet.Then ♥♥♥♥ gets crazy yo.You are waiting for one of your dropships to bring in more troops since the last lot are currently blocking up the entrance to your base with their dead bodies when suddenly you hear an explosion, so you quickly zoom around the map looking for the source of the sound, and you see that one of your (barely functioning by this point) turrets has destroyed one of the engines of a dropship. You then watch as the dropship spirals out of control, smashes into the ground (and your turret) and explodes. What cargo was that dropship carrying? That's right. Mother♥♥♥♥ing mine bombs. Mines go everywhere. You then realize that your dropship has arrived. but it's too late, and everything explodes in an awesome tornado of dropship bits and body parts.There's also local splitscreen multiplayer. Why haven't you bought this game yet?			"

												      This game is an amazing addition to my steam library. The idea behind the game is amazing.  The AI isnt the best, but the AI still can be challenging though. (Oh and by AI I mean the commander and not the soilders):). Now other than that, the game is truly a enjoyable experience. I can sit down for hours and play this game. From the variety of factions and weapons, the missions and the bunker parts to create the bunker of your dreams. Decisions like ""should I choose the coalition or the dummys"", ""SMG or a assult rifle"", ""defensive or offensive"". with everything having its purpose and pros and cons. There are features I wish to be added in the future, but still I belive it is still worth a buy.			"

												A fantastic game where you can build a bunker and then have swarms of enemies cut into it as well as blocking off many paths with their bodies and rocket parts.  Great for prolonged conflicts in and around battlefields with overlapping fields of fire and dropships firebombing incoming troops or popping open pillboxes.  The controls take some getting used to, but once you do that, a whole world of explosive and lead filled fun is possible.			"

												I really don't understand why this game gets bad rep. Maybe because it doesn't exactly have a fully-fleshed out campaign mode? Maybe because it was in development for a heck of a long time? I don't know. What I do know is it's a ton of fun.It's a physics-heavy 2D shooter where stuff like hit detection is calculated by the PIXEL, and the physics really are the coolest part. You can blast enemies to beautiful bloody giblets with a multitude of weapons, drop bombs to destroy terrain (and soldiers) and when you're done bombing, accelerate your dropship to insane speeds and slam it into anything that's still moving, creating a deadly explosion of fire and shrapnel.If I'm going to be perfectly honest, I have a few gripes with the game myself, but for how incredibly unique it is compared to every other shooter out there, and how fun it manages to be despite being so different, it deserves better than a 44 on metacritic.

												First I would just like to say- Ive boured dozens, if not hundreds, of hours into this, but only just got the steam version. If you like the idea of this game, I would highly advise it, no matter what the other reveiws say, as personally I've found the bugs that do pop up to be forgettable ,and the core gamepaly to be fantastic.PROS-First of my favourite part of this game- local coop- This gmae allows up to four human palyers, with xbox controllers, in nearly ever mission, and can also have a A.I team in there. The primary reason I got this game, and kept it, was for this features flawless implementation.-Huge selection of items- During the game, at any stage you can order a selected type of dropship to deploy units, tools or airstrikes. There are several factions, dozens of varied actors, and probably hundreds of bombs, guns and tools. Also, at the begining of some missions, you have acsess to the entire libary of content to build a customized bunker, that can stretch the entire map. The actors can be customized with every weapon of the game, but overloading them will slow them down, so you have to find the right balance. If the current selection of items is still to small for you, then there is the-Mods- You can fight space nazis with space marines. Enough said.-Gamplay- I'm not denying this game has some issues that need fixed, but this game palys flawlessly in most cases. some movment looks unnatural sure, but at the end of the day, this  gmae is a working mix of world map campaign, squad based , terraria like mining, base building,destuctible enviroment multiplayer shooter. AS much as I love it,, these features also make it a potential CON(S)-Complexity- AS some of my friends who are used to simple shooters like COD said, thsi game is a little complex. Although I think the dozens of diffrent gamepaly elements are as streamlinned as possible, the game still takes a bit of gettign used to. Which brigns me to the second con..-learning curve- Im going to be honest, the tutorial is a bit lacking in its current state, qit hzero info on how to use the campaign menu. However, after lookign up some internet guides, the games secrets reveal themselves quickly.-Clipping issues- As a game with fully destructible enviroments, actors trying to get out of the palyer build catacombs some times get indefinatly stuck on on peices of terrain, but this can be fixed with a quick zap of a digger.Overall, this game is deffeinatly worth getting, esscpecialy since the developer has stated that they have not left this game.

Don't think of this game as something to pass the time becase its so much more and im proud to see the game move forward and the mod update is super it just makes the game more fun if possible and as for if you want to buy this game i say its more than worth it and for all you strategy gamers its sure to take you for a spin because in cortex command you never know whats ganna happen.P.S. Hope this helps you look more into the game its worth it.P.P.S People who hate this game only played 2 hours worth and wont take the time to lern the option weel or the movement of the factions whats the point of playing game if you wont take the time to lern it first and yes it has bugs and not bad ones, one man made this, one man so stop hateing, minecraft was a one man game and it first came out lots of people hated it alot but he made updates at first took forever as it became more fun people joined in to help him make the game just like cortex command he is getting help now and has a work shop alredy! So i want you all to give him some time and im sure the game will bloom into a stuning game if you read all of this you are my hero :3.			"

												I know this game has gotten bad press, and that everyone thinks its rubbish...But wait a second... this game has a BRILLIANT gameplay, with scenarios and techs (factions) that will keep you coming back for more. Sure, 'data realms' has all but abandoned this game in favour of some dunebuggy alpha test,but the modders can, and WILL keep this game alive...And i am currently creating a faction myself... but due to its size, don't expect it to be complete outside next year at best...Remember though, that the only reason this game has survived this long (11 years! more than most COD games!) as an active game (in a sense) is because of its great engine and its easy acess to modders...yes there are rubbish mods, but Skyrim (a UTTER favourite of mine) has MANY MORE OF THE SAME SH***YNESS!This game will live on... the real question is when Data realms asks the modders to complete his game for him!

												The controls are a bit clunky, the UI can be annoying at times, and the game isn't very deep. But I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy every minute of this game I've played so far.The game plays as sort of a 2D, side-scrolling RTS. You control individual soldiers one at a time as you move them around the battle field in hopes of protecting your ""Brain"" and destroying the enemy's. Mine for gold to purchase an air drop of more troops, or hijack the dropship and fly it into your enemies to cause lots of destruction. Not the most polished game, but lots of chaotic fun to be had. Hard to recommend at its current $20 price tag, but definitely worth the buy if you can find it for less during a Steam sale.

												Now this is my first review I've written so yeah.This game has taken a crap ton of hours from me, for better or for worse, and what I've noticed from those hours is that patience can be very rewarding, mostly gameplay wise. I've had this game since the latest update 31 came out, and haven't really had any of the problems I've noticed others have had, I'm not gonna name them cuz I am lazy. The gameplay is probably the most open and captivating that I have seen in a game to date, and offers a lot of possibilities and methods of victory. This is aided by the fact that the terrain is destructible, buildings and other fortifications feel ""concrete"" and wear away over the battle as does the battle field, covered in blood and machine and vehicle parts, and the gameplay mechanic of orbital delivery adds a sense of urgency/excitment to offensive attacks and defensive counter attacks. That said, the gameplay mechanics build up the game, and make it worth playing, now thats not to say that more couldn't hurt, like day and night cycles with the darkness of night adding stealth mechanics and sneak attacks, perhaps a custom weapon maker, firing crabs out of a gun, or maybe water, underwater bases, water traps, water water... these of course aren't necessary but they would add a bunch to the game, and the need for updates is also a concern for me, but hey, if they are on hiatus then so be it. As for its gameplay mechanics such as controlling mass amounts of units and stuff like that it is probably the most innovative I've ever played before, I can be very fun with friends or solo, and once you get used to how the little guys play you'll be setting up sqauds, fortifying your base, hunting for brains, and blowing things up in no time. As for play and replayability, it truly depends on what kind of  system specs you have, if you have a lot of ram opened up, then it should run fairly smoothly, just dont get mods that'll crash the game, and for replayability, if you download some scenarios it can be very worth it, all in all, its a good game with a couple rough edges like not enough maps or slow moving guys but the positives out weigh the negatives from my experiance, so I'd reccomend it.Thanks for reading this far :p			"

What I do know is it's a ton of fun.It's a physics-heavy 2D shooter where stuff like hit detection is calculated by the PIXEL, and the physics really are the coolest part. You can blast enemies to beautiful bloody giblets with a multitude of weapons, drop bombs to destroy terrain (and soldiers) and when you're done bombing, accelerate your dropship to insane speeds and slam it into anything that's still moving, creating a deadly explosion of fire and shrapnel.If I'm going to be perfectly honest, I have a few gripes with the game myself, but for how incredibly unique it is compared to every other shooter out there, and how fun it manages to be despite being so different, it deserves better than a 44 on metacritic.

												A fantastic game where you can build a bunker and then have swarms of enemies cut into it as well as blocking off many paths with their bodies and rocket parts.  Great for prolonged conflicts in and around battlefields with overlapping fields of fire and dropships firebombing incoming troops or popping open pillboxes.  The controls take some getting used to, but once you do that, a whole world of explosive and lead filled fun is possible.			"

												This is what I would qualify as a mixed review. First of all, I understand fully that the game is being developed. That, and the very fun elements of the game that I have enjoyed have permitted me to enjoy what I got so far, and hope for more. The game is inventive and seems to be a great piece of work. The problems it has fall into three major categories.1) Streamlining.Its pretty self explanatory here, but when I'm trying to build bases or order soldiers / guns, it takes forever to navigate back and forth between the menus. You'll know how to get from place to place after one good attempt, but the actual act of manuevering is never easy.2) Polish.AI needs some work. The bots are at the same time both lethal to enemies and themselves. They're bad at following you,  but sometimes highly skilled at it. They can't hit anything for♥♥♥♥♥♥ one half of the time, and they're Rambo the other half. Some refinement would be much appreciated.3) Glitches and Freezing.I played this game happily with both previous problems until I was no longer able to enjoy it because the game stopped working. It would freeze during loading for around 5 minutes, then load the menu, freeze for a few minutes loading a game, and then again during play. This is a problem for any game, especially ones that aren't finished, but it needs work.Still, after all of this, you should buy this game. Its hilarious and wonky, and sometimes a little unweildy, but its a great game and its worth your time and hard earned cash.			"

												Where to start with this game.  I started playing this game long before it got to steam.  It was a far more simple game with just a skirmish sandbox.  The community rapidly grew and the game it self steadily grew.  I wasted so many hours with this game and the many fun mods that have been made for it.  It is really easy to get distracted fighting off a wave of enemies assaulting your brain bunker in wave defense and have a total blast doing it.  It is also very easy to tailor the games challenge level either through built in settings or choosing to challenge yourself with creative set ups.Downsides.  The game can be a bit hard on older computers as the way the engine works requires some decent power to make the game run reasonably well.  Some of the cooler mods have effects and particles flying about in such quantity the game can slow to a crawl.The mod community is normally great.  The steam workshop though seems abit under populated given the overall size of the old community.  Getting updated mods that work can be a bit of problem sometimes.  I haven't played the game as much since it made it to steam but from what I have seen so far it is still the same great game it was when I first picked up years ago.			"

												Genuinely, this game is fantastic. the physics engine is weird enough that you can still be surprised sometimes but no longer buggy enough that its frustrating. with the improvement of the object limit, we're now able to have massive battles that can be genuinely harrowing at times. I have had moments where I've been winning a battle by a landslide and they send in troops that absolutely wreck me. I'd then push foreword and get pushed back again and again. the difficulty slider being seperate from the A.I. intelligence slider is also incredibly fun. You can set the enemies to be bullet sponges, sure, but you can also get them to be intelligent and capable of taking you down. the campaign mode is fun at the higher difficulties, but I do feel that some more content and game modes would be fun. All in all, the game is fantastic and I highly recommend it. 11/10 it has eaten my life.Also, I recommend modding this game. Although do be sure to uninstall the mods you don't want and then check to make sure they're gone in the games files, as sometimes steam won't remove them properly and the game gets clogged at start up from tons of files you're not using.

												Would I recommend this game? /♥♥♥♥. Yes./ That's all that needs to be said. Don't be fooled with the little time I have on this as of right now, 2.7 hours. I've been playing this for years. Since Build 24. YEARS of being part of this game. Hard at first. Once you spend some time with it though, I'd say a good solid 4 hours, you gain an understanding of controls. For soldiers. It may come faster to you, but the piloting of ships took me a long time. It's gentle but heavy. The AI makes it seem like they stop instantly, but they don't. Enough about that. Review stuff, that's why you're still reading this wall of text.Positives!- Sandbox. So many ways to play this, I can't say I've had a game go the same way. Ever.- Hardcore gameplay. It's not for the average person looking to waste some time, unless of course you want to watch your own units die to the random ship failures.- CRABS! Have you ever dropped a green box crammed full of alien crabs? Doubt it! But you want to now, don't you? DO IT. Never before have you seen the world shift into a lagtastic slow-mo while everyone around the impact site turns into a puddle of red goo as crab shells rain down over the battlefield!- It's still in development!  You'll be seeing builds faster than I did, and that's exciting, because this game needs more love! Keep it up Data!- Mods, Mods, Mods! Hit up the workshop and add some things! And if you go to the DataRealms forums, you can hit up the modding community where it started. The latter is a manual installation, but it's a simple folder into another one.Negatives. (Are there any? Maybe.)- Fullscreen is a total pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get to work, and the normal size for the screen is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to look at.- Learning curve. A lot of games have them, but the controls are a little weird with this. The Pie menu isn't as sensitive as I'd want it, but it does what it needs to once you remember where things are located on it.I wanted to think of more negatives, but I just can't. TL;DR: BUY THE GAME. CRAB BOMBS. SHIP DEBRIS FRIENDLY FIRE. BLOOD SHOWERS. BULLET CASING PILES.10/10 would spend 20oz of gold to cram 500 crabs into a green box and drop it from orbit, killing all life in a 500 miles radius.			"

												First of all, the positive review is based on more the idea of the game and the potential. This is because the developer has a great game on his hands here but he does not update frequently (its been in development for 11 years) and bugs and crashes run rampant.It is unpolished and by far perfect but you will get some good laughs and carnage out of it. I recomend buy it on sale. For $20 is not bad (as long as he continues to update) but not knowing the future i would pay like $10 maybe $15And let me just remind you I DO KNOW THIS IS EARLY ACCESS, i know thta has been a complaint thta people tohught it was all finished but it was cleared up that it is not and this review is for its early access, build 31 state.Pros:-Funny-Gorey-Mayhem-Nice 2d pixels and animations-4 player splitscreen-MODDING COMMUNITY!! (would only get maybe a couple hours out of it wihtout the mods)Cons:-Performance-Crashes, Bugs, etc.-Few  updates. Last one came about a month ago, but a year after the one before it...-In general unpolished (Ex: walking sucks, terrain doesnt always get dug up properly, little stuff like that)These cons can easily be fixed so if they do i will delete all of them and give a purely positive review on the game, because thats all there will be left to say.PLEASE FIX PERFORMANCE! My PC should not be having trouble with  a 2d game like this and neither should most other peoples! This is my biggest complaint!			"

												A game to be played with mods and no seriousness in mind. Due to its excellent physics engine, no two games will ever be the same and it's alway entertaining to see the map littered with ships and bodies, creating new terrain. Using guns is extremely satisfying as the variety is huge and they all have a nice kick to them.Unfortunately, the developer decided to release this game without polishing it first so it suffers from quite a few bugs and A.I., while competent during first half of the game, doesn't have any idea how to manage money and always ends up defenseless.

												The downside of this game is it feels rather limiting in some aspects. I don't really know what I mean by that... There's just a few things I'd like to do that I can't. Example, playing in a base between campaign battles. It would be nice to have a chance to dig out some debris and damage between battles, because you can only do that when under attack, and as a result of all the bodies I leave in my wake, doors end up getting broken. The base contruction could use more components as well. Some of the ""odds and ends"" have a left piece, but not a right piece, and vise versa. But that's just really knit-picky on my end.I love the concept, the plot, the art, the mechanics, the smoothness, the modding potential... There's so much that makes this game incredibly addictive. The Campaign is great. It has a board-game feel to it, like Risk. Triumphing against your enemies is really satisfying, especially when you come up with a clever stratagy (Tactical Skele-Brigade Strike FTW!).  The scenarios are great fun as well. I say this game is a great investment, and the devs should be proud of this work of art.			"

												I've followed Cortex Command since long before the day it was availible on Steam. I've always been fascinated in the intricate physics system, and how literally every single pixel has it's own properties outside of being purely visual.I feel like this isn't as appreciated as it should be, but really, the fact that Cortex Command has split screen local multiplayer is SO GREAT. Just as the intro screen says, just grab some buddies and controllers, and you've got yourself a mighty fine party game.While there are bits about it that are ridiculously unstable, there's always so much going on in any game that I can't help but to laugh whenever characters randomly explode into bits for absolutely no reason. With the modability of the game and the integration with Steam Workshop, there are some seriously fun gamemodes and  additions out there to work with to keep the game fresh, action packed, and at times... just... really weird.10 spontaneously combusting Coalition soldiers out of 10.

												One of the best strategy games I have ever played, if you would call this a strategy game. The unique idea and original story make this game interesting, but it isn't polished enough to be called a finished product.Start with a moderate amount of funds and take over a mining site on the planet. The amount you invest in an expidition is the amount you will have to purchase troops, upgrades, weapons. A small amount is taken right at the start of the battle in order to cover the cost of the brain and remote body. If you play smart and use the terrain and your troops effectively you will win without spending much. Simply pouring funds and troops into a battle is sure to make you lose in the long run.Overall the game runs fine. The graphics are almost dated, but they don't look bad. It almost seems like something from the late nineties. Most players will be challenged, but those who enjoy a unique kind of strategy will love it. Try to start a new campaign and learn some of the basics before you form an opinion. There are some bugs, but nothing game breaking. The devs are still working on this game and there's some great add-on content.			"

												There are not any games like this out there that I can find. This is a true original idea. I am VERY impressed.I have been playing this game for a little while now. I watched a few videos on youtube to learn some of the gameplay and also because this game is so fun to watch.When I started playing myself I was really impressed with some of the technology used in this game. I program games myself and some of the things these guys are doing are very impressive. The fact that all terrain is destructible and that the ai can actually find its way around in underground dugup tunnels is awesome! That path finding is impressive!Heres my ratings:Game play: 5/5 (very fun)Music and sounds: (5/5 well done)Graphics: 4/5 (they are 2D but literally 3D would make this not as good)Multiplayer: 3/5 (From what I can tell it is only local multiplayer)Cons:-If there's one thing that can make this better it would be Multplayer not restricted to local. Figure it out guys.-Get some procedural generation code in there for the maps. Right now you tend to play on the same maps. It can get old after many hours of single player.If you add those two things to this game it would be worth 30 bucks and would be my new favorite game.Great job guys.			"

												      This game is an amazing addition to my steam library. The idea behind the game is amazing.  The AI isnt the best, but the AI still can be challenging though. (Oh and by AI I mean the commander and not the soilders):). Now other than that, the game is truly a enjoyable experience. I can sit down for hours and play this game. From the variety of factions and weapons, the missions and the bunker parts to create the bunker of your dreams. Decisions like ""should I choose the coalition or the dummys"", ""SMG or a assult rifle"", ""defensive or offensive"". with everything having its purpose and pros and cons. There are features I wish to be added in the future, but still I belive it is still worth a buy.			"

												This is a nice Indie game that could easily be overlooked. Everything about it screams retro side scroller, however I was pleasantly suprized to see alot of interesting gameplay mechanics. It's part castle defense, part RTS, part contra style shootem up. If any of these things sound appealing to you this may just be your game: building the most inpenitrable base, sending waves of units to take out an enemy base, or Running around blowing limbs of scores of baddies, Resourse management and development, or sitting back and letting the computer do it for you. The game is based in a very distant future where people's brains controll robotic legions to fight over resources. Everything about the game can be found in its opening cutscene (which might i add is freaken awsome) The core gameplay revolves around you Brain... both literally and virturally represented. The brain is either a moving robot or a static part of your defense that controlls all other actors and units. Its pretty simple kill the Brain, win the game. Initially when you occupy a planet at the same time as an opponet your brain will be air assaulted in with a few minor units ( In most cases a mobile sentry with anti arcraft rocket) From there you can call in additional units expending a gold resource that can be mined. Once a plannet is in your controll you can put your gold into building your dream base or have the computer do it for you. In the campain you set the number of factions and faction types along with the number of brains they have. Once all the brains are gone you win... or loose. Lets move on to the actors/units you can rain firery death with.There are a few tarting factions in the game ( which can be expanded with player made mods) Each faction has a pool of troops (actors) weapons, tools, and aircraft to choose from. In the campaing by selecting a certain faction gives you a discount towards thier troops and gear, however you are not constrained to just that faction type. When your brain calls up troops you'll have a window that you may select the troops and thier eqipment. You start of with how they get thier, what troop type, and eqipment thier carrying. The initial equipment and weapons is expansive, with every weapon and tool verying greatly between eachother. A unit can hold many weapons and tools and freely switch between them on the fly, however if you load up on to much you cant fly... This brings me to another point. All your units are equiped with jet packs. This is both awesome and fustrationg as menuvering your flyboys and girls cand take some practice; and will most likely end up with your trooper splattered against a wall or something. Its almost like Tribes meets Contra. The combat in this game can be pretty intertaining. All troops have body parts that can be blown off with well aimed shots; can make them beguin to bleed out or not. Another option is shooting the weapons out of enemies hands. The RTS aspect lets you select a groop of actors and set them on a patroll, Guard, Brain hunt mode, or designated points. You can also form a squad and have them move together and/or follow you. This is a pretty interesting aspect and gives the game some depth and versitility. If you feel like being rambo you can,  want to dropp in with an expensive hit team into the heart of the enemy defenses you can, or if You just want to send wave after wave of troops while you mine for gold Terraria style to fund it YOU CAN! This is a very enjoyable game and has many interesting elements not utilized by other games. It is however not without its faults. The AI can be less desirable at times, as in getting stuck or just flat out non responsive. The game has a tendency to crash when overloaded with actors in the campain feature. The campain is very easy even on hard difficulty and there are many ways of rigging your planet to be niegh impenitrable. It would be a great improvement if you could choose to drop a couple bombs on key locations before your very vulnerable brain drops from the heavens just to get shot down my spammed rocket infantry. All in all this is a great indi game and well worth a few bucks just to experience an outside the box game. It didnt have the backing of a AAA design team, yet still happens to pack some oomph.			"

Don't be scared by the price of this game. This game is amazing! Iv'e been supporting these guys since it first came  to beta on their website. All I can say is this game will get far in the game industries. It's very fun and hilarioius. 10/10! Its so easy to create custom user content. The coding template of this game is easy as well. This game is not out there yet. Not many people know about it. I would like to keep it like that. If you think you can handle a game that is very thrilling and intense when it comes to fighting. This game is for you! [ Owned this game before it was on steam :) ]			"

												Back in my young college days there was a downloaded version of this game going around amongst my friends (I really wanted to buy it but couldn't spare even the small amount of money required). At the time it was an unfinished sandbox where you basically downloaded mods and shoot crazy guns and stuff at terrible AI that practically just stood there.Now there's actually a game here. The campaign consists of taking and defending territories while competing with up to 3 othere AI players. You pick a place and if anyone challenges you for it you fight for it. Once you take it you can either design your own base within it, or pick a budget and let the game build one for you. I found designing things to be a little unfriendly because i wasn't sure what everything was, and it can take a lot of time depending on how crazy you want to get. Considering that at the moment the campaign doesn't usually last a long time depending on how good you are and the settings you choose I didn't feel compelled to do it. Additionally you'll be taking over several bases over the course of the game and it would be insane to manually build each one unless you were really quick. However, the autobuilding feature of the game tends to build some pretty decent looking bases. The problem is that each day you give the computer a budget for your base and then it decides how to spend the money and in what order. This means over time the base will get better but at the beginning you might have a pretty incomplete base. When you get attacked and you have an incomplete base, it can be nearly impossible to protect.The actual battles are where the game shines. You start with a brainbot or if you have a base he might just be a brain in a jar. He's basically your commander and if his fragile brain jar gets destroyed then its game over. I usually send him down to dig for gold while i let my other units guard him. This game is a physics based game where each pixel acually has its own properties. Units are actually made up of connected parts that move and interact based on their physics. This means that every part of a character can be blown off and every spec of dirt or other material has its own properties that can be deformed. Bullets go through softer objects and ricochet off harder ones. Rockets all have their own forces and when they explode they shred into pieces that can effect characters around the environment.This game is run by gold and every unit is bought and dropped into your scene through the buy menu that will let you customize the unit and what it's carrying. generally they all have jetpacks, and weight matters so you dont want to bog a guy down too much otherwise he'll get stuck a lot and won't be able to jetpack too high.Once a unit is called down you can take control of him and use his arsenal to take out other units and hopefully their brain. This is the part thats both amazingly fun, hilarious, and sometimes frustrating. The AI has gotten pretty smart at navigating around the levels and everyone is so fragile it can get pretty difficult, but in a good way. Especially when you're outnumbered and units are getting close to your brain. Having to fend off guys while simultaneously trying to buy and call down more units can be really tense. Especially because you're always working within a changing budget. Juggling shooting things, buying things, and budgetting can be pretty crazy at times.But the real craziness comes from the Cortex Command moments you'll experience. Blowing up dropships and having them rollover and land on top of the guys they just dropped off, then exploding is always awesome. Jetpacking out of control and then smashing into 3 enemy NPCs and watching everyone explode is hilarious. Sniping a guy from long range and watching his parts just fly off is super satifying, and if you get your hands on a rocket launcher, you're in for some serious entertainment. These moments almost never get old, and will keep you playing this game for hours on end. Even when you totally fail the simplest task and all these things happen to you, its still hilarious. And when you get bored? There are a bunch of great secenarios and community made mods on the steam workshop that will keep the game fresh. weegee's unmapped lands 2 mod is a really great conversion of the campaign and probably more fun than the vanilla game itself. He even has his own interpretation of FTL in the CC world that's worth checking out.I'll be honest, this game has a bit of a learning curve. In the current state I'm reviewing this game it's unfinished. The developer has admitted that all the features are in the game, they just arent polished, and thats true. There is a tutorial that does an okay job of teaching you the basics of combat and mining gold, but as far as the campaign part of the game goes, there's basically no guidance at all. The community has made up for this though. In it's current state it's a game you can sit down and play for 15mins or 5 hours. However, you can really see the potential of the game, and it can really only get better from here on out. It's a great game to add to your collection, play until your burnt out, forget about it for a year or two, and then play it until your burnt out again. It's that solid and that evergreen. You'll never get tired of blowing things up.Like the developer says in the video on the Store page. This game reviewed several years ago by alot of major sites in was was obviously an unfinished state. I'm not sure of the specific circumstances behind that, but this isnt the same game it was then. I'd argue it wasn't even a game then. Now it is, but still unfinished. The message here is, don't believe the major reviews or metacritic score. Read the reviews on steam. Everyone is recommending it, just like myself. "

												I love this game. Never before have I played a game where you can design a bunker, set up turrets inside, and call down troops from dropship, each soldier chosen and customely outfitted by YOU. The entire game is physics based. The walking, flying, climbing, and crawling, is done with your own characters 2 hands and 2 feet. Also, the plethora of mods, secenarios, and minigames make this game fun as hell even if you exhausted the vanilla game. Most of the major problems this game had before (Stupid AIs couldn't follow through with orders, Glitches, and movement errors) have been fixed. The new squad system has made the AI competent at organizing troops. You can create a squad to attack the enemy base, and turn around and focus protecting your own.  Just bringing down soldiers is awesome. Nothing is as beautiful as several dropships floating down from the sky, with AA missiles rising up to meet them. The game is just so versatile. Need to clear an enemy bunker? Send in masses of cheap robots, clones, or zombies, or send in a heavily armed squad of tough elite units, or fricking have crash test dummies go the long way around dig through the walls to eliminate their defenseless commander.This game is special. It's mechanics are something I have never seen before, and don't think I'll see again for a along time.			"

												There are two things that really makes Cortex Command shine: The physics, which applies to anything that is active, and even to terrain to a certain degree, and the near-absolute modding freedom. Everything except the very core of the game can be modified, and you can also create your own content. Even the core is starting to get exposed with the new Lua compatibility! These mods can be anything from a simple pistol to a hypercharged giant walker with a cannon that can blast half the level away and so on. With your wobbly legged brain-robot you must destroy the enemies brain or on other modes... Faceplant into the ground, blow yourself up, snipe someone without legs, and ALOT more craziness. This game is one of my all-time favorites and will always be.			"

												I can say that this is one of my favorite indie games of all time, don't be fooled by how many hours it says I've played because I had the non-steam version before this a pours dozens of hours into that as well. It's perfect in the way that you can spend hours customizing your load out and saving them so you can use them in different missions and in the way you take your time to build your base the best possible way.

In several attempts to even get the tutorial started (which mind you, told me how to do nothing in the overcomiclicatied garbage I was thrusted into for the few seconds I could actually maintain control) I finally decided that this game was my biggest waste of money for 2016 and its still February.

												I can say that this is one of my favorite indie games of all time, don't be fooled by how many hours it says I've played because I had the non-steam version before this a pours dozens of hours into that as well. It's perfect in the way that you can spend hours customizing your load out and saving them so you can use them in different missions and in the way you take your time to build your base the best possible way.

												Note: I've played well over 300 hours in this game offline and off-steam in the 5 years I've been playing.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fun games with a bit of strategy.Serving suggestion: This game is best served with a 3 gigabyte helping of mods. These can be found on the workshop.GAMEPLAYYou play on a 2D sideview map usually with your brain and the enemy's brain having to dig gold and purchase different 'actors' to be delivered from orbit for you to use to attempt to destroy the enemy brain.The physics in this game are very detailed and very important to winning. However, it may also be the thing that turns some people off. It makes movement feel somewhat 'heavy' and can be frustrating to get the hang of. But once you figure it out you'll be flying (yes everyone gets a jet pack) the body of your recently de-limbed trooper into the face of the enemy, hopefully decapitating them with the force... or maybe knocking the gun out of their hand... or the enemy might just laugh and shoot your face off.All in all this style is easy to understand and very fun to execute due to the large amount of actors and equipment you can choose from. However some things like the grappling gun and repeller gun are not very useful or practical in normal games.STORYNot much here. We're a bunch of space brains with unlimited armies at our backs that are ready and willing to blast each other for gold.GRAPHICSThe graphical style is wonderfuly done pixel art that isn't to pixely and is pixely enough it doesn't look cheap. It has just the right amount of detail to fantasticaly render every body part and machine piece as they explode and pile up on the map.CONCLUSIONThis is definently THE funnest game I have ever played in my life. The entertainment value is endless due to the active modding community and making mods yourself isn't that hard. It certainly won't disappoint if you can get used to the controls.			"

												This game is something special. It's a 2d realtime combat strategy. Everything is destructible to the pixel, and there's a physics engine at work as well. Shoot a human and they can lose limbs or bleed out. The environment is destructible, and the factions and setting is pretty interesting. Overall, a very unique and entertaining game. Those who like it tend to stick with it for years, it has somewhat of a cult following.I will say though, that if you're looking for a game that is amazing right out of the box, this might not be for you. Mods really allow this game to shine, and I would say that this game is only worth playing if you're willing to collect some mods for it. Void walkers adds an awesome campaign, and with a few others you can add thousands of new weapons, vehicles, and factions. I can't stress this point enough: mods turn this game from 'just ok' to 'using a lightsaber to deflect bullets back at the master chief while your psychic brain robot telekinetically rips peoples arms off'. 10/10, would play for a decade straight again			"

												When I first heard about this game I was kinda confused. (It was not on steam back then). So I investigated a bit. And found out that this game is SO MUCH FUN, but yet missing something.This game is great and I would recommend buying this game on steam sale. Its gonna make you laugh a lot and even more when you download some mods from the workshop. I abolutely love it. When you play it with more people splitscreen its even more fun.But the fact that this game was left unfinished makes me sad. Developers did some major updates. But the game still feels like it would need some polish. Not to the actual engine. But just overall. It got better, I know. But still. Now Data Realms are focusing on ""Space pioneers"" which is an awesome game now in development with the 2DCrush engine. Looking foward to that as well :)Anyway, great game, great community, great developers, but then could've made the game a bit better. :)			"

YouTube™ Video: Cortex Command Review 

			Views: 928		

			http://www.keengamer.com Cortex Command is a Sandbox RTS game crafted by the folks at Data Realms. Check our video review because Data Realms did not give up on their vision, and we applaud them for...		

I’ve poured in almost 70 hours into Cortex Command with no end in sight.  This may perplex you as Cortex Command was released in 2012 with… mostly negative reception.  However, the developers did not give up this project and have justified the 20 dollar price tag.  I’m usually not one to become obsessed with complicated games, but this game that has consumed me and make hours pass by like minutes.  	The story is a great backdrop for a sci-fi sandbox game, and set up the great motives for why you’re doing what you’re and that makes it good. When Earth ends, Cortex Command’s story begins.  Earth had become a viciously dark place, and the only choice the human race had was to leave.  From our evolution we cast aside our insignificant bodies as our brains alone, were capable to control multiple bodies in tandem.  This made it effortless to leave earth as we were literally just brains that could be transported easily.  When reaching the deep edges of space, we as a species learned that we were not alone as well as not important.  After some growing pains, we all adjusted to the alien life.  However, resources were depleting quickly and species started looking towards other systems which will hold the setpiece for a lawless, wild west type gold rush.  The artstyle of Cortex Command is similar to sidescrolling 2D indie games like Terraria, but it leans more on its physics engine to be pleasing on its technical side. The pixel art blossoms, and the physics are heavy and satisfying.  Robots have a similar weight to the B.U.D. in Grow Home, mechs look like controlling hulking metal, and mining in the completely destructable environments beholds an ambitious animation proposition that is executed perfectly.The music is a magically airy chiptune selection.  It sets the atmosphere perfectly, and is a great background to the hundreds of hours you will spend plowing through the wasteland.  Have you ever played StarCraft?  In a sense, Cortex Command is the same idea.  Two bases build themselves up as they slowly try to frame their offensive attack to take out the other player. Instead of controlling multiple units at once, you simultaneously control and give commands to singular units one after another with the flick of a button. You land on a planet and build your base to defend your brain, the juggling and resource management is satisfying and immensely rewarding as you choose whether to attack or defend.  You can allot credits to have more possibilities as you mine for gold and build up your weapons.  Planetary scuffles can either swelter to a grand strike after multiple hours or a swift contest mere seconds into the match.  Jetpacks allow verticality and become weildly after a few hours with it’s amusing physics build. Keep a FAQ in hand however, as the games tutorials can be complicated and enigmatic.Cortex Command is a Sandbox RTS game crafted by the folks at Data Realms, which is available for 19.99$ on Steam and Data Realms website. I purely suggest that you wait for a Steam sale and order multiple copies to gift to friends, as it’s very pleasant when playing with others.   Data Realm did not give up on their vision, and I applaud them for slowly improving Cortex Command into the game it is today.  Cortex Command is a game, that’s great for those who are looking for that new addicting game that stretches your dollar for hours upon each cent. "

												By and large, i get it. The game is intense, and fast paced, tactical, and has lots of excellent elements.But the controls are absolutely garbage. It's like trying to turn a car on minnesota roads covered in slush.The reticle system for the interface is also garbage. You have to look at the guys head to determine which direction hes gonna go. Shooting isn't toooooo bad. Thank goodness.But the controls just make the game overly hard and unenjoyable. Which is too bad, It looked REALLY promising.			"

												Cortex Command is an odd case. Having spent much of its time in development Hell and being released on Steam in what many believe to be an incomplete state, it's not hard to understand why the game gets a bad rap.However, underneath the bugs and quirks lies an indie title that does things quite a bit differently from others. It's not right to call it another 2D platformer or ""a shooter trying to be Terraria"". It's something of its own.Firstly, Cortex Command offers a simple and yet versatile file structure that allows an enormous range of mods. If the game bugs you one way or you want something in the game that isn't there, you're practically encouraged to do so. On its official forums, an enormous range of already-completed mods can be found, allowing those unskilled in development to pick and choose from the wealth of community additions.Second, the game offers something distinctly different from other games. It blends strategy and action together in an odd, yet enjoyable package, allowing the player to order new troops to fight their battles and manually take control of individual units to help swing the tide of battle. Indeed, it is entirely possible to win most scenarios by picking the right selection of equipment and going it alone - though it may be quite difficult, especially if one uses the frail brain robot for this task.Detailed terrain deformation and physics offer creative ways of manipulating the battlefield or assaulting enemy positions, where literally everything can be blasted, drilled, or bashed open with the right tools. Roughly everything is physically simulated, from sprays of dirt from a mining tool to an infantryman's legs in motion and even the debris from a destroyed aircraft.Which brings us to my third point. Cortex Command is, quite simply, comedy gold at times. Fighting off an enemy invasion with an armless and legless meatball of a man, using his sheer weight as his weapon, is entirely possible. Crashing a dropship full of crabs into a well-planned defensive wall and watching the gibs from the explosion kill everything in a half-mile radius is more than an infrequent occurrence - even if crabs aren't buyable in the campaign anymore. And with mods, things can get even funnier, particularly when they go catastrophically wrong.While a bit pricey for its simplicity, Cortex Command is still a game I'm happy to have purchased. There is one thing everyone should note before they take the plunge, however: Most agree that this is not a game for everyone and opinions are typically black and white; you either love it to death or hate it with a fiery passion. Try to get first-hand accounts about the game from both sides of the fence before making your final decision. And if you do buy the game, I do hope you enjoy it.			"

I was eager to install it on Steam after it had been released and see what the finished game was like.  Sadly, we will never know becuase the game will never be finished.  The developer is a vulgar and unethical person who has lied and milked this game for all it's worth.  It won't take any new player long at all to see the lack of quality of this game and regret their purchase.  In my opinion, it's a twelve year old alpha.  Stay away!			"

												I felt like most of the game modes I tried were too fast-paced and subject to a lot of randomness. I approached the game wanting to take the time to strategize and build a base while the enemy built their own and apparently you can't do that against the AI, only other players.  Instead, I always found myself under immediate attack, often before I could get anything accomplished thanks to the horrible control scheme.  The fact that I played a dozen or so maps in various modes in less than an hour speaks to the pace of the game.It would probably be a fun multiplayer game, but sadly it only offers local, non-networked split-screen, which means it's a singleplayer game to most people.

												It's a bit of a cross between Worms and Terraria. RTS with basebuilding, but the game has serious problems, not least of which is the developers seem to have abandoned it.- No default keybindings- No resolution options other than tiny window or (not borderless) fullscreen- UI is hard to find, much less understand- Units easily get hung up on single dirt pixels floating in midair; the physics makes units seem to shut down at times+ Great concept; with playtesting and polishing it could be amazing+ When the physics works the way it should, it's great; e.g. a cargo rocket exploding in midair and the debris crushing all my robotsOverall it might be worth it for some people, but not for me.

												The units you can control are very clunky and the most agile of the bunch are still difficult to move with. The game is NOT worth 20$. The game has many options to build your base, one can potentially create a large labryninth of corridors and rooms with intricate turrets and defendable positions. This isn't a positive though, as the annoying mobility of the game renders complex bases too clumsy to traverse through. The controls are bad and the game does not take it into account. THere are about seven scenarios to play on, as the multiplayer function does not function. The economics of the game do not balance well with the game. One ALWAYS has enough money to just create the essential unit to win. You don't feel any difference between units or weapons (of course there are the obvious assualt rifles and shotguns, etc.). The game is really repetitive. In a few reviews of the game on Steam and on Youtube, there were mods in the workshop to fix all the above problems, however the only mods are extra factions, maps, or items. You can download all the mods you'd like, however, the vanilla game's loading times are already terrible, and are made significantly worse with mods.			"

												Good concept plagued by horrible controls. For example, the ""back"" button wipes all your building or restarts the battle, losing all progress, without confirmation. Pressing ""start"" to try to start a mission instead sends you to the main menu, again with no confirmation. Controlling the drones themselves in an exercise in frustration, but that can be excused as intentional difficulty; performing destructive actions irreversibly and without confirmation at the push of a single button is inexcusable.

												Do buy.Seriously, it is worth the price.This game is the kind of game that gets you thinking of new ways to kill your enemies. There are so many ways to do so.There are also some hilarious things. Try arming a heavily armed soldier with a minigun. Now try walking through snow. You WILL sink.Or you could take the rocket that just delievered your supplies and take it for a spin, smashing it into the enemy base.Or dig a back tunnel into the enemy base.It's just so deep, just buy it when you get the chance. Worth the twenty bucks.			"

												Plays game with friend.Starts having fun.game crashes.Best game I ever played.==If your use to garry's mod lag when it comes too much crap on screen at once, then you can understand the lag in this.ALTHOUGH! the lag also may of been because I played this on a 6 year old computer with a Navida GTX 260 graphics card but I'm not completely sure, this also may of been the reason why it would crash sometimes.The specs say it should work on any 5 year old computer but I geuss one more year was just too big of a leap for it, possiblly.I just got a new computer so I'm gonna download it again 'eventually'.If I notice a differance I'll change my review.==There is no online co-op so don't go buying this for your friends thinkin' you can play with them.I was kinda sad when I found that out but it's still a fun builder like strategy game.It does however have local co-op which is nice and even though I don't do local co-op that much anymore I still think it should be something more commen in more games.

												Cortex Command is fun. That's pretty much all there is to it. Mods are a must, though, as the vanilla game is... lacking(And weegee makes ♥♥♥♥ing epic maps). Although even with only vanilla, it's still a 2D side scrolling/sandbox shooter with pixel-based terrain destruction. Your bullets cut grass, make the dirt softer/break and makes concrete break with sustained fire. It's also an epic-moment generator, where your rifle's been shot and broken, all you have left is a pistol and a frag grenade, and you combat roll off a cliff, throwing the grenade, landing on another guy's gun, making him drop it, pick up the dropped gun, shoot down the first guy and then the grenade explodes killing the last one, making the victory screen appear.Yes, that situation was just another day in CC. I've jetpack-assisted flying-knee'd someone in the face, making his head explode before.			"

												Definitely an acquired taste.  It's OK if you don't mind the dated graphics.  The enemy AI plays well: but the actual game gives you few strategic choices.  Tactically, the game gets interesting: since you land on a planet with variable amounts of available cash (dep on how much you allocated beforehand) and you could wind up fighting up to 3AI's for the planet...both above AND underground.

												Great Game!It is completely different from what the trailer depicts ( I suggest watching a few ""let's Play!"" videos) but the gem that is underneath is beautiful...and a little flawed.The Game is a 2D RTS/Platformer/Action hybrid where you take the reigns of a disembodied brain whose goal is to become rich by claiming all of the gold mining sites on the planet's surface.Now...let me tell you the campaign is kind of dull (or at least I found it to be) but the varied skirmishes more than make up for it. The hilarity of combat is what makes this game shine, enemy drop ships landing on the planet's surface? take your trusty rocket launcher and blow it out of the sky, but beware! loose engine pods have a tendency to zoom off in random directions acting as a unstoppable battering ram. If you are successful in combat, holding the breach from waves of enemies, do not be surprised when the climb the mountain of corpses and attack from above, or mine below the surface, digging the ground from underneath you.What makes this game even better are the loads of mods found on the DATAREALMS.COM forums, adding factions and hilarious weapons to the gameplay.Catch it on sale and do not miss this. The company (and man) who made this game did an amazing job so show your support! "

												You need two things before you play this; mods, & a local friend to join you. If you've got both, this is the most fun you've had in a while. Any issues fall away the moment your skull is detonated from across town by Darth Vader packing a .50 Cal rifle, poised atop a pile of skulls, stopping you from suicide bombing his home base. By yourself-or, even worse, without mods- , it's startlingly average. The A.I.'s dumb, the controls can be damningly obtuse sometimes, & there are days you'll see the crash report more than the Main Menu. By all means get a friend and play this, but only at a discount, or hell, check all those Humble Bundles you bought eons ago, you might have a copy.			"

												Cortex Command is an odd ball of a game. I bought it when it was first released to the public, in its unfinished stage. I played the hell out of it, dumped so many mods in there that it took it 10 minutes to start and I had plenty of fun with it. Its a great time consumer and there is plenty to do, especially when it comes to testing out weapons and causing massive destruction. However it is also a game with some problems - multiple maps have almost infinte enemies spawning (not the problem ;), but as there is not limit, the game will begin to lag. Of course killing them instantly fixes it - but it is a weakness.Another and more fundamental flaw from my view point is that I am never entirely sure why I am playing it. It is great to see a shot hit as intended or bomb the living hell out of a base. But when it comes down to it, I don't really feel productive. Yes, I did say productive, which is an strange choice of word, but I do feel productive when playing other games, it might not be the productivity in the form of work - but more in the sense that I am accomplishing something. This game is not that type of game. Its a game with a huge fun factor, lots of mods and play as you want. But if you a looking for more than a great way to waste time, then this game might not be for you (at least until an hour later when you want to smash some skeletons, stomp on crabs and blow up a spaceship so much that your computer chrashes).

												First of all, I will start with negative aspects of this game: -Controls are a bit confusing at the beginning and it's actually hard to control a group of soldiers and mostly you will have to play 1 unit commando-style. Squad takes a bit of time to aim to an enemy, so they are pretty much a cannon fodder.-It gets laggy with a lot of units on one location.-There is no internet co-op (Though, it should be. This would save this game). Only local co-op. If you are not okay with that, this game is probably not for you. But if it's fine by you, then don't waste your time and buy it. Sandbox world, build whatever you want, steam workshop for mods, tons of guns and everything is destroyble. What are you waiting for? BUT IT! BUY IT NOW!			"

												I was at a stalemate against three two other factions: The Brotherhood of Nod and The Combine Overwatch. Somehow Nod had been able to kill off the Imperium of Man relatively early, although a contributing factor to their defeat was their strange compulsion to defend the tactically useless desert where their heavy units simply fell into the sand and were unable to retaliate.Playing as the United Aerospace Corporation I had the unique ability to deploy all troops and supplies to the field instantly through teleportation. This had worked in my favor until I found myself caught in between a firefight between Black Hand confessors and Combine Elites backed by several Hunters. The instant my forces were on the ground they were incinerated. My stubborness to admit defeat and simply wait for another opportunity to take the site got the best of me and my defenses were spread ridiculously thin. I had ended up taking the cliffsides but it was not even remotely worth the effort. I had an ample supply of brains to reclaim any territory that would be lost to the enemy, but no funds to supply them with backup and the ability to purchase new recruits. At the same time it was plain to see that with the Brotherhood of Nod sweeping across Combine territory and emerging victorious, they had no plans to halt their advance and give me time to save up the cash to produce an army powerful enough to turn the coming red tide. I had no choice but to perform an extremely stupid and desperate attack utilizing all the resources I had at that point against a single stronghold that Nod had dumped most of its cash in. If I could capture this territory I would kill off almost 50% of their units occupying the planet and also maybe gain the use of some Nod units as well.It was not going well at first, but then I massed a large group of minigunners and rifleman together on a high ground overlooking their main fortress. It was crawling with infantry and surrounded by turrets, but due to the sheer number of rounds I was throwing at them everything above the surface was slowly obliterated by an advancing swarm of lead death.Finally I was able to send in a modest amount of men armed with shotguns, chainguns and plasma rifles. I was slowly pushing their troops deeper and deeper into a retreat, forcing them to fall further back to the depths of their fortress, bottlenecking them. I had them. My initial strike force was getting weak, so I ordered them to continue onward without my direct interference. I produced another marine, this time armed with a BFG9000 and sent him in to finish the job. My men had managed to corner their brain at the very bottom of the base, but they were missing most of their legs and arms and couldn't land a shot. Their death would not be in vain. I fired the BFG directly at their brain and one second before it reached its target the game crashed.War is hell.			"

												  The game had potential, it really did. As it stands though the final product, if you can call this a final product, is not passable. The user interface is downright poor and for this game's concept to work it would need a fantastic interface. At the end of the day I might have been able to put up with the frequent crashes and lack of game modes and content in general if the interface were more intuitive but it simply isn't up to snuff. Without a way to quickly and easily call in reinforcements or to control those reinforcements the game just doesn't play well. It's a shame too because the games core concepts and mechanics are promising. Final verdict is that this game isn't worth the money even on sale.			"

												First Impression:Conceptually Excellent, I have been looking forward to buying this game for years.I just wanted to wait until I thought it was ready for purchase.With build 30 I decided it was finally time.I sat down at the keyboard with nervous excitement. I started up the game, watch a fun into video.Giddy with excitement I clicked the campaign, (not finished no biggie), and started the tutorial. Within seconds my excitement starts to falter, then fade.  I immediately realize that this game is only playable on a console or with a controller even though I selected mouse and keyboard controls. A few minutes later I find out that the controls are even worse then I imagined.  The same commands given over and over give different results. Pushing up and right to fire the jetpack will sometimes move you up and right, other times it will hover you in place, other times it will move you straight up.  The list goes on.  After playing for 10 minutes and accidently turning on the ai of the unit I was controlling so that it would just start doing whatever it wanted and override my commands I gave up.  With a heavy heart I still wasn't ready to give up.  So I pulled out my xbox 360 controller and set it up on my computer. After a few minutes I was good to go.  I started up the game switched the controls to joystick and tried again.  After loading up the tutorial I was met with being told to do things with [][]  with no buttons inside to let me know what to do.  So Knowing I was trying to select a bot I hit every button on the controller including pushing down the movement sticks, yet none of the buttons slected the bots.  So with all my dreams crushed and the inability to deal with the horrendous controls, I step back and write this review to warn others.I plan on coming back to the game next update and giving it another try, if things change I will update this review.

												Could not get this game to function in fullscreen mode.also playing it.  the robots walk way to slow to help adapt to the battlefield. most of the time i would use the jetpacks just to get through the halls.  i kept dieing on the tutorial level just trying to get a squad together and shoot the bad guys.Oh and they really didnt explain the buy option till like 3 tutorials in.  i think they should have started with the exploring tutorial where you are a walking brain and work from there.   And it NEVER explained the planet conquest thingy.I do enjoy playing a little but it bugs me how slow you walk and I personnally think that instead of specail delivery robots  you should be able to make a assembly unit.  if its going to be a resouce and time management things need to walk a hair faster and the buy/ deliver option is kinda goofy because you can just deliver them right out side the enemy base.It makes more sence to have a assembly room or something.  I havent figured out how to build or expand the base yet. "

												This is it, folks. The original Early Access game that failed to deliver, made waayyy before Steam Early Access was even a thing.Fun concept that has been in development for a literal decade without much advancement from the alpha that I was playing in '07 aside from a conquest mode that feels rushed despite being worked on for years. Entertaining, sure, but not enough to be worth $20 when you can get much more rewarding games for much less.Get it on sale maybe.I rate this game 3 out of 5 years spent developing nothing.			"

												I really want to like this game, but it's borderline unplayable on OSX. If some of the major issues get addressed, I'd be really excited to play, but at the moment I'm spending most of my time wanting to rip my hair out.  The idea of the game is REALLY cool, and yes, I had fun playing, but mostly it was an exercise in frustration.These are the major issues that I encountered:1. Broken 360 controller support. Buttons work, but not the sticks.2. Godawful frame rate at any resolution.3. Screen resolution options are terrible with anything other than native screen res. Smaller resolution in a window is very tiny, and going full-screen doesn't actually fill the screen, it just makes the same size ""window"" in a full-screen. That means lots of black with a still-tiny game in the middle.4. Fonts - anything smaller than native resolution (1680x1050 in my case) is unreadable.5. The aiming system is very difficult. Sometimes I get an aiming ""reticle"" so I can see where I'm aiming across the screen, but other times (even with the same gun) it's not there, which means you can't tell where you're aiming except to carefully watch the bullets.6. The jet-packs - after 2 hours of play-time, I still can't get my soldiers around using the jet-packs. Most of the time, they seem to barely budge my soldier off the ground. If a soldier gets stuck down a mine-shaft (or whatever), it takes so much time to get them back out that the rest of my squad is usually wiped out. Consequently, I end up leaving many squad members in useless positions and buying more.			"

If you want to see a person that doesn't know any of the controls, go to Youtube and search up ""totalbiscuit cortex command."" I picked this up with birthday money that I got instead of Don't Starve, another game on the steam store, since it was on sale, and oh lordy I never regretted a thing. Maybe one thing. I don't know.

The idea of piling your enemies bodies one top of eachother, and the destruction... Oh my is it beautiful. I'm one of those people who love tearing down enemy units and watch them fall apart. Build 30 has also been a great improvement. The mining A.I. now does it job as planned, Squad mechanics add a whole new set of things. I want other to support this and help reastart the modding community. I also love the splitscreen. Me and my brother always enjoy playing it together. I enjoy the game and hope fore improvements.

												You want a review? ♥♥♥♥ you, how about a recap instead?I remember Cortex Command vaguely. It's one of the earliest examples of why early access shouldn't be a thing. The game was hyped up like crazy the first few years it was available. It was hard to be on the internet in the late 00's without hearing about it. People were hyped for a strategy game that implemented complex 2D physics. However, as time went on, the creator slacked in developing the game and lashed out at people who had complaints like ""hey, it's been a few years now..."" or ""why am I paying $30 for $10 at best worth of content?"". Overall, it lead to the Cortex Command we have today. It doesn't quite work as a sandbox, and it doesn't quite work as a game, either. It's fun to screw around with for a bit, but honestly I wouldn't buy it for more than $5.			"

												This is one of those games, and one of those reviews, that says ""I REALLY wanted to like this.""  On paper it has all sorts of coolness.  Base building, battling robots, a little platforming and a little mining.   RTS elements.  Lots of coolness. Alas... I can not reccomend this to anyone.  The robot controls are clumsy at best.  The campaign is some sort of unexplained turn based thing.  The AI players have no problem with their controls so they win a LOT of otherwise even battles.  But they also get confused by the terrain a lot.  And don't even get me started about how you need a magnifying glass to read any of the text that pops up.  There's a lot going on.  And a tutorial that tells you ""use WASD keys to move, there's a radial menu, you can form squads, go get em'"" essentially.  Getting to that point in a campaign is... confusing at best.  More tutorial info would hep a lot... if I could read any of it.Like I said, I REALLY want to like this.  But it feels like it aught to be an early access game.  My appologis to the devs but, I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this.  Thanks for listening.			"

												Nah, don't bother.It looks interesting when you see the gameplay clips, but it's unfinished, even after years and years of development.The Dev made a nice start-interface when it was released to Steam, but the underlying game still needs a ton of work to complete, which will probably never happen.By the way, my 28 minutes or so gameplay time isn't accurate.  I played it a before it made it to Steam.			"

												The game has potential and promise, however it has been abandoned by it's developer who's idea of Game Design seems to be ""Make a barely finished product, then depend on Modders to do the rest of the work for you.""If you are REALLY into Mods for games and REALLY into the modding scene of *ANY* game, then sure. Guess you could get this.At $19.99 however it is very overpriced. Wait till it falls around 75% off, then get it. Failing that? Pass on this game. It is an abandoned project at this point, another one of those Steam games where a dev makes big promises, grabs the money, then splits town.			"

												How this game got so many good reviews is beyond me.  The tutorial consists of you controlling 3 robots with 2 guns between them and an uphill battle against multiple enemies that are stronger than you.  So when they kill you, you watch them walk into your base and you lose... And that's just the tutorial...  I bought it for $5 and that was way too much to pay for this ""game"".			"

												This game starts in a VERY small window with VERY small text.When trying to use Alt+Enter to go to fullscreen it ""crashes"" and is simply unable to go to fullscreen and returns to the tiny window.  I restarted and reinstalled and nothing worked.  Eventually on the fifth try it finally went to fullscreen.  I have a high end system and have never had this problem with any of the over 200+ Steam games I've bought.  Makes you wonder what other bugs may be lurking.Unfortunately, even in full screen the turtorial text is miniscule.  It must be a font size of 4 or less!  So even in fullscreen I must sit close to the screen to try and read the instructions.  (Didn't see anything in the Options to increase font size.)So sad.  It looks like it might be fun, but I have no clue why the Dev felt it would be fun to make it so difficult to read any of the onscreen prompts.  Just too frustrating.			"

												Very confusing UI and lack of customization for windowed modes. Also, it has a steep difficulty curve, and while challenge is nice, the game has no sense of pacing, so right away you're screwed over.A little clarity: it's basically a mix between tower defense and platforming combat. I don't know how to describe it, but the only word I can't use is -good-. See, there's very little room for error, and the game unfortunately makes you mess up tons of times. When controlling basic characters you'l often find yourself flapping around because of poor controls, and your guy will be sent flying to a part of the map you don't want. Other times the jetpack will just die on you, leaving your character to die.  As far as engagements go, you fight guys on the ground with ranged weaponry, but you and them are made of paper, so you die almost instantly when one sees the other. Even the tutorial is unforgiving like this, and you'll die if you don't shoot him the second he comes on screen. So above all, I would avoid this game, even on sale, unless you're intothe type of game I described. I wish I didn't have to be so harsh, but there is one last thing that really bugs me: no single player that I'm aware of. You get to play multiplayer versus bots, and online if I recall, but Im not too much into those, and for 15 bucks I was kinda hoping for it. Maybe I didn't look hard enough, but what can you do?			"

												Quite an entertaining engine and sandbox, with all manner of visceral pixel destruction physics. Quite admirable in that respect. I'm not sure how many sandboxy options are actually afforded to you anymore, that was from much earlier in development, and I'm sorry to say that the actual game portion of the game, in spite of continued revamps, just isn't even remotely engaging on an actually-playing-the-game level. It's remarkable fun to watch♥♥♥♥♥♥get destroyed, particularly dropships, but actually attempting to control stuff and do battle is an impossibly obtuse and clunky process.

												Quite possibly the most perfect example of unrealized potential.Cortex Command feels very much like a pet project that some developer put a lot of love and effort to make a freeware linux game in which it'd be possible to overlook every single one of these flaws. But the price is $20! It might be worth $5 to play in the sandbox and see what might have been. The control scheme is so incredibly broken - for every action except movement and cycling between your forces, you need to navigate a radial menu. Reloading? Switching weapons? Buying more troops? RADIAL MENU. The control of aiming is almost impossible with a mouse or keyboard - gamepad is effectively a requirement.Menu navigation in the middle of an action game is just such a huge no no.			"

												Cortex Command is a game where you have a Brain that is like a Commander, and you order units that are considored ""Soldiers"". You are also greeted by the Buy Menu. Not only that, it's a side-scrolling game where you have to defend your brain and sometimes kill the enemies brain but that's rarely the case. Now, to the part where the reason why I gave this a bad review. Cortex Command has been out for eight years. And it still hasn't changed drastically since then. All games should change in those years. Yet, the developers were extremely lazy and rarely update this game. The Developers also rely on the Modding community to fix and optimize their game. But what if they don't? I'd say, don't buy this game. The game is terrible. And guess what, this game is the only game out there that lets you buy units and deploy them from the skies, and control them manually too. I listed a pro's and con's list. PROSLag Optimization: Recently, the Developers released a update where it improves the FPS. Now this is actually good for a game, as FPS matters. Before the update, the lag was horrendous and I couldn't even stand it. Scenario Battle: Yes, the mode everyone knows and it is a truely loved feature by every Cortex Command player out there is the Scenario Battle. This mode is heavily modifable. As you can test out costume factions, units, weapons and more in this mode. This mode is infamous because you could easily add new modes in the Scenario Battle. Think of Void Wanderers for example, this mod was added into Scenario Battle to make it ten times more easier. CONSCampaign: The Campaign has a huge potential but the Developers didn't cared about it and didn't even touched it at all, which is why all Cortex Command players hate that mode. In this mode, you select your own faction and you need to rely on your own faction to build bases, defend and assault. What I don't like about the Campaign is that it has very limited scenarios to play it. And you would expect that the bases would be randomly or procedurally generated by the AI, well. Actually it's not. It is simple just a prefab of the enemy base.Boringness: Games are ment to be fun. And this is actually not fun at all. The reason why is because matches can take an extreme long time to finish, some matches do. The reason for that is the dumb AI, the AI controls your units and the enemies units terribly. Forcing you to micro-manage your units in order to make sure they are actually breaching in the enemies bunker correctly. The AI diffculty does not change nothing at all as well. AI: Yes, the AI is the worst. Out of all of the Cons, I hate this the most. The AI is just stupid. As I mentioned before, the AI has problems controlling your units and the enemies units. Not only that, they designate deliveries in the worst areas possible. For example, they literally order a Drop Ship on your built-bunker, drop units then get destroyed by your units then falls and the explosion bits hit your units and kill them instantly. Making the enemy unit safe. This is extremely unrealistic and unintelligant. Not only that, when breaching in your or the enemies bunker. They would dig to their brain instead, making the process slow when invading the enemies bunker. Instead of going in the best way, like entering a tunnel that is heading deep in the base, they would choose that. What's worst is that the enemy AI might notice and deliver units to the unit digging down. Inevitably killing them. In conclusion, I DEFINETLY do not recommend this game to ANYONE, only to those who like bad AI and very inactive developers. I certiantly hope the Developers will see this Review. I will change my review to positive if they update the game more often, but I highly doubt that. Don't buy this game until the developers decided to fix this game.			"

												The bad: This game has terrible tutorial, the controls feel awkward, for the life of me I can't find a website that explains what each tool / weapon does (How do I use the constructor? Why can't I cancel already given commands? Why does AI place blocks and not let me control them when I switch to other bots?) Maybe there's an answer for all of these, but the fact it's so insanely hard to find is what my main complaint is.The menu doesn't explain much, the entire game feels like a beta (or alpha?)The good: Great concept. Some game modes are very fun. Plenty of options to choose from for tools and weapons (if only I knew what each did or was.)Overall: For the price of $2 it's not a waste of money for sure. But I'll be waiting for content / patches / wiki to come out before I can play any more. For now, it's a waste of time.			"

												There is a ton of elements in this game, that make a great game. You can tell love and effort came into this game. But, it is not a good game. It was not tied up properly, it did not run smoothly enough, some of the more basic elements of the game were just not optimized for fun. Some of this can be excused for various reasons, but it is still not enough to ignore the fun factor. It is slow. It is clunky. Much of the game is unweldy and not the most player friendly in design. I saw this game for a long time, had it on my wishlist and was interested by it. But then that new video appeared, really irked me. Something about it is really off by the attitude of it. Typically when a game retaliates to a review in that way, something was very off. The price irked me as well. As the years went by, I decided to finally give it a try.Do not buy this game unless you really admire its concepts enough that you are fine with trudging past the more painful aspects or you want to support the dev. Just, do not buy it thinking you will have a good time.			"

												It's rare that I'll say a game is terrible, but this game has the least intuitive UI in any title I've ever played, and that's enough to result in a terrible game. You have no warning when you're being attacked at the other side of the map, you have no way of knowing which weapon you have equipped unless you know the ammo quantities and which weapon ""model"" is which. The tutorial is a single level with a half a dozen sign posts to tell you how to play on a game with considerable depth as this, that is not enough. The floor seems to melt away as you're walking on it resulting in getting stuck in the floor. There is no progression to show you which weapons are better than other or which bodies are more capable than others. You get given a list of several hundred buyable items and get no indication on which ones are worth buying. The campaign is simply a series of skirmishes with a shared resource pool. The graphics are mediocre, looking almost as though the whole game and all the assets are developed to play in 640 X 480, aiming is terrible and unintuitive, sometimes working and sometimes not, can we have an Aim button so we know when we're aiming or otherwise. Why can I not see any range of distance when aiming, often having to approximate the thing I'm aiming at but I can somehow see anywhere on the map when I'm choosing my delivery locations?Personally I think the game would have had a lot of potential, but in it's current state it almost seems like the thing is having an identity crisis, it's like the game doesn't know if it want's to be a strategy game or a 2d action platformer. I think I would prefer it if it was played entirely like an RTS game and I could just pause the action issue commands to my troops where to move and which direction to cover etc. For a game which has been in development for such a long time, it seems that the developers have had no clear direction and rather than ending up with a solid game, have instead ended up with a digital identity crisis.

												It has such fantastic promise. When playing you'll have an awesome sense of being in a real fire fight, The weapons feel solid and bodies react realistic to being shot.  With your troops you can give them diggers and make fox holes in the ground, tunnel under the enemy, or in a emergency shoot their way through a wall to get away. Enviroment is completley destructable. Eventually some corridors will become to packed full of bodies and debris you need to send a skeleton with a light digger to let your troops advance.If a drop ship come in with fresh supplies, there is potential that if it's shot down, the flying debris will decapitate or just crush your men. The content it includes however feels unpolished and limited. The campaign feels broken, and there are scenarios that are fun, yet very limited. I'm becoming a bit bored with the repeated content. But I still enjoy the game a lot, when it updates more it will be way more worth then $20.			"

 Absolutelly great game with endless fun Cortex Command is a really REALLY great game. It has the tactical feel of  ""Should i send a squad of riflemen, or a All in One solution thats fragile?"", but when enemy drop pods start crushing your people and when one of your allies ""accidentaly"" shoots a RPG at a friendly dropship you know you are playing this the right way.  But what makes it so great? Well then, sit down and let me tell you about the magic of a PHYSICS ENGINE in a 2D enviroment that is always fresh. You can literally use soldiers as a ballistic missile with C4 stuck on them, you can use a super heavy soldier with  Rocket Propelled Chainsaws  to annihilate a squad of enemies while a dismembered, bleeding enemy with a pistol shoots at your back. You can not decline the satisfaction of firing grenades into a bunker and remotely detonating it. Anything else? Well of course. You have the steam workshop with many GREAT mods like Void Wanderer which entirely change the entire point of the game, some mods with OP factions like DsTech with flashy weaponry and high cost. Or maybe if you just wanna mess around Hueg pack of mods with quality content like a nuclear fridge or a walking gas canister. Pros:  Provides endless fun The workshop provides quality content The physics engine keeps everything fresh and unpredictable For the amount of particle movement and physics the optimitisation is EXTRAORDINARY good Easy to mod, create content and overall costumisable Is even more fun in front of a TV with friends Cons:  The AI isn`t anything special but can be challenging The developers are a small, slow team but they still update The game is still a bit rough around the edges.All in all. This is one of the most under-rated games on steam that deserves more attention as it is unique and fun as hell.Really, if you can afford a couple of quid, pick this up right away.			"

												I'm trying really hard to like this game, because it combines so many elements that I usually love: it's a sandbox (or rather box of toy soldiers) full of cool stuff with crazy physics, ragdoll soldiers, a totally destructible envirnoment... and yet somehow it seems to add up to less than the sum of its parts. Here are a list of some of my grievances:1) The controls, UI, menus etc are all very ropey and unintuitive. It takes a long time to get a basic grasp on stuff like the RMB command dial and the jetpacks for moving around, and the worst thing is almost nothing is explained to you, so you just have to persevere and figure it out. Now, I'm old enough that I grew up with games that were like this by deafault, but I think most modern gamers would find the lack of a proper tutorial inexcusable and annoying.2) The load time for the game is ridiculous; it's literally the longest-loading game I own by some distance. This game is a 90Mb download... how can it take longer to load than massive, graphics-intensive games? I feel like I haven't waited this long for a game to load since the days when I owned an Amiga 500!3) So many crashes, so much lag caused by too much stuff happening on screen. It crashes enough without mods, but with mods I can barely finish a scenario without an unexplained CTD or hang. Given the game's modding community is one of the things people praise about it, this seems prety unforgivable.4) Absolutely no story, nothing to work for, no progression. It even has a paltry 11 Steam achievements! I know it's a sandbox, but I feel like a structured campaign where you were slowly immersed in the game, unlocking weapons etc as you went, would make it a lot less overwhelming and keep you engaged for longer.5) Starts to feel very samey very quickly, despite the obvious diversity of units and weapons on offer.I'm only 7 hours in an debating whether I will put much more time into this, if I'm honest. I got it at 80% off and I guess I've had my £3 worth of entertainment from it already, but there's absolutely no way I could recommend this at full price. Pick it up on sale if you fancy messing around with it for a few hours, but don't expect a game that you'll love. It's a shame, as I really wanted to love it!			"

Why to buy:Plenty of detail, challenge and hotseat - multiplayer. If you are the kind of person that gathers friends home to enjoy game match. This is made for you in most ways. You can have fun for quite a long time. If you are the sandbox play with your self kind of player - you can really toy with it a lot.Why to pass: Single-player barely exists. All single-player options boil down to skirmishes that you can do for a while, but do not have a goal, do not build up and are not presented gradually. Think of it as a worms armageddon without the campaign and with everything unlocked at start. All you can do is hotseat with friends or play quick matches vs the AI.Value for money? I like to own games that have a certain effort put into them, and this certainly has plenty of that. The good news is - it has huge potential to grow. Maybe one day its maker would finally learn to work with its strenghts, instead of adding more guns etc.At the time of review I had 24 hours spent on it. 2 Hours spent being familliar with everything. 22 hours being my own entertainer until I moved on to something else. Not everybody is the sandbox self-entertaining type.			"

Game menus and flow don't make sense and seem buggy. It looks apealing and there feeling there is a gem here.But theres no flow, not much progression of technology. Doesn't look like too much thought has been put in to finishing the game. Its just bam you get just about every item/tech and your overwhelmed at the start.

												Disappointed. The devs bailed on this game. I bought this game before it was on steam. 2010ish.It's a tech demo at most with no fleshed out features or the campaign they promised and were working on. The physics engine is a beast, but there's just nothing compelling to tie the game together. Would not recommend buying and would also balk at their new title that is (surprise surprise) coming out in early access in April.			"

												I have very mixed feelings about this game. I love the concept that combines real time strategy, shooting, and finance management. However, everything feels poorly executed.You move your units in the game using walking, which is painfully slow and a jetpack which has very little thrust and makes your character flop around like a piece of paper and get stuck on everything he touches, making it feel very awkward to move. Several times I've been powerless to defend my base because I couldn't move my units over a hill or wall to confront the enemy.The shooting is pretty well done, and I really like how your units' parts can be destroyed, leaving him disarmed, without legs, or blown apart across a large distance.The place where the game makes me feel most handicapped is when I am trying to order units. The menu UI works well enough, but selecting your units, their weapons, and the craft their delivered in takes too much time in the heat of battle, and there's no way to pause while doing it. Even when selecting preset units I feel much to slow, and usually you don't even get a chance to enforce your base with units before it gets attacked. So many times I've failed battles because I couldn't order units fast enough and was wiped off the planet by the AI without a fighting chance. Sometimes the unit delivery doesn't even work. For example, I ordered three preset units in a drop pod, the drop pod fell, broke through the ground and got stuck, and when it opened all my units' parts exploded out of it with their guns, the soldiers having been crushed to death.Overall the game feels very awkward and unfinished, but it can still be enjoyable. However, it is definitely not worth $20.			"

												Cortex Command is a physics-based strategy-shooter. With much more physics than most other games you'll see out there, and the highest level of modability I've ever seen.It's difficult to say who will like this game or not. Honestly, it is. I know that I like it a lot. What I do know is that you might like this if you like: shooters, particle physics simulations, RTS, and blowing stuff up. The best way to figure out whether you should buy it is by watching gameplay videos so you know what it's all about beforehand.There is a catch, though: the game is single-threaded, meaning you need to have a decent processor to play this game at a reasonable speed, so don't get this if your only computer is an old laptop.

												This is one of the coolest games I have played lately..  I really enjoyed this game a lot so far and pretty much love everything about it.  Definitely not the sort of gameplay for everyone, there is a blend of action and strategy.  The physics engine in this game is like nothing I have ever really seen before, and it is rather impressive.  Even more impressive is the devs next game engine already in the works.   You can make modifications for this game, and even your own totally custom levels with some additional programs.  The built in editor lets you easily remake the inlcuded maps.  I just wish it would not depend so heavily on the CPU because when action gets heavy this game can slow down quite a bit.  There are ways of getting around this though, tweaks to settings files and even the possibility to make modifications.  For me these tweaks seem to have fixed the issues mostly.Update:  This game still rocks IMO..  I'm really surprised it has such a low meta score, and that more people aren't digging it.  It has a ton of replayability, especially with all the awesome mods.  The ONLY thing I don't like about this game is that it runs poorly on my quad core because it isn't multithreaded, but the core engine was built a long time ago and would probably be a pain in the butt to redo.  So I can accept that, especially because it is still a lot of fun.			"

												One of the most creative and innovative games I have ever played. I bought this a few years ago and this still sits as one of my favorite games.There is a fairly large learning curb, as I can't even compare the gameplay to any other games. The closet I can compare it to is that this is like Wurms turned real-time with an overdose of action, a massive hit of strategy, and under all of that is a tab of freedom.There is a health bar, but most of the time it means nothing besides a bleedout timer as you can be instantly killed by a headshot or be crushed to death by your own dropship or rocket. You can shoot off legs and arms and sometimes it can even works towards your favor, but most of the time it doesnt as you hands to even hold a gun. Did your space rambo get both of his legs blown off and is rapidly bleeding to death? No worries, without those legs weighing you down you can jetpack much faster towards the enemies and then headbutt people to death as you fire your machinegun. But wait, as you move forward a stray piece of dropship debris hits you at 666km/h, killing you instantly. You are quickly overwhelmed by crash-test dummies with spacey nailguns and kills your disembodied brain because you spent all of that money on rambo and didnt bother investing in gold mining. All that is left is a fail message cycling through your screen.tl;dr Buy it.			"

												Look, I'm going to be honest. This game shouldn't be on Steam. It's Just Not Done Yet. And it shows, entire modes inoperable, massive physics problems, just a mess. as is, it should be on Desura for like 5 bucks. On Steam for 20? Madness!...But it's a lot of fun. If you just mess around with it after getting the game from the Humble Bundle, it's pretty easy to see that there is a fun idea underneath the rough beta stuff, pluss its just ridiculous to have crazy Ronin mercs with AK's trying to kill the super hi tech robot faction. and this game is just super moddable and has like 4 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ edditors. if the guy could get some helpers and be able to update regularly, it has potential to be fantastic.

Well im not shure the game will ever be ""done"" (it seems like the Dev will be working on this for the rest of his life :P)its still a fun experance.There are times when the AI builds a Really good bunker and taking it turns into a normandy style invasion.your soldiers are litarly crawling over Piles of broken cement mixed with chunks of gore and Mech parts.There are times when the battles can get extreamly brutle when you see a Human soldier with its legs blown off crawling for cover well a Silver skullman shoots him in the head.All of this is deliverd in a Worms style distructible invirment and is simply amazing and Horrible and Awsome and frustrating all at the same time!So yes i would recommend this game.

Its just not worth twenty dollars, if it were cheaper,say five dollars, it would be acceptable, but its just not worth its current price. The game itself isnt that bad, and if your looking for something to hold your attention for a little while you might be interested in it, especially with all the workshop mods. but even then it won't be too long before you get bored.

												this is an incredible game that is easily moddable and you can even make new weapons by adding explosive gibs to existing weapons: riot shield+ cluster grenade gib = fun timesit lacks a mod launcher....so all you have is steams subscribe/unsubscribe method which makes it hard when you download some random uberrace that someone created and the ai starts whipping you like crazy, the other problem with this game is that: occasionally....you can actually create explosions that will kill anyone and everyone on the map just by the shockwavealthough, i like baiting the ai with having to tunnel to my brain and filling the hole with napalm10/10			"

												I first played Cortex Command back in 2007, a demo for it was on a CD that came with MaximumPC magazine. The game was build 18 back at that time. I had a blast with it then for quite awhile, then forgot about it. Then in 2009 I rediscovered it, but found out that there was a ton of mods available for the game. I remember coming home from school day after day and just playing skirmish against the AI outfitted with modded weapons and characters on custom maps, I must have racked up at least 300 hours in the game, if not more. It was seriously the only game I played for a few months (hey, I had dial-up internet at the time and not a lot of money, I can't really complain)Some things you might find useful:This game loads all the files upfront, similar to Kerbal Space Program. The more mods you have, the longer it will take to load. Games like this REALLY benefit from being on a SSD or ramdisk. A ramdisk might not be necessary, but it depends on how much you play it, how often you reboot and how often it crashes on you.If you want a nice fullscreen borderless windowed setting for a 1920x1080 monitor, open up Cortex Command/Base.rte/Settings.ini and set ResolutionX to 960 and ResolutionY to 532, Fullscreen to 0, NxWindowed to 2 and NxFullscreen to 2. Then run the below .ahk file with AutoHotkey (or use the .exe version) and press Ctrl+Alt+G to remove the window's borders.If you don't have a 1920x1080 monitor, setting ResolutionX to half your horizontal resolution and ResolutionY to 8 subtracted from half your vertical resolution should work, but I don't have any other monitors to test it with. If stuff is too small on screen, you could try setting NxWindowed to 3 and set ResolutionX to 1/3 your horizontal resolution and ResolutionY to 6 subtracted from 1/3 your vertical resolution. If you have amazing eyes and want everything to appear at its original resolution (unzoomed) then set NxWindowed to 0, ResolutionX to your horizontal resolution, and ResolutionY to 16 subtracted from your full vertical resolution, but be aware that this is quite hard to see clearly, and is probably best for HDTVs or very large monitors.AutoHotkey script: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25140621/fullscreen.ahkhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25140621/fullscreen.exeSpacebar or escape will skip the startup message and intro. Don't accidentally hit escape at the main menu or the game will close (which could mean sitting through another long loading sequence). Setting PlayIntro to 0 in Settings.ini will just throw you straight into the tutorial mission, so you could do that too I suppose.If you ever want more money in the middle of a mission, press tilde (`) to open the console and paste in:ActivityMan:GetActivity():SetTeamFunds(5000,0)Feel free to replace 5000 with however much money you want.And in case you were curious, my favorite mods from back in the day were/are AAL by numgun, DarkStorm by Darlos9D, UniTec by Gotcha! and Crobotech by capnbubs. UniTec has a massive assortment of items and characters, as well as some nice mechs. DarkStorm has a bunch incredibly innovative scripted items and characters which are a ton of fun. AAL has pretty nice heavy soldiers and a giant mecha with a big variety of weapons (however it's quite unbalanced), and Crobotech has some very fun polished weapons and characters (also relatively unbalanced).

												been playing this one a long time (longer than my steam account) even made my own mod, so I have a faction. I play with my son, he uses a controller, i use the computer. Sometime i hook it up to the big tv and we play for more fun.    Your forces are robots, they can act by themselves, and are great at getting themselves killed. You will have epic moments when your commander takes aout a squad with his pistol, and you will have epiv fails when you accidently shot down your own rocket and it lands on your troops.   The game can be unpredictable sometimes, it goes with the game. The local split screen is the best.			"

												so this gameit is a legitimate rival to tf2it has hats added in the last updateand zombies(jk the zombies are in mods)But in all seriousness, this game is amazingly good fun.  Who cares if it's still buggy?  Can't you people enjoy a game?  The basics are totally there, and with mods and a bit of tweaking to find which mods work with certain other mods, you get countless hours of fun.  The campaign mode breaks easily, but the scenarios are crazy.  I once went up against a bunch of guys with diggers (they dig and are an extremely powerful melee weapon) and I hid in a vent, shooting at the hordes of the ""undead"" while they frantically dug away at the vent attempting to reach me.  Luckily I survived long enough, and the mission was over, but I had to make sure to not destroy the bodies of the enemies as that was what saved me, the fact that the bodies were blocking the way.Honestly, I'd rate this game 9/10 IGN, it's like a 7.5 real review.  In my opinion, Metacritic is just plain stupid and gave this game a 44/100, because ""the game isn't ready so therefore it can't be fun"".  Screw Metacritic, it's an awful rating system.			"

												I have very mixed feelings about this game. I love the concept that combines real time strategy, shooting, and finance management. However, everything feels poorly executed.You move your units in the game using walking, which is painfully slow and a jetpack which has very little thrust and makes your character flop around like a piece of paper and get stuck on everything he touches, making it feel very awkward to move. Several times I've been powerless to defend my base because I couldn't move my units over a hill or wall to confront the enemy.The shooting is pretty well done, and I really like how your units' parts can be destroyed, leaving him disarmed, without legs, or blown apart across a large distance.The place where the game makes me feel most handicapped is when I am trying to order units. The menu UI works well enough, but selecting your units, their weapons, and the craft their delivered in takes too much time in the heat of battle, and there's no way to pause while doing it. Even when selecting preset units I feel much to slow, and usually you don't even get a chance to enforce your base with units before it gets attacked. So many times I've failed battles because I couldn't order units fast enough and was wiped off the planet by the AI without a fighting chance. Sometimes the unit delivery doesn't even work. For example, I ordered three preset units in a drop pod, the drop pod fell, broke through the ground and got stuck, and when it opened all my units' parts exploded out of it with their guns, the soldiers having been crushed to death.Overall the game feels very awkward and unfinished, but it can still be enjoyable. However, it is definitely not worth $20.			"

												Its a fun game, but very hard to start out playing if you don't look up any guides, considering you can die in the tutorial and not re spawn. The way the characters control is a little strange, but works well in this type of game. This game has a lot of potential, as can be seen in the vast modding community. Even though there is no real story, the campaign (basically just a skirmish mode) is entertaining so far, and I am looking forward to future updates.			"

Why to buy:Plenty of detail, challenge and hotseat - multiplayer. If you are the kind of person that gathers friends home to enjoy game match. This is made for you in most ways. You can have fun for quite a long time. If you are the sandbox play with your self kind of player - you can really toy with it a lot.Why to pass: Single-player barely exists. All single-player options boil down to skirmishes that you can do for a while, but do not have a goal, do not build up and are not presented gradually. Think of it as a worms armageddon without the campaign and with everything unlocked at start. All you can do is hotseat with friends or play quick matches vs the AI.Value for money? I like to own games that have a certain effort put into them, and this certainly has plenty of that. The good news is - it has huge potential to grow. Maybe one day its maker would finally learn to work with its strenghts, instead of adding more guns etc.At the time of review I had 24 hours spent on it. 2 Hours spent being familliar with everything. 22 hours being my own entertainer until I moved on to something else. Not everybody is the sandbox self-entertaining type.			"

												Two-dimensional awesomeness! With its physics engine you can destroy literally every single pixel of solid material. Shoot your enemies with a huge selection of guns while standing in rain of blood and metal, at the edge of an ocean made of your enemies blood and bodyparts while rockets cash above your head and everything around you explodes! Not to forget the easy to install mods that are already available, and if you are into making game content yourself you can go right ahead and do it! This game cannot be played over the network, which is understandable (Have fun synchronizing thousands of flying pixels), but luckily you can play with up to four people on one computer.			"

Game menus and flow don't make sense and seem buggy. It looks apealing and there feeling there is a gem here.But theres no flow, not much progression of technology. Doesn't look like too much thought has been put in to finishing the game. Its just bam you get just about every item/tech and your overwhelmed at the start. Largely a figure it out yourself and mess around mentality. Maybe I just don't have the patience. Disapointed.			"

												This is one of those few games I say is so awesome the trailer actually didn't show enough. So I just want to tell anyone who reads this abt the other features since it is a great game me and my brother play together. One is he fact that it has controller support, but you can see that on the store page. Second is the fully destructable environment and enemies. Everything can be destroyed down to the pixel, literally. You can shoot the leg of of somebody, or blast the gun out of their hands or even destroy the gun. The environment is also like this, you can dig trenches and wage a war like that, or instead you can use the rockets as missiles and bomb everyone. The more players the better, especially when everyone has a large in game budget, allowing them to fund huge armies. My only problem here is the fact that it may have a huge update and change some of the things that make it so unique and amazing, and I really hope the final updates are just focused on bug fixes, since it has all these features it basically created, and can definately say they ripped off me and not the other way around. It's a ame you can play with friends, family, and by yourself. The AI has a difficulty selection so you can always have a fair game or an unfair game to suit your masochistic needs. Worth every penny.			"

												This game is simply amazing,The little things like ships losing control becouse you distroyed a thruster is something other games miss out onThe only bad thing I can say about the game is the bad optimization, It may be becouse I play with mods (Like a lot of mods) but if sometimes feels im playing in slowmotion.And while I do recommend the game, No way in hell it is worth 20€, Buy it on sale for 10 if you can.

												Cortex Command is one of the best games I have ever played in my life. The physics are great,everything in the game is destructable, absolutly anything as well as amazing combat mechanics, you can snipe someone from afar or gun them down by rifles or even slice them with swords! and a huge collection of units which can be given any weapon you desire( mods add more diversity 10/10 from me!

												It's a shame this was released in the EARLY days of Early Access and called 1.0 - therefore it was reviewed as it was, bugs and all, and not well received.  It's a great concept and a very unique game with a lot of hours of fun to be had (more than 1.2 hours played outside of Steam).  My only complaint is the pricing - catch it when it's on sale.			"

												I played this game for a long time back when it was in build 24-27 (I think...) and loved it. The mods you could create and the general destruction you could cause was just incredible. The destructible environment could use some more dynamic effects, but that's all that was around then I suppose. I highly recommend this to anyone who played Soldat or Liero and also likes destructible terrain.			"

												been playing this one a long time (longer than my steam account) even made my own mod, so I have a faction. I play with my son, he uses a controller, i use the computer. Sometime i hook it up to the big tv and we play for more fun.    Your forces are robots, they can act by themselves, and are great at getting themselves killed. You will have epic moments when your commander takes aout a squad with his pistol, and you will have epiv fails when you accidently shot down your own rocket and it lands on your troops.   The game can be unpredictable sometimes, it goes with the game. The local split screen is the best.			"

												so this gameit is a legitimate rival to tf2it has hats added in the last updateand zombies(jk the zombies are in mods)But in all seriousness, this game is amazingly good fun.  Who cares if it's still buggy?  Can't you people enjoy a game?  The basics are totally there, and with mods and a bit of tweaking to find which mods work with certain other mods, you get countless hours of fun.  The campaign mode breaks easily, but the scenarios are crazy.  I once went up against a bunch of guys with diggers (they dig and are an extremely powerful melee weapon) and I hid in a vent, shooting at the hordes of the ""undead"" while they frantically dug away at the vent attempting to reach me.  Luckily I survived long enough, and the mission was over, but I had to make sure to not destroy the bodies of the enemies as that was what saved me, the fact that the bodies were blocking the way.Honestly, I'd rate this game 9/10 IGN, it's like a 7.5 real review.  In my opinion, Metacritic is just plain stupid and gave this game a 44/100, because ""the game isn't ready so therefore it can't be fun"".  Screw Metacritic, it's an awful rating system.			"

												First impressions on this is that it is probably not worth the current price tag of $20. It is certainly a very interesting game, but it is lacking polish and feels like it is still rolling in beta. You play a brain in a jar with access to a satellite filled with munitions and robotic drones/minions you control to do your bidding. You are competing with other such brains for mining resources. Fun concept and the gameplay is certainly interesting, but I would never pay $20 for it. It feels like a $10 game tops in the current state. I tossed a few dollars to it back in early early alpha, so I lucked out in being able to try it with minimal investment. No internet multiplayer as far as I was able to find. It feels like a complex version of some of those old sega games you used to see. Maybe pick it up on sale.			"

												I bought this game on September 30th, 2012, 2 days after it released on Steam, for $17.99.  Since then, I have watched the rating of it drop and watch as the game was dragged through the mud.  I have a tendancy to leave games for a while (especially early access), and try to finish all the games I have that are 'finished', so I can play through everything being complete.  Over the years as well, I have watched as it seemed this game was lost in the void of the oh so many games never coming to fruition for whatever reasons (owning some as well, of course).  It's pretty frustrating, however I played this game once, yup, One time, for almost an hour, that's my actual playtime.  Yet after all the complaining, and the Steam refund system coming into full effect (which I have used), after thinking this game was lost, and such a small amount of time played, the time I did play, through all the rough edges, I could tell that I would enjoy this game, someday, when I got around to it.  It was only when I left another game today, December 30th, 2016, and became really confused to see Cortex Command at the bottom of my update list, I was happy to see they are not gone.  So here we are, 4 years later, sure it may be some time before I really sit down and get into it, I will say, it does have a certain charm about it, that I could not abandon after all that time, ..is the point.  *To be updated*			"

												One of the most replayable and funnest games I've ever purchased, you can play it for hours on the vanilla and then install from the huge range of mods to increase replayability further. The game can be buggy and there's been a persistent and unfixed bug of fullscreen mode at certain resolutions and development is EXTREMELY slow, but what's there is good enough to make the game worth it. Especially in a sale.If you like sandbox destruction and violence this is probably your perfect game. I wish it was updated more often! (last updated yesterday luckily!)			"

												My history with this game is...long. A long and joyful history where I spent hours looking at footage before buying it. Then it released on steam. Though it releasing on steam came with a lot of...stuff. A lot of my mods didn't work, so much stuff broke. Whatever though! We have WORKSHOP! Workshop is the BEST thing to happen to this game.Though I am not here to talk about that.Cortex Commands is a game I have played a lot of. On steam and off steam I have I would say 200~ hours combined. I ADORE this game to bits. It is under apreciated and I don't think its being updated anymore, due to the last update being in 2015...I'm pretty sure. My dreams of online multiplayer, crushed. If this game were to have that it would breathe SO much new life into it. I would also love that even more since being able to have long campaigns with online folks. A 1v1v1v1 campaign would be SO much fun with people. You may say ""Oh, you have split-screen!"" My answer to that is none of my IRL friends enjoy these type of games, also the split-screen sucks and the gamepad controls sucks. (IMO)The chaos that would unfold.I could also tell you about the game...cause thats sorta the purpose of a review, but I ain't. I'll just say go watch a let's play or something. That will give you a idea. I am just ranting about this game and how much joy it has given me, and I really hope that in the future it gives a lot more people the same joy I felt with my experience with this game.UPDATE: December 2016 - WOOO!

The tutorial covers the absolute bare minimum of moving around and shooting, and the basic objectives, but does not cover anything regarding the career mode such as base building or even turn structure.

You'd be wrong; however, if you assumed that there are more negatives than positives. There is a lot of potential for a game like this, will that ever be met I have no idea, but it's still amazing. This game can really become one of the only games you play. It's actually pretty ridiculous how much fun you can have. I assure you that this is an amazing investment. You'll play this game and say, ""Wow that's pretty neat. Kinda wish there was more to it though."" Guess what buddy. It has a brilliant community to and not to mention that community is a modding one. If I was a game developer I would have strived to create something like this. Infinite opportunity.			"

Worth every penny and great fun with a few friends and some controllers - I'd even go as far as to say this is the best local multiplayer game available for PC and I own Crawl, Nidhog, and others. If you've ever played with army men, legos, and action figures when you were young and imagined massive, brutal, battles this game brings it to life. Build and defend massive underground bases with traps and fortified rooms or storm someone else's creation while they defend. The community mod list is massive and always growing. I actually find myself removing some from time to time because the amount of choices can be overwhelming.			"

												I completely reccomend this game BUT I will not give it thumbs up until the controller problems are broken. If you are going to be playing by yourself with a keyboard, buy the game. But if you are planing to use a controller wait untill the problems are fixed. If your wondering what the problems are, its that the right stick does not function in game. Datarealms, fix this huge bug please.EDIT: They fixed it THANK YOU SO MUCH			"

												Cortex command is a strange case. It reminds me a lot of old PC games like Liero. I think the first thing to make clear is the game is not fun without mods.  The vanilla factions, whilst fun for a while are lacking in many ways and the stuff the community comes up with is much more interesting.The game has some great unique gameplay though. You control a brain, your brain and can use it to control bodies and craft that are called in from space. The game is a weird hybrid of RTS, Side scrolling shooter and Physics puzzler. Each body you control has physics and weight (giving them more weapons makes em heavier) lighter bodies can fly easier but will also die when colliding with concrete at high speed. Heavier bodies can't fly as well but the concrete will get smashed before their faces. The game also has a base building aspect (in some modes) where you put together a 'brain bunker' from various bits and pieces and defend it from people who do not like your brain. Throw in a few mods and the strange physics and unique gameplay make for a highly entertaining experiance....until it crashes.Cortex command is far from stable. It'll crash regularly once you get a few mods going and the loading time when booting up the game does make every crash a tragedy.All things said though I reccomend the game if you can get it on sale. Grab a few mods (I reccomend void wanderers and a few compatible factions to go with it) and have fun shouting at a crash test dummy to stop shooting the doors.			"
