												DO NOT BUY THE COMPLETE VERSION!!!If you pay the $35 for this game, you will be paying to skip content. Winning games to unlock boosters is the whole point of DotP, so buying the complete version basically means you've wasted not only the extra money over the basic version, but also the money for the basic version. All. Your. Money. Wasted. The ""pick a deck, but you're stuck with it"" gimmick is bad design and the devs are bad for doing it. No preview of the decks, just a vague description that in my case was totally misleading. I chose Red->Black which was described as ""focusing on stealing your opponent's creatures and sacrificing them for fun and profit"". Yeah it was just a plain RB aggro deck with 2 Act of Treason and 2 vampires that could sacrifice creatures for a +1/+1 counter...in a 60-card deck. 4 cards does not a focus make. But that bad design was merely irritating, not game-breaking. I could live with it. The deck-building feature is good, it's about time that they added it. However, they didn't actually add it. They replaced all other features with it, for a net loss of game. Let's see what the trade off was for something that should have been a standard feature years ago:No more Two-Headed Giant, either co-op vs AI or multiplayer.No more Planechase multiplayer.No Challenge puzzles.No Sealed campaigns.Is all that worth it? Hell no.This is a blatant money-grab by Wizards, who clearly fear losing players from MTGO if they add too much actual gameplay here, which is completely stupid as the two games serve two different fanbases.I have nothing but disgust for the design decisions of this game. Definitely do not recommend.			"

												(TLDR? This review is also available in video format for your convenience below.)Magic the Gathering; Duels of the Planewalkers has become a yearly franchise, and with the recent success of Blizzard's Hearthstone, they've attempted to step up their game with Magic 2015 by allowing players the much-desired ability to finally create their own decks.After a brief tutorial, you're able to pick a starting deck and begin the campaign. From there, you're able to unlock booster packs as you defeat opponents, allowing further customization of your decks. If you don't feel like endlessly-grinding the single player, you're also able to purchase additional cards via micro-transactions and collecting every card will run you about $50. If you factor in the initial cost of the game, Magic 2015 will run you about the same price as a full-price triple AAA title.There are nearly 300 unique cards to choose from or close to 1000 if you include duplicates, allowing for a multitude of options when it comes to crafting your deck. You're also able to adjust the amount of land in your deck for the first time, which is recommended as leaving it up to the game to do this automatically isn't ideal. Often assigning lands with no rhyme or reasoning behind it, such as giving you mountains in a blue deck. Infact the AI in general is greatly diminished in this installment as it will often tap the wrong lands by default if you're not careful enough to use the toggle key. Such as tapping all of your swamps for colorless mana instead of any other lands you may have available.The campaign features a bit of a narrative where one of the Planeswalkers; Garruk Wildspeaker has gone rogue and has been hunting down other Planeswalkers.  It's your job to track him down and stop him. The campaign's story is nothing extraordinary and chances are you've purchased the game to play with friends.The Multiplayer allows for you to use your crafted deck against your friends as well as other players online. Unfortunately, it's been stripped down from previous games of the series, featuring a lot less gametypes. Two-Headed Giant, Archenemy and Sealed Deck have all been removed, with the only option being a 1 on 1 duel or free for all. The user interface is also completely unintuitive as there's no lobby for multiplayer matches. Once a game is concluded, you're forced to exit to the main menu where you'll have to jump through a few separate menus in order to change your currently equipped deck or to host another game. Also a search function would be a welcomed addition for the deck builder, as it can sometimes be a little tedious searching for the cards you want.This isn't the only area of the game that is lacking content as the single player challenge mode has been removed as well. There are also a lot of cards that are only available in the single player campaign and inaccessible when it comes to crafting your deck. One could say this is a result of balancing issues, but the game has definitely been designed from the ground up to cater towards micro-transactions. I wouldn't mind spending money for constant DLC card packs and additions if the game was self-contained like Hearthstone but the fact that it's simply a yearly release that will only be supported for a limited time, makes it feel somewhat pointless. Magic 2015 also has quite a few bugs and glitches. I found that I was unable to change my resolution to 1920 x 1080 without going in and manually editing the config file in wordpad. I've also experienced quite a few freezes in the multiplayer where the timer will disappear, forcing us to leave the game. Not only that, but it does randomly crash to the desktop as well.Ultimately, Magic 2015 is one step forward and two steps back, it's enjoyable if you're a fan of Magic the Gathering. The deck creation tool is a much welcomed addition, however micro-transactions, an unintuitive interface, bugs, and a lack of features in general holds it back. While the initial game provides a great base to build on, chances are the DLC will be aimed at making as much money as possible from the consumer before repeating the same formula with Magic 2016.

												Dear Wizards of the Coast. You seriously need to step your game up and create a DTCG (Digital Trading Card Game) that actually competes with other DTCG's currently and upcoming out there. You have failed to create a singular platform (Magic Online is a piece of garbage) where all MGTO fans can gather and play each other for fun and competitivly. Look at Infinity Wars, HEX, hell even Hearthstone.... How dense can ya'll be?I have been wanting to play a singular online platform of MGTO on my desktop since I was in middleschool, I am now 26... I am still waiting for ya'll to get your act together and create an actually stable, graphicle, and appealing online game. You have failed to do so and have given us this. Sure it's good looking and stable. But there is still tons to be desired to even be as competent as the other DTCG who have far less funding yet FAR surpass you. This shouldn't HAPPEN! I have always loved and dedicated a lot of time on MGTO but for some odd reason even though you're the big one in the room you FAIL at giving what your fans and dedicated players want.If you guys stopped with this whole ""Release"" a new title every year which are limited in their cards that fractures your player base and created a single downloadable client that we all can download and all be able to play with a cash shop and all then I'd be happy. I want to spend my money on your DTCG game but at your current state and your competition my money goes to them instead of you.Don't get me wrong I enjoyed playing this game but coming from playing other competing DTCG's you have left massive holes to be desired and to improve upon. Stop releasing new 'games' every year. Focus on the engine and release card collections like the rest of the herd. No microtransactions on a game that will be dead next year. I dont want to start my collection from scratch every year!Hopefully you get it right the next time but my expectations will always be low.			"

												A lot more bad points than good points on this one.Edit : BUT, you might wanna have a look at my (edited now that I got more hours behind me) closing words to know if this game is for you or not.Pros & ConsPros :- Finally being able to build a somehow more ""customized deck"" !- The new battle UI is neat (is that even a good point anyway)- If you're really patient, you can get a lot of cards and shape your deck however you want, tho be prepared for some nuts grinding.Cons :- Menus are goddam slow to navigate in. Looks fancy the first few minutes, but afterwards each menu transition will feel like an eternity. You also sometimes have to click several times on a button due to the slow responsiveness of the UI (probably cos it didn't finish its transition)- You start with only one deck (yes, only one). You cannot swap decks once you have chosen, and you have no idea what the contents of your pick will be (all you know is the colors inside your starter deck).- The starting deck is WEAK, and I mean it. Compared to the previous Magic DoTP, the deck feels weak, no fun cards in it that makes you grin, no solutions against many types of deck you might encounter. The result is, AI will♥♥♥♥♥♥you in Planeswalker diff unless you get not only a perfect starting hand but also very good draws. In fact, turn down the difficulty to ""Mage"" and do some games against a random AI deck, you're not even guaranteed to win, even as a veteran player. The problem would not be with your skills, but because of how weak the deck is. It does look like you can change your starting deck at the very start (tho it doesn't seem clearly visible), but afterwards you're stuck with it until you get enough cards to build a new deck, or to alter your starting one to something decent.- Grindfest party to build a proper deck. We are very close to a Pay2Win iteration with this 2015 edition. The game now has an online shop in which you can buy boosters (1.79€ for 10 cards) for real money, or an entire card collection for (4.99€). We all get where this is going. And given the facts that even Mage level AI will pown you depending on your starter deck (which doesn't make speed games for farm very efficient at start), you will either have to be very patient or break your piggy bank, the latter being obviously what the game wants you to do. For reference, Only two rares in your starting deck (one at first, and the second when you finish or skip tutorial).- The land system is broken. Example : Let's suppose you have two plains and two swamps in play, and in your hand you got two cards that each cost one swamp and one colorless mana to play. If you wanted to play both, you obviously would want to pay one plain and one swamp for each.Well guess what? No. Click the first card in your hand, and the system will often tap both swamps for its mana cost. What the [insert kind words and sing a Bieber song here] hell? You can still tap your lands manually with CTRL, but the system used to be smart enough to leave you with the right mana combinations, which ain't the case anymore. Let's hope this gets fixed.Closing wordsWell, we wanted a better way to customize our deck, so now we have it. While I believe there is a way to build the ""deck of your dreams"" (will never beat Shandalar anyway), the game obviously wants you to pay extra money to get what you want. I'm saying this because if this wasn't the case, they could've made starter decks more fun and powerful (like the starter decks in the previous series), and still make other good cards unlockable afterwards, which would've been fair trade. Instead, they made your deck as weak as it can be to either push your patience to the limit or make you break your piggybank. This is not a business tactic I am especially fond of, thus I cannot put a thumbs up for this game.Edit : To clear any misuderstanding, I'm not saying the game is bad per-se. The game itself is solid, and if you're willing to make repeated fights to farm your cards, you'll definitely have fun later on (I can tell without being there yet). I mean, how can it not be fun to make the deck the way you want ?HOWEVER, and unlike the previous Magic DotP games, you WILL NOT have fun right off the bat. You will first have to farm cards for hours before you have something you can really call a ""Deck"". In the end, if you know you are willing to spend a decent amount of time to get your cards, I believe you won't regret it and you'll definitely have fun. If not, well...Have a great day,Zanameth, a very old Magic playerMy favorite deck? A ""Wildfire"" variant from the Urza block! Veterans will know what I refer to.Edit 19th July : Clarified the mana tapping problem and the starting deck problem.			"

												Wizards of the Coast and Stainless Games have listened to hardcore fans and finally given them what they want: a sales funnel.I'm having a hard time grasping how Magic 2015 became such a mess. Previous games in the series have been wonderful, offering the components and mechanics of the Magic: The Gathering card game without the overly involved meta-game. Choose one of the pre-configured decks, play a quick game online, then step away from the computer and enjoy the other passions in your life. I contend that it is one of the most enjoyable ways to play Magic: The Gathering, if only because you don't have to interact with the sort of people who play Magic: The Gathering on a regular basis.  A common criticism of Magic 2015's predecessors was ""Why can't I build my own deck from scratch using all of the Magic cards ever made?"" This is similar to walking into a coffee shop and asking for a porterhouse steak. No one will argue that it's what you'd most desire at that given moment, but the resources exist for you to have that experience without making the world collapse and conform to your immediate needs. There is a game called Magic: The Gathering Online that allows players to have the ""complete"" Magic: The Gathering experience, such as spending hundreds of dollars to build the same deck that everyone else is using because of a mechanical exploit. That is it's own thing. You can go out onto the internet and type ""Magic: The Gathering Online"" in a search engine, with or without quotes, and spend lots of money on digital trading cards. The Duels of the Planeswalkers series has offered a different experience, more akin to a fighting game. It was a well balanced game that afforded many different play styles and allowed players to have fun regardless of their skill level.Magic 2015 does away with pre-configured decks almost completely. You play a tutorial and then choose from a list of different decks. None of them are very good. You can not change your deck after choosing without deleting your save file and starting over. You must use that deck for the first section of the campaign. If you are patient you will eventually unlock the ability to build your own decks, but only after slogging through numerous battles with the starter deck.When you win a battle, you are rewarded with a booster. This booster contains a few cards that are almost certainly worthless to you. Maybe you are playing with a black zombie deck. Your booster might contain three green cards that are not zombies. And you'll say, ""Wow, I wish I could get lucky and open a booster with some good zombie cards in it!"" The solution to this is to purchase a premium booster. These premium boosters contains the Good Cards. They cost $1.99 each. You can buy as many as you want. The only way to get the Good Cards is by buying premium boosters. If you buy enough of them, you might get a Great Card that wins the game when you play it. If you don't buy enough of them, you will be at a disadvantage when playing online against the people who did buy enough of them. These people will play a Great Card and you will lose the game.It is important to remember that you have paid at least $9.99 for this experience.Design decisions like these have turned a reasonably solid series into something foul. You should not buy this game. You should not play this game. If you want a casual game of Magic: The Gathering, buy Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014. It is well balanced and fun to play. If you want to spend exorbitant amounts of money building whatever deck is dominating the Magic: The Gathering meta-game, play Magic: The Gathering Online. If you want a real challenge, open a coffee shop that sells porterhouse steaks. Let me know how it does.One additional item that I absolutely must mention as part of my ""See Something, Say Something"" campaign against offensive user experiences: the menus in this game are presented in a slideshow fashion, where you can only see one menu option at a time and have to cycle through each screen. This results in the inability to view menu options that are currently disabled. So it's impossible to judge your progress in the campaign, which is unfortunate because most of the game's content is hidden away behind various milestones. FAQs online told me that deck building was unlocked after beating Avanyc, but due to the poor menu system I was unable to determine how many more events I needed to clear before I reached that point. The ""unnumbered list"" menu system used in the previous games, as well as almost every single piece of interactive media produced since the beginning of time, would have been a much better solution for content navigation.

Posted: May 10, 2015
												Honestly there needs to be a mixed button for reviews I think.  Magic 2015 is a shining example of a game that has a number of good qualities but is marred by some bad ones as well.  It's like they took all these great ideas and then put some flaw that ruined the awesomeness that could've been.  I'm going to look at both the core game and the Garruck expansion with this review.On the positive side we finally get true deckbulding.  Every card you unlock can be accessed to build any deck you want.  This is something people have been clamoring for for awhile and it's great that they finally offered it to us.  You also face a wide variety of different decks in the single player campaign which while showing you the diversity of Magic also unfortunately shows you all sorts of cool stuff that you won't get to use in the game yourself.  I've heard people complain about the black and white color scheme and honestly I don't have a problem with it myself.  I think this is a taste thing as it doesn't seem any better or worse than the previous color schemes used in Duels of the Planeswalkers.  This brings us to some of the noticable flaws in the game unfortunately.  First is how they approached deck building.  You can have one of any mythic, two of any rare, three of any uncommon, and four of any common in your deck.  This goes back to the bad old days of hiding good cards behind rarity.  Note that there are good common and uncommon cards in this game and bad rare cards(I can't recall if there are bad mythics off the top of my head) but honestly they should've looked at each card and said ""Is this broken?"" and if their answer was yes, not included it and if the answer was no then allowed a full playset of four cards.  Some games can be decided by someone getting that rare or mythic card in their hand.  Second is some bad campaign choices.  This is especially bad in Garrucks expansion.  In that you have to use Garruck's premade deck and you'll be facing off against decks that are specifically designed to beat him.  It's not fun.  It's frustrating.  For example the second Garruck match gives you some new cards for your deck that you have to use...such as creatures that are capable of killing a non-black creature.....when you're facing an opponent who is using mono-black.  End result is that you have a seriously overpriced 3/3 flyer in your deck.  All the Garruck matches are like this and it's more a frustrating slog through the expansion as a result.  It could've been awesome.  His deck has stuff that you'll almost never get to play in the actual paper game such as Bayous(the original black/green dual land with no restrictions) but they successfully made even that not fun.  Third is the paucity of game modes.  I've heard people complain about the lack of two headed giant which is fair, but they pretty much only have the most basic modes.  This is the first Magic which hasn't offered an alternate mode at all.  No Adversary, no Planechase, nothing.  Commander has been big lately, couldn't they have put stuff in for that at least? Fourth is that some of the starter decks are almost traps.  They're really really bad and if you chose one it'll be much harder to go through the main campaign until you manage to unlock a few worthwhile cards.  And you don't even get to know what's in them until after you chose one.   Fifth is the lack of other players.  The flaws in the game have clearly lead to a limited player base as I've wandered on at what should be good hours and only seen a few people on.  The flaws and the fact that apparently they're already working on another game have clearly lead people to moving on.  The last thing is more a meta situation than anything else so I'd say less a flaw and more a flavor thing.  Obviously different eras of Magic had different metas.  The meta for 2015 is fairly aggressive.  It's going to favor aggro decks and not be so friendly towards slower decks so if you want to play a defensive blue/white control deck for example 2015 probably isn't going to be the Magic environment for you.  Overall it's a fun but noticably flawed game.  I wouldn't pay full price for it but if you see it discounted(I'd say 50% off minimum) and enjoy card games you might have an enjoyable playthrough.  I got it discounted and I do think I got my money's worth but I probably would've been more annoyed if I'd paid full price.  So not recommended at full price, but go ahead and pick it up if you can get it cheap.			"

												Short Version: Do not buy this game.  If you want to play Magic at your computer without investing in MTGO, buy DOTP 2014 instead.Quite frankly WOTC isnt known for quality control of digital products, but this might actually be the worst designed product with their name on it that I've seen (and I played MTG Tactics and MTG Battlegrounds).  I finally decided to try this version out, despite all of the negative things I've heard about it.  Surprisingly though, its somehow worse than I expected.The microtransactions arent the real problem here.  Certainly they are there, and that is slightly annoying given that the point of the DOTP franchise is to play MTG without that aspect of the card game.  However as a paper MTG player I'm certainly used to that.No, the real problem here is that the game that you are paying for is garbage.  First of all, its one of the most abysmal PC ports I've seen in awhile.  Instead of a menu screen, you get a series of icons that you scroll through one at a time until you find the one you were trying to get to.  Even in game, the mouse controls are strangely less smooth and not as responsive as in 2014.  It feels like the function of every aspect of the game has been sacrificed to try to make things look ""cool"".And since I'm talking about the appearance of the game.  It looks horrible.  Why is everything on the screen black and grey?  Did someone at the studio decide that the colorful blues, golds, and reds of DOTP 2014 were too pleasant to look at?  The whole design of the in-game interface is not only far less convenient and poorly laid out, but also just plain irritating to look at.  Are me and my opponent playing MTG in some dystopian sci-fi future where joy is illegal?But so far I've been talking about the interface, gameplay functionality, and apperance of the game; ""what about the actual card game?"", you excitedly ask.Unfortunately its just not worth it.  I continuously feel as though Im playing the sealed gameplay mode of DOTP 2014... except with less interesting cards.  And this is the 2015 campaign gameplay.  Sure being able to make my own deck with random cards is nice, but if I wanted to make a crappy deck with crappy cards I would play sealed mode.  Which I can already do in DOTP 2014.  And if I want to play multiplayer or the campaign, 2014 lets me play with some fun Magic cards from throughout MTG history instead of the boring trash you get to work with in 2015.In conclusion, if at any given time I was unable to go out and play paper Magic with people in person, I would play DOTP 2014.  If I was unable to play DOTP 2014, I would play Hearthstone.  And if I was forced to play DOTP 2015... I would go read a book.Learn from my mistake, dont buy this version of DOTP.  Dont support their horrible decisions.  Hopefully WOTC will seriously rethink their poorly implemented digital business model.			"

												BOTTOM LINE:If you don't already love the MTG games on PC, I would think carefully before buying this. If you do love MtG on PC or consoles and played the crap out of them, this is a nice change to see and lets you see some new cards. If you liked it previous years, get it.Pros:- It's MtG- Can now build decks.- Easiest way to play MtG without investing a fortune- Can be fun to play with friendsCons:-Campaign starts you with awful decks-Still has hilariously clunky menus after 4 years of the game (How did they not listen to the players on that one?)-No rewards/progress for losing games that last 10-25 minutes = wasted efforts and unfortunate for people without a lot of time or people who are new to the game.-It feels mandatory to restart the duel vs. the computer if you don't draw a perfect hand- No 2 Headed Giant (2v2) This was one of my favorite coop experiences with a friend of mine.If you can get past the those and you like Magic, then it's still fun. It's good for those who might have stopped playing MtG and just want a taste of it again. Plus, it's pretty cheap for the main game. Although if it's your first experience with MtG or the PC versions I'd recommend MtG 2014 instead.I'm dissapointed that online play vs other players now puts you at a big disadvantage if you don't to buy boosters to get good cards.

												The Good: You can finally construct your own decks. Some of the opponents are interesting.The Bad: No puzzle mode. The computer opponents get cards that are more fun than yours. Most of the good cards are locked behind pay walls, even in the fully purchased version (like the one I got).The Ugly: Game crashes CONSTANTLY. And I mean constantly. I have yet to actually shut the game down of my own choice. It always crashes to desktop instead.Recommended For: Masochists who enjoy a Computer Opponent who cheats and always has an optimal hand. Folks who really just can't get enough crashes to desktop. Your enemies.			"

												First I want to clarify that I've finished the campaign and played some multiplayer even the FFA.As someone who prefers Coop/Singleplayer it's a rather disappointing game.Pros : - finally some freedom to build our own decks (still not like the paper version)- the Ingame UI is beautifulCons :- no team based multiplayer whatsoever (IT'S HIS FAULT)http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/2ac4v9/ama_with_nik_davidson_lead_designer_for_magic/citnrid- slooooooow menu handling- the payment model (I mean a Complete Edition that doesn't include all cards... really?)- reasonable cardpool BUT there are cards in the game, that are only usable by the AI like the Slivers - no Challenge puzzles.Overall :I like the gameplay, but it's frustating to play against others who have more cards and yes there are some that are especially powerfull or AI that has Cards that you can't unlock at all like the Slivers. As someone who has bought the complete edition i can only turn away in shame.			"

												I was forced to spend an hour beating the first campaign to simply unlock the multiplayer mode.

Once I finally unlocked the multiplayer mode, the only options that I was given were for ""2 players,"" ""3 players,"" and ""4 players.""  I guess I should have done some research on the game first, but it never even dawned on me that they would remove one of the most popular modes, and the only mode that I ever played in Magic 2012, 2013, and 2014.2HG does not exist in this game.

												Not fun.The UI, while looking fancy, makes you slog through the menus. The fade-out/fade-in trick gets annoying very fast. Not fun.The deck system, while not necessarily bad, is simply not fun. You can no longer alternate between thematically oriented, colourful and interesting sets like in DotP '14. Instead, you get to choose a single deck by colour -- without knowing what it actually does and what cards it contains. While the optional second deck is based on your existing portfolio of cards and therefore fails to alleviate the issue, the inability to redo that crucial choice in the beginning is a real kicker. Cue endless tiresome games during which you desperately try to improve the absurdly abysmal starter deck with zero synergy so you stand a fighting chance against a full-blown enemy. It's possible to win, yes, but those 20+ minutes fights of attrition are not fun, unless you consider stabbing yourself in the eye with a rough spoon ""fun"".I'm not interested in multiplayer, but it appears that Wizards of the Coast is slowly pushing for pay-2-win by implementing booster packs with additional, potentially more powerful cards that cannot be obtained via normal play. Not fun.Sigh. Had I known DotP '15 was going to be so much less enjoyable than DotP '14, I would not have bought it. I really wanted to like this, but I think I'll stick with '14 for now, thanks.

												There's no way to restart your progress. You're stuck with the first choice you made. You can't delete your profile. You can't start over. It's just stupid. I got this to see what it was like ages ago, but thought it sucked. I re-installed it to teach my girlfriend how to play, but she'd be stuck with the choices I made. There's literally no way for her to discover anything for herself. It's a monumentally dumb way to design a game.			"

												Really wish i didn't spend the 35 bucks on this game. I had high expectations and it all flopped. Well, so far. CANNOT USE ANY OF THE CARDS YOU BOUGHT THE COMPLETE PACK FOR until you GRIND your way through the first level. I Had to reset match a few times due to the cards they start you with being so crappy. PREMIUM cards cannot be gained without purchasing. That is just GREED. 35 dollars should be enough for all of them. They went backwards with too many things in 2015. Crap.			"

												-The game is designed around microtransactions. The 10$ price tag is misleading.-You must choose a single starting deck and build from there, unlocking more cards as you progress, which would be fine if the cards unlocked at a decent pace (be prepared to grind for them) and if all the starting decks weren't horrible.-Since all the starter decks are absolutely terrible, you will have difficulty playing against the computer in the Planeswalker difficulty even if you are an experienced Magic player.-Terribly slow and badly designed user interface. I'd say it was designed for consoles but it doesn't work well with a gamepad either (maybe it was designed with touchscreens in mind, but definitely not PC).-Lots of people are having issues with crashes, and the game takes loads of time to startup for some mysterious reason.-Cutscenes still look like they belong in Age of Empires II.-No Two-Headed Giant mode.-You need to unlock the multiplayer mode.-The AI that decides on the mana usage is even worse than before. You can set it to manual (as you should), but the ""suggestions"" that the AI give are still terrible and will cost you plays if you're not careful.-This is personal preference, but there are even more ""encounter""/""challenge"" type duels and less against other Planeswalkers, which I don't like.Stay away from this one. If you need to scratch that Duels of the Planeswalkers itch, get the 2012 version.			"

												Sadly the addition of a pay to win premium booster system coupled with the removal of MtG 2014 co-op and challenge modes do not make up for the addition of a deck builder.In order to take full advantage of the new deck builder you would need to spend many hours battling with a tedious starter deck (that you are forced to choose with no card list available and you cannot change) against the AI to unlock cards, or pay $35 to skip. The content is so tedious that I'm sure plenty of people are paying that $35 just to avoid experiencing it. In addition to that, even if you pay $35 or unlock all free content the strongest cards in the game can still only be obtained via the RNG of opening ""premium"" booster packs.It feels like they are trying to shift these Duels of the Planeswalkers games in the direction of MtG Online, expecting people to pay large sums of money to open boosters, build decks and play competitively. Whilst the UI and gameplay is superior to MtG Online, MtG 2015 does not offer the trading, social and most importantly, competitive/tournament scene that the Online client does. So it straddles in between and ultimately offers the best of nothing. Not the enjoyable co-op, single player or casual PvP game that MtG 2014 is, but not the competitive PvP client that MtG Online is. Overall I do not know what the developers were thinking when they designed this, but I'm pretty sure the $ sign was involved. This game is moving in the wrong direction.			"

												What a terrible game. WotC went completely Pay to Win. Where as in Duals of the Planeswalkers 2014 sealed play was one of the best things in the game (Even if you had to pay in DotP 2014 to have 3 or more sealed decks ..of course.. ), they completely REMOVED sealed play from M2015 and I will tell you why. It's because their other game, Magic Online, makes them a lot more money in offering sealed play events because people pay the full price for virtual card packs over and over again (By the by, yes, the full retail price is charged in Magic Online. The exact same 4 dollars per pack like you would have to pay for physical ones.). And because that alone is not making them enough money yet, they changed their business model to make this game appealing only for the crowd of new players who are new to Magic and want to learn how to play. EDIT: They removed Two Headed Giant too apparentlyDon't even try multiplayer in this game. A number of card sets are available for everyone who wants to pay to make the perfect decks. If you just buy this game you are stuck with a cheap deck of commons that you picked at the beginning of the game. A choice you can't even revert later on if you don't like your deck.But wait, there is more:This game's interface, for some reason, is SLOW.  It's not my hardware but even scrolling through the main options is slow. The design is poor. You are pretty much forced to use your keyboard to scroll through it because it's so oddly placed on screen that if you try to use your mouse you will often accidentally click something, and your have to wait until it's loaded up (which takes like 3 seconds) before you can go back and load the interface back up (takes too annoyingly long as well). You might think; 'a few seconds? What is this guy whining about?' well, buy the game. You will see how annoying it becomes after you misclicked for the fifth time. The whole feel to this game is just as if it's an unfinished, unpolished game. Very badly optimized.My rant is not over yet:The promo you get for buying this game: Soul of Shandalar is terrible. Last year we got a decent rare but this card is just unplayable. Don't even get this game for the promo card if you were planning on that.Even if you are a new player whose characteristics include infinite patience; this game is not worth it for you even though you are the main selling audience. If you are determined on learning how to play Magic, just drive to your local store, pick up an intro deck (like 20 bucks) and play some real Magic with the people there. Im convinced it's a lot more fun to play together and Magic players are often very helpful and will teach you how. They don't have to improvise a way to help you through the constraints of a shabby business model. I am seriously contemplating quitting Magic the Gathering now. Don't get this game.Positive points:I bought the standard edition and didn't waste another 20 euro's on the full edition.			"

												I love MtG, but I can't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone. The Duels of the Planeswalkers games have always existed more as a product primarily targeting a casual/former/new Magic player audience, but even when I still avidly played the physical game, I could find something to enjoy in a DotP release. This year's edition makes the welcome change to allow deckbuilding to give more advanced players a meatier experience, but it does so many other things wrong that it ends up not being a product that is casual/new/lapsed player friendly, but isn't going to appeal to most avid MtGers either.Pros:Adds DeckbuildingNew UI graphic design is niceCons:UI drags, even on a high-end setupRemoved challengesRemoved sealed playRemoved revenge campaignRemoved Two-Headed Giant formatCard unlocking system is horrendousNot all cards unlockable without additional purchases (totalling almost $30 for everything, on top of the $10 for the game)Locks you into the starting deck you initially choose, with no way to view the decklists or try them before choosingStarter decks seem weak and have little synergyAI doesn't seem very intelligentSome enemy decks seem overpowered (despite poor AI), attempting to force you into the booster microtransactions As much as I love Magic, this just isn't fun. It's like WotC wanted to go the Free-to-Play route, but didn't want to make it actually free to play. Some of this could be patched away (though I'm not holding out hope), but a lot of it seems to be problematic at the game's core. Between my Xbox 360 and Steam, I've bought every DotP release as they've come out. Without significant (and unlikely) changes, this will be the last one I purchase.			"

You are stuck with the deck you pick at the start of the game, which I would not be so annoyed with since you are able to customize the deck in its entierity, but some of the cards required to make most archetypes are behind pay walls...I will finish the campaign by sheer brute force, but every time I play instead of being happy I get to play magic, I get annoyed at everything this game does wrong.

												This is the worst sham ever.. at least compared to the previous titles in this series. It used to be a cheap way of getting to play some MtG sure it had its limits with deck building, but it also had fairness in the sense that everybody had acces to the same cards, This new 2015 edition allows you one deck with no way of pre-viewing and then you have to buy booster packs to actually make it strong.... They really screwed the franchise for all of us casual player, the pros play the real online mgt anyway..To clarify you do unlock cards, but you'll have to spend more cash than the initial purchase if you want to have acces to the same arsenal as your oppenents.Other than that the game is pretty much the same as the other games of the serires.Edit: Felt i had to add an edit. Yes, you unlock a lot of cards so you can build more decks, which is fine if you only goal is to play vs. a somewhat broken AI. Unable to make a proper AI like all previous MtG games they allow the AI to chat in the sense that it play solely reactive with what must be classified as miracle draws. No real plan of attack besides the predesigned strategy. I for one have spent most of the old MtG's playing vs human oppenents.And here it very much matters that you need to buy boosters to unlock all the cards. The other MtG's had all the cards unlockable from completing games vs AI or human oppenents. This one does not. So I consider it to be a hidden charge that you need to pay if you plan on playing online. Sure you are not ""forced"" to do it, but it is borderline pay to win.			"

												What is Magic 2015 - Duels of the Planeswalkers?Magic 2015 - Duels of the Planeswalkers is based on the best-selling collectible card game ""Magic: The Gathering"". Like in each PC instance, with the exception of Magic The Gathering Online, the rules are dumbed down and a pre-set of cards is given to make the game appeal to more casual gamers that don't want to invest hundreds of dollars and still play with nice decks against each others.The basics of the game are explained in my review for Magic 2014, so please look there, including the comments section:http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/recommended/213850What are the differences between Magic 2014 and Magic 2015 then?Well, first of all you can now freely build your deck from a given card pool for which you can unlock booster packs by winning games or paying real money. While it doesn't sound bad at first, two factors greatly diminish the value of this novelty to the DOTP series: First of all the card selection is horrible, several combo cards are added without their counterparts, making it difficult to build a good deck. Second, some cards are real-money exclusive, which requires around 16 Euro to unlock all so-called ""premium"" booster packs.The multiplayer experience suffered greatly by the exclusion of the Two-Headed Giant mode where two players could play against two other players cooperative. Another removed mode is the puzzle mode where you could solve 10 puzzles, i.e. pre-given positions where you had to defeat the opponent. Instead a forced tutorial was added that goes over one full act, only afterwards are you allowed to get an own deck, and only after the next act to freely build your deck. This horrible design choice leads you to having to play through the first part of the game with the starter deck which you can't exchange for another starter deck. Those decks, of course, have misleading descriptions.As for achievements, most are nicely done again, only the 100 multiplayer wins are a very bad achievement, since without the Two-Headed Giant mode there is no real incentive to play multiplayer with not fun decks against other people with not fun decks. The 1v1 battles for that achievement should be done with a friend, ensuring you also can get other achievements easily.Another thing that really bugs me is that although the title is ""Magic 2015"" the signature cards of that addon are not included in this game - Waste Not would have been a real addition to the game, allowing for really cool effects. Instead you have cards you either know from the older games or that don't have much synergy. You want to create a deck of your style? No good mill, no good burn, no good anything - a green-white token deck or red-blue control deck without any real opportunity to draw cards is the highest of feelings you can get.On the positive side, several new effects were implemented, such as multicolor lands (finally!) and Monstrosity. And as the title says, planeswalkers are... wait... still not implemented!Recommended: Play inofficial mods for Magic 2014 instead, and do your own deckbuilding with inofficial tools there. Many effects of Magic 2015 are already possible there, although quality varies. And yes, you CAN have planeswalkers with unofficial mods in Magic 2014!Even as a die-hard DOTP fan, I can't recommend Magic 2015!			"

												After spending a lot of time playing Magic 2014, both the story mode and online with freinds I've ended up feeling rather betrayed it's sucessor. Specifically I dislike the way decks and the aqquisition of new cards has been handled. After a brief tutorial you are thrown to a very large list of pre-assembled decks, all looking suitably cool with their flavour names and artwork, however expect to enjoy only one of these for a very large amount of play because that is all you may use with the standard edition. No information is given on any of the decks apart from their colours and it is not made clear that the decision you make here is final with no going back to sample the others. To me this feels like a gentle shove in the direction of the £4 a pop dlc packs offering all the cards instantly. After this at the end of each sucessful duel you will be given a booster pack relating to the plane you are currently on, a nice idea that gives you options for customisation that may not have been so prelavent in previous editions. This system is flawed however, I found on my playthrough the packs to be glitchy, and several times I was re-issued the same pack. The departure of Two Headed Giant, a mode me and freinds enjoyed significantly seems to seal the deal for me. I can't recommend this game particularly, I'd rather just go back to 2014 and play Echanter's Arsenal without having to throw Wizards any more money than I already have...			"

												Magic 2015 has taken steps backwards in all the wrong directions. People have complained for years about many features, or lack thereof in this series. The developers finally listened to people cries for full deck building. While the deckbuilding is robust and the card collection is larger than ever, there is almost no content to back it up.DotP has been a great online trading card game because it had little competition in the past. Now that there is competition in the form of great games like Might & Magic Duel of Champions and Hearthstone, Magic 2015 is easily overshadowed. You would think that a game series would only add content to the franchise in yearly installments, but Magic 2015 has actually stripped multiplayer of it's best game modes. Two headed giant IS NOT in Magic 2015, and the developers fail to acknowledge that it was one of the best selling points of past games, and the only mode distinguising DoTP from the competition (Hearthstone players are dying for a 2HG game mode, but will likely not get it). The removal of the 2HG was a fatal mistake for Magic 2015, and can be credited to Nik Davidson (http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/2ac4v9/ama_with_nik_davidson_lead_designer_for_magic/citnrid).In the past, cards were unlocked either through grinding (which wasn't all that bad!) or simply manipulating game files to unlock all cards. The developers have done nothing to moderate or squelch people from cheating in past iterations of DotP, and I can easily forsee people exploiting Magic 2015 to the fullest. I would say that Magic 2015 is pay to win since actually unlocking the games full content will cost more than the base price of the game in the form of microtransactions, but I won't because I don't think it will be long before people hack cards into their games and start using cookie cutter decks. Regardless, I do not see myself investing the time to craft decks in Magic 2015 because my only multiplayer options are to 1v1 duel, or free-for-all up to four players - opposed to the past 2HG, and the hilarious Planeschase mode from 2013.Aside from the removal of the best game mode in DoTP, Magic 2015 has compounded the worst features of past iterations. The menu system has never been strong, and 2015's is the worst of the worst. Navigating the menu is cumbersome, and clicking buttons is extremely unresponsive. Thankfully, the in-game responsiveness is better, but the game is still brought down by slow animations and a boring playing field.I have been a fan of Duels of the Planeswalkers for years, and a cardboard Magic player for 20 years. Magic 2015 is a huge dissapointment and one of my first regret purchases on Steam. This can honestly be salvaged if the developers patch in 2-Headed Giant, but if past games are any indication, they will do nothing to support the game except release nickle-and-dime microtransactions rather than fix bugs. With over 500 hours played in the DotP series, I am sad to say that I likely will not be playing this game and instead move onto the now better online TCGs.			"

												Here it comes the new duels game of the year! Owners of previous games in the series will be glad that they get a free booster for owning the 2014 instalment of duels and the prebuyers also got an additional booster. However.. this game is a major letdown on several fronts. In general the cards available has never been this weak and lacking in terms of power. The most popular game mode of the series has been ditched (2 Headed Giant) and the sluggish way the menu's work turns what could could be a good game into something less desirable. The only good thing to say is that you're not forced into spending a whole lot of money buying this game and a year from now the game will be forgotten anyhow.			"

												I've owned every mtg since 2012 version and this is by far the worst. Can't change decks if you pick a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one at start, menus are slow as all hell, and they want to force you to buy more cards with real money after already pitching in for this pile of poop in the first place. No co-op anymore and can't even play multiplayer before you beat the first campaign section which is already pretty ridiculously hard if you happened to pick a♥♥♥♥♥♥deck.Just don't buy ;D			"

												I have now been a paying customer of the Magic The Gathering Series for many years, and this game is by far the worst installment i have yet to come across. I know i may not have played the game long enough to gain credibility but lets start at the basics. There is no Two-headed Giant which IMHO is one of the best gametypes they created for the game, the UI is a shambles and in no way needed changing from the previous games. At the games start you get to choose ONE deck out of the many terrible ones they have put together and trust me i know what im talking about when it comes to MtG.From the previous games you had the sence of feeling that everybody had access to the same cards and this has gone in the complete opposite direction in terms of that feeling and approach. It has become, like the metagame itself a pay to win game and i for one am very dissapointed in this ultimate proposal. In Summary do not buy this game, if you are looking to re-invest your time back into MtG then i plead you to try Magic 2014 or just play the real game itself with friends where you do not need to spend ludicrous amounts of money in order to feel ""Competitive"" On the other hand if you are simply looking for a new card game just try Hearthstone where you can actually have a sence of achievement without spending a lot of money on Packs.

												I'd like to discuss the weak starter decks, the new automatic land tap (they broke it), the grind and the missing features but I can't. The whole menu usability is so frustrating it overshadows any other feature of the game.No matter how good I play and with what cards, I will end up frustrated because the HR department skipped over the usability experience in the interviews.All they managed to achieve is have nice single icons on the screen. Which might be nice if you're using a smartphone but you'd break it anyway after another ""menu transition"" which is not really an animation anyway, just a very prolonged fade.Even on a tablet there's place to choose more than one icon (sorry, I forgot left and right...) and have some sort of attempt to ease the navigation. For the mouse navigation they just attached a mouse to a tablet and checked wether you could see and move the cursor. You will go mad if you don't use the keyboard in the menus.Overall it takes me about 50 (not counting skipping the intros or the 20 clicks to get past the ""Press Start"" screen) clicks to start a game. The menus are so horrible I ended up quitting the game several times because I accidentally clicked past ""do you really want to leave"". Which is the only good thing about these menus since it saved me from several heart attacks.			"

												Let me start by saying I was really excited for this game. I've loved every Magic DotP game and have called them one of the best cost to content bargains available for years. That being said, I was fairly happy to shell out the $35 for the complete edition of this game. This leads me to one of my bigger $35 dollar mistakes in recent memory. This game fails to deliver on so many differnet facets, I get a headache pondering the rant that I want to fill this page with. To attempt brevity: In the pursuit of making the game more aesthetically pleasing and the touted 'build your own deck' function, they have miserably failed at delivering the experience given in the other DotP titles. When I start inspecting the ""card collection"" available in this game (which I payed a premium cost that would have reflected 2 expansions for games earlier in the series) the true migrane sets in... I really have more to say, but writing this out is kind of ruining my evening. So, please, take it from me AVOID THIS TITLE. Thanks.			"

												Relatively new player to MtG here. I've played and enjoyed DotP2014 very much so I decided to pick this one up as well. And my thoughts so far? A very apparent downgrade to the previous version. Like the other reviewers have said: the menus are extremely slow and often buggy (more than likely you'll have to click twice or more before the damn thing responds), annoying fade to white screen when you win a duel, the AI for mana tapping is extremely dumb (it prioritizes same color mana instead of looking at what you have in hand and then making the optimal selection), you can NOT view the contents of the starter decks beforehand, you are stuck with your starter deck with no option to change starter decks, pay2win premium booster packs that unlocks fairly good cards, playing campaign battles do not grant booster packs when you win, no extra play modes (challenges & two headed giant). The upside with this 2015 version is that you can now build your own deck and the UI is slightly better.6/10 I don't feel like I've wasted $10 but am still very disappointed.			"

												Beware before buying: slow, slow, sloooooooooooooow.- Starts out with a terrible deck and defeating the AI is painfuly slow. (Yeah it cheats)- Getting new cards is painfuly slow.- Gameplay is slow as ever but to boot now even the menu is horribly slow. You have to watch that sliding animation every time you switch a menu. Slower to restart a duel too because of this and you will want to restart a lot vs the AI unless you like wasting 20-25 minutes because you drew a bad hand.- Choosing your initial deck is nothing but a guess. I chose a green one, was a bad idea.So basically if you own previous titles and try out this one, you will be annoyed. If you haven't tried any installments then you can get this one although I think previous years were better. Ps. No Two headed giant.			"

												I have to preface this review with a couple of facts.  This is my first negative review of a steam product.  I love MTG and have been playing since the 90s with a couple of breaks in between.  So when I say this game is garbage I'm not just being a hater.  At the core when you are playing a match it is just like all the other games in the series.  It is the card gathering mechanics, menus, and lack of game modes that hurts this version of Duels.  Unlike previous games in the Planeswalker series you don't start the game with a selection of decks to move between and maybe discover new play styles.  You are locked into one deck that you have to pick off it's NAME, thats right name and color no card preview.  You are now stuck with that and must use it to beat matches and earn booster packs.  On the plus side you do have the ability to fully customize your decks which is awesome.  The down side to that is that the card selection is kinda meh.  Also being a game that is focused on dual colored cards it has barely any and the card focus is totally on sets that had plenty of them.  You can buy booster packs with micreotransactions or just unlock all the cards in a certain set.  Personally I don't like microtransactions of that nature but whatever, what really burns it is that the cards are lackluster on a whole.  I spent about 10 hours grinding out my black deck and once I had it finished I didn't want to play anymore.  Oh almost forgot no Two-Headed Giant (2v2 MP) or Archenemy(3v1 uber deck)!  Draft mode is chill but I dig team battles way more.  Go play real life MTG or Hearthstone.			"

												Advantages:- you can finally build your own deck, freely without any limitations (other than cards available in game)Disadvantages:- slow and unresponsive menu - you have to click the same button multiple times or wait 5 seconds for stupid animation to finish- interface bugs - sometimes when asked to make a choice you are unable to do this (e.g. you are asked to choose a card from graveyard but you cannot look into the graveyard) - the only solution is to concede a duel- game play bugs such as AI taping one swamp to pay ""one black mana + X any mana"" with X = 1- AI is taking a lot of time to make the choice (as in the previous editions)- the game gets boring after you unlock all the cards by playing campaign- only standard games - no archenemy, no planechase, no two headed giant- no challenge puzzles- some cards cannot be unlocked in the campaign, but have to be bought via micro transactions- a lot of cards implemented in the game are not available to the player, but are used by AIOverall the game is very disappointing and unless you are huge MTG fan you shouldn't waste your money on it. It's based on the same engine as previous editions, so the only work they have actually done was adding a deck building tool and implemented new cards.			"

												Bad bad bad. ****There is a hidden fee of $24 in this game if you want access to everything. If you don't want to pay this then you are locked out of a large chunk of cards.****Finally adding the ability to create your own deck from a large pool of cards at the expense of every other enjoyable concept in the previous titles is just... well, bad. You start off with a random starter deck, or might as well be random as you can't see what any of the starters have in them till you make your choice. You are then locked into those cards till you grind away for hours opening random packs of cards. What's worse, is even after spending hours upon hours of your time grinding away to unlock your cards, there is still a large collection of cards that are unobtainable unless you spend $1.99 per pack to randomly get your ""Premium Cards"". So disapointed with this title and with myself for wasting money buying this before reading the reviews of this game.			"

												As of right now this game is either a joke or a real life simulation of the way you get cards in the real game. you pay $10 to buy the game itself, then after wasting an hour in the tutorial you pick one dual color deck that gives little to no information on what is inside. To make matters worse you need to do the tutorial to progress which is nigh impossible considering the scamming ai and the fact that ""intro deck"" you picked has little to no way of dealing with anything.Edit: After playing the game for a bit and grinding I not only managed to beat the tutorial but also the first world. Now my review still stands for a few good reasons, 1. Now this may sound trivial but 2 headed giant is a well loved game mode by many fans of the other installments and also planeswalker was a fun mode, and 2. It should tell you what you are getting in those duo colored decks.			"

												I do not recommend buying 2015, I, like many others made the mistake of purchasing this game under the impression that multiplayer game mode Two-Headed Giant would still be there, which it isn't. There are many gameplay and graphical bugs, however those I'm sure will be addressed. Still no real deck builder, and the worst offence is the addition of pay only premium cards. WotC has gone completely P2W, while taking out a core multiplayer experience.			"

												The game looks nice and the ability to create your own decks is certainly welcome.  However, the clunky interface and the lack of 2-Headed Giant mode makes this much less fun to play.  I don't understand how 2HG mode has been in all the previous iterations of Magic but somehow they just can't pull it together for this year.  Or will it be something that needs to be purchased seperately as a DLC as a way to milk some extra cash from customers?In any case, I feel this was either a poor effort or the prelude to a cash grab.

												Watch out, the game starts with only one deck unlock, which you recieve so little information that its pratically a guessing game, and you can pay for cards ingame. P2W on a game that you have to buy is pretty low and while you can grind to unlock cards as well the AI is overpowered meaning that you need to have a great starting hand to win. Play Hearthstone instead, at least the game is free and the unlocks feel more rewarding.			"

												HUGE step down from 2014.You are forced to play a Tutorial AND the first Campaign level to unlock every feature like the filter option in the Deck Edit menu or your pre-order / complete edition purchases. (Though this is the least bad thing)It uses a UI straight ported from the iPad version, with animations on each click taking ages to finish (~2-4 seconds to arrive at the next screen).It is horribly programmed. GTX 580 + i5 2500k and i barely get an average FPS of 40. If cards are played i drop as low as ~20  FPS.They dropped every mode besides basic 1v1.Though you get most cards from playing, there are special ""Premium Cards"" you have to buy with real money. To get all Premium Cards you need 14 Premium Boosters valued at ~1.79€ each. Those Premium Cards naturally are pretty good cards.Those are the main problems i have with this game. Until something changes i do NOT recommend anyone, even fans of the series, to buy this game.			"

I have been playing hearthstone for the last month counting down the days until 2015 launch, I even had my girlfriend signed on to play, since we could do 2headed giant together. Not sure if I will keep playing 2015 at all.Cons:No 2HG or ANY kind of way to play with friends. (I cant believe they did this.)No ranked vs casual playNo split mode with customdecks only and theme decks onlyObvious pay2win implicationsNo challenge scenarios (lol what? why)Pros:Now you can build a deck from scratch, and they did a good job giving you more info (stats etc), but this only translates to people who buy the most boosters being on top.Overall, huge dissapointment. Im not sure why they decided to take away almost half of the features, its not like this is exactly a complicated game. If I wanted to play MtG online, I would.			"

												No Two Headed Giants. Only one deck blindly unlocked from the beginning of the game. Custom matches against the CPU no longer award cards for decks. New Pay-to-Win booster purchasing model for both single and multiplayer. In terms of actual gameplay mechanics, it's basically the same as its predecessors. Nothing much to comment on there. But If you don't support this disgusting new emerging P2W model that seems to be creeping into every facet of gaming these days, vote with your wallet: Don't buy this game. Go buy/play DoTP 2014 instead. Unfortunately I preordered this one, so I don't have the option of denying them my money. At least not this time. Guess who won't be preordering M16.Shame on you Magic. Pathetic cash grab.EDIT: Also, you appear to be arbitrarily limited to fewer than 4 copies of certain cards in your digital collection. I have no idea whether this is intended as a balancing move or to further entice players into purchasing premium boosters, but either way that is not how Magic works and it is stupid.			"

												They start you off by having you pick a deck that you have no way of previewing but that's irrelevant because it will almost certainly be unplayable until you buy boosters. Menus are very clunky and navagating them is awkward. I may be alone on this one but when I preordered the special edition with all the card collections I thought I was going to be getting entire blocks of cards, not 50ish random cards from blocks with 250ish in them, again, that may just be me but they didn't specify what ""collection"" meant and it was very deflating to find out I payed for around 50 cards from each block listed and most of the cards are useless. I dont have xp but I do think making a card game that doesn't support it is absurd, don't waste your time here.			"

												I just have to say: If I was going to recommend this game, it would be a hell of a challenge at the moment!Much like the other Duels of the planeswalkers games, I can find ways to get fun out of it. But this one makes it quite a bitmore difficult then the others I have played!Now to what I like and dislike about this.The Decks!Positive: You can build your own decks: This has its enjoyable moments and it feels good to ""Build"" your own deck as-well ashaving freedom to do what you want and use or add what-ever colour you feel like! so long as you have the right cards of course. It was also good for them to do Tutorials before jumping you right into the decks and give you a chance to understand what the colours do!Negative: The starting deck experience I thought was fine at first. But you eventually realise that the starting deck you get is just garbage and can't really compete against half the decks reliably. It doesn't help that the cards you get almost feel like they are intentionally designed to not help your deck (I'll get to that later)Negative 2: Be careful what Starting colour you pick, because you cannot change once you accept it! You can build others yes, but good luck with that!______Boosters!Positive: I really like that they have done it much like MTG in real life (Bunch of commons, 3 uncommons and a rare or mythic rare!) the mystery of the boosters is always something I am a fan of. It is also nice that you get a booster everytime you finish a campaign mission (Not sure about Multiplayer; haven't touched it yet) Negative: As much as I like the mystery of the cards, I swear it is Designed to NOT pick cards for your starting deck! the amount of cards from boosters I have gotten that have been every colour BUT Blue white (Which is the starting deck I chose) Is a bit silly now! This does makes me guess they done it for the next Negative...Negative2: PAYWALL, GUYS! PAYWALL! This I was originally worried about because we already pay money for the bloody game, and it feels like you're forced to pay more, Which is just bad design! I did by two just to see a difference. Thankfully I just got draws I couldn't use, because that is exactly what I needed (Insert Sarcasm here!)_____Visuals Positive: The menus and the game over-all game looks nicer and more modernised! It is good to look at and easy to find most things. Positive: When actually playing the game, everything not only looks better and is easier to see but they made it more interactive. It was a cool Idea that the Environment actually shifts tone and the battlefield gets modified as-well as some other minor things which is just neat to look at!Negative: As much as I like the look of the menus... They couldn't make it more annoying to work with! In a nutshell, you can only look at one thing at a time (Single player, multiplayer, decks, shops ect..) and when things are locked off, it doesn't allow you to look at them AT ALL! It is especially annoying in the Deck area, where you can see these different decks, but cannot get a clue of WHAT THEY ARE! Negative 2: This isn't really a visual thing, but it kinda does fit in. TRANSITIONS! And boy do they like making you look at fading white fog with a white background... Slowly! If they didn't take so bloody long, they would actually be pretty cool and would fit well with the theming of 2015. But no, they had to be unusually slow and annoying to watch! You even have to stare at the start menu! ""Yes, they must look at our glorious 'Enter game' button"" A Genius developer said (Insert Sarcasm here)-----Finally, Gameplay(NOTE: I haven't done multiplayer yet, only single player, so I wont judge the game there)Positive: Because of the ability to properly make your own deck, the game has that extra level of enjoyment. It is that feeling when in real life, you made your first deck away from a starter deck and won against one of your friends (Which is a fun♥♥♥♥♥feeling!) Positive: I don't know if I am frequently lucky or not. but it feels like the drawing system is more designed so you actually get cards you can use so you can actually play the game! I do know from the previous DotP games that you can quite oftenly just draw abysmally and you'd be better off leave or restart half the games you play.Negative (This is campaign exclusive) : I have grown to really hate the campaign in this one! It isn't like the others where they add some stupid mechanic that you have to get a good draw to beat it.. That still exists, but from the ones I've seen, they are at-least acceptable and only slightly annoying. What is annoying that relates to that is the AI drawing the same cards, or always having the same cards. This would be fine if the deck you were given and the boosters weren't so bad that you likely can't do a thing about what they do. I'm almost content to not play the singleplayer at all because of it! -----CONCLUSION!I can say for a time you will get enjoyment out of this game much like the others. How long that lasts, will likely depend on how full your wallet is... or your Patience to tolerate some of the issues this game has. It does sadden me a little, because I was looking forward to the boosters, the deck building and just a freash change from the usual DotP Formula. It is just a classic case of ""Taking one step forward, but two steps back"" Which is really unfortunate. Thank you for reading my Rambling! Hopefully I did well for a first review on Steam!			"

												Firstly I've been playing this game since revised and this is the 6th computer version I've played. So my basic opionions on it.1. There is no 2 headed giant. A major drawback for some. I miss it, but I can live without it.2. Terrible starting decks. It's a deleberate game push towards teaching deck tweeking. And it does lend to the true beginners experiance of not having any cards. 3. The automatic funtions as always have to be turned of. I can declaire my own attackers thank you, and I'll choose when I'm done with a stage. I know they use this for beginners, but it's truely as always anoying and useless. Even beginners need to learn how to manage games stages.4. The card pool of unlockable cards is one of the biggest of all the electronic versions. Still not enough cards for my taste. But a nice big unlockable pool. And don't pay to unlock the cards, just play for them. Easy enough to get everything but the battle packs.5. Foils again?! Why? Worthless online; you can't trade them for upmarket value like in real face to face and as always they make it VERY difficult to see which card is which on screen. 6. Multiplayer is a bit sparce currently. It may pick up, I suspect though with people still playing 2012 on here, 2013 on here, and 2014 on here; just massively hampers the number of players. And to top that with no 2headed giant available as of yet...7. There are no stupid slots you have to pay to unlock! WOOP!Now you take all that.. and it is still a good version of magic online. Well worth buying and playing. If you love deck crafting this is the best version available. Could use a larger card pool, but at least they are giving you a great lake to play in rather than the typical large pond the hand you. I just wish they'd give us the ocean.			"

I have purchased all of the other Duels games and so far this is the worst one to come out. The starting decks are completely terrible and there is no way to obtain the booster pack I supposedly recieved by preordering it. There is no phone number for steam and my attempts to contact the company have gotten me nowhere. Way to lose a paying customer!			"

												As a fan of MTG for over 10 years and have played every game in the series, but this is by far the worst it's simply pay2win and not even subtle about it, you start with a terrible under powered decks and you have 2 options spend real money on deck unlocks or boosters or grind hoping to get decent cards.

												Welcome to MTG DotPw 2015.It's a pos compare to 2014 (which is the best, so far). As you get into the game you're pushed on some AD which only counts in the US or what not so why push this on us outside the US border... after that you're greeted with this garbage of a Menu UI. Some touch / console trash which makes you furious to navigate, when playing the ""game"" it still the same UI luckly. Now! what's new, beside the awful UI? Well, they added something we've been asking / hoping for, deck buidling. But, it turned out to be a dumb gimmick, given all you get is a small pool of mostly terrible cards. I'd rather go back to pre constructed decks which gets 40 unlocks or whatever than this. They removed two headed giant and there's no archenemy, why? It's like removing conquest from battlefield or TDM from call of duty.3/10 "

												While I have purchased and enjoyed every DotP game to date, this game reinforces that the magic franchise wants your money more than they want you to enjoy their product.I was exicted about the promise of this game, and even went so far as to pre-order, having overall enjoyed their previous games despite their faults. Won't make that mistake again.My biggest qualms thus far are the crawling rate to acquire cards that seems to imply they'll want you to buy many of them, the abundance of crappy animations and transitions that you can't disable, the strange requirement to unlock the game modes, and the removal of team play (previously seen in the form of Two Headed Giant). While previous magic incarnations have allowed you to unlock a deck after completion of each campaign leg, now you do not unlock enough cards to make a full new deck in a campaign leg. While I'm intrigued and excited by the new deck building format similar to the 2014 sealed, it's looking like you'll be paying a lot of money for boosters if you want any decent cards. I have no problem with grinding for them, but I hate pay to win games, especially when i've already payed for the base game. Again, there are unlocks, but it's taking me so long to get enough cards for a new deck that makes sense that I'll likely have to finish the full campaign before I can make more decks. I'm excited for deck building, but the starter materials are a little too scarce for my liking, especially since you can't change your starter deck if you find you hate it.I found it curious that even as an accomplished magic player I was forced to play through a really slow and annoying tutorial teaching me how to play. While some players have reported that there should be an option to skip, I'm not the only person who couldn't find it and instead had to waste half an hour on the tutorial before they could touch anything else. Also, you have to finish the first leg of the campaign before you can play multiplayer. Since the multiplayer is all I usually play for, this was frustrating, and it was a whole hour spent on this game before I realized the real deal breaker for me- the changes in multiplayer game modes.Regarding the ever present 2-headed giant complaint, I started playing magic online for the co-op. My boyfriend and I love the franchise because it gives us something we can do together even when we're far apart. Since the begining we loved the 2v2 mode that magic provided. While this evolution of the game still allows multiplayer, it doesn't allow for teamplay. For that reason we're probably going to stop playing 2015 within the week and go back to playing 2014. And we certainly won't be pre-ordering the next iteration if there is one, for fear that they'll continue removing features we liked.Also, in addition to removing 2HG, there is no longer local co-op. Regarding the UI and AI, they both are still pretty crappy and annoying. Broken cards, cheating AI, wasted space, and clunky, laggy menus are still the norm. Also, there are only 2 resolution options, which are the same in both full screen and windowed mode. Which means if you have a large screen you're really going to want to be playing windowed, and you don't get to choose how your window is sized. Also, they still have that derpy bug where the game tries to start full screen, and if your resolution isn't one of their favorites, it just sits there confused and refuses to load. At least we've encountered that one enough to have a work around... The game continues to be technically buggy, and despite hopes that it will be patched, there were never fixes for a number of bugs in 2014, so I'm not terribly hopeful. All in all Wizards of the Coast continues to disappoint, and I'm left wondering why I yet again let them have my money.			"

			NOW YOU HAVE ♥♥♥♥ED UP!!!!		

+ All decks are fully customizable meaning you won't be very likely to meet someone in multiplayer with the same deck.- All decks are fully customizable meaning you have to either PAY (fast) to get cards or PLAY (slow) to get cards.- Getting cards while playing is completly random just like in the IRL version of the game. Forcing you to either play alot or simply buy alot.- The menues are HORRIBLE and SLOW compared to previous versions of the game (Magic 2014)- They have oriented the game alot more like the Pay 2 Win model. - There is NO TWO-HEADED GIANT Multiplayer mode! (SERIOUSLY WTF!?!?!)- The music is not interesting at all.DON'T BUY THIS GAME - NOT WORTH IT. Unless you have a huge wallet and don't care or just have tremendous amount of free time.Seriously wtf where they thinking? Waste of 9,99€. Going back to Magic 2014.			"

												As an avid Magic the Gathering player this game was truly disappointing.The starter decks are truly dire, they're worse than actual starter decks. Reminiscent of something along the lines of a sealed pre-release deck, no play sets, just random single cards put in. Except these starter decks seem to have little to no synergy.The deck building is entire garbage. ""Oh here, you have access to RtR, Innistrad, Theros, all these sets.... Except not actually because we only put 1/3rd of the set in the game. We totally ignored all the dual creatures from RtR, and if you think you're using a heroic deck from theros then think again because we ain't having none of that."" They advertise all these sets but only every use 30-40 cards from each set and a lot of the time ignore the key mechanic from the set. Also, after three iterations of this game there's still no way to cancel and cast if you pick up a card. As soon as you lift it from your hand thats it, you have to play it. The Mana usage in the game is also terrible. Sure theres an option that lets you toggle what mana the cast will use. But its off by default! Which is awful for new players.I feel very bad for people who are new to MtG and are experiencing this, because it's just awful.			"

												Now that i have gotten past the first boss the game has started to turn around for me. I still do not reccommend this game to other ppl who play with friends. They removed two headed giant which always has been a big seller on these magics games for me. Why? Cause my friend and I have lways played magic together. We have litterally spent hours just getting recipes down in the previous game that pair well with one another. This game also in my opinion is not very oriented towards new players. Although other versions were not either. They still had base recipes that new players could run with and learn. This one Just pushes you to make your own. Which for an expierenced magic player isn't to bad. My original review of this game was horrible because i was agrivated about alot of the things about this game. Now that i have had time to calm down and think the game  through i decided it was time to type a more thought out and rational review. All in all i give this game a 6/10. The game lost points for me for removing a multiplayer mode and by not having pre created decks on top of the the player created ones.			"

												Ever since MDOTP 2013, this game series has deteriorated. In the 2015 game, it has no new feautures, seems very dumbed down, gives slim to none explanation of the plot, and the deck creating system looks as if it was thrown together last minute. You are given a choice of 2 colors in your deck. The game randomly gives you a deck, holding no synergetic qualaties, and having only monocolored cards. The booster packs you earn from defeating opponents and encounters in the campaign contain only 3 cards, and usually don't contain the colors in your deck. They, like the deck you are given, seem htrown together. Even though this game only cost me 10 dollars, which in of itself shows that the game doesn't seem to be that much of a breakthrough, I feel it was a complete waste of money. 2/10			"

												TL;DR: If you like pay-2-win, this game is perfect for you. Otherwise I recommend you stay clear.Previous versions of Duels of the Planeswalkers (which I generally enjoyed quite a bit) had a multitude of different decks, a few already unlocked, and many unlockable by defeating the AI. You also could upgrade them by winning games. Enter Magic 2015, which was advertised to have full deck building. Boy was I excited! And boy was it a let down.For starters you get to blindly choose a starting deck based on a two-color-combination. And let me get this straight: the deck is terrible. Also: it's the only deck. Everything else you have to piece together from booster pack unlocks, which contain a hand full of cards.Now this wouldn't be too bad if the AI wouldn't be playing decks that were approxinately 100 times better than yours. Oh yes, you unlock new cards whenver you win (not only in your colors but in all five) to upgrade your deck, but playing feels like smashing your face into a brick wall that is the much better deck of the AI.But not all hope is lost! You can just buy new cards for 1,79€ a pack! Isn't that great?! Yeah no, not for me. The intent is crystal clear: Give the player a crappy deck, give the AI good decks and create the incentive to spend real money to stand a chance.All in all the game is already uninstalled and left an extremely sour taste in my mouth. Until now, Duels of the Planeswalkers was an instant-buy for me, including additional decks and all. But I don't think I will be falling for this money-grabbing-scheme again.			"

												So far I have played through the tutorial and finished that set.  The interface is different than 2014, though I wouldn't say any better or worse.  I am just more used to Duels2014 at this point.  However, the biggest drawback of this game, is that there is no setting to adjust the graphic settings.  I don't have the best PC laptop. I am a student.  But the lag I am experiencing is absurd.During a duel, there is smoke swirling around the table. All of the menus are scroll sections instead of just a menu.  I am perfectly content to click the option I want, and not have to scroll through to find what I want.  This is another thing that bogs down my computer, and almost overheated it twice.  (Nothing but steam and the game running, fyi.)Until I have the ability to reduce the graphics, I will not be reccommending the game.			"

												I put 4 hours into the game before i decided to write a review. For the most part: it is just as disappointing as all the other DotP games. While it is nice that we finally have the ability to build decks however we want, the game has a fatal flaw: the NPC decks are WAY stronger than anything you can build as the NPC has a MUCH larger card pool to pull from. The first world is relatively timid, but as soon as you get to Theros you will want a refund. The very first deck you face in Theros is amazing (Hydra deck), and as soon as it wipes the floor with you, you will want to go into deck builder and build the deck....only to find you can't, as the Hydras you want aren't available for use, nor are the sorceries that let you double your lands to your hearts content. once you finally have a deck worthy of speed wiping the hydra deck, you face off against the Journey into Nyx Minotaur themed intro deck, only to find you will need to spend another hour and a half building a new deck to compete against it because, like the Hydra deck, you can't use the cards that are in the minotaur deck. I paid $35 to unlock every card upon release, and still can't compete with the NPC decks as they use much stronger cards than what's available for PC use. I do NOT recommend this game, and it pains me to say it as i play every format of Magic that exists. Wish i could get my money back for this one.			"

												A bit dissapointed with the amount of cards available from each set. Seems like some mechanics where just removed. As people have said in other reviews: A Hearthstone model (Play to get ingame currency -> Buy Boosters) + ALL of the cards from each set would have made this a must buy game. I just hope they add rest of the sets, not as a DLC but just as a patch to say ""sorry"" for a very dissapointing game. If you have friends you want to start playing Magic with, DON'T buy this game. It will put them off because of the incredibly bad starter decks they force you to play with + the very limited abillity to make any decent decks.			"

												My name is Wizards Of The Coast and I had a great idea. What if I make a PC trading card game with no decks? Huh? Incredible! You'll pick one deck in the beginning of the game and now you're stuck with it! But don't worry, you can unlock some cards for your garbage deck and make it a little better after you spend 2 hours trying to beat the first boss. Genius, huh? I know. In previous games you had several decks, but who cares about that huh? Let's narrow it down to just one. Much more fun! And what about the god awful menu that was clearly designed for tablets? Perfect. People are going to love it! It's not like the previous games were much better than this garbage, right? It's not like they'll want their money back, right? "

												If you want a FUN Magic the Gathering game, check out Magic 2014 or Magic 2013. This game practically makes you pour money into it to make your deck just powerful enough to kill each boss.Edit: After having played the game in its entirety and unlocked every single card via the game, you would still need to pay $1.99 PER Premium Booster pack to get some of the, arguably, best cards available in the game. For that reason, I'm appalled that a Pay-to-Win game of Magic the Gathering was released.			"

												Well after playing 2 hours, i have to admit that it was a total waste of money. I bought the complete bundle. The decks are just crap and the available cards to build your own decks are not really good and there is no card synergy at all. There are good things. All the gaphics and overlay are well done. The waiting time for the computer to play dropped compared to Magic 2014. However, I recommend not buying the 2015 version. Of course you can't compare it to the card game, but for experienced plainswalkers this game is useless.			"

												I have over 75 hours played in M14, most of them in 2HG with a friend. Why they would even consider removing this mode is beyond me. I'll probably just stick with M14, because 2015 pretty much screwed us over. It's turning into a pay-to-win format, where you have to buy a booster pack to even get a decently powered deck. You only get one deck at the beginning of the game, and it's not even that good. Also, the game doesn't match my laptop's screen resolution. It works on my desktop, but that's it.If you were planning on buying this, don't bother. Unless they do some serious revamping of the game, it's not worth buying. Stick to 2014 if you have it.			"

Posted: July 16, 2014
												The things I've seen are:Removal of popular game modes over the years. The biggest seems to be the lack of 2HG.Microtransactions. This series has always had them but there is a lot more ""day 1 DLC"" than in the past. Personally I wish that Wizards would just realize that the UI for MTGO is unacceptable and update it to look as good as Duels but with a bit more functionality.Only 1 starter deck is unlocked. The rest of the cards have to be unlocked via exploration boosters, premium booster purchases, and the optional collection purchase (the collection cards can be unlocked via the $5 each, $20 total or grinding out exploration for each collection). That can be a problem if you pick a deck that has weak matchups. After beating the last tutorial mission, you are locked into your 2 color starter deck.It is a yearly release that makes players start over every year. Series like Call of Duty get plenty of flak for being a yearly, iterative release. CCGs can, to some players, feel worse. Players are used to being able to use their collection of older cards for CCGs... maybe in just a different rules format. In Duels, your collection starts over every year. Some people like the change in deck metagame. Some people are annoyed at the amount of DLC that comes out and becomes worthless at the next release.Personally... I get the base game every year. During a Steam seasonal sale I usually buy the expansions or new deck DLCs that come out when they are at least 50% off. I get 20-50 hours of gameplay over the course of the year and spend <$30. So I do not feel cheated. I do think that Wizards is squandering a chance to expand their game to being far larger in the digital world by releasing Duels and leaving MTGO in the state that it is in. And that is even worse with them suing CZE over Hex which may not have ever existed if MTGO was even halfway decent. But I find it to be a fair model most years. My biggest complaint usually is the fact that purchases are not cross platform. Why can a small studio like Stoneblade manage to make SolForge cross platform on one account for IOS, Android, and PC and yet Hasbro cannot hire someone to let me play with my same collection on my tablet?This year though? $10 for base game. $20 to unlock the base cards. And I think I heard there were 15 premium boosters needed to unlock all premium cards. That means that if you preordered and want the full collection but do not want to grind, you are looking at $48 on day 1. About 10-20 higher than previous years. Between that and the loss of game modes I can understand some of the frustration.﻿My recommendation is wait and see. I feel that the $10 is fair for the game (even though I wish we could unlock the other starter decks like we could in the past). More freedom in deck construction is always nice. But the extra day 1 purchases and loss of popular game modes will annoy many players. So wait and see how this game handles future content. Will there be more premium cards requiring more $2 boosters during the upcoming expansions? Will the new deck lists be unlocked or require either more grinding or more ""collection packs"" in addition to buying the extra deck lists, campaign, etc? Will Wizards add back in some popular features from previous years? If you are a fan of MTG but no longer player paper and hate MTGO the base game is not an awful deal. But this may be the year to give it a few weeks/months before jumping in unless you really want to play with the new cards and deck building.			"

												This review is most if you're a single player type gamer such as myself.I have purchased all Magic games for Steam, and always loved it. I know there have been complaints, but I loved the single player campaign and such - just a nice way to pass time and destress. I have bought all and was planning to buy the game every year - but because of this one, I won't. I refuse to give them my money now. I'll explain why.The core is the same. It's not a AAA game, the animation is so-so, but it's Magic, we all know it and love it. The cards and decks are great. However - NOT when you have to GRIND for your deck. That's right. Forget the previous games, with this one you have to either buy or grind boosters until you collected enough for a pre-made deck. Insane. It makes the campaign and multiplayer rather boring - because you can't switch decks as easy and change tactics were as appropriate.It's an insanely greedy, unneccesary step, only to bring in more money because the grinding is painstakingly boring. There are more complaints such as mediocre storyline, The menu is horrific. Looks pretty, but the usability is horrible, there's just no oversight.The worst complaint I have is for the expansion where you play as Garruk. Pretty cool - only for the fact if you follow the single player story line you can NOT change decks. You play only with Garruk's deck. And guess what - they made your opponents in a way they COUNTER your deck.And you cannot change! This is a classic example of extremely poor gamedesign. It has become a game of luck. You have to get JUST the right cards and hope your opponent (AI) doesn't get theirs in order to win. F*ck being clever or involving strategy, them not allowing you to pick your own deck was the worst they could do. In the expansion it's all luck and no skill - which is extremely poor as game mechanic, but even more so in a strategic game as Magic the Gathering.It's sad. I really had fun for a while with the other parts. Them going for the option to cash in doesn't sit right with me as life long fan. I don't want ingame transactions to make it more fun with Magic. I paid for the game - let me enjoy all of it damn it.Just play the old games - and ignore this one and future games. I wish I had listened.			"

Not only that but they're trying to charge more for card packs on the PC than they are on ipad! What are you doing, Wizard?!In addition for some inexplicable reason they have limited the number of the same uncommon you can have to three and the number of the same rares and legendaries down to one. This has a huge negative impact on the way you make decks... Oh, and also, the actual selection of cards you get for this game is utter rubbish. Worse than last year, even though you can build your own decks this time.Not only that but the interface is appalling. Just... appaling.

												This is disappointing, you can only choose one starter deck to play and if you are not happy with it, I can't find an option to select another during the tutorial stage. I choose a Red/Black deck and can't seem to deselect it now. The menus are clunky and feel rushed. Perhaps I'm being a bit too negative but from my first initial impression its a thumbs down.			"

												The concept of having more open decking building is a fatastic idea and was something missing in all previous version.However they have asked a heavy price...-The game and unlocking of cards and decks it done at a much more tedious pace. Instead of unlocking each deck and playing them to unlock additional cards you must earn boosters and random chances. They've brought a profit mindset forward to mimic the the physical version and the likes of Hearthstone.-And mentioning Hearthstone brings up the next issue. I assumed they would have two-headed giant like in all previous versions, but they have removed two-headed giant and made no attempt to make new playing formats. For anyone familiar with Magic this is a travesty given the number of game formats they developed over the years, from three headed, Emperor, and even their mis-balanced Arch-enemy from Magic:Planeswalker a few versions back. Co-op was and is possible in Magic, but they have ignored it. My only guess is the programing got too hard and they wanted to just do simple AI programing.-The small issue is the extensive graphics they've addded to the game. The board shifts and moves each time you go into your attack phase. They've added fluff that wastes time and burns polygons.So I can't recommend this game since I know I might play the singleplayer campaign once through and then shelf it for the lack of dynamic multiplayer. I supposes many feel that the only good multiplayer is PvP, but that's not what's going to keep me playing this game.			"

												This series of MTG is a huge disappointment. Having played the last 3 installments I can say without a doubt this is a cash cow attempt. I'll get into that again in a second however. The first 2 installments of MTG I think they got down rather well, while the first didn't have deck customization fully, all 3 did allow for more of ""play how you want"" playstyle, with decks that closely related to many different styles, whether you liked full color decks, mixed, defensive, offensive, etc. There was a deck for you. You also got to play ALL of the decks in the game, you got 5-6 starter decks, then you could unlock each boss deck once you beat them. Allowing for many decks to be played. Ontop of that, all the past MTG installments allowed you to unlock up too 50 new cards for every deck, letting you either use them all if you like large decks, or pick and choose what cards you want. In the 2014 series you had the additional option of ""foil decks"" which let you create 5-6 additional decks off of random foil packs, while unlocking additional foil packs to build up on. It was a good amount of customization. While you couldn't build a deck totally from scratch, having over 50+ extra cards ontop of the already 30+ cards at the start for every deck allowed for you to customize any deck how you want. --------------------------So what about 2015? I was astounded at the stunt they pulled. Not only do you only get the 1 deck of your choosing, but you do not unlock extra cards specific for that deck. Instead for every win you get a foil pack with random cards in it. Much like the foil deck play in 2014, except instead of getting 5-6 decks, you get 1. You do not ever get to use the other starter decks unless you buy them. The foil play style for your 1 deck is also limited. If you are a casual player, and don't want to put money into additional ""lottery foil"" luck to try to get the 1 card you want, you'll quickly find your deck lacking and unable to be competitive in the campaign, or multi-player. While the past installments of MTG were fair, in that even casuals could unlock good cards, specific for every deck in the game, this is not the case by any means in 2015. --------------------------------------------------------If that isn't bad enough, they also took out the most played game, which is 2 headed giant. They also took out many other game modes from past MTG. This truly is a cash cow in the sense they took out all game modes from past MTG, force players to buy foil packs through steam to ""maybe"" get a card they can use in their 1 deck.--------------------------------------------------However, it gets even worse... The way the game plays is still an obvious cop out with built in mechanics. The game is scripted not to read what card the AI has in its hands, but rather, what cards are left in the deck. To many players this wont be obvious until they play several games, however if the AI has 6 cards in its hand, those are all in essence, wild cards. The Game waits to see what you do, then see's what cards are potentially in the deck it has, and then decides what card to play from the deck as a whole. This becomes very obvious at medium/high difficulty setting, when the AI will start pulling the perfect counter card 10 times in a row, despite having no cards in its hand, and it will do this consistantly every battle. -IF- it truly was random, the mathematical impossobility of this is enough to say, there is some serious bs built in ""cheating"" the AI is doing. Basically if it doesn't want you to win, you won't. This is also done on purpose as a time sink. To make you play through longer as you lose more often, and attempt to make you buy more foil packs for better cards. ------------------------------------All in all, avoid this game like a plague.

												After seeing a lot of terrible information being passed around in the knee-jerked negative reviews I felt compelled to write this. Although this game is flawed and not as good as previous editions I think it's only fair to actually discuss the issues factually rather than react emotionally to some of the negatives.I have played every single Duels of the Planeswalkers since they first came out and (so far) I have actually enjoyed this one the most. However my aim with this review is to try and offer a different outlook on certain contentious aspects of the game because I don't beleive it is anywhere near as bad as people are making it out.Before I mention some of the issues in the game I'd like to give one piece of advice, when you start the game you are asked what colour you want your first deck to be and then once you answer this you are given another choice that will determine the content of your deck. For example I picked black and my second option was red and I got a rakdos deck based onsacrifice, zombies and some low curve red stuff. -THIS CHOICE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT-You will be stuck using this deck for a while until you can unlock enough cards to make a deck of different colours or themes. This was a pretty terrible design choice as it won't let you change and it doesn't really stress the implications of your choice either. The game really suffers from a lack of information about how the deck building and card unlocking works and i would strongly recommend you read into how it works a bit before starting. (ALSO, you can skip the tutorial there's an option near the bottom left of the screen I saw some people complaining that you could not skip)Most people's biggest complaint about the previous versions of Dotp is that you have always lacked the ability to fully create your own decks; now you can. You can create a deck with any of the cards in your collection which can be obtained through playing the single player campaign. There are 6 sets based around different planes in the Magic multiverse and the cards that you unlock for them are also loosely based on the corresponding sets, apart from one. There is a ""Premium"" set of cards that can -only- be obtained through buying virtual booster packs and this is where the main controversy lies. I'd like to supply some further information about these sets. Each set has a number of cards within them that you can unlock here are the totals for each plane or set.(Also note that you can obviously get multiples of the same card I have just looked purely at the individual cards)49 - Zendikar49 - Shandalar49 - Theros49 - Innistrad59 - Ravnica[43 - Premium cards]So that's 255 cards available without spending a single penny on micro transactions. 255 out of a total 298 cards in the game which is ~85%. Now you also have the option to fully unlock these sets through micro transactions but that is -entirely optional- as you can unlock them within the game. You do so by playing the story battles that put you against certain themed enemies in different scenarios and a win will award you with one booster pack that contains cards from the corresponding set. In addition to this there is an option named ""explore [set name]"" that will put you in a random battle against an opponent themed to match the set. (Think like playing an rpg with random encounters or Pokémon walking through grass). Winning these battles  will also award you with a booster pack and this seems to be the method you would use to ""farm"" the cards from set you can repeat this process -infinitely-. This does appear to be a bit on the grindy side but it is also giving you a reason to play the single player against the AI. Something else that was pointed out to me was how the AI decks get to use lots of cards that you don't have access to. This was definitely the case in the previous games but it's more of a glaring issue in dotp15 due to availability of a deck builder. It's pretty frustrating that some really interesting cards were coded into the game but for whatever reason you don't get to use them (you can't even ""pay to win"" for them).To address the premium set, I have not bought any of it and nor do I plan to but I took a quick look into the pricing and the way it works and found the following. The premium boosters are semi-randomized, you will never open a card that you already have the maximum playable number of. So there is a limit to how many premium boosters you would need to buy and that limit is 14, which is £16 in total. I have had a look through the cards included in the set and on the whole it doesn't appear to be any more or less powerful than the other cards in the game. However, it clearly gives you an advantage having access to these cards as you have more choice in your deck building and sometimes that can be an upper hand against an opponent online. To speak less objectively here I don't think duels has ever been a competitive game, it's great fun multiplayer with friends but there's no real ladder or reason to take it too seriously especially in 2014 where the online game was full of hackers. This brings us to another issue though, Dotp15 does not have any additional multiplayer modes like two headed giant, archenemy or planechase. It only has free for all supporting up to 4 players. This sucks hopefully they will release some other options later.The final aspect of the game I have seen people complaining about is the interface. The interfaces of the older dotp were just absolutely awful. 13 improved it a bit but not much,14 did a better job but still fell short of fixing the unclean feel that it had and people complained about it. In m15 they have obviously tried to take these complaints into accountand it looks great. It's sharp it's nicely animated it's clean and it's clear.However it functions... weirdly I don't know how else to put it. The menu's still feel clunky and the animations, although they look nice, feel like they might be lagging the navigation. It's an interface clearly designed to feel sexy on a touch screen and maybe it does but on the pc with mouse and keyboard it's a bit wonky -but it is not game breaking-. As for the actual gameplay and in-match interface I feel like it's smoother, more responsive and clear. The mechanics of the game work perfectly and the AI is pretty decent on the whole, I've seen it do a few weird things (cursed itself and shocked its own creature in response to my shock) but other than that no problems in this department.TL;DRTo summarize, I think that for £6.99 (or equivalent) you really can't complain too much at all. It's a game with flaws that vary to differing degrees but for its price I think it's great.If you want to mess around with some cool -casual- magic deck building in a limited environment against the AI or with friends I would strongly recommend to give it a shot. Unlocking the card sets is rewarding and fun and can be a great time sink. However, if you are looking (for some reason) to take this game super seriously and play at a high level in multiplayer I would not recommend it, you'd be better just playing something else like ""real"" magic or magic the gathering online (good luck).

												My first DOTP was 2014, and I enjoyed it a lot. In fact, I played it a few days before the release of 2015 to get used to MTG again. It had its flaws, including but not limited to: a mediocre campaign, unbalanced decks and somewhat poor AI. But it was still really fun, with 2HG and most of the decks having strong themes that were flavorful and unique. A variety of cards were included, all sorts of color combinations, and 2013 even had a rainbow deck that was very strong apparently. And then there's DOTP 2015. God. I literally didn't get to play it, it crashes on startup constistently. After browsing reviews and various websties, there seems to be a consensus that the game has poor optimization, the UI is poor, and the deckbuilding is practically imprisoned in the Helvault that Avacyn for whatever reason doesn't want you getting into because the starter decks are terrible and the AI decks ACTUALLY HAVE SYNERGY. And the lack of other modes doesn't help, and even if they existed you would have to complete the campaign to get to it. If you want to buy it, don't. Instead walk across a highway on rush hour while pouring tar on your feet and walking a Chihuahua with rabies. It's the same experience, albeit cheaper.			"

												Pros & consPros & Preferences- In single player random deck they can use one of your decks ( obviously roflstomping whatever             useless deck you are running with one of the better ones from your collection)- It's magic like what you would expect- Ui in game is clean- Expansion of the draft mode- Free for all focused- Relatively simple- The little sniplets of story are decent (though not sure where the voice acting went for some of them)- Campaign is no longer as preset as before e.g (ai can also suffer from mana flooding and needs to mulligan)- Teachs basics decently well- Cards are gained slightly faster- You can make your own decks- Unlockable upto 826/976 at leastCons- It's a Stainless release ie. there are some funky or wonky interactions (check forums)- No Two-headed giant- No more puzzles- Doesn't explain some rules (casting spells during declaring blockers ends the blocking step)- Modders are going to take longer than usual to do anything- Lack of card variety eg. lack of multi-colored spells- No special Theros cards (in case your wondering)- Lack of synergy between some showcase cards- Grindfest as always- Punishing rng and losses ( the usual)- Navigation is a pain in the menu (taking time to load in and out)- Adjustment of land is awful (auto-land option can screw you over) & (have you tried changing the number of land in a deck                -                                                                                                                                                               well it'll take a minute)- Feels like an Average port ( lack of typing or numpad use)- Makes it look as if running anything other than a 60 card deck is wrong and unviable- Some starter decks are awful (Red&Black is fine in my opinion though)- The campaign opponents have more interesting decks and cards than yours- Balanced mainly for a PvP focus- No new modes- Decks take a while to form (due to RNG Gods hating on you ""not even going to try give you what you want"")- Cards are limited to 4 Commons, 3 Uncommons, 2 Rares, 1 Mythic- Still no planeswalkers ( i trust in the modders to fix this )- requires $24 to unlock all the cards in the game (gated ""doubling season"" away for me and my bad swarm deck)- Some decks are near impossible to run (if you remember from 2014 the dracomancers welcome to hell) (try to win through pure milling and control, if you can well your lucky draws because the game has awful shuffling skills)- Apparent gating of ~300 extra possible cards within the campaign- Running mono requires a decent amount of unlocking- Still capped to 100 cards per deck- Does not support anymore than 3 color decks (lack of evolving winds but can be supplemented     through purchases of premium booster packs)- Non-Aggro decks are midly inefficient- Cards such as doubling season, The paragons, phantasm dragon, Aura Gnarlid, Garruks packleader, hall of triumph, warstorm surge which can be core to a deck type are behind a paywallP.s turn off that useless Auto-land, Auto-damage assign and the smart targetingYou also can't change to windowed mode in setting while in game, just in case your wondering where the option is because you enter the settings screen too often to notice that while in the menu there is an extra page 2if you reset the deck to default decks the game will replace some cards with others which are blatantly better (creating a new deck under an archaetype)- Traditional Burn decks are average if you could run less than 60 cardsRecommendation go buy Magic 2013 for vanilla game or 2014 modded they are worth it a bit more.if you already own them well you get another booster or two in this game and you'll get a booster for next years version.It is still a relatively enjoyable gameYou get a real card which is decent maybe worth 2$			"

												BUY MAGIC 2014 INSTEAD, IT'S BETTER IN ALMOST EVERYTHINGAlright, this game has REMOVED 2-headed giant, my favourite mode for the computer games.The starter decks are horrible, you don't unlock good decks at all like in 2014, you unlock individual cards, getting locked in your starter colors, it's really hard to get boosters to get a good collection (you get sets of good cards just by playing the deck in 2014, here you have to get lucky on the limited boosters, or spend money), you can't get good complete decks like you do in 2014, it's terrible.You can pay to unlock complete sets of cards, the fun part of the computer game was that it was free to unlock cards, unlike the real paper game, you could playtest some stuff for free and have fun, now you get locked in one terrible deck for the entire sinlge-player and even multiplayer if you don't spend money.Also, there are cards EXCLUSIVE to ""premium"" boosters, some of them really powerful, like Stoneforge Mystic and some others, this means people who paid 6 dollars for a booster can get cards you can't at all just by playing, this is terrible, BUY 2014 if you want to play good computer magic.AND THE MENUS SUCK AND ARE SLOW, HORRIBLE.

												I really wish there was an in-between vote for recommendations, because I would otherwise set this game as a ""maybe."" As someone who has played all of the DotP games, this is probably the clunkiest release since the first game. I mean, if you can get past that, it's still pretty fun, but I wouldn't go out of the way for it. If you're looking for a decent MtG game to while away your time, I would personally recommend DotP 2013 or 2014 over this one. If you enjoyed those, you might like this one, but I'd advise you to wait for a sale.For one, the menus are AWFUL. They're a pain to navigate, somewhat unresponsive, and the design direction just so unnecessary. Thankfully, the main dueling UI is very nice and clean, though it also suffers from a lack of responsiveness. The AI is still horribly flawed and I've noticed that it still likes to ""cheat"" in cards that it shouldn't have in it's hand, namely spells that had already been cast the maximum times for the deck in use and had never been retrieved from the graveyard. The game also looks to favor customers who pay for card unlocks. All cards can still be unlocked, but it'll take a metric ton of time and grinding to do so.If you can get past the serious flaws of the game, it's still quite enjoyable and it's still a fun and cheap way to enjoy Magic without dropping a fortune on the physical cards or MtGO.

												I bought the game on the promise of free deck building.  While it is there, the card pool is extremely limited.  So limited that you'll end up building the standard archetypes anyway because there's just not that much flexibility for synergy available.  Even if you buy the ""Complete Bundle"", or the card collections, you will be missing a portion of the available cards.  Those cards - the more powerful cards in the game, of course - are locked away behind Premium Packs, which you have to pay extra for and are, of course, random.  Beyond this, there are several cards with art and rules in the game that are locked away from the player to ever get, even with premium packs.  They removed several game types from previous games as well.Don't buy this game, especially if you already have one of the old versions.  These Duels of the Planeswalker games will never be as complete as the players want them to be, because WOTC wants you to play Magic Online, and pay full price for fake cards.			"

												This is my second DOTP game, along with M14. Can't say I'm a fan of this one. It seems like there was no effort put into the storyline. One of the reasons I wanted to play this was for some extra Magic lore and background. Instead it just feels like a bunch of random duels, and planeswalkers randomly thrown in to ""test your ability"". I bought the expanded edition so after beating Innistrad I had access to a whole bunch of cards and could make my own decks, which is supposed to be a advantage of this game over previous versions. But really with the limited amount of cards there's only so many decks you could make anyway. And I'm not getting booster packs for winning, so I guess I'll have to spend more money to get all the cards. At this point I definitely don't feel like I got my $35 worth. I read a couple of other reviews that said you're better off investing the time and money into Hearthstone if you're looking for a card game and I have to agree. Very let down by this game...			"

												The only positive thing I can say about this game is that you are free to build your own deck.  Otherwise the game is a pretty huge step backwards.The User interface was made much flashier, apparently for sole purpose of it being flashier.  The end result was an awkward, generally annoying and horribly unresponsive interface.  The gameplay itself is pretty much the same as the other entries in the series, just with a worse UI and the complete absence of co-op modes like 2-headed giant.Finally, while Pay to Win has always been a big part of Magic: The Gathering games, one of the attractions of the duels of the planeswalker games was that they kept that to a minimum.  That is no longer the case, this game goes straight to for your wallet and doesn't look back.			"

												I played and quite enjoyed the 2014 edition of this game; it was a fun way to play MtG on my own since no one around me played. I picked up the 2015 edition and the expansion a few weeks ago from a Humble Bundle -- it was the main reason I picked up the bundle actually.I kind of regret buying this game though. Whatever Wizards of the Coast changed between this year and last, it's made the game really frustrating to play. I am by no means a great Magic player, but neither am I totally terrible. So, y'know, I expect to lose a match or two as I figure out the AI's deck and playstyle, and adjust my own to suit. But something seems incredibly wrong to me when I go up against an AI opponent and lose eight or ten times in a row. Part of the problem, to me, is the way the game gives you more cards to build decks with -- you complete (or skip, I guess) the tutorial and choose a starter deck (there are, I think, 10 starter decks? One of each mono-color and then various permutations of color-combo decks). You play through the first match and when you (finally) win, you get a booster pack. For the first few matches, you can't even make use of these cards because deck-building isn't unlocked until you beat the first ""plane"". So you slog through the first plane, playing each match over and over again hoping you get lucky this time. If you played the 2014 edition of the game, you'll get to the last match, the Planeswalker/boss match, and finally win and get all excited because you're expecting to unlock a whole new deck to play with. Nope. No new preconstructed decks unlock. Only booster packs. And if you get all the cards in one of the starter decks through booster packs, then you'll see them pop up in your deckbuilder as starting points for new decks. But new cards only come from booster packs.And that's the biggest problem. Your collection doesn't grow fast enough to enable you to tweak your deck effectively to combat the sometimes radically different playstyles between two matches.The other problem is that the AI's decks all seem to be some degree of overpowered; they've all got cards and combos that seem miles above whatever the player has available, so too many matches comes down to dumb luck -- each match is somewhat scripted; the AI is drawing the same cards in the same order every time (if I'm not mistaken), so you just have to hope that your randomly shuffled deck gets you the cards you need to throw wrenches into the AI's plan and keep them from playing those cards and combos. 60% of the time, you don't get lucky.Of course, there's also the online component. Could be fun if it didn't require slogging through the tedious and frustrating grind of the single-player campaign -- or, I suppose, pay for the collection unlock -- in order to unlock better cards so you can stand a chance. The Quick Match matchmaker doesn't seem to take skill and deck power into account when it matches opponents up.All in all, a terrible entry into the franchise. The UI is ugly and hard to navigate, but that's overshadowed by the massive hits to playability. Buy one of the older editions if you're after a fun single-player MtG experience. Be ready to buy the game and the card collection unlock DLC if you're after the active online experience (though the older editions might have that too, since this sucks so hard).			"

												I want to start by saying.  I love Magic the Gathering.  I have never played Magic The Gathering Online.  I play the real card game and I've played all of the steam released Magic games.  Also this is pretty much a single player review, I don't do multiplayer personally. That being said. TLDR Summary: Brutal AI, Not instant acess for content you paid for, Clunky menu navagation, micro-transactions, unable to get certian content without micro-transactions, Developers don't care arn't listening, No 2-headed giant, and the computer has acess to cards you do not.  Buy the older games.Do NOT buy this game.  It thrives on micro-transactions and micro-payments.  The other games did thrive on DLC, but, there was a limit and if you waited long enough it would come along reasonably priced.  There is nothing reasonable about this game.The menu interfaces are loud and have this weird fog outlaying it, which takes up alot of processing power to show (The game being what it is), and its confusing, there is alot of rooting around to find what your getting to, like if your in the middle of a campeign and go fiddle with your deck, you have to manually go back through the campeign.  It's a hot mess to navagate.  The other magic games had this but it was smooth and streamlined to a degree, you didn't get lost doing it.When you do buy DLC content or pre-order your not allowed to access any of it, the game forces you to do the tutorial, which is fair enough for new players, then it forces you to do the first area of the campeign before it gives you the stuff you bought already.  Which is time consuming and pointless.Speaking of the above when you come out of the tutorial you are given acess to ten Ravnica decks, One deck for each of the two color combinations, you are not allowed to look inside them and have to take them on face value depending which two colors you like to play with the most, from my understanding each deck is crap and isn't properly balanced you need to keep restarting duels to get a mirical hand and pray for lucky draws.The AI is downright unforgiving aswell, and seems to cheat, not as much as in games of this franchise previously, but the game seems to be able to draw just what it needs when it needs to screw you over.  It can put you in your place in a manner I come to believe the game is resenting me playing it.  Even on the lowest difficulty the game seems unforgiving.  I always start low and then increase the more and longer I play to ramp up the challenge.  I dread to think of ramping up the difficulty.  (I kinda invision it with you starting a duel and it telling you that you lost by default.)Now lets talk about the big one, the fact you can build your own deck from scratch.  2014 had a minor version of this, which wasn't well implimented.  In this one... its even worse.  They do give you a good chunk of cards to play with, and it goes pretty far back in the magic timeline (Still no Mirrodian, or Time Sprial, or further back), but it gives you compleate and utter crap to work with.  I have to keep tweaking and tweaking and tweaking to get my deck juuuust right and I still get pummeled by the computer.  While I am not a world reknowned magic champion, I do think I can throw together a pretty mean deck in real life, and I honestly believe the game gives you crap to work with, even if you do buy all the cards.  In the previous games the decks they offered were fun, and intresting and designed by professionals that you could tweak to make it feel like your own.  When playing those I kinda wanted something like this, but with this poor implimentation I honestly yearn for the good old days.Another thing about Deck Building, the game determines if your deck is 'valid' or not.  If your deck is not valid you cannot use it, nor can you give it to a computer to use.  So your deck needs to be just perfect or the computer tells you to fix it.  I tried to make a deck spesficly to do pratice duels with, the computer wouldn't let me use the deck I made because it wasn't valid, and I had to go in and out twenty or so times before I had something it would let the computer equip, and then it cheated so bad it wasn't even a test, nor fun.Also If you do buy the DLC the game still snags you with microtransactions.  Or if you want to grind yourself silly and save a few bucks (More power to you.) you still have to pay for premium boosters.  Now you may be asking what are premium boosters.  Premium boosters are boosters that cost $1.99 in game and give you ten cards and the only known way to acess them is to have preordered (You get one free, also you get a second premium pack free if you have magic 2014), you get ten cards, like a regular booster pack, six commons, three uncommon and one rare, and Premium has it's own set, so you cannot grind for premium cards, you have to throw real money at the game.  Some say Magic is an expensive hobby, this is true, but I play a computer game to simulate it, if I am going to waste this kinda money I will go to the store and buy a real pack.Also the AI has acess to cards you do not.  I see this as a grossly unfair advantage, the games are there, programed into the game, and we, the players cannot acess them?  I always said in the older games it would be fun to mess with the AI's set decks.  The AI has had some pretty fun decks in the past games, this one seems more unfair with the brutal AI, but they seem to be able to acess cards you can't.  I view this as highly unfair, and unpleasent.  The cards are already programed in, we should have access to them even more so when the entire game is rigged around building your own deck!Although if you ARE going to buy this game and you are a hardcore player of magic.  I suggest buying the compleate edition, unlocks all the crap and saves on grinding.  It is also cheaper than buying each peice individually through DLC or microtransactions.   Though if you want my opinion, save your money, or buy Magic 2012-2014 and enjoy those.Also from my understanding the developers don't listen, don't care, and don't even visit steam.  So they put out crap they got their money and Im sure they are going to be putting out more crap DLC and more crap micro-transactions like premium 2,3,4,79I'll try to bully through it, try to see if it goes anywere or gets better later in the game.  I honestly, seriously doubt it does.  I want to like it.  It offers features I, and many other players have wanted, but it impliments them so poorly, and so expensivly, its just not worth anyones time.Seriously this is one of the worst purcheses on steam I have ever made.

												This one is very different from the previous Duels games.  It is much more difficult and focused much more on selling you product; many of the cards gotten from premium boosters (which reward cards at random) are flat-out better than what you can get playing the game (those boosters can award cards that can't be gotten otherwise).There are serious issues playing the game at the start  You'll be locked into a single deck for the first campaign, with no ability to ""grind"" more cards for your collection (as the ""Explore"" options aren't unlocked and scenario opponents do not give rewards on subsequent matches).  Effectively, if you are not able to win the first couple of campaign scenarios with the deck you picked, you will not be able to proceed, or even collect cards you paid for (which are rewarded at the end of the first campaign).If you really want to play MTG on the computer either play one of the older Duels games or play MTGO.  This game tries to cover both the experience the previous Duels games had and MTGO without being either and is just not as entertaining as any of them.			"

												This game was a huge disappointment. I don't want to just play ffa. I played dotp for their special modes like 2hdg or archenemy in the past which they got rid of. Also, they moved to a pay to win model. All ""premium"" cards you have to pay for. Instead of releasing all of it and then buying expansions as they come out you have to pay up front. Basically the bare minimum game costs around $30. The card choices are terrible either way. You will notice %90 of the people play the same type of deck. Either discard to graveyard for tokens/spiders or red/blue burn counter deck. Rarely will you find anything in between. I'd rather have many predetermined decks than have to only play against 2.			"

												I loved all the previous DotP games, despite UI issues and other nonsense, and I've bought them all on multiple systems. I love Magic in general and usually have a pretty good time with these games!This one is the exception. Every aspect of the game feels designed to drive you into the cash shop to buy their premium packs. Once you're past the tutorial you're stuck with whatever deck you have until you earn enough cards to make a new one, which can be awhile. Gone are the days of trying out a different pre-made deck if the current one you're running gets boring, and you probably won't have much choice in what you play for several hours after starting. All of this can be relieved by paying them more money to get access to new cards.I'd suggest playing one of the previous editions and skipping this one completely, unless you're interested in pumping money into this one for some reason.

												First impressions, very dissapointing. I love Magic, I had played them for 14 years. This time I said to myself ""dude, preorder it, 30 bucks includes 5 complete collections!"" That was one of the worst decission I made in my game-buying life, if not the worst (right after Fable 3). I wanted to start with good cards right after the first match. I didn't start with good cards, I didn't even know which cards had the starting decks. Pros:- More options to customize your decks. - Higher AI level.End of the pros.Cons:- The game content said ""Complete collection"", which doesn't mean complete. It means ""the complete list of the cards we selected"". You get 6-10 colour cards from each collection (6 green cards from Ravnica, 6 from Theros, etc...). If this won't be enough, selected cards are a laugh at your face. And if that won't be enough, you need to fight 6 matches with your starting deck (should I say di ck instead?) to unlock them. And finally, you won't get 4 of each, some will get 4, some 2. Sad, very very sad. Full edition NOT RECCOMENDED UNDER ANY CIRCUNSTANCES, QUARANTINE.- Menus are slow as hell for some reason.- Slowest game of all those DOTP series. - Random crashes. Game crashes slowly too.- Pay 2 win system, so you figure out where this is going. - No fun cards at all. Standard standard gameplay, some good picks for the make up.Do not expect to find:- Coolest cards from other DOTP games. They are by far much much worse.- Fun right after starting. Farming cards from the ridiculous starting decks could be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥(not for me, cause I paid the money for non complete complete collections)A complete waste of money, should I have read the forums first.

												Wanted to like this... to bad it's♥♥♥♥♥♥Cons :First Deck - You can't change the first deck you get or even make edits for quite some time. This presents problems because a few of the stock configs literally suck balls and force you to play until you get a random lucky win.Bad UI - Constantly scrolling through pictures rather then just having all the options presented on one screen. Having the layout like this is supper slow and annoying. Each time you go in or out of menu there's also a slow transition animation. Probably the worst menu UI I've seen in a game in years.Bad Cards - Nothing really too exciting here. There must not have been much playtesting because 85% of people I've played against online use a token deck (and it's pretty much the only choice to use to fight another token deck).R - Goblins/TokensRU - Goblins/TokensW - TokensWR - TokensWG - TokensWRG - TokensBad Campaign - Huge grind to get cards. Lame cutscenes.Super annoying final battle.Overall meh...Micro Transactions - If you want all the cards you have to spend money.Pros :Runs Well - Quite a bit smoother than previous games.Dual lands - Praise jesus... sadly you only get to use the crap common ones. Why? Only WoTC would know.Deck Builder - Cool but only once you've unlocked all the cards (thank god there's hacks).Overall : 3/10			"

												This game is bug ridden. I had unlocked all the cards and beaten the game, please check my achievements its clearly there. Then I play maybe 3 games of multiplayer and it freezes once, no big deal just exit the game and restart.. yet somehow in that exchange all my data ended up wiped. I have a disscussion up regarding what happened and it seems this has happened to many others as well. Waste of money and time. I'm serverely disappointed in WotC as they are offering NO support of any kind for the glitch. If you want a better, free MTG experience check out Untap.in it has all cards available and free deck construction. Lets just step away from my terrible bug experience.. surely the game was good before my data got wiped right..? No? Damn.Deck construction is a joke, limiting the player to 3 uncommons, 2 rares and 1 mythic of an y one card? Why? What is the purpose? You want long games with decks full of unplayable cards? No 2HG which is the sole reason I bought this game, and no reason or indication given at all. Premium cards that can ONLY be gained by spending REAL money. A tedius process for unlocking cards, remember how in previous games you only had to unlock the cards for decks you wanted to use? Well not anymore now you have to unlock ALL of them. Still no Planeswalkers and we are just now getting dual lands.. and by that I only mean guildgates. This game feels stripped and pushed to sell DLC and Micro Transactions. This game is an embarrassment to the WotC name.I give it 0/5 stars.			"

												Stick to 2014, yes this game has deck building but what they added with deckbuilding they took away so much more. No 2 headed GiantNo Planechase, Mastermind, whatever special rules modeNo Challenges (i actually really miss those)That and frankly quite lazy campaign mode make for a barely worth it game. which i would wait for a sale to purchase if it wasn't for the following...DIDN'T WORK on my computer originally, had to manually edit config files to get it to a workable point.Obvious Mobile port, used to be PC players had to worry about getting Console ports now it seems we have to worry about getting ports of Mobile games with all their touch screen interface stereotypes intact and quite annoying to navigate with a mouse.But worst of all it has Microtransactions, Thats right microtransactions in a premium games, sure quite a few games nowadays have microtransactions for speed ups, unlock everything keys. this one has premium booster packs which contain cards only in that booster pack and thus completely unattainable, randomized booster packs at that, which retail in game at £1.49.So good luck sinking money into this game for those booster pack cards or do as i'm sure numerous will do and hack unlock those cards. i'm sure there are ways and someone is no doubt doing it right now.Wizards or should i say Hasbro, wizards money centric overlord, decided to market Duels of the Planeswalkers as their entry product into magic, something for those unwilling to put down money for physical and in this case they made an apt product it does indeed introduce you to magic with the slight problem that they expect new players to deck build, having remembered my early days of playing magic, i would just modify a store bought deck it was a while before i started making my own decks but game throws the new players right in at the deep end.TL:DR Edition.If your a new player don't buy this game, buy last years, it'll teach you more your learn faster and then once you know the stuff... go play the real game keep avoiding this one.if your already a magic player, still avoid this game for whilst magic dotp used to be a ""level playing field"" its not pay to win thanks to ""premium boosters""Don't believe me check the forums			"

												As of 17/5/2016.I've really given this game a try. It's pretty bad. For starters, the in cards are hard to get, you only stick to one archetype deck after the turorial and use it to grind for more booster packs to make more decks through campaign. The game is punishing as the AI's have good synergy decks while you are trying to make do with little you have.The in game shops are offline, and there are no more new content. The multiplayer probably dead, you cant access it until you complete the first stage of the campaign.Anyways, if you are looking to play a Magic game. Download Magic Duels for free or buy Magic 2014 instead of this.(Magic 2014 allows you to obtain different archetype decks through buying the dlc or completeing the campaign game modes) "

												Stick to 2014, yes this game has deck building but what they added with deckbuilding they took away so much more. No 2 headed GiantNo Planechase, Mastermind, whatever special rules modeNo Challenges (i actually really miss those)That and frankly quite lazy campaign mode make for a barely worth it game. which i would wait for a sale to purchase if it wasn't for the following...DIDN'T WORK on my computer originally, had to manually edit config files to get it to a workable point.Obvious Mobile port, used to be PC players had to worry about getting Console ports now it seems we have to worry about getting ports of Mobile games with all their touch screen interface stereotypes intact and quite annoying to navigate with a mouse.But worst of all it has Microtransactions, Thats right microtransactions in a premium games, sure quite a few games nowadays have microtransactions for speed ups, unlock everything keys. this one has premium booster packs which contain cards only in that booster pack and thus completely unattainable, randomized booster packs at that, which retail in game at £1.49.So good luck sinking money into this game for those booster pack cards or do as i'm sure numerous will do and hack unlock those cards. i'm sure there are ways and someone is no doubt doing it right now.Wizards or should i say Hasbro, wizards money centric overlord, decided to market Duels of the Planeswalkers as their entry product into magic, something for those unwilling to put down money for physical and in this case they made an apt product it does indeed introduce you to magic with the slight problem that they expect new players to deck build, having remembered my early days of playing magic, i would just modify a store bought deck it was a while before i started making my own decks but game throws the new players right in at the deep end.TL:DR Edition.If your a new player don't buy this game, buy last years, it'll teach you more your learn faster and then once you know the stuff... go play the real game keep avoiding this one.if your already a magic player, still avoid this game for whilst magic dotp used to be a ""level playing field"" its not pay to win thanks to ""premium boosters""Don't believe me check the forums			"

												This game is a disappointment. A Sham. It promises a deck builder. Hooray! For the first time in a Duels of the Planeswalker series, an actual deck builder! I wonder how many others this promise conned into buying it like it did me. So lets look at this Deck Builder shall we?There are 249 cards in the Theros set. 165 in Born of the Gods and 165 in Journey into Nyx. This is a total of 579 cards. The Duels of the Planeswalker has... 49 Theros cards. From the Theros block. 49! Out of 579! And its as bad for the OTHER Blocks. Innistrad, 666 cards in the block. This game? 49! And the only reason Return to Ravnica has 59 is because it includes the 10 guild gate lands!But these cards are not being denied to you because of programing reasons, oh no. The AI decks you face on your quest through the planes HAVE THE CARDS YOU ARE DENIED. You see them being waved under your nose, taunting you with what you are not allowed. This game is a bigger disappointment than Aliens: Colonial Marines was.			"

												HUGE let down. I bought the 35$ edition and i am completly dissapointed. The menu is not fit to be in 2014, i understand that there are animations but the scrolling and loading is so long it makes me lose intrest. You don't have to make menus all fancy if it slows them down, we honestly just want to get to the magic, so please if they have to be less pretty in order for me not to have to sit there for minutes a menu system that should take seconds please make it ugly. Also I have to click on something multiple times to make it actually register to click. The mana system always taps the mana i was going to use on other speels even when i set it to manual. They also took out alot of multiplayer features. After playing duels, and M14 i feel like they took a huge step back, this game was very dissapointing, and not worth the heafty price tag.			"

												When I heard that they were finally adding the capability to build your own deck, I was quite excited. Maybe this would be the Magic the Gathering game we have all been hoping for. But having played it for a bit, I am saddened to say that this is not the great game I thought it would be. True, they did add full deck building, but they have destroyed almost all other aspects of the game in the process. They removed the 2-Headed Giant game mode, making any games with friends Free-for-All. They have reworked the controls so that there is no pulling a card back in that you might have accidently clicked on. And if you use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in, it won't allow you to zoom back out again most of the time. Someone said it best, it is like this game was made by people that haven't played the previous versions of it.			"

												I've been buying these games for the past few years and each year there has been a improvement on the last.Each year the game had multiple game modes, single player and multiplayer game types.Cards unlocked through the course of gameplay or for a additional fee if you didn't have time to play to unlock the cards and just wished to get into the duelling fun. The DotP games never had the best deck building in card games but I believe this was on purpose to create a easy and accessible game for newcomers and seasoned magic players just to pick up and play a few games without having to spend hours making a perfect deck.But each game has had fun mix of modes and cards that gave me a lot of enjoyment, Duelling friends and overcoming defeat in the scripted duels with certain hand of cards where the AI would always play the same set of cards so even if you failed the first time you could learn and adapt to what that opponent did and be able to defeat them.The puzzle challenges which would have you die the next turn and only by using your pro MLG magic skills and thinking outside the box you would be able to turn it around and win before the end of your current turn.Working with friends to overcome insurmountable odds in the special modes like Planechase mode and Archenemy mode which change each year as fun twist on the traditional magic formula where only by working together you could overcome the enemy.It is with that knowledge that I bought this game without looking into it as all previous game have been brilliant and this would appear to be my down fall as in this year's Magic: DoTP they seem to have taking a gigantic leap backwards in term of available content within the game.They have striped it down to a 1v1 format with a basic single player duel against AI(which does have an interesting story tied with it) and 1v1v1v1 for the multiplayer that's is it, no unique game modes or fun additions just a very basic dare I say it cash in title.This game has an UI that seemed to be designed with either tablets or consoles in mind. absolute worse pc port I have ever seen, (maybe even worse than dark souls 1) now the DotP games have always had let me say... clunky menu systems but when I have to click the start button on the tile screen and it takes me 28 clicks before It goes to the next screen that immediately raises flags in my mind of what to expect.Now, I am all for artistic flair but if I have to endure a delay every time I swap menus or exit to main menu which is then proceeded by a light that is brighter than the light Gandalf shines from his staff to stop the Nazguls from attacking Faramirs men in LotR every time I go to a different menu it kind of puts me off playing the game as my time is being wasted at every turn and as my goblins pals say ""time is money friend"".Now I think this review maybe long enough as it is but to sum it up because most of you have probably not read it anyway. :)Pros:Interesting overall story within the single player experienceBetter deck customisation Cons: Puzzle modes goneChallenge modes goneMultiplayer modes gone only basic 1v1v1v1 leftNo two headed giant multiplayer mode UI takes ages to move through menus, mouse doesn't seem to react sometimes. Better deck customisation seems to have taken away the good starting decks the other DotP games had now you choose a starter deck and it doesn't synergise with the card in the deck, without extensive modification.Premium booster packs (bad starter decks might not of been a mistake but a calculated decision)In my opinion don't buy this year's version I don't know what happened whilst in development but the game is a huge step backwards its a no from me on this one guys.

												I love magic. I'm a mediorce magic player. The last games had some hard decks and the AI was pretty good.This deck is a step in reverse. The AI has made a couple easy mistakes despite me being on the toughest difficulty. The design team took the 'play stuff after combat' too far. It has failed some game winning turns by using auras after combat. Even if it were playing really defensively, I've seen a few screw ups.The biggest is I can't complete the first part of the campaign. At all. I can't beat Avacyn. She has a much better mana curve than I do and a far better deck. Even trying to get the perfect hand, the Green/Red deck is just so bad, it's impossible to do anything. I suspect this game is Pay 2 Win. I don't have the shop available yet here, but I get the strong feeling that if the FIRST CAMPAIGN is impossible to beat, the rest of the game is going to require I have a lot more boosters. I can't recommend this game at all. I feel like they took a big step back instead of a good step forward.			"

												A complete waste of money and time. I have been on and off playing mtg for many blocks, steming all way back to 7th edition, and after I moved so DotP has been the only way to play with friends.Pros- Deck BuildingCons-vary pay to win (I bought the complete version due to the descreptions of the content but I'll get to that)- most of the cards in the game are unacessable to the player.-the extra content is vary misleading and by that I mean they say ""all the cards from inistrad"" making is sound as if its a block expanstion, but no its 40 cards out a 300+ card set.-the interface is vary slow (takes about 40secs to just leave the main menu after pressing enter).-the interface is also trying to make things look clean but they hide information that you want (equiped deck... things like that)-they force the tutorial upon you. literly you cannot do anything till you play their tutorial (yes you can skip most of it but then you have to do a duel just to leave the dueling tutorial) then you get to go the the deck building tutorial. Overall this game is over all a bad choice to purchase and if I could refund it i would.			"

I could go over all the pros and cons but there are already a thousand other reviews here saying the same thing.  Bottom line: If you loved DotP for the quick playability, co-op two-headed giant games with friends, and the simple, yet incredibly synergenic, pre-built decks then Magic 2015 isn't for you.			"

												An update after a couple patches and an expansion : Still trash. Menus are a little faster but need a total redesign as they're still a bulky slog. Deck equipping was and is a dumb idea.The expansion has 51 damn cards. There are thousands and thousands of cards in MTG, guys. It was worth the price I paid for it at least, since I got it for ""free"" after I bought a couple of premium boosters before they became a multiplayer only reward.Still a bad game. Still a huge step back from 2014 and 2013.--I was on board for the idea of building your own deck until I saw that DOTP 2015 literally lifted its Sealed pool from 2014, transplanted it into this game, made the interface clunky and painfully slow, and removed all other game modes besides campaign and online 2-player mode.Besides the UI being like wading through sludge, 80% of the cards in the card pool are complete trash in the context of Constructed, with little to no synergy existing between them. Sealed =/= Constructed, but apparently nobody told Stainless. If you like slow paced games where you drop 1/1 creatures waiting for a 7 mana 4/4 bomb, you're in the right place. Admittedly I probably only unlocked 50% of the cards, but I've been playing Magic for years and a look at the full list of cards, even the so-called Premiums, told me a sad tale.This could be made right with patches to fix the UI and by adding cards into the pool with actual board impact through promo codes but I have ample reason to believe nothing will be done with this game besides dumping a few extra loads of mediocre cards into the pool and charging for it, then continuing Duels' slow, rotting march into oblivion with the following iterations.I'd love to be proven wrong, though.

												After playing most other Duels of the Planswalkers, this is the first one I cannot recommend. Even as a learning tool, this version may leave you bitter and disilusioned in magic as a whole.After the first deck you recieve, all other cards have to be obtained through booster packs, which you earn by playing. However, the idea of booster packs is only an illusion. You recieve the cards in a set order depending on which plane you play on. So if you want Brimaz, you have to unlock every other card on Theros because he is the last. And after you unlock every card on a plane, THERE IS NO REASON TO CONTINUE PLAYING THERE. You cannot gain additional copies of cards, so you'll only ever get one Brimaz.Additionally, not all cards can be found in free booster packs. Some cards can ONLY be obtained through ""premium"" packs bought for real money. These cards include:-Kozelik-Stoneforge Mystic-Maelstrum Archangel-Kitesail Apprentice (Really?)-Blasting StationBeing able to construct your own decks is supposed to be a major draw this time around, however it came at the expense of all pre-made decks. You can ONLY use the first deck you recieve (nearly all commons and uncommons) and decks you've built out of a pool that only reaches 300 cards. This ends up with you having a lot less variety and synergy in your decks, especially if you're new to the game. Additionally the constructed deck mechanic fails in that you're basically building a 60 card sealed deck to face against pre-made decks until you reach the point where you've unlocked enough to make a confident constructed deck... but at that point you've probably beaten most of the single player campaign.Additionally there are cards programmed into the game that you as the player cannot use. TONS OF THEM. Now, older versions of the game have all done this, it's not new. BUT in those versions it kinda made sense as all you had was pre-made decks and perhaps those cards didn't fit in any of them. But now when you can make your own decks, every card programmed into the game should be avalible to you at some point. There's no reason not to give the players cards like Grey Merchent and Honor of the Pure when you already put them in the game!There's no secondary game mode this time around, such as Planechase or Archenemy. Also gone are the entertaining and sometimes even tricky challenges that would give you one turn and a set of cards to get out of a bad situation.On a plus side, the game looks very pretty. Backgrounds and menus look very stylish as do all the booster pack arts. The downside is this comes at the expense of actual functionality. Even the escape menu during a game is a mess, and is really more form coming before function.The game runs slow unless you turn off shadows and the audio is always popping for me.The game is also very buggy. Often, when too many triggers are going on the stack and some form of lifegain is involved the game will break and make whoever was gaining life invincible. You can tell this has happened because their life total won't change. I've had to happen to the AI as well as myself.Additionally a lot of cards don't work as they should (Ajani's pridemate still only gets 1 counter when there are multiple lifelinking creatures dealing damage) and targeting creatures during combat can get messed up by some strange bug that returns a ""cannot target creatures in that zone"" error.So, once again, do not purchase this game. Purchase duels 2014 or 2013, they are much better and worth it especially if you're trying to get into magic.			"

Grinding forever to build up cards then stuck on bosses then have to get coolest cards from multiplayer or pay. It seems hardly anyone plays multiplayer, so double yuck. I guess it would be fair and balanced once everyone has the same collection, and fun if there were more opponents to find.			"

												As a long time fan of Magic The Gathering, it pains me to say that I would not recommend you buy this game. While it does finally let you build your own deck and manually change how many lands are in said deck, this year's version is quite stripped of content. 2HG, Planechase, and Archenemy were taken out (or just never implemented) for whatever insane reason, sealed play  is nonexistant, and no challenge modes. And don't buy the Complete Bundle or any Card Collections, you will regret it. Why? I will tell you why: by winning games you get booster packs which gets you more cards that you can use to further customise your deck. It takes time and effort, and if you buy the Complete Bundle or the Card Collections you miss out on a big chunk of content.The game is also has its fair share of bugs and glitches, as well as having a feeling of not being polished. I get random framerate drops for no apparent reason; I had to go and manually change the resolution to 1366x768 in the config file because there isnt an option for it, and the menus are lackluster. I give this game a 2/5 for now, until they send out updates and hopefully release more content. But in all honesty, go buy Magic 2014. You will have a much more enjoyable experience, have much more content, and a better polished game than Magic 2015.			"

												Adding full deck-building to the latest version of Stainless Games' series of Magic the Gathering games is almost worthy of a thumbs up recommendation, but poor design decisions keep it from getting a recommendation.The UI is uber-clunky and frustratingly slow in its transitions, mouse clicks take a while to register and sometimes don't seem to register at all, and some of the more frequently addressed buttons are tucked away behind a fair amount of erratic scroll swipes. So, despite a few shortcuts provided by the bottom-right corner avatar pop-up menu, there is a lot of unnecessary action required when navigating the menu.A minor gripe for experienced MTG players is that you're being forced to at least partially go through a tutorial session that explains the most basic game mechanics. Not being adequately informed that the deck you choose to play the campaign with is going to be the deck you are stuck with until you manage to unlock a fair amount of cards that will allow you to adjust the deck to your liking, is an unnecessary nuisance that should annoy both experienced and inexperienced players alike. While these two gripes are not a deal-breaker per se, they do make you question the developers' design choices. If these choices were made for their for 1st MTG:DotP games, they might have been understandable; however, for them to make these decisions for a 5th incarnation of the game is incomprehensible. The design curve for an annual game series such as this should easily show an upward curve, and not a downward one.Some cards can only be obtained by purchasing premium boosters, and you will have to spend at least as much as you spent on the base game to unlock all of those. While that is a pity, it is another pity to find out that many of the great cards played by the AI are not at all available for the player.The biggest fun should be found in deck-building, and then trying that deck out against real opponents. However, despite its size, the card pool is a bit underwhelming in terms of what it has to offer and generally steers the player in the same direction; fast aggro-decks. While there doesn't seem to be an awful lot of opportunity for creative deck designs as of yet, seasoned players of this game series will be aware that more DLC is to be expected, which might spice up the deck design possibilities some more.So in conclusion, full deck building is the long-awaited great step forward, and it certainly adds alot to the fun of the game, especially in multiplayer games, and with that step it's finally approaching the feeling of the real game, but it's very likely that we'll only see the proper implementation of it in the next incarnation of this game.

												Pros:- It's MtG- It's the last version so everybody is going to play this online.- Deck customization but:1) Limited card pool.2) Random restricions (max 2 rares per type etc..).3) There are cards implemented in the game that you cant use.I wasnt sure to put this as a pro or as a con since whoever designed this did a really poor job but other reviews list it as a pro.. Also the idea of deckbuilding itself was good (well people were asking for in since dotp2012) but seems like they tried hard to implement it in the wrost possible way...  Cons:- Day 1 dlc: Unlike the past versions this time you can't unlock every card just by playing. Every gamer already know the cancer of day 1 dlcs, if you aren't aware do a quick reserach on google. Also the whole dlc costs even more than the game itself, no joke.- No 2-Headed Giant: there is no reason at all for this removal, the offcial comment from Wotc was that only a niche played the mode (?!?!?), probably the real reason is that they want to add it in another dlc and make you pay extra money.- Cards implemented used only by the PC. The cards are there ready and working but nope you cant use them, only the AI can. This issue has been pointed out a lot but there is stll no official reason for this. - Microtransactions and balance.If you are familiar with diablo 3, the game was ruined by the choice of balancing the whole game around the AH. In the same way this game is ruined by its design around microtransactions:1) Grindfest to unlock the cards. In this edition wotc push hard to make you buy even the unnecessary DLCs.Especially with some of the starting decks that are no where near the powerlevel of the past editions the gind will be real. A solution can be to lover the difficulty to mage level to speed up this process but yeah.. ask yourself if a good game design would require something like this. 2) P2W.There are pay2win components where paying extra money give access to more premium cards and not only to cosmetics like in the past editions.The base game is just there to tell you ""Hey spend more money!!"" and playing it gives you the feeling that it is a rushed money grab.A quote from the Lead Designer Nik Davidson (From his reddit AMA):""(1)One of my foremost goals on Duels was to control and minimize the impact of the Premium boosters on the overall game, (2)while still providing good value to players who wanted them.""(1) Mission failed.(2) !!!!! ""players who wanted them"" And they removed the 2HG Because ""was a niche feature""!!! Ask yourself if there are more people who want the 2hg or people who want to pay more? (Here the point isn't the extra 20€ but the bs in the head designer thought.)- The menu is slow and buggy.It is probably designed for tablets and the port sucks.1) Super slow screen transitions.2) Unresponsive clicking.3) Bright white background.A couple of comments from the forum: ""Now I'm blind, too much white screens in my eyes....""""Pointless ""equip a deck"" requirement making you go all the way back to the deck creation menu in between games.""""This menu is absolute garbage how they could even come up with something so messed up!!!""- The multiplayer: 1) There are pay2win components.2) Your opponent can pause the game forever and go afk waiting for you to give up. The fact that this is possible just illustrates how poorly the game is designed.There are people that when you play a premium card will accuse you of pay2win (sadly rightfully) and pause the game forever to ""punish you"". I know this because I got a premium booster pack with the preorder and since the cards are obiuosly broken as ♥♥♥♥ I put some of them into a deck I used online...3) The blocking system is messed up. When someone attacks you with more than 10 creatures some of them can't be effectively blocked because the UI sucks.4) If your opponent leave the game the AI take over and you'll be trapped in playing a match vs the AI. They already had this problem resolved in the past editions but who knows how this time they ""forgot"" to put the option of conceding a duel.Update 07/08/2014- Completing the game:1) A bug today still not fixed prevent you form obtaining the ""Explorer Title"" and completing the game 100%.2) For those who buy the game only for the achievements there is a 100 online win achievement and the grind will take a good time, especially be prepared to meet:a) People with full pay2win decks.b) People that when they are about to lose freeze the game forever waiting for you to leave.. - False Advertisement:The Complete Edition is not complete at all so if you would do the huge mistake to buy it for 35€ you would still have to pay the 28€ for the premium cards spending a total of 63€. Let's be real, this game isn't even worth the base 10€ and there are people who were deceived into paying 63€ for it!!TL;DR:Dotp: another good franchise ruined by the greed. This game is garbage.Update 19/11/2014I got the expansion for free since i had the preorder and the 2014 edition. The expansion add more cards to the pool and remove the premium boosters but the game is the same... and still no 2hg...			"

												Not sure if DLC will save this title for me, but I'm not one to give much credit for a game you have to pay extra for to make it feel like a viable title.  The purchase of extra boosters being tied to multiplayer success is a real sticking point for me.I've bought just about every one of the previous titles on my Xbox account and played hours upon hours of multiplayer (two-headed giant being my favorite game type.)  I finished the campaign on this and tried some multiplayer and out of the games I played I saw one deck that was not completely like the others.  I'm surprised to find that I've come to the conclusion that I like the games with premade decks more.If you enjoyed previous versions of this game, you may very well not enjoy this one.  I'm sure many people DO like this, but do some research on the virtues and cons of this game prior to buying.			"

												I have played over one hundred hours of Magic 2014 and I loved it.  Needless to say I pre-ordered Magic 2015 as soon as I could.  Never do this.  The game is a massive disappointment.  If you wish to play a good Magic game get 2014.Pros- Lots and Lots of cards- Decent graphicsCons- NO TWO-PLAYER CO-OP- Stuck with a single deck choice (in 2014 there were at least 8 different decks)- Difficult to unlock cards- Only one type of game mode- Poor auto land tap (the automatic functions of the game do not preform even the most obvious moves)- Painful interfaceOverall the game feels like it was thrown together in an effort to get it out with as little work done be the creators as possible.  The myopic gameplay and single deck make the game become dull quickly when compared to earlier Duels of the Planeswalkers game.  While the custom deck option is nice, it does not compensate for the lack of game modes. "

												Pro - Fully customizable decksCons - Small overall cardpool         - Has the option to purchase ""premium cards"" which are 3x the cost of the base game and are arguably better than the cards you get in the base game         - Limited multiplayer options (only FFA, no 2HG or other format variant)         - Can no longer play in ""Windowed Mode"", needs to be full screen         - It seems Wizards wanted to focus on a UI to make the play on tablets better which IMO made playing on the comuter worse (i.e. menus are not in list form, you scroll through them like you are swiping on a tablet)         - The ""red zone"" in the middle of the battlefield is disgusting. It shifts the battlefield around just so it can show a ""red zone"". Wizards, stop making dumb UI changes. Who cares if it used to be referred to as the red zone. Just stop.

												A marked step down from last years game.In the wake of the microtransaction news I had lowered my expectations for this game but after having spent a solid few hours with it I find I didn't lower them enough.  Oddly my complaints have nothing to do with the microtransactions.Automatic mana tapping is incredibly bad.  Much worse than last years edition.  It will often immediately tap you out of one color in order to pay colorless costs.The interface has obviously been designed for tablet use but in the process has been made clunky for traditional PC play.  Menus require scrolling through option by option, ideal for a tablet but laughably bad for a PC game.The much vaunted deck builder is worse than the modification tools from last years edition.  It automatically segregates your deck by color with no option to to change this.  I do not wish to compare my white six drop to my red one drop, they don't really relate to each other.Presentation is pretty, with nice transitions.  These transitions that you will see hundreds if not thousands of time.  We don't really need a 3 second animation every combat phase, especially when nobody is attacking.This game is all polished presentation that gets in the way of the game.  That you have to buy 30 premium packs to unlock all the cards is just adding insult to injury.			"

												Did EA develop this version? The game is crafted to almost require you to spend money on RNG booster packs. The starter decks are absolute crap (white black gives you Necromancer's Assistant - put 3 cards into the graveyard but NO other cards to bring them back), 2 headed giant mode is gone and Helen Keller functions better than the UI. Save your money for either 2014 if you like preconstructed decks or get some paper cards that at least have some value. Don't forget that the iPad and Steam versions are completely seperate meaning if you buy it in steam you'll still have to pay to unlock a seperate game on the ipad. Incredibly disappointing.One thing I did like is the music but it's the same damn song from 2014.			"

												I've played 2009-2014 Duels of the Planeswalkers, and loved every one of them.However this game fell flat on it's face.Pros:-Cleaner UI, not crappy vertical bars like the previous-Starting deck is any 2 color combo-Can grind different events similar to the hoard events from m2014 to get boosters (One being ""What's in the box?"")Cons:-Slow Interface-Picking a color combination (For me Blue/Black) doesn't mean you get a deck inspired by Dimir (The blue/black Archetype), instead it means you get a few weak, expensive standard black cards and a few weak, blue cards that have no synergy. Blue/black comes with two black cards that make you mill 3 cards when it's placed into battle but there's no card in the basic deck that can activate effects from the grave.-Premade AI draws assure that unless you don't have a perfect hand you're done.-Weak decks mean that even if you have the perfect starting hand, you can garuntee that your opponent will come out with 5/5 flying vigilant angels turn three and you won't have anything in your deck that can contend with them unless you spend all of your land to get rid of one.-No Two Headed Giant, the one and only reason I played the other games, because a game of four friends constantly switching teams is probably the most fun I've had in a videogame for a prolonged period of time.-You have to grind for booster packs, of which you'll only get a few cards of your chosen colors.I'll probably not touch this game untill Dimir support is added or Blue/red Werewolves are added.And please, Wizards Add 2HG, this game will sell like hotcakes if you do.

												With the removal of the Co-Op mode this is a major step back in the franchise for the targeted audience of the ""casual player"".  My friends and I use DotP primarily as a method to comp stomp and relax in the evenings.  We enjoy the custom deck construction but honestly we're not sure if we will continue to play it since it doesn't have the Co-Op vs AI setting.  We're hoping that the manufacturer just didn't have time to develop it for the release but that they will update it later.  My hopes are not super high though.  The single player campaign strikes me as worth the $10.00 pricetag but we were banking on the unlocks for the Complete Bundle to allow us to do our own decks ""right out of the Box"" so to speak.  We are very disappointed to find that the Co-Op mode does not currently exist.  Therefor I would not recommend this game at the $35.00 price tag (but it completely depends on what content you are most interested in).			"

Although, everything else about this game is worse compared to the previous versions of the game. There are 14 premium booster packs that you have pay $2 each to get those premium cards. The menu systems is terrible and not meant for mouse. When you play a multiplayer game, it doesn't take you back to the lobby when the match is over. Instead, it takes you to the main menu so you can't rematch a play. They took out 2 headed giant, which is a coop mode that was really fun in the previous games. Overall, this game is a mess.			"

												The Duels of the Plainswalkers (DotP) series has always been my secret pleasure since I stopped playing Magic the Gathering in high school. It had simplified one on one duels, challenges that were a nice and fun extra if you wanted something to work your brain and learn new strategies for Magic, a Bonus mode like archmage or plainschase that added even more depth to single and multilayer matches, and plenty of decks to use with over hundreds of cards. The series has also had the mode made DotP series extremely popular Two-Headed giant which is two vs two action that could become extremely strategic and to be great at the mode required communication between teammates which was a great addition to the Plainswalker series.The campaign mode in 2015 is dull and can be very frustrating if you didn’t purchase cards packs which to mention compared to previous editions of the DotP series, to unlock all the cards without grinding is expensive and purchasing the complete package doesn't give you all the cards, there are still premium boosters to purchase for two bucks a pop. You are stuck using one deck until you have unlocked enough cards to make a second deck. The story has never been a main point to the series which is why there has never been a good one. They don't matter, it has always been about the gameplay.DotP 2015 takes away everything we loved in the series, challenges, two-headed giant mode, a bonus mode to mix things up and gives us the ability to customize decks and a large variety of the cards. The issue is the menu's are the worst they have ever been, you get kicked out of a room after you have played a game online and you can't change your decks in a room forcing constant inviting the same person over and over if you're playing with a friend or want a rematch. Over time the process becomes unbearable that you will prefer one of the previous entries in the series compared to this one.The ability to create a deck is stunted by one thing, you will always see the same builds over and over with slight differences. This is due to the fact that most of the good cards in a color are very few so more players are more likely to use them and cards that combo with them in order to win more games.Magic 2015 is just a spit in the face to fans of the series, it asks for more money f you don't want to spend hours upon hours grinding and be able to compete in the online competitive multiplayer than any digital Magic game in the series. The menu system might as well be the challenge mode considering that it is the most clunky and unresponsive menu ever. The multiplayer aspect has been ruined by not being able to play two-headed giant or have constant friendly re-matches without getting kicked out of the room. The only pro about this game is that it's Magic and Magic is an excellent card game and has always been.			"

												2015's installment of the annual Duels of the Planeswalkers video game is, in a word, mediocre.In contrast to previous Duels games, Duels 2015 allows you to freely construct decks from one large card pool, rather than providing you with a selection of pre-constructed decks that cannot be mixed and matched. One might expect this to lead to a wider variety of decks seeing play, and to allow for greater individual self-expression. To an extent, this is the case. In practice, however, the fact that any card available to one deck is available to all decks means that, for balance reasons, Duels 2015's card pool ends up feeling somewhat bland and mechanically tame by comparison to some of the more exciting and idiosyncratic decks available in past games (such as my personal favorites, the ""Up to Mischief"" Faeries deck and the ""Lords of Darkness"" Demons deck from Duels 2014). That said, the open card pool was executed about as well as it could be; while there are a few deck archetypes that are clearly much stronger than others, that's the case no matter how you're playing Magic, and the higher-rarity (and therefore, theoretically, higher-power) cards being restricted to fewer copies in a deck than cards of lower rarities helps keep things unpredictable and forces you to play a little more thoughtfully.With only a few exceptions, I found the AI battles in the single-player campaign also less interesting than the single-player encounters in previous Duels games. I did, however, appreciate the ""Explore [Plane]"" function, which added a quite large chunk of content to the game without tediously bulking out the single-player campaign.Duels 2015's multiplayer function is actually a step backwards from the fairly basic multiplayer options of Duels 2014. The popular Two-Headed Giant team play mode is no longer available; the only options are two-player duels and three- or four-player free-for-alls. A minor loss, weighed objectively, but it stings disproportionately. I also, for the life of me, cannot figure out how to make the ""invite player"" function work for multiplayer matchmaking.Duels 2015's user interface is, frankly, obnoxious. While the animations for the various menus may be slick and polished, they also add quite a bit to the time necessary to navigate them. It quickly becomes tedious. Additionally, it is frequently unresponsive to mouse-clicks, requiring several clicks of a button or rolls of the mouse wheel to have any effect. Something as simple and routine as clicking ""Start"" on the game's initial loading screen to access the main menu should not be an effort-intensive chore, but it is. If mere clunkiness was not enough to condemn this game, I have on more than one occasion actually had played cards not take effect, which is absurd.Many people have complained that Duels 2015 is ""pay-to-win,"" in that the cards available only in the Premium Boosters that must be purchased with cash rather than unlocked through play offer deck-builders a substantial advantage. It's true that there are several cards only available through Premium Boosters that are quite useful, but at best the Premium collection takes bad decks up to mediocre; it is trivial to build a competitive deck with only the base collection. Especially with that in mind, Premium Boosters are unquestionably overpriced.In summary, while there are definitely worse ways to spend $9.99, just buy Duels 2014 instead.			"

And a its a poor decision to have a player pick a deck and be stuck with it until they unlock more or grind out enough good cards to make it decent.This year's version of MTG is dull, trodding, poorly planned and executed.If you want a good card game for PC, go MTG 2014 or Hearthstone instead.

												A lot less then what I had Initially expected. Overall the experience is very watered down and I find myself getting more frustrated with the game then actually enjoying it. I get that DOTP is suppose to be the gateway to playing MTGO (MODO) or the actual card game, however this is a poor way to do it.I'm a long time Magic player (20 Years) and I literally struggled to beat the game on Planeswalker difficulty but not because the computer played better, but just the power level imbalance. Honestly the cards we are given to use are a mash up of some of the more popular Standard (Type 2) cards mixed in with a few but not overpowered Modern cards. However... the computer gets acess to a HUGE pool of cards we don't get that are grossly over powered.Example: Lillana played 2 Demonic tutors on me in the same turn ~ Really... TWO! that's not even legal in Vintage (Type 1) less on a level where we have no where near the power level to compete with this and the game seems to more of a luck factor then simply playing the right cards.The Interface sucks ~ its slow, laggy and sometimes unresponsive to my choices. With the Machine I am running, NOTHING SHOULD BE RUNNING SLOW! 8 Cores @ 4.0 Ghz, 8 GB of DDR3 Ram, Nvidia GeForce 760, Navigating around just seems clumky compared to 2014, not sure what they did but its not working right,Not sure why but I cant go above 23Hz... well I can select above it and it changes it but it changes it back from 60hz the moment i get into a game (Bad coding maybe?)Lack of modes is still an issue ~ we had a lot of great modes from the previous games (2HG. Archenemy, Planechase) so why are we limited to single and multiplayer games? Newsflash Wizards... NO ONE PLAYS MULTIPLAYER MAGIC UNLESS ITS COMMNADER!So why not commander?-----------------------------------HighlightsPros: -Finally full deck customization-Lots of computer oppoents-Limits on Cards to add a new experienceCons:-Bad interface-Extreme lack of cards despite many more have been programmed.-Lack of Modes (Only single and Multiplayer ~ No 2HG and others)-Difficulty Imbalance and bad AI (Seen the computer kill one of his own creatures for no reason on planeswalker)-Poor shuffle simulation (I shouldn't be getting mana screwed/Flooded so often in a deck that curves out on 3 thats is running 26 lands just becauase I can rarely get past 2 lands 18 cards deep into my deck)-Random crashes-Needs to be more like the Yu-Gi-Oh!

I came back into the fold for 2015 after hearing some lite talk about building your own decks and having a quick way to finding a bigger multiplayer pool than just my local card shops, so I would dive right in!It's like they upgraded from the kiddie pool to the shallow end.   Like real shallow... two feet, max.The card pool is incredibly limited, estimated at about 50 cards a color and don't even get me started on the premium rares that can only be unlocked with cash/money/hoes.   Magic 2015: Duels of the Planeswalkers is arguably the worst game in the series. The free range deck building has actually turned out to be a negative rather than a positive feature.			"

												You'll be playing the waiting game more than MTG.  Waiting for the menus to scroll, waiting for the menus to load, waiting for the AI to think about its turn, waiting for the timer.  Previous editions went much smoother, and it was much easier to restart a duel (who on earth would think making me click start when I already said I want to play again immediately?).The ability to completely customize your deck sounds like a good idea, and we've been clamoring for it since the first DotP, but the selection of cards is severely limited compared to what it was before.  I guaruntee you won't be able to make a deck you like better than your favorite from 2014.  No Two-Headed Giant or Puzzles just add insult to injury.Save yourself some money and stick to previous editions.  Maybe DLC will make it better, but it's not close to worth it right now.			"

												Very Dissapointing, would be a succinct way to sum up Magic 2015.This Version seems like a very short expansion pack for one of the previous Magic games.The one good added feature of freely customizable Decks gets shot in the knee by the Rest of the games shortcommings.You can have only 1 Starter Deck for the whole game instead of a selection, which at first makes sense because you are supposed to make your own. The problem with that is that you have a insanely small selection of cards at the start and once you finished the Campaign you cant unlock more without paying.Unlocking Cards, due to the randomness of the boosterpacks, can leave you with nothing to really add to your Deck.Which wouldn´t be that much of a problem if you could just get more and more Booster packs. But you only get a set amount. So if you have bad luck and dont get the cards for your deck, start preparing your wallet.They also cut out other features of the old games like the Two-headed Giant format. But maybe we can pay 5$ to get it as DLC later...Get one of the old magic games which are still buggy! but are more fun and dont try to suck out your money quite as hard as this game.Magic 2015 seems like a demo Version of the real programm and as a long time Magic fan I am very dissapointed with it.I hope they will patch some of the things i am complaining about but as it stands now i am done with this series.Save your money and buy yourself some Icecream or something. This game isnt worth your money right now.			"

												I as a magic fan both the TCG and the Videogame feel quite disheartened at this quick crash grab. The only thing that is worth noting of this game is that they've added some of the Theros block set to play around with. The ""Deck building"" gimic isn't much to get excited over since They limit your decks to what you can create with the arbitrary rarity lock (meaning 4 Commons to unlock, 3 Uncommons, 2 Rares, and 1 Mythic) which isn't exciting. To add to the muck that the game seems to irk myself are two things: The Menu is (or was for me) at my friends house was auto locked to a 29p Refresh rate, then playing this on my own rig started at 50fps. Now it might be saying that I'm expecting a lot out of a simple card game would be right but it wouldn't be an issue if the menu screen was incredibly unresponsive and relaxed, It took about 3 or 4 Clicks on the start game promt to let the game know that I wanted to play. Lastly the other thing would be noting is that the AI is pretty sad. Most of the time getting mana screwed won the game by having 2 mana with two 1/1 soilders with a flying enchantment that gives +1/+2 This happened about 6 or 7 times Even on the final boss, Hell infact Twice on the final boss. If I had to give an honest statement, I would have to say that this version is possibly optimised for iPad or Android tablets. Final Statements: Avoid getting the game since its less of what the previous verison is and if you want to get this game and/or want to try it out to see what magic is either look into getting M13 or M14 or wait until a sale for at least half off. 38/100			"

												A broken, unplayable mess that lacks basic features from previous iterations and will let the AI cheat constantly. It introduces cards that you will never be able to use, its system for balancing is rarity (which is totally apart from anything Wizards of the Coast ever intended) and the interface is clearly designed for tablets instead of actual PCs. A more balanced, more creative improvement from Magic 2014, this game is still lacking the basics of a true MtG experience.But like monopoly, the fun is in playing with 3 of your friends and getting mad at them for playing like morons. Thumbs up.			"

												Well I only ever got to play 2013 and I thin the one before that but this one is pretty decent. I got the bundle which was pretty cool so I already had some cards to make decent deck. The Booster packs are really weird though? I figured they would of been something like getting a normal booster pack with the Premium ones just having 3 extra cards in them with maybe the possiblity of extra foils or something but no that is not it. All in all I have enjoyed it so far. I have not gotten to try multiplayer yet sadly still trying to get cards for at least a couple decks before I go play it but 10/10.I had to edit thisEDIT- After playing the game a bit more I wanted to let everyone know that I can no longer recommend it after beating Avacyn I got buy cards from the bundle and proceeded to play the next few matches and the AI have the decks set it seems. I go up against the minotaur deck and it is the same cards each time and I found this to be true with the Hydra as well. I understand its story line but litteraly it makes it almost impossible to beat some of these guys. If you are playing and did not get the bundle I am sorry because the crappy started deck will not pull you through these matches. I can not recommend this after playing a bit further in. I still have not gotten to try multiplay but for the Story Line Battles I would say no.I would also add that you can not tap your Mana the game does it for you and so far I can not find a way to cahnge this so basically say you have 2 Forests on the Field and 2 planes. You have an Ordeal of Heliod that costs 1 Colorless and 1 Plains and you have Swift Justice in your hand that costs 1 Plains. If you go and use Ordeal of Heliod the game makes you use 2 white mana so you are screwed on using your swift justice during the combat phase. The game makes it impossible to make any plays at all. I am seriously regretting buying this game now.			"

												I liked Magic the Gathering 2012. It was a great tool to teach me how to actually play Magic, which before was too daunting of a task. Now I buy the games every year, with each game adding more to the experience. As any iterative game, there are cool new features and drawbacks. However, Magic 2015 takes out all the features that I enjoyed for a system meant to manipulate you into microtransactions. I already paid money for the game, please give me the full game.Negatives:First Noticed that the game overall is slow. The menus are painful and AI is slower/dumber.  Another is no Custom Duels-- My favorite mode Two Headed Giant was taken out. Why? Each year they take great modes away, but this was a staple. I actually reinstalled the other magic games to replay those modes I loved so much. I also loved the decks provided in the previous games, which for this game doesn't have any themed planeswalker deck.You can create your own deck?! Well yes, this year you can actually do that. However, to get the good cards you need to unlock them through the campaign (random chance boosters). To get all the cards... well you will have to pay to do that. Positives:The Art can be cool at times. Sometimes.If you want to get into magic I suggest buying Magic 2013, or even Magic 2014. This game however is trying to ride the card game microtransaction systems of FREE to Play card games WHILE making you pay for the initial game. I regret two purchase in my life for games-- Dragon Age 2 and Magic 2015. I guess another postive at least I didn't spend 60 dollars and have to install Origin. But that is like saying, at least I didnt walk out my front door into traffic today. So buyers beware.			"

But who cares right? You got your paychecks. I DO NOT recommend this game to anyone. M14 was much better. PS card pool sucks, restrictions you put on the already bad card pool makes for worse. How could you not even put in some of the cards that make M15 so great? Royal screw it, this game is such a screw up.			"

												Okay, I'm not a pro, but I love the game since my youth and I've been playing the game for like 20 years.Now that I'm older I don't have so many chances to play the game in real life anymore, just now and then with very few friends who actually kept their cards (most sold theirs).And I tried out the first few PC games for it too and then finally decided I should buy it and bought the 2014 version.Played it lots and lots and even got my real life friends to get it too.They prefer it real life because of the variety (and the actual human contact :P) and so do I.But since that was not always possible I enjoyed the PC game so far.Yes, your ""Deck Building"" choices were very limited but I was never much bothered about that.Though it would certainly be possible to put in all cards from the current edition (and older ones too), I always believed in it that they just want the game to be more like a Demo and make people more interested to actually play the game in real life.Which is good, I liked that.When I read that the new 2015 version will actually have a free Deck Building system I was really surprised and was looking forward to it.I was looking forward to a new MtG game anyways :P - but this sparked my interest even more of course.I basicly counted hours till I could download and play it!Now that I got it and played it a bit I must say, I'm utterly disappointed.I can only really emphazie what I read in the other comments:This game really tries its best to make you spend your money!And any game which tries that in such a forced way is just a ""Not recommand"" for me.If a game offers a fast way out for anyone who does not want to or can not invest the time others do, sure, why not.Like the previous MtG game where you could buy the unlocked Decks or the foil Deck.I didn't buy one! But the option was there.You could eitherway play lots and lots to unlock all the cards or just pay a small fee and unlock it right away.That's okay, not such a bad option and it still leaves all players in an equal situation.In this game, well.First you choose a Deck which contents you do not know, except the starting color/s.I went for a black one which had the description about leeching life away.Found that pretty cool, since I have a mono-black Deck in real life which just works on draining away the opponents life.What did I get in this game? A white/black deck which is WEAK, and I mean really really really WEAK!Like so many comments before: You have to be darn lucky with your opening hand or how you draw, or you can just quit right away and save yourself some 20-30mins painful playing time where you somehow hope you might still turn things around, cause in most cases you just won't!Like I said, I'm not a pro, but I've been playing the game for about 20 years and I feel totally gutted in here.It has nothing to do with your skill, your starting Deck is just sooo weak. By now I set it on Mage, just so I can play a bit and I still sometimes lose without a glimmer for a chance.I was hoping to unlock a bit more cards and yes, you do, but it takes a long time.The RNG for drawing new cards and strong cards I could live with, but first you go through such a painful game to actually win (otherwise no Booster Pack) and then you usually get the same cards over and over again, which don't really strengthen your Deck.Checking the list of possible cards and where they from you think it's possible, but you're so tempted to buy your easy way out you lose your ability to think rational....And what the heck is the section ""Premium Cards"" which has some really cool cards?Do I HAVE to buy premium boosters just to get those? Or have a chance for those?No, that's not okay, not at all.The menu style is from some of the previous games, and at first glance it looks nice, but I really don't want a slow responsive menu and where I have to click 4x ""back"" only to get to the main menu.The 2014 menu was simple, but fast responsive and decent enough.This one is just terrible - graphics are simply not everything.Multiplayer, well, where's 2 Headed Giant? And where are some other cool game modi like Arch-Enemy. I thought they'd come up with something nice again but this time it just has FFA (or I'm too blind to find a way to change it).I'm happy I just pre-ordered the normal version of the game, I think I'd spend a week crying if I bought the complete bundle... at least.So final conclusion: Hands off! Don't buy it, don't support this. I love MtG, supoort it :P But not THIS game.If you want an OK digital version of MtG, go with the 2014 one, that one is okay and even though you're quite limited, it is fun.Sorry for the wall of text - rant over now.And thank you for reading it (if anyone did :P)Update: I completed the single player story now and even played as much as to unlock all cards from all plains.88% complete, just missing the cards from the premium boosters.So now I'll just deinstall it and that's it.Yes, the Deck Building is awesome.But having to spend ~20€ just to unlock all cards isn't enjoyable.In the previous game you could unlock everything by just playing.And that's how it should be.I don't mind paying a couple of € for extra content (Expansion Pack, Deck Packs), but Premium Boosters? No, if I buy a game, I want to have full access to everything and not feel forced to pay extra just to get 100% completion.If they made it so you can get Premium Boosters by winning in multiplayer only, okay, that would have been acceptable too.Asking for money: Just NO!So now I feel disgusted whenever I log into the game and know I'll have never 100% of all cards cause I refuse to pay.Also without 2HG multiplayer is not appealing to me at all, since I was never a fan of FFA.In real life yes, but not in this game.Unless they fix at least one of those issues I'll probably not play it again.Sorry for 2nd rant :P			"

What kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t advertising is that?!  Oh, and they also took out Two-Headed-Giant mode and didn't even bother replacing it with another alternate game type like Planechase or Archenemy.

Maybe they'll iron out the bugs later on, but the pay-to-win model in this game is complete garbage.  This is coming from someone who started playing Magic around the Tempest/Urza's Saga block.			"

												Definitely the worst Duels of the Planeswalkers game...This game is MADE TO PLAY ONLINE, since the idea is that you make your own deck from the boosters that you get during the campaign. The problem is, that anyone CAN BUY SPECIFIC CARDS that you don't get on the campaign, making the online victory something harder an unfair. So if you like PAY MORE MONEY TO WIN, then this is a game for you!Campaign - The campaign is just a mess: there are about 16 matches, and then there is the final boss. The boss itself is not that hard, but after you win, you have to fight him again, and now he has better cards. On this new match, if you lose or restart duel, you go back again, and you have to fight the inicial boss again and then the renewed boss. This doesn't mean that the final boss is harder, it just means that you have to play more and more to win.Decks - everyone likes the idea of making your own deck, which this game has. You begin the game with choosing two colors (one main color and another to help it). The problem is that you keep this two colors till the end of the game, which means you have to win every game WITH ONE DECK. After winning a game you get boosters, but this system is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, because you'll encounter enemies that don't fit your deck - which means you'll play again and again till you're lucky with your cards and the enemy is unlucky with his.Final Boss and other game modes - since the magic 2012 that the final bosses are becoming easier and easier. This one is not hard, it's just plain stupid that you have to play him twice and win both times - it doesn't mean his hard, it just means that  if you don't get good cards, you have to start all over again. Apart from the 16 matches, you have NOTHING MORE. No TWO HEADED GIANT. No ARCHENEMY. NO CHALLENGES. NO GETTING NEW DECKS, JUST ONE DECK FOR WHOLE CAMPAIGN.This game is a step backwards in the saga...			"

												They have changed and improved a lot of things. Very pleasant to see. But as always when new nice things are going in, they are wasting old great stuff. I was very happy about playing this release until... I realised that ""Two headed giant"" mode was taken out of the game. Waste of time and money if your goal was to crash oppononets with your friend next to you.			"

												I don't like the trend in the latest Duels of the planeswalkers games (2014 and 2015).To sell boosters (sealed in 2014 and premium boosters in 2015) just feels greedy.I really miss the puzzles in the older versions of the game, why did they remove that?!I don't like the menus in the game either...What would make me happy would be if they relase booster draft as an expansion.. but then I only want to pay for expansion once.. not every time I want to play another draft!

												The reviews of Magic 2015, here on steam and throughout the interwebs, have been unanimously negative. I agree with the overall sentiment of said reviews, with special disdain for the increased amount of micro transactions sprinkled throughout the game. Every iteration of Magic since 2012 has had micro transactions as a way to decrease the amount of grinding necessary to unlock cards, but what's interesting about this iteration is that the campaign play-through, including completing every ""exploration"" for every plane will unlock most of the cards with very little grinding necessary thereafter. WotC has charged more for unlocking less. The plan, from my perspective, was to lock the player's deck choice, forcing battle after battle against AI opponents with powerful decks while utilizing the weakest form of whichever deck the user selected. The player then is confronted with two choices: sit through loss after loss (you'll lose a lot in the beginning btw) and slowly unlock cards through boosters (some of which may or may not have anything to do with your deck archetype) or pay 20 dollars to unlock every card available in a booster pack normally unlocked through winning matches. There are also cards that can only be unlocked by purchasing premium booster packs.What one gets from the purchase of Magic 2015 are the campaign, cards, and the ability to fully customize one's deck. Multiplayer has been severely truncated and only now consists of 1v1, 1v1v1, and 1v1v1v1. The removal of Two-headed giant was extremely disappointing to say the least, but I have recently learned that one team can only have a total of 4 of the same card. I don't know much beyond that when it comes to multiplayer rules governing the universe of magic however. Challenge mode has been removed as a category and implemented within the achievements. The issues is that instead of clicking on a challenge without having to worry about decks, one may need to rework one's deck to complete these challenges because specific cards must be utilized. For example, one ""challenge"" requires one to kill an angel with Shadowborn Demon. If you don't use a deck that includes black mana, you'll have to modify. Unfortunately, there is only 1 Shadowborn Demon card in this game, making the completion of this achievement based largely on luck and staying power (if the card is pulled late game). I use life-gain by default so I got lucky because I was able to build up enough life to withstand the onslaught; but most of the creatures cast by Avacyn are flying and if decks have no way of dealing with that, it will be a grind. The animation on every screen is terribly long. Choosing to go forward to another plane or back to the main menu is a chore because the animation cannot be overridden or skipped and it cycles through every choice before going to the first one. For example, if one wishes to go back to the main menu, by clicking ""Esc"", to play multiplayer, the animation will start at the end of the selection and work its way down to the first selection. Check the status of your card collection? That selection is close to the end, so one must wait until the animation completes, cycle to ""Card Collection"", click it, and wait as the animation cycles through the other choices (about half a second), load, and then display the card collection. All in all, what one is paying for is full deck customization. It's an extremely high price to say the least. It almost feels like a punishment; WotC gave us what we wanted but had to take back other things to justify the action.			"

												If you're new to Magic and you want to learn how to play, this game is fantastic on teaching you the ways of the basics and explaining what all the enchantments, auras, abilities, and everything else mean. This is coming from someone who had no idea what Magic really was until I played this game. Now I feel like an expert. The game runs you through every element (White, Blue, Green, Red, and Black) to make sure you get a feel for what each color specializes in. Then once you're about to complete the tutorial, it lets you choose what kind of deck you want to run with. And it's already pre-built, just for you, to ensure that you at least stand somewhat of a chance against the computer that knows what it's doing. Most of the time...BUT     If you're an experienced player and you want to play it with your friends and see what kind of awesome deck you can make with the newly-implemented pre-built decks, look the other way. The pre-built deck system is not quite what everyone else was hoping it would be as every deck combination you could possibly use starts you with a vast number of inferior cards. Of course, there's supposed to be weak cards in every deck, but these decks are built with cards that don't have a fine and polished pattern that work efficiently. I guess that makes sense knowing that every card combination, whether it be Red and Blue, Green and White, or Black and Blue, has many ways for you to customize them to your own liking and build your own kind of strategy.      But here's the kicker; the way you get cards is by beating people with a very unefficient deck. If you don't go with white, you're likely going to lose a lot. And the designers planned that. Because once you beat Avacyn, if you can because she's the final boss of the first plane in the campaign, there's an option for you to BUY CARDS. Seriously. I'm not kidding. You can waste $35 of your hard-earned money to get every card IN THE GAME. NOT in as every card in existence. Every card that was PUT INTO THE GAME. And it doesn't bother telling you that either.      Now there's two things that aggravates me about this: First, people who have a lot of money now have the ability to create a terrifying-powerful deck just because they have money. That ruins the experience of learning how to use what you're limited to and formulating your own unique strategy. Now they can use all the best cards and get bored with the challenges and regret their purchase because they wasted their money on a game they'll never play again. Secondly, for the people who don't have money all over their floors, they have to constantly beat annoying people with annoyingly polished decks that crush you if you don't draw all your good cards early in the game. Constantly. And even then, the best card they could get is something that doesn't fit well in any of their decks. The booster packs you earn for beating the snot out of the computer will ALWAYS give you defective cards that don't help your weak deck. And the worst thing about it, is that if you can't do anything but lose and you think you made the wrong choice for what deck you thought would be suitable for your playing style, guess what? You can't change it until you unlock all the cards that would be in the other pre-built decks, or if you reset your profile and risk losing all the cards you so painfully earned.      This game is almost able to classify itself as a pay to win game. You know, like those games on the iPod Touch where you have to pay to unlock certain things that you need in order to progress in the game. Now I haven't spent thirty-five dollars, but just because others fell for it, that upsets me. You're stuck, so you have to pay. Unless you have a lot of free-time at home, which I doubt, or you have the patience of a god. So in conclusion, only buy this if you have no idea how to play Magic and are interested in learning the fundamental concepts of Magic. Otherwise don't buy this friggin' game.			"

												THIS GAME IS A MICRO TRANSACTION SCAMIve been a fan of MTG Duels of the Planeswalkers since 2012 and up to this release Ive found them to be enjoyable.  However, the 2015 release is a scam.  This game has even fewer play modes then the 2014 release and most of the content requires microtransactions.  For $10.00 you get one very basic deck.  Going through the mundane campaign allows access to booster decks that will provide few to no additional deck building options and are largely made up of unneeded duplicates.  To get access to any of the advanced cards that themed decks are centered around you have to pay $2.00 per booster.  If i wanted to pay $100 for a playable game I would have bought the real cards.  I bought this product with the intention (based on previous editions) to enjoy the new content without having to commit the amount of money that the real card game requires.  Atleast the real cards have the possibility of some resell value.			"

Normal multiplayer was still there.The game itself is actually worse in terms of layout and speed then for example Duels 2014The annoying mist effect is not impressive.The hints with artwork shown in loading screens are too blotted because of the mist effect and are shown way too briefly.The music is ok, imo slightly less grating then in previous versions.However, yesterday the game completely froze and i had to restart my computer and now all my progress is gone.How the hell is something like this possible?TL DRprosdecent musicfree deck buildingconsapparently its possible to lose your entire progress without any fault on your own part.no other modes but standard magic multiplayerannoying layout, both slow and unresponsive at timesverdict:besides the free deck building dont bother with this one			"

												This is a no recommend because negative feedback is needed if the next insstallation of this game is to not make the serious mistakes this one did.Dont get me wrong, this game is fun. You get so many cards and the deck building is completely open unlike the past games, so its pretty cool. Having to pay for premium cards, thereby making this somewhat ofa  pay to win game really really bugs me, but it doesnt ruin the game, except for much of the random pvp, which if your like me doesnt affect you at all.Now for the bads:The User Interface is bad. All of it. This is not an overstatement, there is no aspect of this game's user interface that either is not buggy or is poorly designed (most of the time its both)There isnt much of a point in listing the bugs here because they are common and infiltrate nearly every aspect of this game's UI. Unfortunetly this occassionally screws you over in matches. So far ive had a mulligan that did not bring my new hand up so I can view the cards, and an inability to look at anyones' graveyard even when it should have come up automatically to choose a card from it. I encountered both of these within my first couple hours of play.Design wise, the best way to describe the UI is that every choice was made to make it look fancy and new happily at the cost of usability and ease of use. Pressing the start button when opening it has about a 3-5 second pause before the game reacts, with only about 1 second being the transition effect. Another thing to mention is that the AI is absolutely terrible and in no noticeable way improves from the previous games even slightly. Ive had duels where the AI did not pick up on the fact that one of my creatures could become flying easily due to its own ability, and instead it attacked with its only flying creature, leaving it defenseless from the air at about 2 health left.The only multiplayer options anymore are free for all 2-4 player, having removed 2v2 since 2014 and another gametype since 2013. 2v2 (which was called two headed giant) was the third most played gametype.This game is still fun so its not a terrible buy, but beware that you are going to have to endure many annoyances and that this game feels like it needed 7 more months to finish, with missed features and bugs, both serious and minor, that are exceedingly common.

												Recommendations can be a mixed affair. Would I recommend this game to me? Yes. It isn't expensive and I like the grind of playing through matches to collect all the card even more than multiplayer. I've enjoyed to some extent every release of the game. Would I recommend this game to any Magic: the Gathering player or gamer in general? No. The deck building option is the best feature of this game. Any card you have can now be put into any deck you want. And you can create any deck you want. You get more cards by playing games. A win gives you a booster pack of cards. Simple and it works well enough.Interface is one area where this game suffers. It's the best you could hope for a tablet game perhaps, but they didn't change it around for the PC. 'Lazy' is the word that comes to mind to describe this. It is frustrating to go through the UI knowing it could be much better for a PC. There are no other options of gameplay. The other games had Archenemy (very fun), Planechase (not so fun with computer at least), two headed giant (always nice). There is a huge format they haven't touched upon yet. Commander! My lord it is about time they made an EDH release for the game. There are several other options as well. They could have a booster draft options that use only cards in your collection. There is so much they could have done. I don't know why they sat on their hands in this.Another problem is that blizzard seems to want it both ways: charge to buy the game and charge for premium items. I know they need to monetize their product, but this is typically done through one or another. Not both. It feels lame that they keep trying. I hope none of you are buying that stuff. I'm guilting you if you are. You're encouraging bad behavior. In summary, the build your own deck model was a huge step forward for the franchise. They just made several small steps back as well. If you've bought every iteration of the game so far and enjoyed it, you will enjoy this one as well. Otherwise, this isn't exactly the polished product you want to pick up. "

												The idea behind building your own deck is great. Problem is you don't get enough cards to build a deck that has one full strategy. The Theros hero cards are a perfect example. Even though there a tons of the card in the game you only get enough to have half a deck with that strategy. At least in previous games your limited customization allowed you to have one solid strategy and synergy in your decks. 2015 disappoints on every level.			"

												Your money is better spent on boosters in Hearthstone (I wish I did). I bought the game but I don't get all the cards unless I pay even more for premium boosters, and yes most of those cards are very strong. The cards in the game are so random that making a true theme is impossible. 2014 had themed decks like equipment, auras, white weenie, and tribal like slivers, zombie, elves etc. Making a deck that has synergy in 2015 is very hard. DO NOT buy this game and try Hearthstone instead. Hearthstone is free and your able to get ALL cards without having to pay a penny.			"

												Not a great game, would recommend most of it's predecessors over this.Bought into my own hype seeing the trailers for 2015 after loving all the fun me and my friends have had with 2014 in free for alls and two-headed giant. Even went so far as to get the complete bundle so I could get right on down to the deck building,(and when it comes to the endless hours of fun I had in the prior installment this seemed like a small expense). I feel more than let down with this purchase. I'm not huge into the magic scene just a casual player of the video game versions, but the cards available to you in 2015 just arn't very fun. I'm too un focussed to come up with a better way to describe this, but let's just say the themes of samurai's eldrazzi and other such things were far more fun than a jumbled mix of cards to fit a theme previously done better. I can't coherently finish this review so this will have to be the end of it. Final words; WHY DID YOU REMOVE TWO HEADED GIANT? and what's with the micro transaction requirement to get more cards?

And in comparison, put bluntly this game is both a postive and a let down. The ability to finally have your own personal deck is great, even though getting your personal deck can take a lot of time. What they dropped the ball on is modes. They've the basic and just a base multiplayer. Again they've dropped the co-op modes, they dropped the two-headed giant, and still haven't brought back arch enemy.

												I've been a Magic player for 20 years now, almost since the very beginning. I love the card game, its intricacies and depth, which puts to shame other trading card games like Hearthstone at the moment. There's so much work behind each set, it's nothing less than amazing.Sadly, Wizards seems determined to destory all of their reputation with their DotP series, and this is one of the top fails.It is curious to me that throughout each and every iteration of DotP, I've felt as if the games were beta versions at best. They had an unfinished feel to them: as if they were not tested by actual players, but only by the developers blind to their own shortcomings. This game has exactly the same feel, but worse. The menus are horrible to interact with. They're slow, unresponsive, inelegant. The system and the game itself is slow even on my new computer, the AI is taking the wrong decisions, and the land tapping is messed-up so that whenever I want to cast a spell I have to manually adjust the lands being tapped, or the wrong lands would be chosen.Now compare this to Blizzard's Hearthstone slick inteface, their attention to every minute detail (even when you need to wait for online players to connect, there's a 'wheel of fortune' that revolves with good music, so that you feel like you're actually doing something), and their willingness to actually change the format by ignoring things like 'lands' and thus making the game less dependant on chance and shuffling than MtG. I used to think that Wizards could've made the DotP series much better, but they didn't want to because they simply don't want players to be hooked up on DotP as opposed to Magic Online. This is no longer the case, or not completely. For games as badly wrought out as DotP 2015, which 1st year design students (or anyone with skill...) could probably have designed better, I must come to the conclusion that Wizards just couldn't find someone competent enough to program it for them. Obviously, there is a management fluke somewhere here, and it reflects on what Wizards think of their audience. That's us.When somone in the street asks for my money and then screws me over, I will not buy from them again. When a company asks for money to create a game, and then provides me with a shabby, barely-coherent result, I will not buy from them again. And I do not see any reason to buy DotP 2016 (or for you, kind readers, to buy DotP 2015) before Wizards have shown their commitment to the player base and the game by fixing the huge, glaring problems with DotP 2015.Sad that I do not believe this will happen.

Over all game is really slow, campaign is scripted, multiplayer would probably be fun, but I don't have the time or patience to play through all of the tutorials and the first part of campaign. Also, once you choose your deck after tutorial, you are stuck with that deck until you finish the first part of the campaign. The game was made and designed for people who have no idea what magic is, and forcefully treats experienced players like idiots.Game is a solid 6/10, only reason it is that high is because I'm sure the multiplayer would be fun if you could put up with all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to get to play it.

Every time you go to a new screen, be it a menu, or selecting an option, there is a bright flash of white as the ""mist"" takes you there. There is nothing that tells you how unlocking new decks work. It takes you several hours of gameplay to unlock those decks, then there is no notification as to when you unlock them. The AI stalls a lot. The new combat graphic where the table opens up was cool the first few times, but it got annoying really quick.tl;dr+Nice look+Can customize decks properly finaly-Everything is cluttered and slow-No fun multiplayer games-No multiplayer lobby, have to reinvite over and over again "

After tons of hours of fun in Magic 2014, I decided to preorder Magic 2015, thinking it could only be better than the previous version. After only a couple of hours of play, I've come to the conclusion that Magic 2015 is a lot worse. There ARE some improvements compared to 2014, but overall this game is nowhere near as good as its predecessor.The goodFinally, proper deck building! You start the game out (after the tutorials) choosing a mana color, after which it gives you a choice of starting decks that are a combination of your chosen color with another mana color. The starting deck is not bad, it's at least enough to get started earning extra boosters by playing the game, improving your deck by playing.The deck builder actually works pretty well, giving you stats on the colors in your deck and how many cards of each color you have, your land/spell ratio and graphs on how many cards you have per mana cost, allowing you to easily optimize and save your decks.Very slick presentation, both in menus and ingameIt's MtG and plays as MtGCheap option for new players to get into MtG and see what it's all about without having to spend a fortune on booster packs (though you canif you want)The bad No fancy game modes or coop in multiplayer, just straight 1v1 or 1v1v1 or 1v1v1v1 free-for-alls, and no local multiplayer either. For me, especially the omission of 2HG is a big negative, seeing as that's pretty much the only game mode for me. The best cards are only in paid packs, making this more Pay2Win than it should. AI has a bit too much luck in having/drawing just the right cards that it needs Even though the menus and game look very slick, it slows down the game a bit too much. You can't just click on the menu option you want anymore, you have to scroll through the menu animations. Same with the table 'opening up' every combat phase regardless if you or the AI even does something there. All small delays, but these do add upIf you're new to MtG and want to try it out, i'd recommend going for one of the earlier versions instead, the only thing you'll miss is the deck building.If you played earlier versions, skip this and wait for 2016.

												Probably the worst dotp ever.The first thing i noticed was the white, so much white you'd think your playing mono white.THAT resolution, there are only two options 4:3 1024 X 768 and and 16:9 ----When you start the game your going to go trough some tutorials after that you get to chose betwen two color combinations and fight a ''boss'' for your promo(basicaly a rare whose color is dependent on what colors you chose) i chose Black and White,the cards i started whith were simple,but thats fine since this game is supose to introduse you to the basics of M:tg.The way you gain cards is by going trough the campaign and exploring planes(you unlock more by progresing the campaing)I played on Archmage(medium) dificulty, it was slightly harder than the other intalments for the sole reason of lack of sinergie early, what you get is basicly a bunch of comons that have litle to no sinergyI found the new U.I. much worse than previous iterations, its much whitch in turn means less space fore other fings such as the beutifull art on some of the cards.The final boss fight is bad, its like stainles can't make a fun and fair final boss fight, in 2013 bolas had moxes(Free artifacts that giff him mana), in 2014 it was to easy since chandra helped you, and here you have to beat him twice in a row and WHAT DO YOU GET?! Not a thing this was fine in previus iterations beackuse you did not have random bosters, but now it just feals like after all your hard work Sorin(who tells you GO STOP GARUK) could have atleast shown you some hiden treasure trove of cards(or atlest he could have apered and said THANKS BRO)STORY IS GO STOP GARUK(As you can see its an extremly emotional and commpeling story)All in all id say skip this one and buy duels 2013 or 2014			"

												No do not buy this game. There is no other fun mode such as planechase, two headed giant, archenemy or even sealed play and you get stuck with you chosen starter deck forever.At least with the other games you could switch between basic color decks for the different opponents, like a real player.  The green black deck I got stuck with had no synergy and the cards I was unlocking by slogging my way through the campaign were not even the right color. This game is a miserable faliure by WOTC.

												They really screwed this one up.You choose one deck and have to stick with it for the campaign. No switching at all, the cards are added 1-3 at a time when you win, sometimes being all commons, all uncommons, or all rares. You hope and hope that you get a color that matches, only to be let down each time.2 hours into the first campaign tree, and I've had enough. My deck (Blue/Red) was so underpowered and ridiculously put together (meaning, the default card combinations are a joke) that I still cannot beat the end ""boss"" of the first tree in the campaign.Do not buy this game. What a disappointment... especially compared to the 100+ hrs I have logged on Magic 2014. As I'm typing this, right below I see ""Buy this game as a gift for a friend.""

I cannot believe they would remove this game mode. There is only 2,3, or 4 player FFA modes with no teams apparent.The card unlock reward system has been replaced by boosters and to me this doesnt really translate well to the game. Having many varied premade decks in 2014 with 40 unlocks each for customisation allows more varied gameplay despite effectively being a restriction...next game..change deck..next game..change deck..no longer in 2015.

												Between the description of the game and DLC, I was lead to believe it would unlock additional cards not included in the base campaign. As it turns out, it only unlocks all the cards already in the campaign for free for you, after defeating the first chapter.I would not recommend the DLC or Special Edition.As for the base game, it does include an open deck editor. The problem is you don't really get much more customization then previous iterations of the series, So long as you are focused on one or two colors your options for synergistic cards aren't really much better than the old closed deck system (Re: Actually feels like less choices). In addition, you appear to be locked into a single deck after selecting a color at the beginning. This lead to a little frustration as the last fight in the first chapter included a hard counter to my choice and lead to several restarts before a victory was possible with the cards available.  Normally such a challenge would prompt me to switch to a different color deck, change my playstyle, and unlock more cards for a different deck. (In previous DotP games) however here I was forced to face roll and restart-mulligan my way to a cheap victory. And now if I want to switch to a different color, It appears I would have to do up to 60 random encounters to unlock all the cards I would want for the deck first, (At least I assume thats how it would work, I never got to unlock singles from exploring because of the DLC deception)In addition to this, its is impossible to complete the entire card library without dropping even more money on now RANDOM card packs as some cards are exclusive to Premium Packs available for $1.99 each. (12% of cards can only be bought) Buying new decks was acceptable in my books, but random cards? I would rather play physical magic or MTGO.The UI while stylish is a pain to navigate, you are unable to see all the options without scrolling through them one by one. Automatic land tapping is a joke, you have to turn it off and tap manually or it will lock out colors needlessly which wasn't an issue in previous games. The tutorial was much more in-depth this time around, but it felt very long even when skipping through all the dialouge and several times it missed easy damage or had sub-optimal plays that might lead less experienced players into bad habits.If you don't already own Duels of the Planeswalkers, I would probably buy a previous years version over this one.

												By far the weakest game in the series.  If you don't own the previous years, buy any of them instead.  This feels like half a game compared to them.  There is no Two Headed Giant, there is no special mode like planechase or archenemy.   The bosses have cool decks and you can continue to play against them as AI, but most of those cards don't seem to be in the set you can use so your own deck doesn't feel as interesting.  At least last year when they had sealed play there was the entire other side of things with the preconstructed decks, it feels like there should have been something like that here.It doesn't help that this year didn't offer anything new to offset the lack of a special mode.  You have a completely customizable deck, but all your cards are just randomely given to you from boosters.  I preferred getting a single card every time I won that was at least mildly useful to the deck.  Over time I could unlock all the cards that would make my deck better, but that's left up to chance or by paying money, and while I spent hundreds of hours playing last year's game this year doesn't seem like it will even hold my interest for the next few days.

												This game has potential, it really does. However the overall negative outweigh the positives. The core issues are mostly related to that it was designed for mobile first, and PC second. The UI, game play, and animations are all hindered massively by this.It has a very limited card pool of around 300 or so cards, and this leaves the possibility for designing viable decks pretty small.I enjoy playing magic, however this game has many bugs, I would consider it only if you are new to the series. 5/10** EDIT**After the Nov 4th update the game has been updated for the better, many of the key points were addressed. New cards have been added that changed up the meta of the game and the pricing structure was re done.I am updating my review to 7/10			"

												I'm honestly not sure why this game has gotten so many mixed to negative reviews. Perhaps they've updated the game since then to address some of the complaints it received. As a person who has played all of the PC MtG offerings from Steam, I think this one is BY FAR the most polished. The deckbuilding screen is fantastic with easy to use filters in a simple but aesthetically appealing layout that makes the system extremely user-friendly and satisfying. I read many complaints about menu speed but I don't have have any qualms with the menu at all. It's easy to navigate and it doesn't take long to load or jump from place to place once you know where everything is. And I don't have a fancy gaming PC, just a 5 year old desktop. I'm not really sure what people were complaining about there. I also read some complaints about how the game was overly difficult with starter decks. In fact, I read it so often in the reviews that I started out playing on the easiest difficulty because I was concerned about getting wrecked. However, this wasn't my experience either. I've played through all of Innistrad with the cards I got buying the basic game (as well as the boosters you earn as you beat the planeswalkers) and I'd say I have over a 75% winrate for games I actually played through (sometimes I'll just restart a challenge if the manascrew is too steep). For the sake of reference, I only have a moderate amount of experience with MtG but I do have some experience with other ccg's- most notably Hearthstone. So with about eight hours of playtime, I am quite satisfied with the purchase and I'm glad I didn't let the negative reviews scare me off. In my opinion, I've already gotten my money's worth (GoGo Holiday Sale!) and I've still got probably 80% more game to play.tl;drPros:- Aestetically appealing and highly functional deckbuilding screen. I can't overstate how much this is improved from previous installments.Neutrals:- Basically an updated version of the same format from previous installments. There doesn't seem to be anything new and exciting (beyond the deckbuiding being vastly improved). This isn't bad or good, it just is what it is. Cons:- The full screen mode does this weird thing where it messes up the second monitor I have for my desktop (it pushes whatever is displayed there halfway off the screen. Previous versions did too). When I play in windowed mode, it doesn't appear to have a size that is close to my full monitor size. It's not awful, but it's not ideal either.- I guess some people were complaining about the lack of puzzle challenges in this one as compared to previous installments; Unless that's somewhere in this version and I haven't gotten to it yet. I guess that would be a con too, although for me personally, I don't really care much about that feature.    So, my initial impression is that Magic 2015 is definitely worth the money. If you enjoyed the previous installments, you'll like this one as well. It satisfies the MtG itch without having to spend assloads of money on an actual card collection. If I run in to anything else that seems off-putting, I will come back and edit the review, but based on my expectations from having played the previous iterations of the game, this one has pleasantly exceeded my expectations.

												If you pay the $35 for this game, you will be paying to skip content. Winning games to unlock boosters is the whole point of DotP, so buying the complete version basically means you've wasted not only the extra money over the basic version, but also the money for the basic version. All. Your. Money. Wasted. The ""pick a deck, but you're stuck with it"" gimmick is bad design and the devs are bad for doing it. No preview of the decks, just a vague description that in my case was totally misleading. I chose Red->Black which was described as ""focusing on stealing your opponent's creatures and sacrificing them for fun and profit"". Yeah it was just a plain RB aggro deck with 2 Act of Treason and 2 vampires that could sacrifice creatures for a +1/+1 counter...in a 60-card deck. 4 cards does not a focus make. But that bad design was merely irritating, not game-breaking. I could live with it. The deck-building feature is good, it's about time that they added it. However, they didn't actually add it. They replaced all other features with it, for a net loss of game. Let's see what the trade off was for something that should have been a standard feature years ago:No more Two-Headed Giant, either co-op vs AI or multiplayer.No more Planechase multiplayer.No Challenge puzzles.No Sealed campaigns.Is all that worth it? Hell no.This is a blatant money-grab by Wizards, who clearly fear losing players from MTGO if they add too much actual gameplay here, which is completely stupid as the two games serve two different fanbases.I have nothing but disgust for the design decisions of this game. Definitely do not recommend.			"

												I'd first like to point out that the game itself, what little I could actually play of it, was actually a lot of fun but....When I got the game, didnt work. I'd start it up, get right to the main menu and it's close on its own.Mad but they did an update within a week and it started to worked for me. Yay? No.Then they did a second update or something and it stopped working for me again. None of the little tips and tricks are working for me to get it back up and running and I'm honestly pretty displeased with it all. I'd love to recommend the game to someone but it's really a hit or miss as to wether or not you'll even be able to start it up.			"

												I played all DOTP games. If i've to sum up all the hours I spent on the DOTP franchise i would probably reach 500 hours...said that after few hours of playing this new iteration of the game I can safely say that I regret my purchase.the main reason is the SUPER poor interface. It is the most irritating interface design I ever experienced in all my gaming ""career"". Worst thing is when you win/lose, a sudden white flash will blind you...what was the point of that?!also i experienced a nice bug about the screen resolution which can't be turned back to the original one...plus all the things that other people listed...i do not recommend it			"

												Magic 2015, a game I have looked forward to for quite some time, and showed great promise with having the ability to build completely custom decks and a card pool from sevral of the newer blocks, it saddens me to say however that in it's entirety the game is lack-luster and all in all a disappointment.The first thing you notice when you get into the game is that you have basically no choice but to go through the tutorial, granted you CAN skip most of it, but the final match is no choice you have to go through it, from there you get to choose a starting deck and go up against the final round of the tutorial, after that you can choose to change your deck for one of the other starter decks and do it  again, or continue into the main game, though be careful about this, because you won't be able to change your starter deck for a while after you leave.To unlock more cards you gotta win games, which will give you a booster pack that contain rand om cards from the plain set in which you just fought, so if you fought n the plain of innistrad you will unlok cards from the innistrad set.The main issue with this, is that the cards you get from them are random and might be useless to your current deck, to top is all off, there are cards you can only get out of the Premium Booster Packs, which you have to buy in the store, FOR REAL MONEY, even if you bought the most expensive special edition do you have to buy them, which is a frikkin Rip-Off, though not as much a rip-off as the 9,99€ those unlucky enough to not own most expensive Special Edition have to shell out for each of Card Collection.The campaign are extremly hit and miss, some of the matches completely and utterly demolish certain starter decks, for instance if you pick the black/red started deck you are going to be stuck on the final battle in Innistrad for quite a while, and you have to beat this battle to unlock your special edition content, I might ad, so if you where hoping having those would make it easier, think again, wheras others are so easy I literally never lost a single card, a perfect example of this are against a certain mission that pits you against your own deck, if you play a mill deck and put to Elixirs of Immortality in, you can't loose, it might take some time but the AI are basically programmed try to bash you to death, so a Wall mill deck (using the wall humunculi and the myriad of other Blue defender cards, will leave the A.I literally incapabale of doing anything, throughout my entire game the AI smashed me for 12 damage, cuss I simply dind't feel like blocking as I knew I would win, and milled 6 cards using Hedron Crab.So the variance of the matchups are hit and miss, which is slightly annoying, but what really ticks me off is that there are so many cards programmed into the game we probably will have to shell out coin for later, even though they are already in the game itself, the final boss of Innistrad uses cards you do not have acess to at all, they are not even listed in the card collection, so if we want them it's probably DLC.The card pool contains many cards, sure, but there are so weak and unfocused absolutely no way to build a themed deck out of them, want to build a goblin deck? there are about 5 diffrent goblins in the entire game, and none of their lords, want to use elves, same problem only that there are about 3 diffrent ones, milling? hope your not looking for Traumatize or Mind Funeral, cuss they aren't in the game either, Artifacts, let me be blunt, there are a grand total of 2 Artifact creatures in the entire game, one of which is a Defender. infact the best deck I have been able to construct after nearly 6 hours of constant building and testing are a burn deck, and that's solely because most of the critters in this game tend to be glass cannons unless you want to go above 6 mana in cost, you really know the card pool is weak when Shock can kill most of the critters you get in the starting decks without any assistance.Meanwhile the Campaign features fun decks like Allies, Demons, Slivers and Soldiers and other such highly focused highly effective decks, which you have to beat with the deck you build from this junky card pool, it does make it more challenging, sure, but it also makes it frustrating, knowing YOU  could have been using those cards instead of whatever you have managed to claw out of your Boosters.The Card-pool issue gets even worse by the fact that they put out cards that are meant to be used in such specific decks but have so few cards to go along with that they simply can't work, a perfect example of which are Vent Sentinel, which you would use in a Defender deck, most Defender creatures are in blue in this game and they support a Mill strategy much better than a burn strategy, infact Vent Sentinel is the ONLY red defender in the game.To make matters even worse is the fact that green is all but unplayable on it's own, green has a ton of stompy creatures, don't get me wrong, but in total there are only 2 sets of cards that can accelerate your mana, first of which is Cultivate, and the other is the elf that puts a basic land from your han onto the field when you summon it, there are Travelers Charm, which puts land into your hand, but that's it.While you do have Meteor, or if your lucky enough to score a Darksteel Ingot out of the Premiums you will have some more mana acceleration, but those aren't exactly viable since Ingot are a Rare card and Meteor costs 5, and have to be gotten from Theros Boosters, which are the halfway point of the campaign.Then we have the game modes for single and multiplayer outside the campaign, we have 2-player Duel, 3-Player Duel and 4-player Duel, that's it... no puzzles, no special game modes, no special campaigns or anything of the sort, what it DOES sport is a store locator, which is useless if your not into the physical card game, a Leaderboard, which, considering how weak the card pool is are also pretty useless, and a Gallery.The games story, what little there is, are OK I guess, mothing super but nothing flat out bad either, though the ending was a bit... wierd, not sure what was up with that.Multiplayer.... well it's what you expect right now, those who bought the most epxensive special edition and as of such have all the cards can easily produce decks that stomps those who dare try to be casual and no-pay-standard-edition about it, good ol' pay-to-win in other words, I suspect this will improve once players finish up their card collections the hard way, or break down and buy them in the store, but until then, I would actually suggest staying clear, not fun having a starter deck when your oponent are using a deck that actually has atleast a wee bit of streamlining behind it.And then there is the forced tutorials, while you CAN skip the gameplay tutorial, aside from the final battle of it, which you choose your starter deck in, the tutorial for the deck builder are unskippable and starts automatically the first time you enter AND a 2nd tutorial starts once you defeat the final encounter in Innistrad, the first Campaign Zone, and you have no choice but to go through both if you actually want to build your deck, but do NOT click too fast during it, or the tutorial will bug out and freeze, forcing you to ALT + F4 the game and restart the game, which will force you to watch it all over again.Addendum:Hit-and miss campaign, no extras outside it, weak card pool and pay-to-win multiplayer, I really wish I could recommend this game, but I really, REALLY can't, do yourself a favor, stay clear until it goes on sale or something, this is simply not worth it, trust me.

												This is the worst magic game ever made! Please dont waste your money, start off with 1 really weak deck which makes it pretty much impossible to get throught the campaign. Soon gets really frustrating and boring playing with the same weak deck.I was a big fan off previous magic games but this 1 is a complete waste off money, stick with previous magic games this 1 is not worth anyone's time.Pro's:           The game can be DELETED!!!Cons:          The entire GAME!!!

												There are some faults.  It should be noted that this is my first DotP experiance but I've been playing paper MTG for a while.  There are some issues; it's slow and sometimes the AI cheats and does things that aren't legal.  For example, I was playing against the Kor deck and lost to my opponent ""Kicking"" his creature to make it unblockable for lethal (I had like 4 blockers for his 2 creatures and the creature he ""kicked"" had been in play since the 3rd turn - it was about the 8th turn at that point so legally it shouldn't have happened as ""Kicking"" is an entering play ability - SUPER ANNOYING and I would have won the next turn had this not occured).  It wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't the kicked creature that then attacked and killed me.I like that you can create your own deck but dislike that it has such hash restrictions like only being able to play 1 of each Mythic, 2 of each rare and 3 of each uncommon.  It's particularly annoying when the bosses tend to have such a tempo advantage against you anyway as they're running Tropical Islands and Bayous, etc. against my crappy Guildgate lands.Anyway, I've just completed the single player game playing a GW Token deck.  The only really difficult games I came accross was the Mirror guy (playing my own deck against me only with insanely lucky hands) and Garruks' game 1 (who just drew perfectly every game).  Its a bizzarre system, I lost a few rounds to decks that seemed impossible then I'd rematch and they'd flip to being almost too easy! That's MTG I suppose.			"

												Literally, the worst M:TG game to date. First you are forced to choose your colors... Which is ok in some ways, if this afflicted your boosters you earned or just gave an increase to those colors in card from boosters... But, no. it is YOUR deck. It is your predetermined deck through the campaign. Basically a deck you need to farm for since most initial decks suck♥♥♥♥♥ You will be raging at the pitiful♥♥♥♥♥♥you have to play from till you either farm cards or hopefully get lucky.Second, the UI is awful. I like graphic upgrades, but why do it to the menu? It takes twice as much to load up now and get into the game and the Ui to choose whan I want to do in game takes 3 times as long with me having to ""scroll"" to where I want to go. Why change the UI from the M""TG 2014 game with the ""easy to see all options"" menu of M:TG 2014? We are not playing this game for the graphics... Just going to throw that out there.Lastly, The game seems to ""up"" the challenge incampaign mode by just being forced into one deck. Oh, sure, you can change it after farming enough cards anyways... But you have to farm... You took away my joy of picking a deck I thought would win and counter my opponent. It was easy, yes.... But I had to think and realize which deck would be best for each campaign challenge and tailoir my deck to it. Now it's just ""restart duel"" till I get an ok hand and hope the computer does not cheat with 3 life gain cards, of the same name, in a row near the end at 2 hp while they still have 45 cards left in the deck.I can feel the need to up the challenge of campaign... But I play this game for fun as no one around me in real life plays much M:TG anymore. You are taking much of that away by forcing colored decks through out.			"

												A frustrating single player makes this game hard to recommend.The AI in the campaigns mostly uses decks which are almost all creatures that buff each other, which is unintersting and makes for a dull grid to unlock news cards.Futhermore you _must_ complete a portion of the single player campaign before you can even have a multiplayer game with your friends.There are at least less bugs than in previous incarnations of the game.

ANd YET they are giving us nothing new each year I will never spend money on this and Please dont either !!!!after so many years they added option to create your own deck , enormous job! i can imagine how much time and resources it took to program that.I dont like to be rabbit runing after  carrot on stick. Sad thing is that so many people will buy this . You gusy (WotC) earnign much and same time losing a lot more just becouse you are lazy and want easy money, no thank you .pls thumbs up if you are disapointed same as I am and real fanboy of Magic card game that is in wrong hands these days in my opinion.  Manu is awfull, i can understand that this is for tablet but it doeanst work for PC . Seems that they dont need well polished game >  who cares if they are working on 2016 version now so.Scrolling for desired option take ages, you need minutes not seconds , minutes to start game ...... beeing sarcastic.  I really dont care about achievements , this is just another useless stuff i would do just by playing game it is just boring idea not something that entertain me. Nothing new , copy paste ideas , bag full of trash.  Unlocking new avatars? what for ? they dont add anything to play ... unlocking avatar could enchant gameplay visual style or something.  You shuld have atleast option how to reach Garuk , atleast two ways , this game need some real campaing with options off loseing card s (in campaing only) and  have impact on fabular events. If you lose you still have option to get to him but in different way, all of your WINS nad LOSES are part of you adventure , not some simple try again button ,.....   Give something so this Fabular aspect of game can take its first breath. Dont you  red any of MTG books?  Art style and animations are just normal , they dont add much .I feel its for kids not for me old fan boy with all these cheap low cost events.I bought this game and played long just to find something that will surprise, i needed that ! after many years of same game just with different cards.If they only want virtual version of magic without shandalar world like in 1998, they really should put some effort and create entertaining ideas, gameplay different styles a real Campaign .  I am not against microtransaction , you can have my money but give me something worth this money.I could pay em if i see they really puted efort in this game.			"

												OK, I confess, I like Magic.  But these games are set up in a way that drowns out the fun while accentuating the worst parts of the game.  I would love a game where you could build a deck out of a reasonable (and growable) selection of cards and play through a single player campaign.  Instead, once again, you get to sort of slowly uncripple a few boring decks (or just get started with a sealed deck and have that mini-campaign end before it gets at all interesting).  All the pieces are here to do have a great game, but they won't put them together.I assume they've purposefully avoided giving me the game I want, in order to protect their ""other"" Magic game, MTGO or something... but I really wish they could find a business model that somehow works for them while also letting us have something reasonable and a reasonable time+money cost.

												Huge step backwards in the DotP series. I do like the option to create your own decks wich has been a request from the fans for a long time. Unfortunately, Wizards has executed this the worst way possible. The pay wall. Seems to me there are a small selection of base cards which can be unlocked through winning matches in the game. There is another pool of cards called ""Premium Cards"" which can only be unlocked by microtransactions of 1.99 per booster. I have been a huge fan of the DotP series since the first one and 2015 is a huge disapointment. On top of the pay wall issue it seems the card selection is misleading. At first it sounded like all of the cards from the last few sets would be available for deck building. That does not seem to be the case here. Only some selected cards from each set are available. They also removed two-headed giant which was a huge draw for me as these games gave me a chance to partner up with friends who live far away and play games against others. 3/10			"

												While I was highly anticipating this game, the final product really left alot of be desired.Clunky interface that was clearly designed for tablet / touch interaction - lazy console port anyone?Noticably shorter campaign and the lack of 2HG is definitly something to factor in as well in terms of R.O.I.Lack of playable cards utilised within this set that are easy to program in rather than including strong staple cards that are actually fun to play with.The pool list is very underwhelming to say the least. While many are rejoicing the the fact that decks are now able to be completly customised, the ability to do so is only as good as the options you are given...which in most cases is extremly lacking.Unless Wizards plan to release many free dlc packs, I would not recommend purchasing this.Hell if Wizards are charging as much as they are and continue to do so under this business model, I would say go and download a cracked copy of it.

												This version of Magic is better than its predecessors in many ways, with one glaring exception.  Each version of Duels of the Planeswalkers has forced users to suffer through worse and worse menu systems and this version is no different.  In fact, this version has given up all pretext of usability.  I cannot recommend this version because navigating through the menus to get to play the game is simply too painful.  Rather than display 6 available choices one can click on (or even better use keyboard shortcuts on), on must suffer through animations to toggle highlighted options.  One can't even see all the options available at once becuase non-highlighted options are mysteriously clouded or just not displayed.I hope the next version is more user friendly.			"

												Unless they fix some of the features, this seems like a vast downgrade from the last game, sadly. The starting decks are extremely weak and less fun to play than any of the previous entries in the series. No local co-op, or just co-op in general. I miss Two Headed Giant. :(No more puzzles, no more planechase, no more sealed campaign...why remove all of these features  Wizards? Only things really improved are the UI in duels, and the addition of deck building, which should have been in the game long ago. Forces you to complete the tutorial to play the game, and forces you to complete the first campaign missions to play multiplayer.Can't see myself sinking too many hours into this game compared to the others.5/10 :/			"

												This game is terrible out of all the PC versions of the game. I wish I never had bought such a vile thing. They want you to bleed out all your money on it just so you can skip the grind and hopefully get a decent card.They stripped many of the features of why I even bother with these games such as two headed giant and planeschase.I like how they want you to make your own deck but they DO NOT give you enough cards or options to unlock more decks effectively.  The cards you end up earning by grinding are terrible compared to the cards the ai get to use against you. It will ALWAYS be a massive uphill battle with these terrible cards and starting decks you have. This is the worst buy I had all year and I really wish I didn't preorder. I won't be buying these games anymore after this massive trainwreck. The game creators don't deserve the money I spent on this game but they deserve a terrible rating instead.			"

												Summary:I can only recommend this game to you if you're a real Duels Of The Planeswalkers fanatic and can't live without the next installment. Other than that I feel like you'd probably be disappointed.The Rest:As an avid player of the previous 3 games in the series, I was hugely looking forward to this being released. I enjoyed the sealed deckbuilding in Magic 2014, and looked forward to having even more freedom with my decks in 2015. But having now played it, I feel that Magic 2015 is trying too hard to be Hearthstone, and without all the diverse prebuilt decks (not to mention the Two-Headed Giant and Challenge gamemodes) it gets pretty boring after only 5 hours of play, and probably less than that for some others. For me personally that's roughly 1/20 of my recorded playtime on any one of the previous three games, and I could probably still go back and play those some more.With the complete lack of anything more to do now that I've finished the main Campaign mode, I have to say that it feels more like a demo or an early-access game than a full release title. It wasn't worth the money I spent preordering it, and it certainly isn't worth spending any extra money on Premium Booster Packs.I hope that Wizards Of The Coast listen to my review, and others I've seen here on Steam, and bring out some sort of update for the game to bring back the long-term fun of the previous games. When they inevitably bring out an Expansion Pack and/or Deck Packs (or card-pool equivilents to Deck Packs) I will think twice about bothering with them this time around unless they make some big changes.Maybe I'd see it as a better game on it's own, without having to live up to the previous games in the series. But unfortunately Wizards Of The Coast didn't have that luxury, and they've left this Magic: The Gathering fan feeling pretty much done with the Duels Of The Planeswalkers series.			"

												Recommendation - Pass with the might of a thousand passesThe words I want to use when describing this game are unsuitable for children, the elderly, the pregnant, those with a heart condition, and people with sensitive ears.I have not raged this hard at a game since I was a kid, playing the arena mode of Armored Core. If it were not for me having already unlocked the multiplayer, my desk would be split in half and pieces of my mouse would be embedded in the drywall for how hard I would have smashed the ""delete local content"" button.The reason for my rage is the single player campaign. Put simply, it is god-awful. It is terrible. It is horrifically unfair and completely stupid. You will have the bone-stock vanilla uber-generic weak deck up against ridiculously powerful enemies. You will lose and lose and lose and lose unless you just happen to start with a great hand AND your opponent simultaneously gets a bad one.Let me know if the following scenario sounds fun: You go to the local game shop where Magic players gather, you buy a $10 starter deck, and then sit down to battle a pro-level player who has a masterfully-built multicolored deck filled with holographic, prismatic, epically-rare legendary creatures.Sound fun? NO!?? Well, gasp and shock! OH, UNKNOWABLE UNIVERSE! I would have to take off my shoes to count how many things I would rather do than slog through that garbage. I'm honestly having more fun typing up this review than I did playing that stupid campaign.You might be thinking ""well just play multiplayer!"" and you're right, to a point. The multiplayer can certainly be fun (assuming you're against a player with a similarly-terrible deck), but unfortunately, YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE CAMPAIGN TO UNLOCK MULTIPLAYER!!! 4 tough battles, one of whom is a boss.Magic is a multiplayer game. Magic has ALWAYS been a multiplayer game. The card game version has never been anything BUT a multiplayer game. Before the elctronic version, it was literally impossible to NOT play with other people. So kudos to the devs for locking the main feature that the game was built around and that 99% of all players want behind hours and hours of campaign-fueled frustration and nonsense.The multiplayer is fun, but the rest of the game is terrible. There are SO many other card games to play with friends (many of them free) that unless you can pick this game up for a couple bucks or you have a superhuman amount of patience, don't even make direct eye-contact with it.

												Duels of the Planeswalkers finally gets deckbuilding, but at what cost? Slow, unresponsive UI, a starting experience that is frustrating because you are forced into playing with mediocre cards for hours, and a shockingly overt pay-to-win structure where lots of good cards are locked behind Premium Boosters that you can only buy with real money. Lack of puzzles is also a large disappointment for me. All in all, I would recommend staying away from this, even as someone who enjoys Magic regularly and has been buying the Duels of the Planeswalkers series annually.			"

												I have really enjoyed the Magic 2012/13/14, upon hearing that we could have fully custom decks i thought, great, but the truth of it all is, the game has basically become pay to win, if you want to compete in mutiplayer, you will have to be a premium buyer otherwise you have no chance, which is fair enough for the developers i understand, but im not prepared to pump money into it, its already at £30 gbp for premium, game only been out for a month, by month 2 could cost another £10 etc etc, (speculation ofc) still gutted myself so on that side of things it gets a non recomendation from me.

												One step forward, two steps back.If i would have to to describe the newest literation in one sentence, this would be it.On the positive side, deck building is finally introduced, which isnt as great as it sounds though, as the card pool is very small and contains many useless cards as well, which makes it incredibly hard to build a synergising deck.On the negative side, this game uses the same source code as every year, which means that all the bugs, downsides and annoyances are presented again, and that the game is as poorly developed as ever.Additionaly, there is no 2HG (2vs2) mode anymore, which was the funniest way to play the game in the previous versions.And finally, the price for the complete bundle has significantly increased, by introducing microtransactions of 30$ total, which you will have to pay in order to have access to all cards in the game. (The ""complete edition"" does not include those cards btw).I wouldnt go as far to call it a pay2win game, but it is a great disturbance for sure.Concerning the community, it is better than i expected, which means that the most players do not behave too badly. However, there lurks a die-hard fanboy called ""GoodRiddance2HG"" in the forum, who is poisoning almost every conversation with his presence.Be sure that he will start a war with everybody that dares to say anything negative about this game or magic in general. - Every - single - time - !And as there is much reason to discuss the game, and as there are many different oppinions, his rude posts spam the whole forum, which made me stop using it any more.I seriously do not need such a person in my life.All in all, i have lost interest in this game far, far faster than with the previous version, where i played about 200 hours, and in general, have gotten tired of paying every year for basically the same game.

Posted: August 22, 2014
												I am a long time Magic player and I have played all of the Duels games released so far.  This is the third of the games that I have purchased on Steam, and let me tell you it is a disappointment.  The card collecting is nothing like the the previous installments.  There's virtually no replayability in single player unless you really want to dedicate the time to opening enough random cards that you may actually collect each one.  And even if you collect each card, what will you do with them?  The pool is so weird and scattershot in terms of mechanics and card quality that it's just silly.  Multiplayer is a joke, as in everyone else is also limited to this strange selection of cards so games end up usually uninteresting and just waiting for someone to draw that bomb.  It has no point.I must also mention the aesthetics of the menus.  It's 2014 as I write this , and maybe it's a bit cliche to state, but holy moly talk about dated looking menus.  It's like navigating a flash-based website circa the year 2001 complete with unwelcome dissolve animations and unacceptable load times.  Yes that's right, I hope you enjoy menu screens because you're gonna spend a lot of time trying to get around in an ugly and clunky system.  Not to mention the layout and navigation of the game screens, which for some reason change every year.  I don't get it, isn't this designed with controller support in mind?  Why is everything such a pain to navigate with a controller then?  And why is it that using a mouse instead is somehow no better?  Everything about this seems like it was designed by 15 year olds, no joke.  It's a whole lot of ""Wouldn't this be cool?"" instead of what it should be, which is ""Shouldn't this be seamless and functional considering this is the fifth version of this game we've put out?""I honestly regret buying this game, especially at full price.  Yeah I've put some time into it but just in the hopes that it will become fun.  It has not.  For what it's worth 2014's ""sealed"" mode was a huge letdown coming from the point of view of someone who plays MTGO exclusively for the limited tournaments.  But you know I've sunk a lot of downtime into 2014 because the theme decks were fun, and there's a concrete goal of unlocking the next card for that deck and figuring out how to tune what you have into not only playable but just downright fun decks.  2015 has no such charm.  It's a complete step backwards in the series, there is absolutely no improvement in this version over the previous versions.  They had a single good idea -- custom deck building -- but top to bottom this game is executed poorly and not worth your time or money until it gets some very deep discounts.  If I can just convince one person to trust me and spend their money elsewhere that'll be good enough for me.			"

												First must point out the game itself can be fun, but up to a point.Winning packs in multiplayer play was fun, but then you no longer get packs for wins.Game loses it playability once you are left with just the collection you own. The cards you can't have unless you join the pay-to-win players. You can tell a play-to-win player. Expect mana ramp,Eldrazi and Static creature pumps. So there tokens end up being 2/2 or 3/3. If you played the game you know how many token spells there are in this game.Game crashes when leaving a duel and stalls menus.Everyone mentions the interface as being bad. You need to scroll through and back through various menus to change decks and and to select differnt games.I do not suggest buying this game for people. Stick with the previous games. Nothing been improved only given a new shine.As a last note it should be known the card draws in this game are broken. I have plenty of screenshots showing messed up draws. I call it a duplicate glitch. You will draw the same cards over and over again.Opening hands will have sets and through out the game you will draw nothing else.			"

												I do enjoy this game, and for the $10 price tag it is worth the price. The reason I can not recommend this game is because there is an entire category of cards hidden behind a paywall. These premium tier cards are stronger than the default and hidden behind a paywall. Really starts to make multiplayer feel more, pay to win than it should; you will be less competative in multiplayer if you do not purchase some of the premium cards. I prefer the way Hearthstone goes about this.Another complaint is that the deck you choose to complete the tutorial with is the only deck you will be playing with for a long time; lets hope you make a good choice.With all of this said, it is not a bad game and I will continue playing it, but I feel that it was a very bad move to have a special pay-only card tier.

												I'm giving this a bad review simply because of the atrocious menues. If you want my opinion of the game itself, it's Magic. It's no different from any of the years before it besides the card library.=======================================================================================The intro is simply annoying. It plays the same whispering wind four times in a row for each of the devs or publishes and their alienware advertisement (because I need top of the line equipment for a digital card game) before finally getting to the intro custscene which repeats the same whispering wind. This one, you have to sit through a few seconds before being able to skip it. We then hit the Start screen where the player is prompted to click start. There is then a two second delay before the fog ever so slowly begins to engulf the screen and take me to the main menu.I know this sounds like nit-picking but the menues are beyond awful to navigate. Rather than a standard push button menu or even a left and right option, it's uses a front/back layout so you can see the icons for the options behind your current selection, but the icons are just card portraits. How am I to know that ""Dictate of the Twin Gods"" is ""Restart Battle"". How about a clock or a back arrow or a curved arrow or something to symbolize restarting. Anyone familiar with the card will tell you that the card has nothing to do with reversing time either, the icons are simply arbitrary to look pretty leaving you to one by one, scroll through your options one by one and read the text underneath until finding what you want. Oh and guess what. The lingering fog is back.Even if you do happen to manage to memorize the icons, it doesn't make enough of a difference. The one you're on is selected and focused, you cannot see any options you have already passed and any yet to come forward are out of focus and slightly to the right so you can easily click on them. Guess what, it doesn't matter. I can see that icon in the back and I know it is the one I want to click so I'm going to click it but it only shuffles over once to the next option forcing me to click four times just to open the option I want to get to.2014 gave me a loading screen inbetween menues that lasted maybe a full second at most. I have a 4 gigahert processor, it loaded and then the game started. That's it. Quick and simple.The game itself has become increasingly annoying as well. The table pulls itself apart like an antique dining table that has an optional insert every time your attack phase comes up and it makes this god awful clang of a forge when it does this. This all happens regardless of whether or not you are attacking. And guess what. That whole nonsense takes another three seconds per turn.=======================================================================================In the end, I used to play M14 to kill a few minutes while waiting for my friends to finish whatever they were doing so we could all play the same game. This terrible design couple with these nuisences have ruined that for me as I spend more time looking at WotC's pretentious smoke effect than actually playing the game. Do not bother with this purchase, just buy the movie ""The Fog"" instead. You'll get about as much entertainment out of it.			"

I expected more out of the game and the hype was too much for this game. I paid $34 for this game which is more then any other dotp even with all the dlc and im feeling like I have less to do.

												I realy love maigc. but thay broke the game, removing all the fun parts of the game just to add one deck builder dos'nt woth it.The starter decks are weak with no fun cards like the old games. and you have to grind a lot to try and get some good cards.and removing all the co-op and fun modes from the multiplayer realy killing the game.

												I've enjoyed and overlooked the errors in previous versions/years of Duels of the Planeswalkers, but 2015 sort of jumped the shark for me.a)  Don't buy the premium bundles that include all the cards of various planes.  As soon as you do, the game stops giving out the booster packs for that particular plane.   A lot of the fun just drained from the game at that time.b) The game cheats.  Playing through the entire series I never saw the computer muligan.  Never fought it where it had a flood or a drought of land.   This became particuarly evident when fighting the sliver deck as every game.  *every game* I played of the 20+ times to get past it, they had 3 different mana colors by turn 3.  Perfect curves.    Yes, I know this is necessary for AI's to stand a chance against humans but it still rankles when it's so damn obvious.c) The new layout is not convenient.   I'd much rather look at options and navigation on one screen then have to slide through a whole bunch of other options first.   This lay out seems designed for phones where a swipe of the finger is more convenient than the click of a mouse.   If you're on a PC it's just tedious.d) The card choice is poor of the cards given.  Yes there are some good cards and some favorite cards, but the cards that become available to build your deck are mediocre at best.   Nor do they allow you the cards that their own decks are built.   This causes (at least me) to feel like I've been given stone-and-stick tools to face foes outfitted in iron.   It's another means of giving the AI a necessary boost to make it competitive.   It still feels lame.   e) The auto-adjust of land is either on or off.  In 2014 I could put my deck together and click on ""suggest land"" and then tweak as I want.   In 2015 you can either accept what MTG2015 says you should have or you have to do it manually.   This wouldn't be so irksome except that to change the option to auto-adjust you have to leave the deck building screen, find the settings, make the adjuistment, and return to the deck building screen.f) I'll say it again:  Don't buy the expansion card sets that just give you all the cards.   It really did ruin a lot of the fun.I played 2014 all through 2013 and up to release of 2015.   I'll probably play 2015 whenever an expansion comes out but to be honest it just doesn't inspire the urge to continue playing.   Even with the chance to build my own deck, I feel like the mediocre decks I can manage just don't warrant excitement.Buy for the 9.99.  Don't spend much more on this and be happy updating the included decks with whaterver wheat you can seperate from the dross of the booster packs.			"

												I despise leaving a bad review and I've tried to make the issues I have with the game work out, but still I feel like I've wasted the game money as well as a Ravnicka Pack worth of money.   If you can save the few bucks from reading this then I've done my job, with tweaks this game would be ok ish at best.      There is a feature when you are just getting started which is absolute crap whatever deck you pick at the start you are stuck with apparently, and by start I mean your forced tutorial.  You can skip everything but the last fight, but when you win that deck you won with is yours for the forseeable future.  I played a black / blue deck just for fun for testing purposes, bought the ravnicka pack loaded the game, now the store says I bought it ( in the menus ) but the card collection and deck builder have no cards... excellent work and you can change the cards from anything other than blue / black at this point anyway.   80% of my aggrevation lies here, but it's not the end.     There is a lovely attempt at a smooth transition when switching menu's billowing smoke or some delay of a few seconds between your mouse click and the desired action.  I get it, when I click a button I expect immediate if not sooner results, so when i click a button and can walk to the kitchen get a drink and sit back down and it's loading the options menu because of design not computer performance I get aggrevated.       The system of knowing what is checked and what isn't checked in the options menu's is also hit or miss, you may have something on or off ie: auto hold, auto land etc but wheather the white city colored in is on / off is up for grabs cute idea, but in the end not great, I dont like to guess especially with your attempt at transitions between clicks and effects are so paused makes changing a setting a few minute adventure of did that just take effect or not.     The sad part is I've played other versions of this and I really enjoyed the game, so when i saw this was out I scooped it up without thinking and bought a pack just to kick start my adventure.  Not sure if things changed in the management or deployment of wizards on the coast, but something changed and it's not for the better.  Future things from them will be watched by me from afar before being picked right up.  Just keep it in mind when they release a game watch some gameplay footage, check youtube.  Game feels clunky and unfinished will make a video for this and edit the post later pointing out my issues. "

												After all the problems DotP 2014 had, I was really hoping that the devs had taken a step back and rectified the issues with it (deck construction locked into Sealed mode, bad challenges, restrictive campaign, etc.). Instead we get a barebones version of MTG that does everything wrong that it possibly can. Problems are apparent right when you start up the game; the UI is slow and heavily animated, obviously being designed for a touch screen interface. Instead of being given 1-2 prebuilt decks like in the previous two annual releases, you are given a choice between deck archetypes. However, you have no idea what cards are actually inside your deck before you lock in to using that ""Intro Deck""-strength deck which can really screw you over at the start of the game. For example, I picked a supposedly B/G Reanimator deck but the only reanimator card in it was Rescue from the Underworld (a high costed, slow reanimator that requires saccing a creature as an additional cost). Because you are picking an archetype and not an actual deck, you also don't get unlocks specifically for your deck; while this gives you more freedom in deck construction, new players will be baffled about what they should add to their deck or how to edit it properly. A ""Suggested Cards"" tool is available but it isn't very trustworthy; using it with my best deck (G/W tokens), two of the three recommended cards are Phytotitan and Pelakka Wurm.While you can finally build your own decks with DotP 2015, you will really struggle to put something playable together without buying cards for real money. Buying all the cards in the game will cost you $20 and individual ""planes"" of cards will cost you $5 each. If you could just drop $20 on unlocking everything in the game you would be looking at spending only $30 total on DotP 2015. Of course, it isn't that easy... many of the best cards available (including Stoneforge Mystic, Doubling Season, Kozilek, and more) are locked behind ""Premium Boosters"" which give you 10 random cards for $2 (physical boosters in Standard cost between $2-4 and have 15 cards each). Last year's gambling mechanic was bad but it was only restricted to the Sealed Deck mode. DotP 2015 has essentially become Pay2Win with these boosters because the cards inside can be used in any game mode, including online.Speaking of online play, there barely is any! 2-Headed Giant has been removed for no reason and no other game modes have been added. You can only play 2-4 player FFA with your custom built decks; no Archenemy, no Planechase, no new modes. With the addition of deck construction and the rise of popularity in Commander/EDH, it is really disappointing that even that wasn't added.The only good thing that I can say about this is that they finally added non-basic lands. Deck construction is a nice touch finally but the rest of the game has suffered for it. It seems that in order to release the same game on every platform they had to cut content to make it work on mobile devices. DotP 2015 has a tedious, boring, and grindy single player campaign, no Challenges, no multiplayer modes outside of FFA, and no tools to introduce new players to MTG except for the tutorial. This is the worst DotP game made yet (even worse than the original DotP which was removed from Steam) and not even fans of the series should bother with this blatant cash grab.			"

												As a MTG card collector, gamer and fan. I have to say. This game is not something u would want to buy if u have experience with Magic the Gathering. MTGO is a far superior game compared with this game. However for the more unexperienced players and the ones new to this card game, the game is an awsome starters guide on how to play and how to build decks. I've bought the complete bundle :( This game is about collecting cards to build better decks. However if u buy the complete bundle u alrdy have all the collections except the premium one witch is kinda expencive and only obtaineble if u use real money. So to get the feeling of actually progressing in this game and get more gameplay for ur $. I'd propose that u buy the game with no extras and collect the cards urself. If not, you would only have the small campaign to play through and that will drasticly deminish how fun and how many hours of gameplay you experince, in my opinion :)			"

I used to play a ton of ""Duels"" with  coworkers and friends, but we don't like the FFA mode.  If I had known there was no 2HG mode or any alternate cooperative modes, I would not have purchased.  I also find the UI and menus to be awful: slow forced waits between menu sections, clicking a second time RESETS the animation instead of skipping it.  Some button clicks do not seem to register at all, and so you wait for the slow fade animation after a single click... and it might not even be going to the next screen at all.

												A starkly different sort of Magic: the Gathering experience from the previous games.Rather than decklists, they offer you a freedom of a sort to build your own decks with any of the unlockable cards you can attain. However, they offer you cards one might have after buying a few deckbuilder's toolkits. Mostly disjointed commons, with limits on the number of copies of each card you can maintain in your collection based off of wether or not it is an uncommon (maximum of 3) rare (maximum of 2) or mythic (maximum of 1) rarity. Meanwhile, your campaign opponents have very organized decks that are not restricted the same way as your decks at all. many of these decks contain cards you will never yourself own; not uncommon to Duels of The Planeswalkers games, but never has it been this saturated before. A strong familiarity is not jusr reccomended to get by in this game, but REQUIRED. a design flaw, to be sure, for a game meant to draw in new potential players for the TCG.			"

												I recently purchased this game, thinking that it would be along the old lines - crack open decks as you progressed further, and you also had the option to purchase other desck to use (you'd still have to unlock them).  This game is very different.  After you've complete the training, the game prompts you to pick a deck.  Sad thing is that if you ened up not liking the deck, you cannot , repeat, cannot change decks.  Now, if you win a game, it gives you some booster cards (around 5 or so)... thus I expect that you are supposed to build new decks from thiem. Oh yeah, wizards finally got on to the ""pay-to-play"" sceme, where if you ytally want to modify your decks, you pay a lot and then get them.  This, my friends, creates a huge gap between people who can ""afford"" the game, and those who can't.  I have to be honest - I feel ripped off by the game.So, would I refer this game to a friend? Absolutely NOT.  I'd advise them to play Magic 2014Edit:This is an update on my review.  After playing for well over 100 hours on this game, I have unlocked every card possible - outside of premium. I've won over 100 multiplayer matches, beat the campaign, everything. But guess what? There are cards that I cannot use because I refuse to pay more money for a computer game I PURCHASED and should have everything unlocked already! I don't know if wizards is hurting for money or not, but it I have baught the game, I should have access to all features. I was fine with 2014's option to purchase other DECKS, but come on, this is down right silly. And personally, I feel ripped off. I do have to add, though, that as you progress further into the game, you can unlock new decks. But again, this isn't like 2014, where one deck is a theme of cards and you place the ones you want for your complete deck. No, these seem to be only *guidelines* where you can still build any deck any way you want. Honestly, I'm getting pretty sick and tired of losing games to players, where I had them beat, but they pull out some premium card and end up beating me. The one card that comes to mind is a 12/12 4 annihilation card. Yeah folks, that's right, the only way you'll EVER have access to it is if you decide to give wizards more of your hard earned cash and BUY IT! And unlike the trading card game, you do NOT get an actual copy of the card in the mail, so when a new games comes out, or wizard decides to stop supporting this game, all that money you spent is worthless. So really, Magic 2015 is a PAY-TO-WIN game! If you're rich, or don't mind throwing money down the tube, then this game may be for you. But with the money grubing scheme, the complete absense of 2v2 games, and a very crappy interface (seriously, you have to wait for some stupid cloud animation to finish on EVERY PAGE before you can click to continue), this game is really a major step down from the last!And finally, I also want to note that the game is buggy as hell. The one card (can't remember its name) - an enchantment where if you have or are tied for the greatest power, you draw an extra card, well its broken. I've been in MANY games where I've had the most powerful creatures (many of them) and STILL the other player gets an auto card draw! Also, the angel card that resets your life to 20 sometimes doesn't work, giving the other player INFINITE life and forcing a loss on the other player. This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												It's funny, before I played Hearthstone I used to think that the interface in DotP was pretty okay.  It's still better than Magic Online, but it's basically crap.  It feels like it's made for consoles and the Steam version is an afterthought.I'll pick one small example of why this game is designed poorly.  I'm a longtime Magic player, and have played other DotP games, so I picked Planeswalker difficulty and went right to the end of the tutorial, and then onto the first game of the campaign.  At some point in the game, I wanted to cast a spell using certain mana.  I knew that this was something previous games wouldn't always let you do.  So I hunted around in the options for a check box related to it.  I tried one marked ""Auto Lands"" but that didn't do anything.  Anyway, when I cast the spell, a prompt came up saying ""Press the mana choice key to choose how to cast this spell"".   Sounds easy, right?  Well I have no way to know what key that is.  I hunted back in the options for a ""Controls"" setting, but there's none there.  Before I could locate a help page or something that might tell me what key it is, the game crashed.  When I restarted, my progress in the game was lost.  The 20 minutes I had just spent grinding down the AI's zombie deck while I was mana screwed was for nothing.  How could this have been prevented?  Simple!  The prompt should have said ""Press the mana choice key (KEY NAME) to choose how to cast this spell"".  But instead of getting a useful prompt, the game persists in presenting me with the ""continue"" button even when there is no game action I could possibly take.  I'm not going to bluff the AI! The game should really be run in the equivalent of ""F8"" mode from Magic Online, or at least have the option.  ""Auto-continue when no actions are possible"" it could say.Okay, whatever, I've already wasted more time with this than I shoud have.  I'll go back to playing Hearthstone now.			"

												Ive played every Planeswalker and I play MTGO, this is by far the worst installment. 1st- theres absolutely no ranking or community stats. 2nd- anyone can easily freeze the game anytime they want. 3rd- the game itself crashes between almost every game......and of course the only reason people  play Planeswalker instead of just playing MTGO is the twoheaded giant, which they dont offer..... Basically youre better off playing Magic The Gathering Online.			"

												I have been playing Duels of the Planeswalker for years now, purchasing them annually.I have to gripe about this one in that the UI is so unintuitive! The menus are unnecessarily stylized and it is very frustrating to track your progress.I liked the ""themed"" based decks in the older versions and unlocking cards to enhance them. I understand the developers wanted to address customized deck building and I applaud them in doing so. However the interface makes it very difficult to understand the deck building or template based deck creation /unlocking progress. Which is what I find most enjoyable about this game.Recommendations is to make the menus more intuitive and more clarity on the deck creation/unlocking process.			"

												This should be a fantastic game. It isnt, but it should be. As a DOTA fan im inherently against pay to win, but theres a good reason for this. It isn't... you know... pay to win. I'd be okay with a longer unlock system allowing for every card to  actually be available, but the reality is this: after paying the 10$ for the game, youre already at a disadvantage agaisnt someone else who did purchase one of the premium packs. While card games are inherently pay to win in general, this is somwhat unjustified on a digital platfrom where the appeal is that for the upfront price you hypothetically have access to every card.Now don't get me wrong. the game itself is great and as usual the magic mechanics are fantastic. However, coupled with a sluggish interface and an inherent pay to win attitude, i struggle to justify playing this rort on a persons expectations of what they will and will not have access to. For the rather dear 10$ for the experience, its probably worth getting the real thing or finding something that actually is free to play			"

												I really wanted to like this iteration of Magic 2015 however I can't recommend it for several reasons. Firstly, being locked into a deck and not being able to adapt to your opponent was very frustrating. Secondly, no 2HG? Really? That was one of the few reasons (along with the Revenge Campaigns which are also missing) that made me enjoy the series. Thirdly (but not lastly), the microtransactions. No more unlocking decks. Nope. Your stuck with winning boosters. This version of the series just seems like a cash grab minus the more fun parts of MTG. Luckily this was gifted to me. Otherwise I would never have purchased it myself.			"

												I buy the new edition of this Magic Madden every year, and this series has just gone downhill ever since 2012. Every year they've removed more features, removed game variations and removed multiplayer game types. We're now back to where we started with a single player campaign and one-on-one multiplayer. Nothing is transferrable from the previous years' games, you start from scratch every time, and with this latest kick in the balls to their fanbase, I have to say that this game just isn't fun anymore.The idea of these games is to promote the card game and in that way Hasbro has certainly succeeded, because I'm going back to the card game and I'm not playing this♥♥♥♥♥♥anymore.

												You'd think that the DOTP series would get better year after year, but unfortunately that isn't the case. The game is plauged with game breaking bugs, such as the one where I have to turn off my internet connection in order to boot up the game, and then reconnect to have access to multiplayer. Or the fact that you dont have access to any card collections you purchased or preorder bonuses until you beat the first main boss, who is nigh impossible to beat, since every single player match is way too one sided in an effort to make you spend more money on cards. The entire game is not so much a Magic the Gathering game as it is a horrible pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥designed to make you waste more money, and even then, the ""entire"" card collections you can pay to unlock are just small underpowered portions of their real life counterparts, missing many signature cards, such as the Gods of Theros. The ""game"", if I could even call it that, is a blatant racket designed to make players continuously spend money just to beat what should be a fun and challenging single player mode, which is really a one sided slaughter where your opponent always has the perfect cards for every situation. If you really want to play MTG, you are much better off spending the money you would on this game on actual physical cards. ♥♥♥♥ this game and anyone who had a hand in making it, you should all be ashamed of yourselves.

												Poor oversight by Magic 2015 developers in the game.Positives include a catchy theme song, ability to construct a deck to however you like, storyline is not a bad inclusion, opening more boosters to provide anticipation and excitement.Sadly however the negatives definately out weigh the positives.You are restricted in deck building to a limited selection of cards after you have completed the campaign unless you which ti invest in ""boosters"" to increase your card pool. Matching up against others who have superior cards or/even duplicates or sets of 4 card(s) whom have purchased additional boosters, not only makes deck building difficult, ineffective but also increases the likelihood that you will be demorilised over and over again in matches against other opponents in 1 v 1 or free for all matching.I generally enjoy purchasing this product for the puzzle games, Last turn puzzles a few years ago were amazing and difficult/challanging. 2014 however showcases some very sub par puzzles games and this year, well, there are none.I played one game of free for all on 4 v 4 and I felt so far away from the game table I requested my flatmate to provide me a magnifine glass. myself and another player also realised 4 turns in that we had already lost when one of the players threw down some superior cards for which we had not even access to.This put me off continuing playing this game into the future as really there is no point unless I am wishing to invest into this.Suggestions would be to at least bring ""two headed giant"" match making back, a level par card selection by perhaps charging a set $15 fee from the start and not this ""micro transaction booster option"" which is poor oversight in my opinion and perhaps even a tournament mode where equal par magic the gatherers could paticipate tournaments of 10 players etc, round robin to then provide a level based system and a decent points rating for those wishing to climb to the top in rankings over time (by winning more tourney's etc)Rating, interface, music score, Story concept 6/10 (as what else can you do with a story really)gameplay campaign 5/10 (as well the AI seems to get the perfect run of cards sometimes :S)Deck building feature, 8/10 as this is very flexibleCard selection 2/10 (extremely limited unless additional investments made)gameplay vs human 3/10 (for the reason you will become frustate that you are unable to build a deck that is consistent without investment into more booster packs)Overall I would probably rate Magic 2015 4/10			"

												Let me make a brief disclaimer: I wanted to like this game. Desperately so. I've played Magic: the Gathering for a while now, and have gotten fairly good at it. I keep up with standard builds, set rotations, popular meta builds and have numerous real-life paper decks for anything from Modern to EDH. I really, really, wanted to like this game. But, sadly, this game suffers from what I call, ""Penny Rare Syndrome."" It has a lot of flavor, and is fun initially, but you'll later find that if you spent more than a dollar on it, you're not getting your money's worth. On the surface, it looks like an epic concept: keeping in line with the lore behind the M15 Core Set release, Garruk, the wild planeswalker, has been possessed/corrupted by Liliana Vess, who is now in possession of the powerful Chain Veil. As a planeswalker learned and hardened by various journeys (i.e. the previous games), you embark on a journey to stop Garruk as he hunts down planeswalkers in a wild bloodlust.Sounds cool, doesn't it? Chasing a crazed, homicidal woodsman as you both hop from plane to plane, narrowly missing each other in a dangerous game of cat and mouse? Well, unfortunately, that description is about as intense as it gets. Other than a smattering of graphic-novel stlye cutscenes that are criminally short, most of this ""epic"" quest is told in the form of text boxes. Boring. Old. Textboxes. I've played a lot of TCGs, I grew up with them. I've played some pretty good TCG video games as well. Portable games that give you a complete experience by letting you explore a world, build a deck, and battle all of your favorite characters, all the while sharpening your skills and becoming a better player.Magic 2015 is not those games. I know, it never really was, and expecting a massive genre-shift is not really a realistic expectation. But I cannot excuse how Magic 2015 somehow makes one of the most epic stories in the card gaming-world boring. Not delivering a genre-busting epic powerhouse of card-game-playing, open-world-exploring action is one thing: starting with a great premise and watering it down to nothing is another.Notice I haven't even mentioned the actual systems of the game yet? The deck building, the customization, the collecting, even the UI? There's a reason for that. And it's brief: They're poor. And that's even being too polite, some facets of the game are non-existant. Did you enjoy the sealed campaign from 2014? Gone. 2-Headed Giant? Gone. But hey, you can customize your own deck! Honestly I'd be ok even with that if the deck building wasn't the mess it is. The starter decks are laughably bad. Intro packs are more playable. And even intro packs come with two boosters to give you a shot at something better. Yes, you unlock ""boosters"" as you play through the game, but they're often pre-determined sets that will give you little if anything truly useful; often they're simpy bad cards that are just slightly less horrible than your current terrible cards. If you want the real heavy-hitters, you need to shell out more money. Yep. Micro transactions. Simply to have access to some of the at least marginally playable cards. That is where I draw the line. I was fine with the previous Magic iteration as it was a decently competent package in and of itself. Buy it cheap (while on sale) and you could have some fun toying with interesting deck concepts and goofing about with friends. But even on sale, I would have a hard time recommending Magic 2015, as the up-front price is essentially akin to paying an entrance fee to walk into a card shop: you're still going to have to pay for anything of value inside.I hope this game gets more love. I hope it improves. Implement better decks. Implement a way to build and shape your own Magic dream deck in a harmless vaccuum. This is not Magic Online. This is not Paper Magic. If you build here what would be a $250 standard deck for simply the cost of the game, who cares? Nothing in this game pertains to the actual economy of Magic. Nobody at a Pro Tour qualifier is going to pay any heed to my claims that I have my ace standard deck ready to go if it's simply a collection of pixels in my M:DotP 2015 digital deck queue. It is, again, a vaccuum. This is the place where casual Magic players can escape to have fun. But, sadly, the game is far too engrossed in its potential profits to care. All I can do is hope that one day it will be fixed. But until then, I cannot, with a clear conscience, recommend this game, especially with other far better options out there.			"

												I played quite a bit of 2013 and 2014 and loved those games!  After playing through the main campaign, 2015 just wasn't as fun for me. The main complaint revolves around unlocking cards. While deck building is more open ended, after a certain point you cannot unlock more cards without additional purchases.  2014 didn't have this until they released additional content well after the game was released.  There are some performance issues.  I run an i7 and a 660GTX, but the menus are slow and choppy.  I look past this since it doesn't seem to impact the main game, but it does seem sloppy.			"

												I'll keep this short: The card pool is extremely, extremely limited. Making your own deck from scratch is really neat, but with such a small card pool, there's only so many viable options. Lack of two headed giant is also inexcusable. The game lags for no reason (and yes; my PC exceeds the recommended system specs by a landslide) and it's just very aesthetically unpleasant; everything is so white that it hurts my eyes. Also the ambient music is lame. I was super excited for this game but I'd say wait until they add more DLC and discount it. But for now: go play Magic 2014 instead.			"

A lot of the really good cards that can you play against which make powerful decks are unlockable.  After discovering this I stopped playing all together because I was so dissappointed. I do not think my husband and I will be buying another online Magic the Gathering Game unless this is fixed in MTG 2015 (we bought this game twice so we could play against eachother).

Next you took off the TWO headed giant mode where it is the I would say the most important feature to me so that I can play with my friends in co-op. Then, you made the game consist too many micro-transaction, you almost made it a Pay-to-Win game by setting the AI to have strong cards(tropical island, like really?) at first and limit our starter decks to only 1! But kudos to you guys that finally implemented a custom deck builder and if there is no 2HG in the future for Magic 2015 then I guess I am done with this game.			"

												[+] Positive- Free pool of cards, you unlock boosters and is able to create any deck with it- Greater diversity of opponent's than previous titles in the series- Any color combination can have a decent deck in it[-] Negative- The pool is very small, and can only be expanded by buying boosters- The campaign is pretty much meaningless, since there's nothing to unlock beside boosters (unless you care for avatars), which can be unlocked outside mission objectives- You can unlock all the cards in less than 20 hours- Comparatively fewer cards are relevant to your deck from the earlier versions of Duels of the PWs- With the unfocused decks, they become in it's better form much more superficial and boring, with simple cards and less interesting sinergy- The game is much less engaging, since you won't battle to upgrade your decks, after a few hours (after unlocking all ""free"" boosters)- For an experient player (a player of Magic outside Steam), you have a worst experience than playing with a real pool of cards, and, for me, the limitations of decks from previous versions were responsible for a sense of interest in this digital version of the gameI've played them all, and to me, this is the most boring Duels of the Planeswalkers ever released.

Full package DOESN'T CONTAIN premium cards, which you can get by buying premium magic 2015 boosters (around 1,99$). To get all premium cards you need to buy ~14 boosters. So if you want to play this game, don't buy full package enjoy collecting new cards by playing the game, and if you really want to spend some additional money, buy those premium boosters nothng else (also it kinda sucks because it's over 100 cards locked for players who don't want to spend additional money for booster packs).So, do I recommend? It's your call, if you are fine with white color madness, no gamma setting, no 2headed giant multiplayer option, and over 100 cards that can be only unlocked by paying ~25$/EUROS, then go for it.

												I am highly dissappointed in this game.  I like how I can customize the decks better, but I thought I would actually be able to unlock better cards.  I don't even know how many times I had to play agains Jace and the Sliver deck to beat them, and when I finally did, I thought I would get better cards.  But no.  A lot of the really good cards that can you play against which make powerful decks are unlockable.  After discovering this I stopped playing all together because I was so dissappointed. I do not think my husband and I will be buying another online Magic the Gathering Game unless this is fixed in MTG 2015 (we bought this game twice so we could play against eachother).  And we will not be paying more just to buy extra booster packs in a game we have already bought.			"

												I'll keep this short: The card pool is extremely, extremely limited. Making your own deck from scratch is really neat, but with such a small card pool, there's only so many viable options. Lack of two headed giant is also inexcusable. The game lags for no reason (and yes; my PC exceeds the recommended system specs by a landslide) and it's just very aesthetically unpleasant; everything is so white that it hurts my eyes. Also the ambient music is lame. I was super excited for this game but I'd say wait until they add more DLC and discount it. But for now: go play Magic 2014 instead.			"

												Disappointed to be honest.  The AI can be dumb as a box of rocks and the deck options are seriously limited.  I also hate hate hate the long animations on the loading screens, it's needless to spend all that time just cycling to get into a match.  Getting into a quick game takes needless extra time because of having to watch the animations.Spend less time on graphics and flash and more time on AI and deck improvements, also bring back the extra formats.  Basically do what you guys were doing in 2013 and 2014, but 2015 doesn't measure up.Still going to play it but very disappointed overall.			"

												Not too much to like about this game. Its pay to win unless you happen to have hours to dump into building decks from mediocre cards to get the few good ones many many matches later. If you're a casual magic player like myself it will not be as fun as having nice prebuilt decks at your finger tips that you can modify to suit your play style. Its also disappointing that two headed giant is no longer n option.			"

												WotC is a fantastic company. They put on yearly free magic days and other fan service. This game does not represent them well at all. First the good things. The UI is much tougher. Ok thats it, now the bad unfortunately. The card pool is incredibly shrunk down from 2014. It seems to be about a third the size of the last game. They removed the puzzles and two-headed giant mode along with sealed. Even worse no new modes were added!Then the greatest crime of all, they released cards that cant be unlocked through gameplay. If you want the prmium cards, and why would't you, you are going to have to pay $1.99 per 15 cards. There are only 50 premiums but you can play multiple copies of cards.It seems that the developers didnt understand what people actually want. People wanted open construction, as in the ability to shift cards from one deck to the other. This game provides very little contructed possibilities because of the very small card pool. They also didnt support elves. This really bugs me.  "

												This game had a lot of potential, and it's really dissapointing that it fell through on most of it. This is the first ""Duels of the Planeswalkers"" game to allow you ""fully customizable"" deck building. Unfortunately, most of the cards you can unlock through the random booster packs are pretty bad. To get better cards, you can purchase premium booster packs, or a set of all of the cards. Without these pre-included features, though, this feels more like an incomplete game. Two-Headed Giant mode is also notably absent. The gameplay is fairly smooth, but occasionally unresponsive. The AI switches between borderline moronic (sometimes it seems to ignore the abilities of creatures you control when making decisions) and busted difficult (turn 3 Grislebrand?). Overall, I was not impressed. It's a step down from previous iterations.			"

												Worst game in the series. The removal of several multiplayer modes in exchange of an ugly U.I, and what I can only describe as a cash shop, was a terrible mistake. The single player campaign is a waste of time. The A.I is terrible on all levels, for example Mage and Archmage are too easy, and Planeswalker difficulty isn't fun or challenging at all, since the A.I will simply use the same scripted opening hand, but it is better than paying extra to unlock all the cards. Story wise, there isn't one. Despite the effort, the story in these games is practically non-existent, it simply feels heartless. To sum up the story Garruk turns evil, you defeat a demon, then Garruk, and then it cuts to a cliffhanger. The story is told in about six 30 second videos, the advertisement for this game has more content in them than the entire game. Have in mind Magic the Gathering is a franchise that produces comic books, and novels based on its lore, making this an embarrassment.This iteration has less cards than the 2015 Core Set, which negates the functionality of several deck types due to lack of cards. The addition of Premium Boosters means the player has to pay extra to complete his/her collection.Premium packs give advantage to players willing to pay for them. As someone who bought the Special Edition I can say the amount of content, or lack thereof, in it is not worth it, and your best option is to get the base game, that is, if you truly want to play this. I can't stress enough how disappoiting this is for me. The commercials advertise Garruk as a threat in the multiverse, but the game doesn't include the ""Garruk"" multiplayer mode. Gee fine, don't have Garruk on the cover if you truly don't mean it.			"

												I do not recommend this game for the following reasons: -It's not a pay to win, but when the game starts you are given a crap deck which you need to adapt with better cards. The problem is: If you want to play on expert, this is an impossible task because the cpu always have a perfect hand for perfect gameplay, and your deck its so much worse than theirs. Solution: Play on easy or medium, but not the same ""pleasure level"".-They took off the 2 Headed Giants game mode, that mode was what made me play 50h+ on Magic 2014 DotP. Solution: Add the mode as a dlc or patch in the future...-The game isn't noob friendly because don't explain well how to build a good deck. The available recipes are crap, and the suggested cards they do aren't good. If you don't know how to build a good deck, you gonna have a bad time to beat the main campaign.-They could give us something for winning a multiplayer game, like M2014DotP when you won a game you unlock a card for the deck. (Just my opinion, not criticizing the game on this one).- The interface of the game is pretty good, and the thematic is very cool but it got slowier than previous games and you need to scroll down to go to desired option instead of simply click on it.-Every time you finish a duel you are sent back to the main menu, which is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to keep playing, 'cuz you need to  suffer from the interface problems again, and if you want a rematch with the person on a multiplayer game you can't, because you and him were kicked from the lobby.Sorry for the poor english, not main language.

												I have been playing Duels of the Planeswalker for years now, purchasing them annually.I have to gripe about this one in that the UI is so unintuitive! The menus are unnecessarily stylized and it is very frustrating to track your progress.I liked the ""themed"" based decks in the older versions and unlocking cards to enhance them. I understand the developers wanted to address customized deck building and I applaud them in doing so. However the interface makes it very difficult to understand the deck building or template based deck creation /unlocking progress. Which is what I find most enjoyable about this game.Recommendations is to make the menus more intuitive and more clarity on the deck creation/unlocking process.			"

												This should be a fantastic game. It isnt, but it should be. As a DOTA fan im inherently against pay to win, but theres a good reason for this. It isn't... you know... pay to win. I'd be okay with a longer unlock system allowing for every card to  actually be available, but the reality is this: after paying the 10$ for the game, youre already at a disadvantage agaisnt someone else who did purchase one of the premium packs. While card games are inherently pay to win in general, this is somwhat unjustified on a digital platfrom where the appeal is that for the upfront price you hypothetically have access to every card.Now don't get me wrong. the game itself is great and as usual the magic mechanics are fantastic. However, coupled with a sluggish interface and an inherent pay to win attitude, i struggle to justify playing this rort on a persons expectations of what they will and will not have access to. For the rather dear 10$ for the experience, its probably worth getting the real thing or finding something that actually is free to play			"

												I really wanted to like this iteration of Magic 2015 however I can't recommend it for several reasons. Firstly, being locked into a deck and not being able to adapt to your opponent was very frustrating. Secondly, no 2HG? Really? That was one of the few reasons (along with the Revenge Campaigns which are also missing) that made me enjoy the series. Thirdly (but not lastly), the microtransactions. No more unlocking decks. Nope. Your stuck with winning boosters. This version of the series just seems like a cash grab minus the more fun parts of MTG. Luckily this was gifted to me.

												I buy the new edition of this Magic Madden every year, and this series has just gone downhill ever since 2012. Every year they've removed more features, removed game variations and removed multiplayer game types. We're now back to where we started with a single player campaign and one-on-one multiplayer. Nothing is transferrable from the previous years' games, you start from scratch every time, and with this latest kick in the balls to their fanbase, I have to say that this game just isn't fun anymore.The idea of these games is to promote the card game and in that way Hasbro has certainly succeeded, because I'm going back to the card game and I'm not playing this♥♥♥♥♥♥anymore.

												Worst edition to date.  They finally took the decks off rails, but failed on all other aspects of the game.  In the beginning unlocking the cards is very tedious as you don't have good enough cards to make a credible deck considering the difficulty of the enemies.  I know 3 people who quit after the tutorial because the difficulty curve was too steep for them.Once you unlock enough cards to make a decent deck there are still major problems with the user interface.  It is very unresponsive on the PC.  You often have to click things 2 or 3 times to register a click.  The screen often freezes and when it unfreezes you miss your opportunity to respond to a spell.They took a giant leap backwards in multiplayer.  There is no longer 2 headed giant or nemisis.  The match making is horrible.  You have to attempt to join 4 or 5 games before you are finally allowed in to the game.  If you start a game yourself you can see the problem as the icon for the opponent will quickly flash between several avitars before finally settling on one.  Each flash of an avitar is obviously another player attempting to join the same game and getting kicked with the message ""The game is full"".This is assuming the multiplayer is working at all.  For the last 2 days I've been unable to join any games at all. "

												Terribly disappointed, even at my first go at a Magic: the Gathering video game. Not even that good at the card game, but i thoroughly enjoy it. After discovering that the best cards can only be bought, i thought to myself ""Whats the point?"" If i can't earn the cards, why would i play the game at all? I spent 10 bucks on the game already, and you're telling me i have to spend more to get decent cards? Hell, for that price i could go down to my local Card Shop and buy real cards to play with anyone at anytime, y'know, actually get something worth my money instead of virtual B.S. This is truely a demonstation of pure greed, removing every fun aspect about a game and forcing someone to pay even more money just to try and enjoy it. Thanks for trying, but the video game industy is just going down hill with all this ""Pay-to-win"" crap, at least in other games people are allowed to grind and earn those rare prizes, instead of just making it avaliable only to those who buy them. I feel like i was tricked into spending 10 dollars, spending hours just getting by the first bosses, only to find out that i could play this game forever and still never have the awesome deck that those who pay get. For the same price, i could buy winner decks from friends or the shop! What a scam.			"

												Dropped the ball.I wanted to like this game, I really did. And one can argue for 10$ you can get more then enough enjoyment out of it. I clocked in around 30 hours with all the card unlockes and made some pretty fun decks......thats the games good side.If your familiar with the previous installments you'll be sorely dissipointed with this game. Gone is Revenge campaign, gone is challenge mode. If your into multiplayer, gone is two headed giant. The UI is clunky and frustrating. For example in order to change decks in multiplayer you have to leave the lobby, go into single player menu THEN go into the deck editor to ""equip"" your deck. The entire enterface feels like it was built for tablets and smart phones and was less conserned about streamlining the process.There are few games I'll Purchase DLC for, In the past years Magic was one of them. I loved buying new decks and see what sort of gimmic they had... In this all of the DLC is just Card unlocks, some of which are ONLY avalible via DLC. Had I purchased the full DLC package I would have essentially bought my way though 3/4ths of the game.The Deck editor is fun and while the card pool is limited there are options there once you have a full library, but that alone can not redeem the game in my eyes. The game does have some good, there IS fun to be had in it but I held the Duel of the planewalker franchise to a much higher regard and to see it become this is pretty heart breaking.My advice, buy older installments. 2014 was a great game with some really cool decks. I hear theres even mods for it that implements a deck editor though I have yet to check it out.			"

												If I should recommend a magic game, Id recommend 2014. 2014 was still not good, but well playable.2015 took many steps back, but includes free deck building. I dont think that this was worth it.2014 had these nice simple menus. Quick, gave a good overview and were easy to use. Now in 2015 we have slow scrolling menus(again?). We had them in 2013 too, but they were quicker there. In 2015 I have to klick start several times before I get to the menu, then there are these slow fade outs/ins into the next menus. Thats just crap. Should that look epic or something? Its just slow and hindering. The online matchmaking is poorly made aswell. After game I dont get to the lobby again, I have to create a new one after every match. I have some friends with whom I play with. We want to stay in our lobby. But hey there are reasons to go out of the lobby, to change the deck! Yeah now I have to equip a deck in the main menu to use it in multiplayer. I cant just scroll through them like in 2014, or '13. What the heck you were able to this the last 2 years. Why not again? And where is the two-headed-giant mode? I liked to play this with my freinds, if others disliked that mode its no reason to drop it. They dont have to play it. The same with planechase in 2013. That mode was fun.The computer provides many graphical advantages over cards made of paper. You can have animated cards in a computer game. And we got a few animated cards in 2014. I thought it looks nice, still improvable but nice. Why dont you keep or improve it? No another feature that has been dropped.And in 2013/14 the computer was good at manatapping. It saw your hand and knew what lands you would like to tap. Now manual tapping is a must because the computer cant get it done. Why not? It was possible the last years! And still, a problem that has been there since 2013, when many creatures attack(10+), you cant properly block them because all creatures overlap so you cant even klick them. Stop dropping features and bring solutions to the problems that occur every year so far!2015 has free deck building. Thats the only improvement over the other games. The ONLY improvement. The game got worse in EVERY other aspect. And all these things, but the blocking problem I mentioned, are unnecessary as they were there or good in 2013 or 2014. Its not that I want new things, I want you to keep the good stuff that has been there so far and improve on the rest.To conclude, what do I want to see in 2016:-menu from 2014-free deck bulding(I like the 'recipes' you get in 2015 for pre build decks. keep them)-good automated manatapping-two-headed-giant, planechase(and maybe new fun modes)-a good multiplayer matchmaking system(2014 was ok, but Id like to see a list of open lobbys or something. like in 'Worms')-(more)animated cards(I know you cant do 3D models battling each other, but the 2014 animations were good. do something like that again)-make scroll in/out of cards and graveyard quick again(it doesnt react well) "

And what really makes this a kick in the balls is that it is now pay to win... and it's not even a free to play game! You only get 1 deck to start with, and whichever one you pick, it is horrible. If you want to make it better you are forced to either grind out cards by playing single player, or buy booster packs. I have been playing DotP since it started and I have to say that this is very dissapointing, the worst game of the series yet.

												I really wish I'd read up on this game before buying it. I could get into all of what they did wrong with this latest iteration but it's all beside the point because the UI is absolutely broken. The menus are intolerable. It's simply not worth dealing with such dogshit UI design. Making these games with functional menus is not that difficult, and was never a problem with previous games in this series. I wish I could just get my money back. Congratulations, guys. You got my ten bucks. You won't get any more out of me.			"

												First of all I've been a die hard Magic fan since the early 90s. Secondly I've bought every single Duels of the planes walkers games on day 1. I greatly enjoyed every one of them until 2014. While 2013 was solid and I played through all the content, it did introduce the events. Ok they were boring and NOT what any duels player wanted...but they were few and far between...I forgave them. 2014 came along and it was just plain bad...where as 2013 had a few events....2014 was only events with an actual AI fight here and there... I have never found a single player who has claimed to enjoy these events.2015 was announced and it sounded like it would be the second coming. Finally we can make our own decks. No more events right?!? Oh you can pay for cards now? well...you can earn them in game so ..thats good right? oh 30$ for the mega edition that just gives you every card? Let's go for that!!!Well turns out my 30$ bought me...some of the cards... Thats right, paying 3 times the base game price buys you SOME of the cards...not all. As far as I can see I got a premium booster for owning 2014 and another for preordering, but apart form those 2 if you want the cards they arbitrarily decided were ""premium"" you'll be forking out 2$ for a ""CHANCE!"" to get some of them..maybe... but that's 1 copy of it...need 4 for a deck idea? Well start forking out those 2$ buddy. Keeping in mind currently the competiton is Hearthstone, and that can be 100% free to play. Everything in hearthstone can be bought with in game gold.Oh and the kicker btw...its just 2014 all over again....""beat these 4 events to face an actual AI"". This is just pure and simply LAZY dev. The game should have been: Face off againt all that blocks starter decks as ""minions"" then face a boss with a constructed deck of that block. Beat the boss unlock the blocks cards to make decks with.I would recommend you stay away from this game and if you bought it...well..consider waiting next year before buying 2016....I know I will			"

												Imo 2014 did it right, things were set up in list format, the blochy white screen and environment and constant scrolling and poor interface make this game very unappealing to play. After 45 minutes of playing it was so disappointing to deal with the large amount of wasted time in getting around to find what you need and changes you wanted to make quickly. Also, the battles seem to take up more time with the turns due to the fact the developer thought it would be nice to add more movable graphics to each card play and turn. It's a card game....not an mmo or action game. I understand its a new game and it should take time to adjust, but the whole point of playing another version of the same game is that it shouldn't change from the simplicity of its functions. 2014 imo gave you that. The other thing I wish we could do with Magic the Gathering in general is actually build our own decks and play instead of dealing with the pre-made bull crap combo decks that ""THEY"" want us to play with. I had started playing Magic The Gathering during Unlimited and Revised editions, that was a long long time ago. Things just aren't what they used to be...			"

												I played DotP 2014 for over 500 Hours and enjoyed it. This 2015 version has many more cards, and the campaign is much better.However those are the only good things I can say about the game. The multiplayer is absolutely atrocious, as far as I’m concerned they have taken 100 steps backwards.Matches are also only ever 1 off only. You return to multiplayer select after a win or loss rather than being offered an immediate rematch as per earlier versions.Also the equip deck now means you have to pre select your deck before you go online with it - gone are the days of deciding last minute what deck you want to run.Finally there are still so many bugs and glitches with this game, you soon lose count. I have played countless matches which result in both players not being able to proceed, with the game locking up. This has always been a problem with previous versions, you think they would have a fix by now!Very disappointing and definitely do not recommend this game.			"

												First of all, you get to pick one starter deck that is can barely hold up the the enemies in the game, and when you win a duel you get three random cards. To unlock all the cards in the game, it takes a ridiculous amount of wins. This wouldn't be a problem if they gave you cards that would help with the deck you chose. They essentially try to force you into paying more money to unlock all the cards. Which is another $20 for all the blocks, or $5 for one, which would total $25, and to get the premium cards, you have to buy boosters which are $2 each. Oh, they also got rid of all the extra game modes, so its just generic magic now. They also don't even give you all the cards from each block, its only specific selection. Basically this feels like it is only a quarter of the way done. I feel sorry for anyone who bought it without reading any reviews, and I am angry that I wasted the money on it. tl;dr  It is made worse than it's predecessors, with less features, and is so poorly designed you virtually have to pay more money. This game is pay to win trash.			"

												Compared to their previous iterations this is definitely the worst and most blatant ""PAY ME"" MTG game ever. At least with Magic: Online you get to keep the cards you pay for. Do yourself a favor and do not purchase ever until Wizards drops the fud with this game. The point of MTG on Steam and whatnot is to be a lightweight MTG *WITHOUT* having to worry about a pay wall (no more repeatable campaign plays to unlock cards).  In any case, the random pack grind certainly takes its' toll on you. This game takes steps back with every release For one, their menus change drastically with every version. Magic 2015 includes a pointless and flashy menu GUI that is horrendously slow and takes up computer resources just to look ""Pretty"". It is overbearing to have so much time wasted to progress and go back to change settings, decks, etc. Their other versions were streamlined and had simplified menu systems. Why do this?Other versions gave puzzle challenges, replayability, faux sealed decks, and open decks, headed dragons for just the sticker price. Now you get campaign and multiplayer and nothing else. They built up this brand and now bait and switch MTG fans who enjoy the Steam versions. Do yourself a favor and keep your money and never buy again until they remember why we liked playing this MTG version. If you're new, try the other versions instead.I love MTG but this is one leaves a sour taste.			"

												I like Magic the Gathering. A lot. It's one of my favourite card games. I got this in a humble and I was hoping for a Hearthstone esque progression earning card packs over time, expanding my collection to eventually own every card from Magic 2015 and being able to play against friends online.That's not what this is. The UI is clunky. The game wants to handhold you SOOOO hard. The tutorial takes ages. Those can all either be gotten used to, completed  or turned off. Then you get to the game. Not only does it give you a new card pack every 5 minutes, the game also has a very limited card pool AND DOESN'T EVEN LET YOU COLLECT ALL OF THEM. The result is you wind up with a random selection of the games cards very quickly and then can't get any more. This is also primarily an ad for Magic 2015. Windows keep coming up advertising Friday Night Magic tournaments and there is a button on the main menu to locate a store near you. No, I can't reccomend this game.			"

												I am not very thrilled with this new Magic game: the interface is pretty slow (everything takes time, everything has a fade-out effect that takes precious time), and for occasional, weak Magic players like myself, the game presents some obstacles that are hardly solved, for example, I am stuck with the same B-G deck because I don't have enough cards to create other decks, and even if I could, I don't have the minimum knowledge of how to create a playable deck. In previous Magic games (2012, 2013, 2014, all of which I own and enjoy) the pre-constructed decks were great for players like me because we had a playable base and we could tweak those decks with some cards. Currently, creating a deck from scratch is rather hard and I can hardly enjoy the game because I am stuck with the same deck and this means I cannot beat some decks (those with flying creatures, just as an example).It might be nice if a future DLC provided us n00bs with a number of basic decks we could then tweak with the few cards we have been able to obtain through boosters.

												This is a great game if you're new to magic and want to learn in detail how to play. It has taught me the ins and outs of playing the paper version and I am a much better player.I recommend it only if you're interested in playing a lot of battles. I have unlocked all of the main game cards without paying any extra money and in the process I learned to play magic a lot better and also learned how to build good concepts for decks.I don't recommend buying any of the card sets. You're just destroying the only purpose of this game by doing so. Play every campaign level. Explore every card set until you no longer get boosters and that means you collected all the cards for that set. I did so until I had them all.Overall it was a lot of fun.			"

												Not recommended.The free-building of decks had long been expected, and when they finally added it, it mostly sucks. There are other things that make this a bad game. Here are my complains:1- When you start, you pick a combination of two colors. You're given a deck in that combination and you must start with it. When you win you earn cards. Simple, right? Well, not that much. This starting deck is awful (no matter what combination you picked, they all s.u.c.k. I just can talk about two combinations, but for what I've read in other reviews, it's the same for everything else), so you may need to play a lot before winning. And when you start winning you're given like 2 cards. Seriously. Just until you beat the first ""boss"" you are awarded with more than 10 cards per match, which is cool, or well, would be cool if the cards were useful.2- The card pool is poor. there are few cards and the ones available are mostly bad cards. You must play a good while until you have enough cards to customize your starting deck, let alone build one from scratch. You start with 26 lands, which seems an awful lot for me, and that get you constantly mana flowed. Go figure: at the beggining you are so limited that almost half your deck is lands. You can disable auto land-filling in the options if you want to change that, which will be useful until you have something decent to replace the lands you take out. Also, (this may be just my skill level), I have not been able to create a deck that stands good against all opponents. I know this is, almost by definition, impossible, but in previous year's Duels, the decks were more or less balanced and had some rather solid base that allowed you to build your strategy against different opponents, which meant that any single deck was able to overcome the complete campaign. In Duels 2015, I have been in the need of making an entire specific deck for a specific opponent. Try to  use that deck against the next one, and you're screwed. There's few (if any) flexibility.3- The description of the starter decks is crap. Take this: the red-black one is supposed to be FOCUSED in stealing your opponent's creatures and sacrificing them for your own benefit. Cool sounding? Well, in your 60 cards deck (26 of  which are lands, remember) there are 2 cards that steal creatures from your enemy and 2 that can get some benefit of it. Good luck making that ""strategy"" work.4- The menus are awful, you have to stupidly scroll through it, instead of a convenient and simple list as was Duels 2014 main menu. It takes a lot of scroll to get anywhere. Selecting your deck is a long tedious process, instead of being able to simply pick a deck at the beggining of a match. Are those menus good for tablets? so some people say, but I don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥, I'm using a PC. And even if I were using a tablet, I'd prefer a simple list that lets me see all that is available in a menu. Also, sometimes when you click, the game does not respond, forcing you to click for a second or third time before something actually happens.5- Microtransactions. This is not particulary bad for me, since I never make in-game purchases in any game. But be aware that if you want all the possible cards, the price of the game goes, in total, to $40.6- No extra game-modes. Just campaign and free for all. I loved the coop two headed giant, now it's gone.7- Decks in campaign mode have access to a totally different card pool than the one you have, usually with cards much stronger than the ones you have. Take this example: a match against slivers. On turn 5 i was crushed by 5 trampling slivers, the weakest being 5/5. It took me like 6 tries to beat the slivers. And do you get some slivers for your pool after winning? Nope, you don't.This game had a huge potential, and it was totally wasted. Not buying next year's. They have lost a fan.			"

												Buyer beware, you're in for a..frustrating experience.First off, let me just say that I've played M:TG for close to two decades now, so this review is based off of my time playing both the physical version of the game was well as the previous DotP.Where to begin? Well, first off the UI is just poorly coded. I'm 99 percent sure the UI is taking the majority of the resources here, and even still, it's laggy and buggy as hell. You'll mouse over items only to have to click above or below them to actually activate them. It takes FOREVER to get somewhere because there's about three menus per item you have to go through just to get to playing. If you want to create a new deck? You have to back all the way out to the main menu. Want to adjust options? The majority of them require you to be at the main menu to adjust. Now, let's get to the core of the game: actually playing.Here's where DotP 2015 should shine, but it keeps falling short. Here's a Pro/Con lis:PRO: Yes, you can FINALLY (it only took them three games to figure out we don't WANT pre-made decks, we want to build our own from the get go) build your own decks for use in the main campaign. CON: Good luck with the new system. The card unlocks trickle in slowly and you usually end up having to make god awful dual/tri color decks just to get enough cards to actually play.PRO: The deck building system allows you greater freedom in deck size, composition, and syngery.CON: The AI opponents routinely have better decks than you. Routinely get better first hand draws. And routinely have their decks work perfectly. It sucks all the joy and fun out of a game to have spent time building a solid 4-5 star deck only to have it trounced by Liliana five times in a row as she constantly gets the best draws possible.PRO: There are a TON of cards to collect spanning the following sets; Ravnica, Innistrad, Theros, Shandalar, Zendikar. Most of your favorites are here.CON: The card collection system is clearly designed to be pay-to-collect. The only plausible way I can see getting all the cards, aside from a mind numbing amount of grinding, would be to pay for each set unlock. PRO: The campaign, aside from the brutal AI, is engaging and fun. I will give them that. CON: The story behind it, however, is tacked on and largely pointless. Don't waste time on CGI cut-scenes if they're uninteresting and poorly voiced-----FINAL WORD: Do not buy unless you have somebody you want to play with online and this is the only plausible way you can play them.I would highly recommend skipping this game, taking some money, going to your local hobby store, and buying physical cards and playing that way. DotP 2015 is a pretty wrapper around a poorly built, poorly designed, and poorly coded game.			"

												((UPDATE: As of ""Garruk's Revenge"" expansion, some of the negative points I brought up are no longer valid. For example, aside from the expansion pack, cards are no longer locked behind paywalls (though they do require multiplayer play - which may put off some). In addition, the expansion bringing in new cards has done a remarkable thing for the depth of the card pool and possible strategies - 70-120 or so new cards are much more impressive in a game with true, free deck building. That said, I still cannot recommend this game over the previous installments unless you already own them and are looking for something a little new, for all of its flaws))I am currently an avid MTG player, having been brought in to the game via DoTP 2013 about two years ago, but mostly playing physical tournaments and drafts at my local store.Previous Duels of the Planeswalkers games were great ways to learn the game and some examples of cards and strategies from it, as well as experience a non-competetive, easy matchmaking service and a nice little progression aspect, even with a little light story thrown in. Ultimately, they were all greatly restricted in scope, mostly to avoid treading on the toes of MTG Online and the physical card game - Duels is, and always will be, an advertisement for the CCG and a great tutorial with some fun games to be had.This newest iteration allows you to build decks from scratch with the full pool of cards - something that, shockingly, was never in the previous 'modify an existing deck' design of the series - and has a slightly stronger story and cinematics than the previous ones, in my own opinion. It showcases some nice mechanics and visuals, and has EXCELLENT AI at the highest difficulties (with one or two questionable judgements every now and then), given the complexity of the game. The game also has some nice artworks and background lore/information for people new to the MTG universe, who are so interested.However. Even without DLC or Expansions, large amounts of cards are strictly locked behind a paywall. PvP players will note a distinct lack of multiplayer modes compared to previous games, and people seeking to grind cards to complete their collection and enhance the number of strategies will find the largely randomized nature of card acquiring to be infuriating - particularly since previous games allowed you to see which cards, in sequence, you'll unlock for each deck. The UI, while pretty, is clunky frequently when navigated with a mouse, scroll wheel and/or keyboard, likely a mark against the limited effort putting in to porting this game year in year out, when it appears to be gaining traction on tablets/iPad more than anything else.Finally, the card pool is...horrifically shallow. Multiple strategies exist, certainly, but its smaller than any previous Duels game - even before the DLC and expansions are taken into account, EVEN if you include this game's paid-only 'premium' cards. In addition, previous modes and game formats have been completely stripped from the game, and some of the most interesting mechanics in the planes/blocks/sets the game features are completely absent - or at least, not available to players, only the AI.All things considered, this series has taken one step forward and two, three or four steps back. There was never really a noticeable improvement with this series, year by year, but for long time fans this is, frankly, insulting. To call this an 'iterative' series is doing the word a disservice, as 'iterative' implies some kind of development, improvement or progression, which this game lacks. Just buy one of the older ones - there's no reason to get this one for a lot of people.			"

												After playing this for a few hours now, I think this is a bad game. Agreeing with other reviews for example slow UI and you start with a terrible deck. And in multiplayer too many people are experienced players with great decks, which leaves us rookie players with no chance of winning. It's a real shame, since I had high hopes for this game - so much so, that bought it in advance. Uninstalled now and won't be coming back.			"

												All the decks are hamstringed from the start allowing your opponents, who all have decks geared and themed to work together with itself flawlessly, to steam roll you time and time again till the planets align and you get every card in the perfect order. you will spend the better part of the game either scrolling through defeat screens or restarting once the game mana floods/screws you time and time again. also good luck building a decent deck without purchasing the card packs. seems like a cheap attempt to make players have to buy more just to beat the game. do not play, do not buy, if you like the card game i suggest you stay the hell away from this and do better things with your time. in the end, would not suggest. limited card pool, multiplayer features are limited, they removed two headed giant and pretty much removed the fun factor too boot..

												PROS-the customization is amazing ive never really had enough money to buy a lot of cards IRL so being able to build any deck using the hundreds of cards is an amazing feeling especially if you deck works-the battle interface is a lot slicker than m14 but not by much I just recently beat m14 so I have a pretty clear idea on how it functioned.CONS (a lot longer)- you are limited in how many mythics, rares, and even uncommons?! This is the stupidest thing I've seen from Wizards. This is not the main reason why you should get the game it is still very functional.`sloooooooooooooow transitions a loading screen is a loading screen use it don't make it seam like it doesn't need it but that's why people didn't mind it as much in the previous versons is because they were put there for a reason.`Microinstructions this is what I don't like about this game the most I pre ordered the complete edition the hole sh-bang but I was still missing cards I have no idea why since I payed $35 even before I knew anything about it since I'm a huge magic fan IRL.-not enough modes I really didn't want to bring this up but I have to in magic 2013 we had Two Headed giant, planechase, online friend play, in 2014 we lost planechase which was my favorite, M15 lost everything besides online play this is why if you want this game is for the online play not for the mediocre campaign I find this completely stupid this is why I think you shouldn't get the game.-bonus con (just because)I almost beat the campaign in less than a day at this point when I am writing this I have played 9.5 hours and I am on the final battle against Garruk. Now I know a final boss is suppose to be hard I get that but it doesn't make since how his first form is laughably easy and all of the sudden he throws this huge curve ball with a different deck different play style which is fine and all but ive looked this up and it has been mentioned before I never get a playable hand I don't care what anyone else says the decks that I have made don't get that bad of hands this commonly ive tried fighting him with my deck 10 times with each of my decks and his first form I got a snap keep it was a perfect hand this once I beat him and I go to his second form drew a hand full of lands or no lands at all or lands and really high costing cards and anyone who has gotten to his second form knows how ridiculous some of his cards are so you need every advantage you can get but you never get a good hand. I know it is just a game and I know that this last situation happens to everybody it just suspicious that it hasn't happened to me ever on his first form.So my final verdict is a 4/10 its really a let down.

												This game is a super huge let-down. On it's own, it's still a pretty bad game, but compared to the previous MTG games it looks even worse. 1. 2015 has no two-headed giant mode. Two-headed giant is the main reason why people play these game. Who wouldn't want to team up with their friends? It's really stupid for Wotc to take it out for no reason. Would it really be that hard just to add another game mode?2. 2015 is also missing the revenge campaign, challenges, and planeswalkers. Basically, all there is is multiplayer (free-for-all only) and campaign mode which is too short on it's own and becomes really easy really quick. 3. The starting decks are a joke. There is no other way to say it. They're literally the worst decks I've ever seen, and trust me, I've seen some really bad decks. In fact, they're worse than the $15 starters you can buy in real life. (If you're a MTG player already, you know what I mean.) Just how bad? They're packed with heaps of common creatures with no special abilities and almost no spells. Playing the first portion of the campaign is literally painful. 4. You get treated like a baby. If you've played MTG before you can skip the tutorial, but you still have to beat the tutorial boss. Then, after that, you aren't allowed to customize your decks until you beat the first ""real"" boss of the campaign. 5. The difficulty curve is totally skewed. In the begining, before you unlock enough cards, the game is IMPOSSIBLE. Even though the AI's are utterly stupid and easu, the computer is allowed to have much better cards than you. Then, later on when you unlock a few cards, the game becomes trivial because the AI sucks too badly.6. Microtransactions. Instead of paying $1 to unlock a cool deck like the earlier games, you have to pay $5 to unlock a set. Even if you do, you don't actually get very many cards and most of them suck. It's such a huge rip-off. So basically, WOTC sold out. This game was clearly made with minimal effort and is obviously a lazy grab for more money. I pre-ordered it because I LOVE MTG and have been playing for years, including all the PC games, and now I feel like an idiot. Don't let your judgement be clouded just because it says ""Magic.""			"

												No co-op, laggy and clunky UI, recycled SFX from last year. Overall this product is missing everything that made previous DotP products worth playing. The worst part, though, is that there are cards locked behind a premium pay wall. Somehow they think it's OK to change a series that's always been about playing MtG with a limited cardpool and to add a pay-to-win random premium card system. No thanks. This game can't decide if it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ installment of DotP or a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of Magic Online. I would get a refund if I could.			"

												Unlike M14 where you could play with any of the starter decks, in M15 you are locked in to playing with the first deck you choose, if this deck turns out to be mostly terrible you will find yourself losing most games, the only way to improve your deck is to then grind out AI battles winning one booster at a time with maybe 1-3 worthwhile cards at a time, and that's only if you manage to win against them. I only bought the special edition and not the complete edition so you may have more luck with that but in the end it comes down to spending more money so that you might be able to enjoy the game.

												By far the worst magic the gathering game i've played,  and on top of that, it lacks 2 headed giant.you have to buy the game, and if you want to unlock better cards you have to pay even more money to buy premium booster packs. i for one like to have the full game when i've payed for it.the automatic mana tapping system is really bad.  and now i can't even start the game, i can't get further than the splash screen. another thing to mention is that the menu is so slow, so you'll be spending half your time manouvering the clumsy menu or changing decks.To summarize, magic 2015 offers....  microtransactions, clumsy menu, in my opinion no replayability  on the campaign, slow menu, bad mana tapping system, Pay to win, bad port to pc. magic 2014 offered more to the champaign, replayability, mulitplayer. and if you just want to build decks etc. i suggest you go buy some packs on the mtg website and play online instead.i'm disappointed, i expected more like many others did...

												EDIT: One thing I forget to mention in this review is that you're limited on the number of card types you can have in MTG2015. You can only have 1 mythic rarity card and 2 rare rarity cards in your deck at any given time. Why they decided to do this I have no idea but it doesn't accurately represent the freedom that MTG gives players. If they wanted to do something like this for balance sake it should have been a separate mode within the game. MTG 2014 and 2013 don't work like this and it is a major failing of MTG 2015 to force this restriction on its players.As much as I'd really like to give this a recommendation I just can't. At its core MTG2015 is a good game. Just like... all of the past games in the series. The reason why I can't recommend this 'good game' is that it lacks some major features. First of all there is no two-headed giant game mode. This really shuts out the demographic that enjoys playing team games over free for all.Second you do not unlock cards via multiplayer. This is a major bummer because, I mean heck, MTG is primarily played for its multiplayer component. Forcing people to grind in random CPU matches for more cards is a major frustration. It forces people into the premium shop to buy boosters at 1.99 each... Which brings me to the next issue.Asking players to pay for boosters is one thing, but restricting access to certain cards is another. There are something like 300 cards available for the players to get. 300... Now I understand that the MTG2015 core set only has 269 cards but this is a video game. We should have access to a lot more than just the core set. Even if each expansion cost another 5-10 bucks. Avid MTG fans would pay it. Here you'll find yourself playing against decks with some truly awesome cards.. that you can't get... and in a lot of cases you'll get stomped early on because of this.In the future, if we see lots of restricted cards added to the mix, and multiplayer fixed I'd totally recommend this.

												This game is a step backward for the franchise. Now you can build your own deck, true. But they force you to play this awful campaign... and AI is hardcore + you start to play with a awful deck. No more 2 Vs 2. I think they looked at Hearthstone and decided to copy pay to win method, but forgot to copy some cool things too, like online progress for example. Only one little thing that make me want to play this game is the fact i can play with 4 players. Only this. Nothing more. For better experience, go play real MTG or Hearthstone			"

												Plays better with Alienware? Only if you like seizures. Whoever thought it would be a good idea to make it so your keyboard flashes and changes colors all the time based on steps and what cards are being played didn't decide to also put in a way to turn off those effects in the options. Had to stop playing due to the eyestrain from my keyboard flashing red over and over every combat step.After disabling all keyboard effects outside of the game I was able to continue playing. The game lacks all the features that kept other versions interesting after completing the campaign. Many fan favorite decks such as Slivers are present in the game, but only as AI controlled opponents, with no way to unlock any of those cards for your deck, even with Premium (microtransactions) boosters.

												Just like with real MTG cards, you have to spend you $$$ to get a good deck, UNLESS you grind the same guy over and over again. Even on the lowest level difficulty, prepare to get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked 7/10 times because the AI opponents constantly get miracle draws. The previous game (2013) was bad enough. This is worse. You can't choose from a variety of decks. You start out with ONE weak, WEAK deck and win booster packs though victories over the AI. Once you have unlocked enough cards then you might be able to start actually enjoying this game.Obviously, as usual, WoTC wants you to spend your money. They made this game rediculously difficult in order to get you to spend. Huge dissapointment. I miss 2012.			"

												I'm not giving this a thumbs-down because I expected to get full-blown deckbuilding for free or almost-free.  I'm not giving this a thumbs-down because the interface is absolutely awful and clunky, as has been said a million times already.  I'm not even giving it a thumbs-down because 2-headed giant, the only reason I got into this series of games to begin with, got removed.I'm giving this a thumbs-down because after purchasing all the bits and pieces of the game and unlocking all of the cards in the entire database, I'm still left with gaping holes in my decks while the AIs get to use multitudes of cards that I never can.  The number of multi-color (gold) cards in particular is abysmal.			"

												Far and away the worst iteration of the DotP series. In this version, you ""build"" your own deck and gradually make it stronger or make new decks along the way. The problem is that virtually all the campaign content can be cleared with a single somewhat optimized deck. I changed up my deck once and created one new deck my entire time playing the campaign. In previous versions, half of the fun was trying the pre-made decks and gradually increasing its strength as you unlocked more cards. The other half of the fun was changing up your deck to take advantage of its strengths compared to the enemy encounter.Additionally, this version is missing a lot of content. There are no challenges and there is no two-headed giant or revenge modes. I would estimate that this game has less than half the content of the previous versions. The ""expansion"", Garruk's Revenge, is a complete joke. It took me less than an hour to complete all of it and the rewards are little to none.Lastly, menu screens are completely unintuitive. Perhaps if it wasn't so damn annoying to build a deck (let alone swap your deck), I would have done it more often.2/5 Stars. Very disappointed with this game even after getting it on sale for like $3.			"

												I've been a Magic player for many years, long before any computer games came out.Most of them sadly can't keep up with the game and are poorly excecuted. Overly poorly actually.Negative:- overly slow, turns take literally forever. You play a land and the automatic unskippable system will still guide you through EVERY damn sup-phase till finally you may end your turn to see the computer play ONE LAND and do the same.I am not overly pushy in games but HELL I don't have time for that. Standard games will still take forever thanks to this. - Animatians are unnecessary - please bring Shanara back, that game was from like 1993 and better than any of the new ones.- Deck creation is poorly at best and so limited that I barely can take it. This is one of the biggest parts in Magic gameplay. Sadly even the way you can interact will never come to pass because you are in the Twilight Zone waiting for your round to finish because hey...you played a land. Let's see what you can do.- Weird algorytm with land draw, went through statistics and boy, in 25 years of regular magic play I never had that issue. Increased land cards in decks to ridiculous amounts and still often you end up with three on the starting hand and then 12 rounds go by without ONE other land card....not sure how they actually shuffle the whole thing :D Opponent never has that issue by the way.Recommendation: Get some friends to play Magic, buy cheap commons in your local comic store and enjoy Magic how it should be: With friends, a good drink, some popcorn and FUN.

												After completing the main storyline and exploring all the different planes I'm going to write an honest review. Unlike the majority of the reviews on here I actually enjoyed this game, putting in almost 17 hours since release. I'll go through a few positives and negatives:- Clunky, touch optimized interface- Grindy nature of collecting all the cards- A small subset are premium cards, which you need to buy 14 booster packs to unlock- Forces you to pick a deck at the start without knowing any of the cards, then restricts all customization options until you beat the first plane- Most of the starter decks are borderline unplayable+ Full deck customization i.e. you can make a deck using any of the 976 cards+ Premium cards aren't any more powerful than the normal cards+ Limits each deck to 1 of any mythic, 2 of any rare, 3 of any uncommon and 4 of any common card, so people that have just bought all the cards don't have as much of an advantage+ Multiplayer mode is very funAs you can see there are a lot of negatives for this game. The most frustrating part for me was they should either give you the option to change your deck after you've beaten the tutorial with it, or tell you that your choice was final and you won't ever be able to change it again. Luckily the deck I chose was strong enough to beat the campaign with, but if I'd have been stuck with a garbage deck from the start it would make progressing through the campaign to unlock decent cards almost impossible. You don't get a large enough range of cards to make any actual other types of decks until you've pretty much completed the campaign mode unless you get lucky through boosters. Overall I found the game very fun since I didn't have any problems completing the campaign, and the grind to unlock the cards wasn't that bad for me. I'm really enjoying the large variety of fun decks you can make on this game, and trying them out against people online is very fun. I haven't spent anything more than the original asking price and am having just as much fun competing with people online as I do with the deck's I've spent 100's on MTGO. Of course the game only contains a finite number of cards so the online meta will get figured out soon enough and the game will become stale and boring, but until then I'm getting a lot of value out of the small purchase price.

												Don´t let you fool about that game!I played MTG cardgame quite a loooong time and I´m still fascinated about the game it self. Well I tried the M12 to M14 befor and I was still hoping for some changes. Changes came but not after my wishes. I´m angry like hell cause I bought the complete edition for nothing. After 3h play I deinstalled it cause the menu using is absolutly useless (works better on a Pad) Well I bought the complete edition and guess what...the androide edition is not includet eather noooo there you have to pay around $80 to get it there complete too.Worst is you still can´t build your deck after your wishes, well and you still don´t get all cards and forget to have 4 of them you really want to have. Buying boosterpacks in a complete edition ???Instead of building the game bigger and better, they cut away possibilities you got befor like two headet.I hope that somebody of the publisher read here and take the wishes of the paying gamers seriously cause I will never buy it againe, if just if some remarkeble changes will come and give us the same fealing as we play with real cards. It´s good example for just make money and give a s***t on the gamer just proffit counts.If you really want to play that game then I give you the tip buy it on sale like for 5 bugs as a Ultra diamond edition!

This game just feels empty and missing heart and soul to it.  It has a very clunky and slow interface, obviously made for consoles like the PS4 and XBox. Why people buy those when they can do the samething on pc astounds me. Magic 2015 has left me not wanting to play another Magic video game ever again. There is a lot of cheating on the AI's part. From them always getting the perfect drawns to you just either drawing nothing but lands and nothing good to play or having some decent cards in your hands and not having the lands to play them.

I could care less about the challenges, and all the window dressing many lonely gamers crave in lieux of playing live players. I don't have complaints since in truth all i want are cards to build decks to play my close family and friends that are into magic also. Its a simple want, since launched i've yet been able to play anyone in my friends list. There is a glitch or bug that prevents you from playing friends, the fact that this has never been addressed speaks volumes on the ethics of the people that both made this game 'Stainless' and distributed it ""steam"" Microsoft would have done something if not refund or made the publisher address the issue. This is a reminder of the shady business of PC games. Completely disappointed with this. Save your money.			"

												This game is funtional, but a big step down from last year. All of the extras and other game modes have been stripped away to accomidate custom deck building. Also, a large chunk of the cardpool is now stuck behind an adiitional paywall that didn't exsist in previous versions. Pros:- Custom deckbuilding- Fun campaign- Looks niceCons:- Shallow cardpool- Annoying menus- Paywall preventing you from accessing all the cards- No additional features- CPU opponents get to use fun cards you're not allowed to play with			"

												I've bought DotP the last few years. While it did suck to have limited customization options, it was at least fun to play with the decks.  This has been nothing more than a grind fest so far. I apparently chose a poor starter deck, and have no way of changing. As of now, I will go back to previous versions where I do not have to pay more to have fun.			"

												This year's version of Duels of the Planeswalkers promised more and delivered less than previous iterations.  You get to start out with one deck, and it's a slow grind to build up a large enough collection to make any substamtial changes beyond that.  This game is so micro-transaction heavy that it feels like it should be a free-to-play game.  I basically feel like I payed $10 to play through a commercial for Magic, rather than enjoy a stand-alone game.  Additionally, the promotional booster pack you can redeem isn't even as exciting as it has been in years past.			"

												*This review is written from the perspective of an experienced player in both the paper game and the Duel of the Planeswalkers series.*Magic 2015 is the newest game in the annual Duel of the Planeswalker series. Other than the beautiful yet short cinematics and the fact that the game is a licensed Magic: The Gathering product, there are very few positive things to say about this game.The user-interface is done in a clunky, slide-show format, making only four options visible on the menu at a single time. Numerous game modes present in prior editions have been removed. The Two-Headed Giant (cooperative) format for multiplayer will be the most noticeable for many players, who probably purchased the game for multiplayer games. The Challenges (puzzles) and Revenge Campaign - a second campaign with more difficult opponents, which appears after the completion of the original Campain mode - are also no longer present.The largest and most noticeable change to the game is the way decks are chosen and constructed. The prior editions of DotP contained numerous pre-constructed decks. The player unlocked additional cards for your deck by playing and winning with it. the player would then use the cards you received to improve their deck, win more, and repeat the cycle. In Magic 2015, this is no longer the case. Decks are now individual constructed by the player from a card pool. With every win, you unlock boosters, which contain new cards for your card pool. Besides who makes the deck, it would still seem that the player win cards to improve their deck to win more cards. This is not the case however.One of my favorite parts about the prior DotP games was the pre-constructed decks. The decks were mostly balanced and - barring a few exceptions - almost all of them were playable with zero cards unlocked. This was great for new players. They could learn the mechanics of the game without being punished for lack of experience with deck construction. Many of the decks were well constructed and included cards that I simply cannot afford to play in real life. This was great for experienced players on a budget, such as myself. The deck construction was constricted, but that kind of constriction prevented too large of a metagame from forming. I'll stop lamenting, but I guess my favorite part of the old DotP games is that every deck was playable to everyone, regardless of a player's skill level.With Magic 2015, the player starts the game by choosing a deck archetype composed of two colours. Once the player chooses their deck, they are stuck with it. These are the only cards that they're going to have to play with until deck construction opens up. This is not a good thing for new players, who will be stuck if their skill level is not enough to overcome the handicap of terrible cards. Once a player has won a few matches, they will have unlocked a few booster packs. The cards in the packs by this point will likely not be enough to make a new deck, and if so, not one of any value. In fact, one of my largest issues with the game as a whole was that the card pool was terrible. Green decks have Cultivate, but no Rampant Growth. Red decks have Shock and Bolt of Keranos, but no Lightning Bolt. Black decks have Assassinate, but no Doom Blade. Griselbrand is all but unplayable in a Black-Green deck designed to get him onto the field.Regardless of how terrible the cards in the card pool comes my other large issue with the game - the metagame. The other DotP games had a metagame, but it is much more mild than the metagame of Magic 2015. This game's metagame is similar to that of Block constructed. In time, only certain decks will be viable in multiplayer, making multiple other decks and cards unplayable. By creating a card pool with flexibility, Wizards of the Coast only limited the amount of playable cards even further.If you want other decks to be useful, then you may have to pay. Pay real life cash. Monocolour decks benefit greatly from their respective Paragon, and a Five colour deck is only justifiable with Maelstrom Angel. These cards are only available in a Premium Booster, which are two dollars a piece with no other way to unlock them. I would have rather payed $20 for a game with all of the card unlockable in game, than $10 for a less than complete game. If you want a card game where your cards are determined by chance, you have infinite flexibility of card construction, a strict metagame, and pay real money for cards then play Magic the Gathering Online. It has all of that and more.In short, Magic 2015 falls short of Magic 2014 by trying to be Magic Online. Magic 2015 has less features, a terrible card pool, a strict metagame, and a pay to win mentality. It is neither a true DotP game or MTGO/MODO. If you want to play real Magic in a digital format, then invest in MTGO/MODO. If you want to play a smooth game with smooth decks, get Magic 2014.Positive: - Beautiful cinematics - Magic: The Gathering licensingDrawbacks: - Poor user interface - Poor deck construction - Poor card pool - Locked content - Removed cooperative multiplayer - Removed Revenge campaign  - Removed challenge feature			"

												I've enjoyed this game, quite a bit considering the price, however your mileage may vary and if you've never enjoyed a Magic duel previously there's a number of things which should give you pause:- The user interface is aggravatingly slow.- Features from previous iterations are missing and card variety could be improved.On the upside you can now build your own deck however you like and this is rewarding. The system of grinding out boosters isn't as bad as some have made it sound - there are at least four exploration battles in each area and they're quite varied.In the end however I cannot give this game a recommendation - those who will enjoy this game will likely buy it anyway, and the rest of you need to be warned.

												I would not recommend this game as the mechanics are now based completely around pay to play just to experience all of the game. You get to start with one deck that has no preview but a brief description, and buying the card collection is a waste of money bordering on a scam. There are no gods or planeswalkers, just a smattering of random cards and the best of them are still not unlocked they require you to buy premium packs to unlock them. Buying the complete card unlock gives you 87% of the cards in the game, I believe that's using the term ""complete"" and ""collection"" a little loosely.			"

												I bought this game thinking it would be a continuation on the immense amount of fun I had with Magic 2014, but that is not the case. Whereas the previous game has several decks that you could choose to play at anytime, in this game you choose a deck after the tutorial and if you don't like it then tough luck. Seriously, I chose White/Black after finishing, played a few games with it, decided to change and was astounded to learn that you can't. The only way to play other colours after making your choice is to unlock more cards but you only unlock 3 after a victory. So, I wont be playing any more of this until that is fixed and I can choose any of the starter decks. In addition, the menu interface is appalling, phases take forever and the whole experince feels like a cash grab rather than an MTG game like the previous.If you're for an introduction to magic: the gathering, get Magic 2014, NOT this.

												To begin, I like the idea of being able to completely create my decks, exactly how I want them and not limited by a theme set.That being said, this game perplexingly manages to fail where it used to succeed.1.) Having to pick ONE beginning deck and being stuck with it is beyond ridiculous.  If you make a bad choice the only way to escape this quagmire is to buy ""Premium packs"" from WOTC.   While I made a good choice for my first deck, some of my friends did not.  They're stuck in situations where they can either lose every game they try to play to unlock cards, or they can purchase these Premium packs.  To me, this sems like nothing more than an underhanded attempt to extort more money out of players.2.) They removed the Two-Headed Giant option.  This feature was the entire reason I played the game.  If I had known this had been removed, I never would have purchased the game.  Lesson learned: Read Reviews.  I feel fairly confident this was ono of the most popular features of the game, so its removal perplexes me.3.) The aforementioned Premium packs contain cards that are inaccessible otherwise.  While I applaud later expansions adding new decks to the game, the initial purchase should allow the player to have ACCESS to the entire game (minus foils and other fluff features that some may choose to spring for).  If someone wants to pay to unlock cards without having to ""grind"" for them, that option should be available as well.Overall, I view this edition as little more than a money grab, and quite frankly flipping off the player base.  Do not buy unless WOTC significantly addresses these issues.			"

												This is by far the worst duels of the planeswalkers created to date.  The series used to consist of fun synergistic decks in which you could unlock rare cards to make them more powerful.  Now you start with your choice of mediocre deck in the colors you prefer.  Youre starting deck will look like a typical draft or sealed deck.  As you progress through the campaign you unlock boosters (which may not have rares) in which to improve your deck.  The first half hour or so is fun but magic players tend to quickly get bored of playing the same weak deck over and over.  The opponents decks are much more crafted and synergistic.  The overall card pool is far to small to be able to make any cool fun to play decks.  At most you will have 2 of a particular rare and 1 of a particular mythic rare.  Any deck you create will play out as a bunch of random cards that for the most part do not complement each other.  The in-match interface is the usual clean and simple arcade design we are used to though the rest of the interface during deck construction, options etc.. is somewhat clunky and difficult to use.  Another feature which is oddly missing is the 2 headed giant.  Many people found this game style to be the main reason they purchased Duels to begin with.  Overall I would give this game a 4/10 and would label it as a do not buy.			"

												I've been playing MtG in both paper and digital form since it came out and want to love this release, but I can't. As all have already noted there is something very off with the interface. That coupled with:1) ""DLC""-content which can't be obtained by just playing, actually masking the cost of the real game: It's not even a real dlc - it's the rest of the game that you never got when you originally purchased it.2) removed multiplayer modes from what previousley existed.3) strange everlasting GUI transitions.4) a matter of taste, but imho the current card sets included are also underwhelming compared to previous releases. This is however highly subjective.5) cards are constantly moved vertically every time there is a fight for no reason whatsoever. Disasterous graphics design call...Don't get me wrong: I will still play this game. I still like it. I just don't think the ""free deckbuilding"" that is the only thing new in this release compensates for all the other issues. All in all the previous 2014 version is superior from my perspective, and if you are choosing between which to pick up stick to 2014.			"

												To sum things up:Playing this game is a frustrating experience. At times I can really sense that there's a very good game at the core of everything, but sadly, it's all hidden behind a horrible framework and strange design decisions. The game seems stuck trying to emulate the original card-game, but failing horribly by not adapting well to digital standards and the current market expectations of players.Things I like:- Deck-building is simple and a welcome ""addition"" to the digtial version of Magic.- Good AI. I've rarely seen it pull off bone-headed moves and it's decently challenging. It does ""cheat"" during some campaign missions, but I'm not really bothered about it.- There's a lot of different cards, rules and concepts used in this game and you can combine in fun and interesting ways.- Nice art; almost all cards are well painted and the graphics are well done in general. The interface is also(visually) clean and simple.- Fairly cheap, unless you start spending money on Premium cards or unlocking ""free"" cards early on.Thigns I dislike:- The incredibly dorky and uninteresting story. Apparently I saved the world by the end(or a plane?), but I don't really care.- Unpractical and sluggish Menu-system. Feels more like a poorly made conversion from a tablet-version than a proper PC-version. It's frustrating how the mousescroll and the keyboard don't always work, and buttons often don't react the first time you click on them.- You won't be having a good time for the first half of the game unless you're persistent or managed to pick a good starting deck. How will you know which deck that's good? You won't, unless you look for external sources.- Lack of information and explanations of several rules, mechanics and cards. I know there's A LOT to cover here, but the in-game tutorial can't prepare you in any good way for what's to come.- Several cards that would have complemented my play style very well would have to be unlocked by paying for a chance at the premium lottery store. This business-model is still a horrible idea.- You can only unlock cards by playing the single-player campaign and random encounters against the AI, forcing you to a dull and fairly uninteresting grind if you want most of the cards.- Some features don't seem to work correctly. For instance, I've received at least two achievements on steam that I didn't actually deserve to unlock, at least according to their description. The online matchmaking also seems to have problems connecting me to games - I only succeed at about every third or fourth attempt.- Using the same graphics for several cards. I know this is a minor gripe, but it feels rather sloppy considering the huge bank of material that this developer must have access to. I'm pretty sure someone could dig up another image of some frog to use on that other card, instead of using a duplicate.			"

												In short, this game feels worse than each of its predecesors, and feels like it added one major feature while striking others.  This net change feels like regress rather than progress.  The game still offers some fun, but I can see it getting very stale very fast.Pros:Magic: the GatheringCustom Deck BuildingThe pool of cards is fairly close to those that are currently standard-legal in the paper game.  The set pulls heavily from Return to Ravnica, Theros, and Magic 2015.Cons:Arguably worse than DotP 2012, 2013, and 2014. (Did not really play the original).The UI is painfully sluggish, and is less efficient than previous iterations.Though one can manually change how mana taps, the AI is less intuitive with its automatic mana tapping than before.  I've seen it tap all of my mana of a color and leave open a color I didn't have spells for.The base card pool feels very lacking.  I have not yet pin-pointed why.To unlock premium cards, one must buy boosters which contain random cards.  I personally find this annoying as one can pay $2 with no guarantee that the card (or any card at all) that they desire will be included.The only multiplayer versions are Free For All with varying numbers of players.  This gets boring really fast to me. I consider Magic: The Gathering to be a major hobby of mine, and I have enjoyed the past DotP games despite any faults.  However, this game feels like such a downgrade, it's very hard to enjoy.  Plus, the game feels boring after a surprisingly short period. "

												This game is not worth the money, do not invest. Magic is a great game and there are far better uses of 10 dollars than this poorly designed mess. You deck is and always will be far weaker then any deck the A.I. is playing, while you cast a Guild gate and a 3/3 for 3 that does nothing the computer is playing Tropical Islands and Bayous using them to play real cards that do something. The story is laughably short maybe 5 hours total if you aren't just restarting over and over trying to win a duel.The unlocking of cards would have been cool assuming that you had any real amount of cards to unlock that would make your deck far better but as it stands there are very few cards in each color that make it worth building a deck in that color. and if you still are determined to buy this game I'll offer one bit of advice. Build a Black Green deck that runs Spider spawning and Nemesis of Mortals that mills you. Probably the strongest deck in this entire game. (At least until they add more cards to this game)			"

												Easily the weakest of the DotP series. The starting pool of cards is so weak that it makes the intro packs they make for the paper format seem top tier. To remedy this, you can grind for booster packs by replaying the same encounters over and over. It's much harder than in the previous games where you were given viable pre-built decks that you could use from start to finish of the campaign. This can be made to seem as a ""plus"", Magic 2015 having more an emphasis on deck building than previous titles, but with the weak starting pool of cards, and the little synnergy amongst them, I'd rather just play the earlier title and learn the game with a competent deck.

												Cards are locked through paywall, and the campign is either terribly easy or, like the last boss, incredibly hard as they have the same cards everytime (which are cards you can never get btw). The lack of 2HG is disappointing as well. I saw other bad reviews but I thought hey, couldn't be that bad right? Wrong. Additionally, any time you want to go make changes to your deck it takes almost a minute to cycle through the menu and watch the animations, which gets annoying after a while. The mana management AI is terrible also, so make sure (if you do buy the game) to go switch auto-land off ASAP. Finally, you can only have one deck ""equipped"" at any one time, so if you want to switch decks you have to through the menu.			"

												Cards are locked through paywall, and the campign is either terribly easy or, like the last boss, incredibly hard as they have the same cards everytime (which are cards you can never get btw). The lack of 2HG is disappointing as well. I saw other bad reviews but I thought hey, couldn't be that bad right? Wrong. Additionally, any time you want to go make changes to your deck it takes almost a minute to cycle through the menu and watch the animations, which gets annoying after a while. The mana management AI is terrible also, so make sure (if you do buy the game) to go switch auto-land off ASAP. Finally, you can only have one deck ""equipped"" at any one time, so if you want to switch decks you have to through the menu.			"

												The IDEA of deck building is sweet. That's it. It gets frustrating once you know you cannot build any kind of deck since some cards can only be unlocked by paying more. Might as well place back the $20 price tag rather than these microtransaction.			"

												Manages to somehow be even worse than the lackluster Magic 2014 by removing features that have become a series staple (such as Two-Headed Giant, both local and online) and restricting access to cards behind a paywall of microtransactions. The best cards in the game are blocked off behind $2 a pop for premium boosters, so players who have dished out cash for these will always win online matches. Deck building is something fans have wanted for a while, and while it works in itself, it is extremely limited, almost as much as the atrocious sealed play in the last instalment. Once you choose a colour you are locked down to it, and you must build a deck focused around that and one more colour. This cannot be changed. You can create a new deck using unique colours, but with the small amount of useful cards you pick up from random boosters (one per victory) these decks will inevitably lose every time. Besides these drawbacks, the user interface is slow and clearly designed around a tablet device. Transitions and loading times are appaling and the game is bland and dull to look at. Swiping through icons for every menu choice should never be a feature in ANY PC game. There are also significant problems with the AI - some blatantly cheat and use cards that are unavailable in the game. When a loss comes from a lack of fairness the game becomes incredibly frustrating and even less fun to play. This is a joke of a game - a truly pathetic, lazy attempt to please fans who have demanded full deck customisation for years. Well, they gave it to us, but they also took away everything else. With Hearthstone being as popular and well received as it is, this game needed to be great to compete, and it is not.			"

												Eh, it's okay. If you already really like Magic and are the kind of fellow who bought every single other DotP game, you're gonna be addicted by this until you've got every single card unlocked (too bad there's the unholy Premium set which costs a small fortune to unlock). However, you will also be very frustrated because this installment in the series is in a lot of ways inferior to the others. In either case, I wouldn't really recommend this game. If you're new, I urge you to buy DotP 2012, instead. The decks in that one are the best - there are some really awesome decks in that game.And that already leads me to the biggest problem with this one, in my view. There are enough people who have written about the abysmal way the game starts you off (which, by no doubt, is designed that way to make you pay money to unlock cards quicker). It is abysmal. And it also leads me to my main problem - the card pool is severely limited.I have picked the Black/Red deck at the beginning of the game. It was based around stealing creatures and sacrificing them. One of the best things about Magic in general (and, notably, the other DotPs) is that you get to improve the strengths of your deck as you go along and collect cards. I eventually saw that I was unable to do that. Sure, I got stronger cards which made my deck stronger - but only very few cards improved on the theme of my deck. Eventually, I simply won because I got to draw and play those strong cards, not because I utilized the mechanics and themes of my deck to their fullest. I thought that I just had poor luck with my booster. I didn't. There simply were almost no cards at all which built on that theme. The best permanent card which allows you to sacrifice creatures was already in the deck. As I found out about that fact, I abandoned the deck and made a series of other decks, which all disappointed me in the same way - there was little possible interaction between the cards, or the interaction was simply too weak to hold up against the extremely powerful decks you fight in the campaign. Even if you just want to make a powerful deck with strong cards, you will find that, for some unknown reason, certain mana ranges only have rather weak or situational cards to offer. Eventually, I managed to make a deck I had fun playing, and also was able to win with, by combining three different colors so as to have more choice in cards (something which I highly recommend if you find yourself in the same position I was in).The card pool is cripplingly small. By now, I have unlocked every non-Premium card and have already taken a closer look at the cards available. A lot of really popular and neat card archetypes just simply aren't there at all, or are extremely underrepresented to the point that their corresponding cards aren't only very poor representatives of their archetypes, but will also take you a long time to find in the first place. Since I have always heavily prefered Red and Black over the other colors, I mainly noticed which of their archetypes fall into this category; these would be: black reanimation, black sweepers, big black demons which require sacrifice, red board-changing sorceries, red sweepers, red creatures which come back from the graveyard, etc. But I have also noticed that decent blue card draw is very hard to come by - let that sink in for a moment.Let's go back to DotP 2013. The decks weren't quite as good as DotP 2012's, but I still clearly remember some of the decks in that game (while I remember none at all from Magic 2014, on a side note). That game made me learn to appreciate Phoenix creatures, and I had turned into a bit of a fan of them. They may not be very impressive as you initially play them, but as the game goes on, you'll be more than happy to find a Phoenix in your graveyard, and some of them lend themselves to some really tricky plays. There's nothing at all which resembles that archetype in Magic 2015, not in Red, not really in any other color, either.To add insult to injury, if you play the game on the harder difficulty settings, your opponents will have access to strictly better cards than you have. Sometimes, you may find yourself facing off againt a deck using a similar theme as you are, but with much, much better cards, and more cards to fit the theme.There is also a lack of just plain gimmicky cards. There are very few cards which would lend themselves to have a deck built around them. Give me Coat of Arms or Adaptive Automaton and I will build a deck around whatever creature type I like. Eh, probably not, since I could only put two of either one into the deck because of how the deck building is limited in that regard - you may have 4 of the same Common card, but only 3 of the same Uncommon, 2 of the same Rare, only 1 of each Mythic Rare.In fact, there's very few cards which promote any creature type. From the top of my head, I only remember there being some cards promoting vampire creatures, for some bizarre reason, and also one card making beasts stronger. There's also a creature which makes goblins worse, so there's that.Even the Premium set sucks. There's some interesting cards, but also some really bizarre picks. The Premium set seems to be aimed to promote mono-colored decks, but with the most boring of cards - cards which simply say they promote a certain color, but don't really fit their color. There's no fun in Mono-Black without Corrupt.Take it from a maniac who has unlocked everything in the game - the card pool sucks and you won't have a lot of fun with it.			"

												DOTP 2015 changes several things about the DOTP experience.  Some are for the better, but overall, I think the series took a step backward with this installation.  The new single-player card collecting experience is nice, but restricting some of the best cards to microtransactions leaves a very bad taste in my mouth, making it difficult to recommend the game overall.So, let's talk about the game.  Well, it's magic.  There's a great variety of cards and the ""booster collection"" system actually lets you put together a deck of your own creation, rather than relying on the premade deck templates of the previous series.  Unfortunately, this system is let down by some arbitrary limitations, both in the variety of cards, and how many of each card can be unlocked.The menus are preposterously slow.  They look fancy, sure, but it quickly becomes frustrating to navigate the menus as you have to watch the wispy animations.  Hell, it takes the game about 10 seconds to get to the main menu after you click ""start"" on the title screen.  There's just no reason for this.The core game is good though if you're a fan of MTG.  The duel interface is great as always.  There are a variety of encounters in the single player experience and the acquisition of boosters does a nice job if creating a sense of progression.  One criticism I might levy - which could be said to some extent of all DOTP - is that increasing the difficulty really just makes it so that the AI has ungodly luck.  That is to say, if their deck has an answer to a card you just played, it's a surefire bet that they will draw it in short order.  It definitely amounts to an increase in difficulty, but it never feels like you get outplayed; it just feels like you lost to impossible luck, and that can be frustrating.Now, perhaps the most vehement criticism levied against this game is that it is pay to win, and to an extent, I would tend to agree.  While there are some very good cards that you can collect in the single player experience, the premium booster packs (purchased with real money) contain several extremely powerful bombs.  While these cards may not win a duel by themselves, there is an obvious difference in a deck without them than a deck with them.  For example, G/W tokens with doubling season is far scarier to me than G/W tokens without doubling season.So, I will say that as a fan of MTG I enjoyed the single-player experience.  I liked the card collecting and the ability to create my own decks.  But overall I have to recommend passing this one up; I think the previous DOTPs were superior, and the money-grab scheme in DOTP 2015 leaves a sour taste in my mouth.			"

But here is the real kicker, you cant even use the boosters you buy until you beat the Nearly Impossible Avacyn level.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! This game is pay to win! So many things wrong with this game. The number one issue is this... You can start with only hybrid decks with little to NO synergy. The first person you duel against in campaign mode is far superior to you in every way. The only way to beat any of these guys is pure luck. Their decks are setup to counter your every move. Your chances of winning are pretty much 20:1.  When you do win you only get 3 random cards, that may or may not be for the hybrid deck you picked. After you struggle to beat the 4 guys in each tier you can do a random encounter for that tier that will reward you with more cards. The issue here, your deck is still as basic as it can be. These guys youre facing will again be far superior to you. Also you cant attempt to build a deck to beat them for two reasons: 1) you still have crap cards 2) you have no idea which one you'll get so it is impossible to build a strategy. By this point you will be so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at how crappy your deck is you will have no choice but to buy the complete collection of cards for $19.

												I've purchased 13, 14, and now 15..  I love the deck building ability of 15. I hate the fact that they took away plane chase and two headed giant from multiplayer.  I bought this so I could teach a friend to play Magic, and was looking forward to playing two headed giant to help them better understand the game, since we live 1800 miles apart.  Now they'll need to pick up an older verison of the game so we can do two headed giant.  As previously stated the deck you ""start"" with, is very important as it'll be the deck you are forced to use for a bit, until you've opened several booster packs to alter it.  That should be better explained and maybe allow players to browse through the deck to see if its something they'll enjoy playing.  Overall I can't recommend this game, I want to, and probably could if more multiplayer options were available.			"

												Being a big fan of the previous MTG online games, I preordered this game, god do I regret it now, I thought the 10 dollar price was really nice for what I was getting. Where do I even start, they removed the most played format, where previous MTG online games had things such as Archenemy, or planechase, you get my gist, there is none. No extra format and they even removed one. They've said its because it did not look well with the current design of the board, and that certain card interactions was too good. I can understand the second point, whereas the first being a terrible excuse.Even then, you do not remove such a feature for that reason, if you don't like the OP card interactions that can be made, its still better than removing such a beloved feature, far better.The menu is absolutely abysmal, there is white everywhere, at all parts of the game, even after transition froma dark cinematic, which hurt my eyes. It is terribly wonky and slow to navigate with tablets being in mind and not the most used way to play it, computer. The fact that they try to make it work well on tablet is great, but again, really not the way to go. They could at least have made a few adjustments to the PC title.There is still so much bad I could say about this game, but I am going to stop beating around the bush and get to the worst feature of the game, saving the best for last.The microtransaction system. Previous titles let you pay a minor amount of money to unlock the entire deck instantly instead of unlocking cards for winning with the deck. As well as paying to get those cards in foil. They'd put a slightly higher charge, but nothing extreme on new decks added after the release of the game, long enough to justify releasing additional decks, as well as expansions. Sounds great to me. Previous titles had codes that'd be released now and then to unlock cards for all the decks. Accessible for everyone as far as I know.This time around, they have put a incredibly high charge on unlocking all the cards you can unlock from playing the campaign, not too bad, no need to buy that really. But they have added promo packs, 15 packs at about 2€ or whatever currency you use. Bumping the DAY ONE price for full content in the game up to 40€. As well as breaking multiplayer mode for people who are not willing to invest more money into the game. Even if you are a long time fan of the online Magic series, do not get this game.			"

												The UI is slower and clunkier, the campaign was more interesting, but at the same time was infuriatingly unbalanced at times - not because the opponents had powerful cards, but because they had coherent decks.That's actually the inherent problem with this game - you see, unlike the previous entries, it now offers complete customization of your decks, which is a ""step up"" but with the pitifully limited library of cards and limited number of copies of the more powerful cards, you soon realize that, sure you can make your deck however you want, but in the end it's not really how you actually want.DotP 2014 sent you in with a prebuilt deck with coherent themes and strategies - DotP 2015 sends you in with a janky pile of commons and uncommons that ultimately aren't as interesting, powerful or exciting in any way.Again, you can make your deck however you want, you just have to do it with the pile of junk they've seen fit for you to be allowed to use.Infuriatingly more still, some of the most exciting cards are locked behind a premium barrier - seriously, you pay for the game, but you have to pay more for some of the more decent cards.Rather than making a unique and interesting game, we get ""starter deck simulator 2015"". Save the $10 and go play some FNM.			"

												This game is a major step down from last years iteration, forcing you to pick a color set immediately after the tutorial with no warning that from then on those are the cards you have until you spend hours upon hours of playing the games new ""Explore Mode"" which from what I've seen is just an infinite battle against AI to earn packs of mostly weak or duplicate cards. Or alternatively you give in to the era of microtransactions and pay your way to having cards that you actually want to play with.			"

												At this time I cannot recommend this game because I cannot join friends matches, and my friends can't join mine.  Some serious patches need to happen fast.  The single player game is great if you like fighting predictable decks, and they are finally allowing us to build any kind of deck we want from scratch.  Some people are complaining that they are getting their asses kicked too much and can't get through the campaign, but they probably don't know how to synergize with the cards they have.  I've spent $10 and have unlocked 90% of the cards so far and have no problems with that aspect of the game.  The only other complaint I have is a couple of the mechanics don't work properly such as deathtouch + first strike.  Any card you throw at them will die before you touch them because they are proccing the deathtouch before the damage is settled.  If you have a 999/999 creature vs a 1/1 deathtouch first striker, the 999/999 creature dies and does 0 damage to the 1/1...Another rule broken is that the computer can have as many orange legendary cards on the field that they want.  It is normally limited to just 1 at a time.  More of an annoyance than anything to me.  For $10 I have gotten plenty of fun out of it so far, but that will only last for so long if I can't play with my friends.UPDATE  I have now spent $8 on the booster decks and have 50% of the premium cards...  so for another $10 I should have 100%.  So for $30 you get everything in the game if you buy the $10 base + $20 for 10 boosters, you have everything.  About the price of a full priced game.  No biggie.OMG MICROTRANSACTIONS!!!  PAY 2 WIN!!!   lol  Whatever...			"

												Somehow the interface for each version of this game keeps getting -worse-.  The in-game menu takes far longer to load than you would expect, and navigating it to figure out what you want to do next requires memorizing blurry pictures.  Pretty silly and annoying, but only $10.00 US.  And it's magic: TG.  Maybe I should buy an Xbox to play it properly.There should be a ""maybe"" button for if it's recommendable.   I guess pay to play features wouldn't be so annoying if the menu was navigable, though I'd be damned if I were to buy a booster pack like it's 1995. :P			"

												I decided to write this review because of the huge number of strange decisions the developers took on this game, and because I find this game really controversial and find myself really torn in my opinion about it.I play it and will play it, especially if the multiplayr manages not to completely die, but more on that soon..First of all, the huge letdowns - The card amount is actually really low which dissapoints me a lot, and the amount of multicolored cards is shocking, as there is only 1 for each 2 color combination, I dont really understand that decision.And to get to the worst, and I now fear ultimate downside to this game, no 2 headed giant mode.It feels like such a sucker punch by the makers, and complete lack of interest in player feedback, to simply not include a favourite mode like that in this game.And as a result of this, the game's multiplayer is pretty dead, at times, there are like 20 games in total, but at the time of the writing for example, it was only three 1 vs 1 games and thats it.And lastly, the game menu is a disaster. When you start the game, you have to press ""Start"" to get to main menu.Well, I manage to press ""Start"" 5 or 6 times before it decides to react, it is that unresponsive, and the entire game menu navigation is cluttered by useless animations that slow the progress of getting to where you want down, and it is annoying to say the least..As a person who owns every Magic game so far, Im just sad based on how the makers approach player feedback, or rather, how they ignore it, and sad to see what they do with this franchise, as it would deserve a quick responsive menu, larger selection of cards, and great choice of game modes, not actually lesser number of them than before.. There are good points about this game too, mainly the single player part which is pretty varied and can test you against all kinds of gamestyles.And of course the fact you can make any deck you want, any combination of colours and cards you have, and any number of decks except, as I mentioned before, the total amount of cards to choose from is in my opinion dissapointing.Based on everything said above, I cannot really recommend this game right now for anyone who would expect a great multiplayer experience. It is fun to play but it can get really hard to impossible to play a mp game.I for example prefer to play 4 player game instead of the missing 2HG mode and thats the least played, and as a result, sometimes I simply dont get to play it when I want to because there is no one playing it, not very good for a game just released..If you were a single player only player however, you may still want to consider it.Rating for SP players only - 75/100 -Fun gameplay but you may wish there was more cards to choose from, bad sluggish menu may annoy you, but the gameplay may still be worth it.Rating for players expecting a full Magic SP and MP experience 55/100 -Missing 2HG mode, very low amount of games hosted at the time of the review, a disastrously annoying menu navigation on a pc, and last, but not least for me on win 7, 6core phenom cpu, 8gb ram and Gigabyte 7950 HD 3gb gpu, a shocking amount of crashes, mostly during menu navigation, so anyone with a similar pc setup beware.

												Probably the worst of the series so far :(It really sucks that in addition to the unlockable card sets from the base game itself, there are a set of premium cards only available via micro transactions. With the already small card pool to build your decks it is kinda disappointing. Not to mention the premium cards are a lot of the times better aswell.Also no 2v2 or any kind of puzzles/challenges to solveIt can still be enjoyable with some friends but I wouldn't buy the game full price			"

The sound effects alone want to make me quit the game. The UI programmers need to be shot.There's only 1 deck to start with and the cards available to construct other decks out of are terrible. This makes the game very hard unless the player spends money on more boosters.During play the turns seem slow and sluggish. The game should be snappy and quick.Such a fall from the M14 game.

												Overall Score: 4/10Graphics: 2/2 - Love the minimalism!Gameplay: 0/2 - We got what we wanted and it sucks, people.Story/Content: 1/2 - I like the story, miss the challengesControls: 1/2 - Auto-tapping sucks, some of the functions are gummed up based on phase.Bonus Points: 0/2 - Sorry, Wizards, you dun f'd up.Current recommendation: Flip-flopped over to ""Don't recommend"" (Again)What is my opinion on Magic 2015? I have very mixed feelings about it.First off, I love the Duels of the Planeswalkers series. Most of my friends are too “poor” (or just cheap) to get into actual paper Magic with me. The closest FNM location to me is almost an hour drive away and I end up spending more of fuel than I do paying at the door. A group of acquaintances play regularly but they're too casual, and that's coming from a casual player. So while I enjoy collecting Magic cards I seldom have anyone of my same caliber to play with. DotP is great for my friends an I because while they can't afford to spend the money necessary to build a strong deck, they can buy this game though sales or ask for it as a gift. In short, this is how I get my Magic fix.Over the past few installments there have been some serious changes. Starting with D12, the game didn't allow you to remove cards from the base deck, meaning if you wanted to add anything you'd end up with a 60+ card deck, and the balance was chaotic (but still fun). D13 introduced a far more balanced environment to play in, as well as the ability to truly change each deck any way you wanted, removing base cards and replacing them with newly unlocked ones. D14's balance and deck structures were a step down from those of D13, but the game had a more story focused approach and featured the Sealed Play game mode which paved the way for D15.And lo, D15 is finally here.Typical of Wizards, information on the game was either sketchy or non-existent. I had to take everything I heard about the game with a dose of salt. A few things caught my eye, those being the entire game would be run in the Sealed format and 2HG wasn't going to be in the game. Hooray for the first, boo for the second. These opened up a flood of questions: How do we unlock cards? How does the campaign work? What do I do if I unpack really bad cards? WHY ARE YOU REMOVING TWO-HEADED GIANT?Wizards score for answering these questions before the release: 0-4Moral of the story being don't expect much from the Wizards PR department when it comes to DotP.Even with these and many more questions looming about, I still pre-ordered the game. Thankfully, when the game was released most of these questions solved themselves. As the game begins, you are placed into a tutorial that walks you though the five colors, creatures, instants/soceries, enchantments, artifacts, lands, etc., etc. This tutorial is clearly for new players, but I appreciated it none the less. At the end of the tutorial, the player picks from any two combinations of colors. I opted for Black/Red, but not before I experimented with each of the combinations. For some reason, Wizards decided that the final fight in the tutorial should be hard as balls, especially if you're on Planeswalker difficulty. Not fun. Once you finally muscle your way through that, though, the game is much more enjoyable.Upon defeating the tutorial, the next chapter in the campaign is unlocked and ready to play. The player travels to Innistrad and duels several different challengers themed around that plane. For some reason, the first challenge in this chapter was the hardest for me, which was very discouraging considering you have very few options as far as deck editing are concerned. As you progress through the chapter, you unlock several booster packs which add 1 or 3 cards to your pool (which makes finishing the chapter much more manageable) until you beat the final boss of that level. Once Innistrad is complete, the player is allowed to open any Premium boosters they have purchased (More on these later.)Moving on from Innistrad, the player has the option of tackling the Theros chapter or returning to the main menu to edit their deck or even create a new one with the cards they have unlocked so far (Finally!).As soon as the player finishes the Innistrad chapter, the game truly begins. Your options as far as deck creation widen, you can farm for booster unlocks, change your persona and title, or battle others online. However, pushing past both the tutorial and Innistrad can be very disheartening, so I encourage any of you who are hung up on this part to continue giving it your all until the real game begins.Now. Let's tackle a few of the negative comments on the game I've seen so far:Two-Headed GiantYes, there's no 2HG mode in the game, which sucks. However, the public outcry at this during the development was severe, and I can't imagine Wizards won't throw us a bone and add it as a DLC or expansion.Premium Boosters (AKA Pay-2-Win Boosters)Yes. They're pay to win. Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. These boosters cost $1.99 and unlock 10 new cards for you, featuring a few you can't get from regular boosters. Playing the campaign without them is hard, but read my comments on Card Collections first.Card CollectionsIn the store you can purchase each of the five card collections (Innistrad, Ravnica, Theros, Zendikar, and Shandalar) which will unlock all of the non-premium cards from that collection for you without having to grind them. I pre-ordered the edition of the game that came with these collections, and I highly regret it. Grinding out boosters is a part of the game, just like playing to win boosters from FNM is a part of the experience of paper Magic. Now read “Card Collections or Premium Boosters?”Card Collections of Premium Boosters?As I said, the cards came unlocked for me, which I regret. Personally, I enjoy the part of the game where you have to grind out new cards to improve your deck, and I really really miss that. I would actually recommend buying Pay-2-Win Boosters over purchasing a Card Collection.The card pool is too small!Yes, the card pool is pretty small, but that's what expansions are for! In the past games, Wizards has released expansions featuring several new decks to play with. Since there aren't per-constructed decks for you to use, I'm calling it now: Wizards will release expansions featuring new Card Collections for players to unlock!Edit 1:As I continue to derp about with deck creation, I keep thinking to myself how limited the pool is. There are a few combinations that work really well, such as BR Control/Sacrifice, GW Landfall, Pure U Control, and even BW Lifegain. The problem is once you've seen that particular strategy, there's not much you can do to create a better variation of that. Now, some of the different strategies are really fun to mess with, like Pyxis of Pandamonium Landfall, or RGU/UBR Defender, but they get old pretty fast. I've started equating this to playing paper Magic within only one expansion. Right now, D15 only has the first part of a three part expansion (I hope, anyway), so it's like playing with only Return to Ravnica or Theros expansion cards, leaving out the rest of the block. The more I play, the more I want to reinstall D13. Heck, I'd even reinstall D14 for the custom mod decks.The sad, sad irony of D15 is that this is EXACTLY what the player base has been asking for. In my opinion, DotP should stay as far away from MTGO as possible, but MTGO could be made to look a little more like DotP.			"

												So far Magic 2015 is worst of the whole series. TL;DR spend your money instead on the real Magic the Gathering Online, or play Magic 2014. Pros:+Customizable deck, if you have the cards.+Better card library than in previous ones.+Couple new cool cards.Cons:- Two-headed giant has been removed. Only FFA for 2-4 players.- No preview to initial deck selection.- Menu navigation is horrible.- The cards you get from the ""free"" boosters are mostly crap, and you're lucky if you get one or two cards that fit to your deck.- Practically you play only with one deck, which evolves as you play and add new cards.- No planeswalker theme decks.- Making good decks is hard because solid and consistent deck requires 3-4 copies of certain key cards, and obtaining those cards is very long process.- Once you choose your starting deck (and colours) you are pretty much married to it long time.- Pay to win.

												This game has all of its promise in the Multiplayer aspect, and there are some things they improved upon since 2014, but overall they just made it pretty bad.- Unneeded timers for everything- No choosing how you want to spend your mana if you run different colored lands.- As opposed to 2014 which had matches that were either designed to where you had to think, it has matches that are all gimmicks that, in order to beat, you need either good cards that counter that gimmick, or serious luck.- The only way to get cards in this game that you want, is to play the campaign, which is not appealing at all- The card sets for DLC dont even tell what the set focuses onOverall, this game gets a bump down from me.

												I've been playing Magic since 1995 and the Duel of the Planeswalker games since the first edition.All of them have had their Pros/Cons but they've all been fun and well worth the value.. until now.I don't know what happened with 2015 but it's horrible. The interface is annoying and clunky. It forced me into the first round of the tutorial before I was able to find the 'skip' button. You are forced to choose 1 starting deck with no information on it other than a very vague description and the colors. That's where the real problem is, the starting deck IS AWFUL. You will be frustrated out of the gate with how horribly underpowered your cards are. Giving you bad cards does not make the game challenge it makes it unfun and annoying. You will be constantly conceding out of the box as you will need to get a near-perfect draw to be competitive with the AI. Even then sometimes you will have a good inital draw then flame out too quickly afterwards and have to start over yet again. Anyone who's played magic knows that luck is involved but with a decent deck the unlucky draws are somewhat minimalized. When you have just crap cards then you are fighting an uphill battle from the start.I suspect all of this is caused by the new deck building / microtransaction system. Yes the one thing I always pined for in previous versions was a decent deck builder and finally we have it.. but at the cost of needing to get a constant flow of cards to make the game playable. You have 2 options to get cards.. you can win them by sludging through the game with your horrible starting deck or you can buy them. I'd imagine the goal is to get you to do the latter.If i wanted to be constantly paying for virtual cards I'd go back to Magic: Online. The Duel games are meant to be stand alone games that give you a fun challenge based around a set of cards. For the last few years I've felt this series has been pretty consistant with delivering that.. until now. Magic 2015 sucks. I'll be going back and playing a previous version.If you haven't bought this already please don't. Check your Library.. do you have all of the previous editions? If not go back and buy one of those.Oh and no Two-Headed Giant. :(			"

												They removed all the good multiplayer modes there is only FFA now, 50 of the 300 cards are behind a paywall (and not just pay 5 bucks...pay them 1.99 for a CHANCE TO MAYBE GET THEM), the UI is slower than ever and the game crashes a lot.Also, the ""open ended deck building"" is also a lie.  You are limited to 3 of one type of uncommon, 2 of a rare, 1 of a mythic.  While this does help make more decks viable...its false advertising to say its completely open when its not.Also, playing versus the AI to get more cards is frustrating.  They give you a hodgepodge deck that has virtually no synergy, and no endgame cards for any of the options you can choose from.  Then you are facing fully completed decks with tons of synergy and they have not only the best premium cards...but cards that players can't even access (even though they are legit MTG cards).  Why even have these cards coded in the game but only for AI?Finally, this game was hyped to have the M15 core set in it, but really most of it is not M15.  And in terms of the 300 cards in general, 95% of them are absolute trash cards.  This is likely due to them limiting deck building, but still.  This isn't even a true magic experience.  I would say its ""fair"" in PvP at least, if there wasn't a clearly pay to win mechanic with permium boosters.Moral of this story is that since 2013, Stainless has been striping this game of features and now has proven to be comfortable with false advertising.  Don't make the mistake I did and buy this out of hype for deck building.  Its the worst trading card game released in years.			"

												This is the worst of the Duels of the Planeswalkers, it has all the glitchiness of the 2012 version, with the user interface designed for tablets. Don't waste your money, the earlier versions are much better buys. All of the progress they have made with these since 2012 has been wiped out. Magic is a pretty straight forward game, its almost as if they tried to make a bad game. Look at 2013, it actually had some decks you might believe a rational person might build.			"

I've lost hundreds of hours in the previous games in the franchise and enjoyed them thoroughly, but I cannot bring myself to recommend this game at all. It's pay to win and a shame on the WotC and the MtG brand. I wish I could get a refund. It's one of the worst games I've ever played. Do not get it. Get one of the previous game instead.			"

												So far Magic 2015 is worst of the whole series. TL;DR spend your money instead on the real Magic the Gathering Online, or play Magic 2014. Pros:+Customizable deck, if you have the cards.+Better card library than in previous ones.+Couple new cool cards.Cons:- Two-headed giant has been removed. Only FFA for 2-4 players.- No preview to initial deck selection.- Menu navigation is horrible.- The cards you get from the ""free"" boosters are mostly crap, and you're lucky if you get one or two cards that fit to your deck.- Practically you play only with one deck, which evolves as you play and add new cards.- No planeswalker theme decks.- Making good decks is hard because solid and consistent deck requires 3-4 copies of certain key cards, and obtaining those cards is very long process.- Once you choose your starting deck (and colours) you are pretty much married to it long time.- Pay to win.

												I've played magic the gathering for almost 20 years, and I've played every Duels of the Planeswalkers games (Including the ancient microprose one) and this game is so bad it makes me want to give up the hobby completely.The Problems I have with this game.Lack of multiple saves. extremely slow menuCustom deck design is hampered by restricting cards by rarity/premium (cannot be unlocked by playing)Probably the first duels of the planeswalker game that actually bored me to tears (Literally, I had tears in my eyes trying to stay awake during the intro games)Due to the slow loading menus I accidently finalized my deck choice to BU and found that I couldn't reset that choice (including deleting the game and every file associated with it.)Seriously, I'm less mad about the $10 then I am about the warcrimes I endured playing this game for just over 80 minutes.

												I'm a big fan of the DotP series since its first inception. I have played all versions and I really liked that it was a great way to introduce beginners into the game with a great graphic interface, a big variety of different cards and formats available from the start. Complete customization to the decks has finally been added to the series, thats great! But wait... they removed all the great content from previous games!There's no more 2-Headed Giant, which was fun in Multiplayer.No more challenges! They were really fun, no reason to remove them :/You start with a crappy deck that has a lot of trouble winning against AI decks... not because they're technically ""difficult"", but because the deck you start with is terrible. You need to grind A LOT to get cards from random boosters, or you can buy them with real money, which essentialy takes away the fun from this series. I better spend that money on the real paper Magic or Magic Online!I really liked the Sealed format in last year's edition, why was it removed?This is a big step backwards in Duels of the Planeswalkers, and I'm really dissapointed. Go back to the previous formula!			"

												I haven't played a Magic the Gathering PC game since MicroProse's 1997/1998 game. I came in expecting this to be just as good. Boy was I ever wrong. This game just feels empty and missing heart and soul to it.  It has a very clunky and slow interface, obviously made for consoles like the PS4 and XBox. Why people buy those when they can do the samething on pc astounds me. Magic 2015 has left me not wanting to play another Magic video game ever again. There is a lot of cheating on the AI's part. From them always getting the perfect drawns to you just either drawing nothing but lands and nothing good to play or having some decent cards in your hands and not having the lands to play them. Feels like the game is made for you to buy their premium packs, and bundles in order to get anything . I did manage to beat the game and I have almost no desire to play this ever again.			"

People can dump money into this game to unlock all the good cards. Which then makes multiplayer quite unfair.3. Cannot unlock cards by playing AI multiple times.4.

There is no custom gamemode, it is based around microtransactions, and they actually messed with the mechanics of deckbuilding.In the standard format of magic, you can have 4 of any one card in a deck.Not four of any common, 3 of any uncommon, 2 of any rare, and one of any mythic rare.

												Now I see why it was delayed for Xboxlive and should have waited for that version. The game will cost you about $50 if you want the cards just to play with your friends. I could care less about the challenges, and all the window dressing many lonely gamers crave in lieux of playing live players. I don't have complaints since in truth all i want are cards to build decks to play my close family and friends that are into magic also. Its a simple want, since launched i've yet been able to play anyone in my friends list. There is a glitch or bug that prevents you from playing friends, the fact that this has never been addressed speaks volumes on the ethics of the people that both made this game 'Stainless' and distributed it ""steam"" Microsoft would have done something if not refund or made the publisher address the issue. This is a reminder of the shady business of PC games. Completely disappointed with this. Save your money.			"

												Being a big fan of the previous MTG online games, I preordered this game, god do I regret it now, I thought the 10 dollar price was really nice for what I was getting. Where do I even start, they removed the most played format, where previous MTG online games had things such as Archenemy, or planechase, you get my gist, there is none. No extra format and they even removed one. They've said its because it did not look well with the current design of the board, and that certain card interactions was too good. I can understand the second point, whereas the first being a terrible excuse.Even then, you do not remove such a feature for that reason, if you don't like the OP card interactions that can be made, its still better than removing such a beloved feature, far better.The menu is absolutely abysmal, there is white everywhere, at all parts of the game, even after transition froma dark cinematic, which hurt my eyes. It is terribly wonky and slow to navigate with tablets being in mind and not the most used way to play it, computer. The fact that they try to make it work well on tablet is great, but again, really not the way to go. They could at least have made a few adjustments to the PC title.There is still so much bad I could say about this game, but I am going to stop beating around the bush and get to the worst feature of the game, saving the best for last.The microtransaction system. Previous titles let you pay a minor amount of money to unlock the entire deck instantly instead of unlocking cards for winning with the deck. As well as paying to get those cards in foil. They'd put a slightly higher charge, but nothing extreme on new decks added after the release of the game, long enough to justify releasing additional decks, as well as expansions. Sounds great to me. Previous titles had codes that'd be released now and then to unlock cards for all the decks. Accessible for everyone as far as I know.This time around, they have put a incredibly high charge on unlocking all the cards you can unlock from playing the campaign, not too bad, no need to buy that really. But they have added promo packs, 15 packs at about 2€ or whatever currency you use. Bumping the DAY ONE price for full content in the game up to 40€. As well as breaking multiplayer mode for people who are not willing to invest more money into the game. Even if you are a long time fan of the online Magic series, do not get this game.			"

												This is a horrible game is SOOO many different ways.First off, the menu screen is so slow. When you choose an option, it has to have this fog envelop the screen first before showing you you wanted to go. This gets so frustrating after a while, especially when you figure out that your deck you get for the first time was utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ That leads into ANOTHER problem with this game, the decks. You'd think for an intro deck, it should be pretty good against your enemies for the first time and it IS pretty cool that you can get booster packs from defeating enemies. That's where the problem comes in. On the first enemy I had to face, I lost so many times with my first deck. I was getting nothing but land for the first few games, then nothing but spells and creatures for the next few games. The only way I was able to win was because the enemy started to draw nothing but lands. And that's the case with A LOT of these enemies, there will be a lot of games that you will win because the enemy hit a mana vein or is getting nothing but creatures. If you beat these enemies, you get a booster pack, which is pretty cool, but ONLY when you beat an enemy. If you want a booster pack, you have to use REAL money to pay for them. If I wanted to pay for magic cards, I would have actually have gotten my cards from a game store and used them to play the actual game.It's fun after the first few minutes of the game, but it gets frustrating and painful to play after that. My recomendation is to go out and buy a deck box or some booster pack instead of playing this train wreck of a game.1/10There is no pit in hell hot enough to burn this game.			"

												One step forward, two steps back.Pro: They added the ability to build your own decks (From about 300 different cards - not masses, but not so bad)Con: They removed 2-headed giant, so no 2v2 games.Con: You cant switch decks in lobby, you have to go back to the main menu.It feels like the developers have no idea what they are doing, or what their playerbase actually wants.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! This game is pay to win! So many things wrong with this game. The number one issue is this... You can start with only hybrid decks with little to NO synergy. The first person you duel against in campaign mode is far superior to you in every way. The only way to beat any of these guys is pure luck. Their decks are setup to counter your every move. Your chances of winning are pretty much 20:1.  When you do win you only get 3 random cards, that may or may not be for the hybrid deck you picked. After you struggle to beat the 4 guys in each tier you can do a random encounter for that tier that will reward you with more cards. The issue here, your deck is still as basic as it can be. These guys youre facing will again be far superior to you. Also you cant attempt to build a deck to beat them for two reasons: 1) you still have crap cards 2) you have no idea which one you'll get so it is impossible to build a strategy. By this point you will be so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at how crappy your deck is you will have no choice but to buy the complete collection of cards for $19. I refuse to give into a company that got greedy and I'll just /uninstall instead.			"

												I've purchased 13, 14, and now 15..  I love the deck building ability of 15. I hate the fact that they took away plane chase and two headed giant from multiplayer.  I bought this so I could teach a friend to play Magic, and was looking forward to playing two headed giant to help them better understand the game, since we live 1800 miles apart.  Now they'll need to pick up an older verison of the game so we can do two headed giant.  As previously stated the deck you ""start"" with, is very important as it'll be the deck you are forced to use for a bit, until you've opened several booster packs to alter it.  That should be better explained and maybe allow players to browse through the deck to see if its something they'll enjoy playing.  Overall I can't recommend this game, I want to, and probably could if more multiplayer options were available.			"

												Being a big fan of the previous MTG online games, I preordered this game, god do I regret it now, I thought the 10 dollar price was really nice for what I was getting. Where do I even start, they removed the most played format, where previous MTG online games had things such as Archenemy, or planechase, you get my gist, there is none. No extra format and they even removed one. They've said its because it did not look well with the current design of the board, and that certain card interactions was too good. I can understand the second point, whereas the first being a terrible excuse.Even then, you do not remove such a feature for that reason, if you don't like the OP card interactions that can be made, its still better than removing such a beloved feature, far better.The menu is absolutely abysmal, there is white everywhere, at all parts of the game, even after transition froma dark cinematic, which hurt my eyes. It is terribly wonky and slow to navigate with tablets being in mind and not the most used way to play it, computer. The fact that they try to make it work well on tablet is great, but again, really not the way to go. They could at least have made a few adjustments to the PC title.There is still so much bad I could say about this game, but I am going to stop beating around the bush and get to the worst feature of the game, saving the best for last.The microtransaction system. Previous titles let you pay a minor amount of money to unlock the entire deck instantly instead of unlocking cards for winning with the deck. As well as paying to get those cards in foil. They'd put a slightly higher charge, but nothing extreme on new decks added after the release of the game, long enough to justify releasing additional decks, as well as expansions. Sounds great to me. Previous titles had codes that'd be released now and then to unlock cards for all the decks. Accessible for everyone as far as I know.This time around, they have put a incredibly high charge on unlocking all the cards you can unlock from playing the campaign, not too bad, no need to buy that really. But they have added promo packs, 15 packs at about 2€ or whatever currency you use. Bumping the DAY ONE price for full content in the game up to 40€. As well as breaking multiplayer mode for people who are not willing to invest more money into the game. Even if you are a long time fan of the online Magic series, do not get this game.			"

												The UI is slower and clunkier, the campaign was more interesting, but at the same time was infuriatingly unbalanced at times - not because the opponents had powerful cards, but because they had coherent decks.That's actually the inherent problem with this game - you see, unlike the previous entries, it now offers complete customization of your decks, which is a ""step up"" but with the pitifully limited library of cards and limited number of copies of the more powerful cards, you soon realize that, sure you can make your deck however you want, but in the end it's not really how you actually want.DotP 2014 sent you in with a prebuilt deck with coherent themes and strategies - DotP 2015 sends you in with a janky pile of commons and uncommons that ultimately aren't as interesting, powerful or exciting in any way.Again, you can make your deck however you want, you just have to do it with the pile of junk they've seen fit for you to be allowed to use.Infuriatingly more still, some of the most exciting cards are locked behind a premium barrier - seriously, you pay for the game, but you have to pay more for some of the more decent cards.Rather than making a unique and interesting game, we get ""starter deck simulator 2015"". Save the $10 and go play some FNM.			"

If you love magic I suggest DONT BUY THIS GAME! because it will force you to lose all respect for the franchise and perhaps make it difficult to sleep at night do to nighmares of the idiots who destroyed Duel of the Planeswalkers name!

												It's a 'ok' game but I wouldn't recommend it. I haven't played the previous year versions and the last time I played real life MGT was well over 10 years ago. Interface is a bit cumbersome but works fine during battles. The first deck you get you can only pick from it's listed name making it a simple gamble. You progress by unlocking boosters from winning game. Freeform deck building is nice but the card selection is rather limited and some cards are unlocked only by paying. Coming back to Magic after all these years I enjoyed it but that enjoyment diminished after finishing the single player and reaching finding out how limited the card base actually is. Finally it seems the game has this awkward  way of 'simulating' a good or bad luck streak for either you or the A.I. You may find yourself get numerous horrible initial draws, or fight an A.I. that seems to do absolutely nothing because it lacks the cards it wants to use.Seems like Magic 2015 has a lot to learn from other modern digital card games. For a game with such a rich history and universe Magic 2015 is simply too limited to warrant it's 10 dollar/euro pricetag.			"

												No two-headed giant. Not all cards from all sets are included. No way to get four of a rare or mythic. Must pay-to-win in some cases as several play styles are neutered due to key cards being only attainable through premium pack purchases. I beat the game in a manner of hours with all achievements (except for the win 100 multiplayer battles, which is ridiculous to think I would suffer through all that menu loading and match making 100 times).This is a dis-improvement from Magic 2014. Basically, this game is a tease to get you to try Magic Online, which sucks in and of itself.			"

Posted: January 25, 2015
												The weakest edition of Duels of the Planeswalkers to date in my opinion, but it does feature custom deckbuilding from scratch. This is balanced and in the end crippled by two things.-The fact that card variety is very limited, (Little over 300 different cards counting the expansion) -Card set limitations based on rarity. (4 common, 3 uncommon, 2 rare, 1 mythic)Short version: slow and kind of a luck based progression in the beginning unless you pay for expensive microtransactions that unlock more cards for your deck. Even then the planeswalker difficulty really feels luck-based on some battles. Building the deck is fun but UI is extremely clunky and almost certainly ported from tablet. This takes the whole game down a notch as it is tedious to make menu selections, scroll cards, tap lands, using abilities and just about everything else when played with a mouse and keyboard. The menus use mouse scroll when they feel like it, but they favor using drag as if played with a tablet. Menus don't activate if you drag a slightest bit when clicking with the mouse, cards zoom if you give a light touch to the scroll. The gamepad controls probably work as intended but I haven't tested. The game also feels slower than previous versions.Long version:The game can be very frustrating because you are against pretty competent decks with better synergy for the most part than is available to the player. They have a huge amount of cards not available to the player and they don't share the rarity limit.  You choose a deck with two colors and kind of a weak description at the end of the tutorial. Then you need to unlock rest of the cards by defeating opponents. One win equals one booster pack and you can't get more by defeating the same campaign opponent multiple times.Different planes reward different cards, but you need to open every plane separately by defeating the campaign levels in the previous plane. This makes building a decent deck even slower because there are only about 10 or so different cards per color per plane.The final opponent gets a special mentions as you need to win two battles in a row and if you're not lucky it can take frustrating amount of retries.I don't really think the expansion is worth the price, It features a single plane(Alara) and you're locked to garruks deck without having a good idea of what cards you actually have in the deck, the deck also changes in every battle according to the storyline. The cards awarded are fun but have limited synergy with the rest of the sets and there are too few from the alara set to really construct fun decks from that block. It does feature a couple of triple lands available for deckbuilding though.Opponents seem to think longer than they used to in previous versions but I'm not 100% certain about this. and all the rules don't seem to always work. One opponent played two of the same legendary without the ability to sacrifice one. The other went to graveyard, the other to the battlefield with tokens from the legendary that went to the graveyard. Also the game sometimes hangs up when you want to cancel a spell with multiple targets.I haven't played the multiplayer but from what i've read from other reviews, there isn't much variety on strategies and decks because of the limited card collection. Also Free for all is the only supported multiplayer mode.In the end i really can't recommend this one over previous editions unless you're dead set on making you own decks from a shallow pool of cards.

												You know what really grinds my gears?Not being able to open the steam overlay. Anyone with a Nvidia graphics card may likely run into this issue. Which means if you want to pick up boosters, or the 25 dollar unlock all cards (seems like a pretty damn good deal compared to irl prices of cards), you're out of luck.Starting decks are total♥♥♥♥♥♥and if you want to beat the first chapter boss you better get good at hitting that restart button. Unlocking cards w/o paying is tedious and doesn't seem worth it at the beginning (though that may be bad RNG on my part).Many game modes seem to be removed including 2 headed giant (a personal favorite online of mine and many others). The online modes remaining (especially when playing against AI with friends) could not drag on longer. A 4 player match against bots was 66% bot decision time, as if they were contemplating their existance. The hud in this mode is EXTREMELY confusing as well (My picture was bottom left, I played on the bottom, my deck bottom right. My friends head was bottom right, he sat on the right and his deck on the top right) absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥In short Magic 2015 is a failure of a product at the current state (written 2/9/2015), even with the expansion. Until these issues are fixed I could not reccomend this any less, or stress caution in picking up this garbage any more. I would instead look into Magic 2013 or 2014 ( I hear 2013 is the better one).			"

												Do yourself a favor, unless you like playing pauper-style magic (i.e using nearly all commons and a few uncommons/rares here and there), don't bother with this game. When you think that you can't wait till you can drop your ""bomb"" of a 4/4 flier for 7 mana that only helps if you're below your starting life total, something is wrong. Games before this: duels 2013 and magic 2014 all had great fun premade decks with cool different themes and a load of unlockable cards which were mostly bombs/gamechangers/synergistic. This game just feels so weak. There is no fun in the decks, the starters you get when you begin are very underwhelming and underpowered and although the booster system is exciting at the very least, you just end up with unusable garbage about 70% of the time. I was looking forward to grinding out matches, unlocking new powerful cards and having a great time like in the previoius two years, but this is just sad. Somehow, Wizards managed to listen to everyone and impliment something that everyone wanted and made it exponentially worse than the past two years. I don't really even want to touch on the pay-to-win aspect of this game either, it just hurts to think about.Overall, I was told if you were a fan of previous magic games on the PC then you will like this one also. Please take it from me, I would rather spend the $9.99 on a cheap back-alley kidney replacement than this disappointment. Atleast then, I might get something I could use for longer than 6 hours.			"

I was extremely excited about building my own deck, but quite frankly the usual archetypes are not viable even with all cards unlocked. You can build pretty crummy versions of Red Deck Wins, UW Control, and a mediocre token deck. They need to add about another 300 cards so deck building is worth the player's time. Also, when you buy the complete bundle you're missing out on 14 cards that you can only get from Premium boosters. If you look carefully these so called Premium cards are not even worth the money. None of them make or break an archetype. I just feel let down with this one.			"

												TL;DR: Just another cash-grab from Wizards of the Coast.They almost learned their lesson from 2014:  Decks start out from pre-built templates, but can be modified with any card that you unlock, giving a much more organic (and rewarding) experience.Unfortunately, all the good cards *need* to be purchased and cannot be unlocked through normal play.  You'd need to spend an extra $30 to unlock 'em all.  So it's not really a $10 game, it's a $40 game - which in itself wouldn't be that bad if the total package was actually worth that much money.  But unfortunatly tons of the really cool cards that you will play against in the campaign are unavailable to the actual player, so.... yeah, it really isn't.If players could unlock ALL of the cards that are featured in this game through normal play, one might actually be encouraged to give the in-game store some money just on account of the sheer enormity of collecting everything.  That might be worth your money.Incrediebly dissaspointing. They were 9/10 of the way there, too, but greed got the best of them in the final stretch and now we have yet another bland, hollow, cheap, Pay-To-Play Diet-Coke MTG knock-off.  Save your money.			"

												The game plays great looks great but many flaws starting with multiplayer mode its only 1 vs 1, no twoheaded anymore, no co-op story, no challanges,  like previous games. The blocks they introduced from theros , zendikar , etc are only a tease they dont even have any of the cards worth having and was only a very limited pool. The game dosent have anything for music its the same song all the time its annoying. The only thing that i like about this game is that they finally allowed full deck customization other than that if you already have any of the older series your not missing anything on here wish for once they would take everything that was good from the older games and incorperate into a new game but they seem to fix one thing and break the rest so i dont reccomend this game at all its not worth your time.

												The weakest edition of Duels of the Planeswalkers to date in my opinion, but it does feature custom deckbuilding from scratch. This is balanced and in the end crippled by two things.-The fact that card variety is very limited, (Little over 300 different cards counting the expansion) -Card set limitations based on rarity. (4 common, 3 uncommon, 2 rare, 1 mythic)Short version: slow and kind of a luck based progression in the beginning unless you pay for expensive microtransactions that unlock more cards for your deck. Even then the planeswalker difficulty really feels luck-based on some battles. Building the deck is fun but UI is extremely clunky and almost certainly ported from tablet. This takes the whole game down a notch as it is tedious to make menu selections, scroll cards, tap lands, using abilities and just about everything else when played with a mouse and keyboard. The menus use mouse scroll when they feel like it, but they favor using drag as if played with a tablet. Menus don't activate if you drag a slightest bit when clicking with the mouse, cards zoom if you give a light touch to the scroll. The gamepad controls probably work as intended but I haven't tested. The game also feels slower than previous versions.Long version:The game can be very frustrating because you are against pretty competent decks with better synergy for the most part than is available to the player. They have a huge amount of cards not available to the player and they don't share the rarity limit.  You choose a deck with two colors and kind of a weak description at the end of the tutorial. Then you need to unlock rest of the cards by defeating opponents. One win equals one booster pack and you can't get more by defeating the same campaign opponent multiple times.Different planes reward different cards, but you need to open every plane separately by defeating the campaign levels in the previous plane. This makes building a decent deck even slower because there are only about 10 or so different cards per color per plane.The final opponent gets a special mentions as you need to win two battles in a row and if you're not lucky it can take frustrating amount of retries.I don't really think the expansion is worth the price, It features a single plane(Alara) and you're locked to garruks deck without having a good idea of what cards you actually have in the deck, the deck also changes in every battle according to the storyline. The cards awarded are fun but have limited synergy with the rest of the sets and there are too few from the alara set to really construct fun decks from that block. It does feature a couple of triple lands available for deckbuilding though.Opponents seem to think longer than they used to in previous versions but I'm not 100% certain about this. and all the rules don't seem to always work. One opponent played two of the same legendary without the ability to sacrifice one. The other went to graveyard, the other to the battlefield with tokens from the legendary that went to the graveyard. Also the game sometimes hangs up when you want to cancel a spell with multiple targets.I haven't played the multiplayer but from what i've read from other reviews, there isn't much variety on strategies and decks because of the limited card collection. Also Free for all is the only supported multiplayer mode.In the end i really can't recommend this one over previous editions unless you're dead set on making you own decks from a shallow pool of cards.

												You know what really grinds my gears?Not being able to open the steam overlay. Anyone with a Nvidia graphics card may likely run into this issue. Which means if you want to pick up boosters, or the 25 dollar unlock all cards (seems like a pretty damn good deal compared to irl prices of cards), you're out of luck.Starting decks are total♥♥♥♥♥♥and if you want to beat the first chapter boss you better get good at hitting that restart button. Unlocking cards w/o paying is tedious and doesn't seem worth it at the beginning (though that may be bad RNG on my part).Many game modes seem to be removed including 2 headed giant (a personal favorite online of mine and many others). The online modes remaining (especially when playing against AI with friends) could not drag on longer. A 4 player match against bots was 66% bot decision time, as if they were contemplating their existance. The hud in this mode is EXTREMELY confusing as well (My picture was bottom left, I played on the bottom, my deck bottom right. My friends head was bottom right, he sat on the right and his deck on the top right) absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥In short Magic 2015 is a failure of a product at the current state (written 2/9/2015), even with the expansion. Until these issues are fixed I could not reccomend this any less, or stress caution in picking up this garbage any more. I would instead look into Magic 2013 or 2014 ( I hear 2013 is the better one).			"

												WARNING: I am in FULL RAGE MODE currently. So i might Edit this Review Later.This Game is Magic as you know it. It is a wonderful Card Game with nearly Endless Possibilities. If it lets you. Which it doesn`t. It will drive you mad with its unnecessarily slow menu, with its SUPER ANNOYING AI Mechanics (Undyingly Cheap Tactics and a Golden RNG) and its super IngameShop.The IngameShop. This is the most RIDICOLOUS THING i`ve ever saw. I`ve spent 21 Euro on Premium Booster because i wanted to have them. It wasn`t possible because a Bug from 2011 (the first Planeswalker) prevented me from accessing Steam Ingame Overlay (Nvidia MobileGPU) - So i let a friend of mine buy them. He did. I lost 21 Dollar , even got a Recipe for it. But i never received the Booster. I dont know what this is but its just plain ridiculous. If you never played Magic buy Planeswalker M14. If you love Magic PLAY Magic or Planeswalker14. Do NOT buy this game. You will buy a game so you can buy ingame Cards so you can not play them.			"

The campaign is barely a campaign and the opponents are almost all boring to play against. Plus it's got all those wild and wacky bugs that we all love from previous Duels of the Planeswalkers.There is also no Two Headed Giant, or alternate format like Sealed, Archenemy, or Planechase. We lost all of those so we can build decks!It has some major issues that need to be worked out, but I doubt they will be. I don't recommend this game to anyone. Maybe 2016 will be better.			"

Instead of being able to change a deck mid campaign you are ""locked"" into the deck you selected after the tutorial.

												The reason I am do not recommend the game is not because it's bad but because it needs more content. Deck building is great but only 300 cards? That's upsetting since there are over 2000 mtg cards. It feels limited, not to mention micro transitions. I love mtg but I don't believe this dotp can compete  with hearthstone. The game is good,(fanboy), it was fun screaming at my cards against jace with 3 chronozoas on the field. I think this game is not out of the ballpark just yet, I just hope they would add more content and when I mean content, not just the adding more cards behind a paywall. I still enjoy it so maybe others would top, happy grinding.			"

Every menu selection is delayed by long transitions of white fog. The board itself animates when you reach the attack phase causing you to wait even more for an arguably ugly aesthetic reason. If you're looking for a card game try Hearthstone, paper magic or MTGO. DotP 13 remains the best installment. This is disappointing dlc ridden garbage.			"

												As a long time player of this franchise, going back as far as DoTP2012, I am severely disappointed in this game. It brings only 1 new thing to the table, while removing a massive amount of other things for no apparent reason.Pros:+ Deck building. This has been asked for ages, and finally it's been implemented, just the way we want it! Fully configurable decks, lands, cards, and all.+ The in game UI is beautiful as always. This has been the main selling point of the DotP games for me personally.Cons:- Massive lack of cards. Let's take Ravnica as an example. The Ravnica plane in game has a 59 unique cards, including 10 guildgates. The 'Return to Ravnica' release in real life cards has 274 unique cards. The whole block (which the plane is based on) has 679 unique cards. Some of these cards are in game, as the AI uses them plenty, but the majority of cards remain unavailable to players. Just to show how bad this is: There is a single dual colored card for each of the Ravnica guilds in game accessible to players.- Lack of Two Headed Giant and other Game modes. Some of these modes such as Two Headed Giant have been part of the game ever since the beginning, and have had a massive appeal for Online play. I personally realize that it would be ridiculously hard to balance things like these, but I still wish the game mode had been left in.- Lack of Challenges. Again, this is something that has been in the series for a long time. But in this version, there are no challenges. By challenge, I mean certain pre-configured scenario where you have to use a certain mechanic of series of cards to win the scenario.- Lack of Revenge campaign. This has also been a part of previous game, but is not in this version either. For clarity's sake, the Revenge campaign was a campaign where you redid the old campaign where the AI had improved decks.- Purchase locked content. There are 43 'Premium' cards which can only be unlocked through the purchase of booster packs. These boosters cost 1.79 euro in Sweden, uncertain about US based pricing.			"

												Interface would be great on a tablet, but it is pretty clumsy on a PC. Lots of loading times, which could all be overlooked if the experience was decent. While the game allows deck building, it requires endless hours to actually build anything beyond whatever base starter deck you select during the tutorial. There is no way to change decks, and you cannot preview any of the starters beyond a very vague description. In order to build a deck, you either need to shell out cash, or grind for an eternity. Especially if you want cards from different colors than your starter deck.There are no additional game modes, like Planechase or challenges, to break the monotony either. Multiplayer without the premium expensive boosters will mean your decks are always at a disadvantage against anyone who just pays to win.While deck building is nice, this game is a complete mess.  "

												This could have been an amazing DotP because unlike all the predecessors, one can now build their deck any way they want from the pool of cards... except, it feels like it is taking rather long to get to the point where I feel I have enough cards to build semi-synergistic decks (other than your starting synergies). On top of that, and I'll throw a bit of hyperbole in here, but this is crippleware. There are cards that are only available through buying premium boosters, so theoretically you cannot get the whole game without buying microtransactions. The campaign is also much shorter. Deck switching feels harder. No two-headed giant. They took one step forward (free deck making) and then like 5 steps back. I'd wait for a Steam Sale, but to get some Magic kicks albeit a tad more deck-restricted go with the earlier years.			"

												                    Let me start by saying I love Magic: the Gathering.  I love the card game and I liked the earlier video game installments.  However, the most recent version of Duels of the Planeswalkers has been (to me) monumentally disappointing.  The entire game works like the Sealed Deck campaign on Magic 2014, which I though was an interesting concept at the time.  It was extremely challenging as a quirky off-shoot of how the main game worked.  Instead of starting out with a good, working deck, you had to hobble together a ramshackle deck to beat your opponent, which often required immense amounts of patients, do-overs and careful manipulation of your deck between matches.  I though it was fun after I beat the main campaign.                      But now with 2015, that's all you have!  A ramshackle deck that barely works and a horribly frustrating method of unlocking new cards.  Worst of all, the card selection on the game is TERRIBLE!!  I can't stress that enough!  I typically play with a mono-Black deck, with plenty of kill cards and lifelink, but low and behold, none of those cards exist in this game!  No Doom Blades, no Murders, or Corrupts or Tendrils of Corruption, none!  The only kill card is a worthless 5-drop!  If you enjoyed the last installment of the series and/or enjoy playing Black, I would highly advise that you avoid this game...			"

												This game is about what one would expect from a Magic the Gathering video game.  Tap mana to play spells, bring your opponent to zero life or have their deck run out before yours does.  Standard fare for what one might expect.  The story even has some moderate relevance to the game at large, especially in the form of the new Ob Nixilis.  Building your own personal deck(s) is a new feature and one that I rather like a lot.  But there are a few things that restrict this quality.  First off, this game does not have quite as many cards as I had expected.  While, yes, it does take cards from M15, Innistrad, Theros, Return to Ravnica, and Zendikar blocks, along with a few odds and ends cards to improve the pool, you still only have access to about as many cards as you did in the previous installment, if that.  Only Evolve and Bloodrush are present from Ravnica as far as guild mechanics go for playable cards, for example, and Bestow is conspicuously absent.  This is made worse by the fact that almost 100 of the cards are additional purchases on top of the game. Secondly, this game has a few bugs and issues with the interface.  One of the primary complaints that I have had about it is that the option to choose the order of damage is not automatically on, and the interface for doing so is a bit unusual.   There are also bugs in receiving a few titles and avatars. Third, and perhaps one of the most obnoxious things out there, is the existance of decks that are illegal.  The game refuses to tell you why this deck can't be used, only that it can't be used.  I myself experienced this while trying to build a RWU deck.Matchmaking will also frequently become an issue, as games will occasionally be joined when two players are already in the lobby, or the connections will outright fail.Overall then, I would say that this game has a number of things to like about it, but it was heavily hyped for  being able to customize your own deck as much as you want.  What the hype did not include was how much was traded off for this functionality.  While I do not dislike this game by any stretch, nor do I dislike Wizards and their affiliates for it, I could not recommend this to a friend in good conscience.  I feel this game is underpolished and could have used a bit more time on the refining steps.			"

												So, the game started off okay.  I got a simple deck, which I understood.  I figured I'd get more powerful cards along the way.  But then by my third battle when I saw the caliber of cards that the AI got and the crap that I had in my deck, I didn't know how I was going to even get past the third game.  Even after playing 5 or 6 games, I wasn't really getting anything good in the ""booster packs"".  I have some pictures on my site that show me playing against the Hydra AI.  He had 3 or 4 hydra's out and started stacking the counters on it.  One of them ended up 130/130 with Trample.  Even if I was able to kill them off quickly, he always managed to pull another from the deck.  and I'm sitting there with a 1/1 fighter.  GO FORTH AND CONQUER!!!I didn't buy any packs (which I'm assuming is their plan), but from what I read about the other reviews, isn't worth it.Love the game, hate the program.  And with the way they built it, if they think it's going to bring new Magic players to the mix is going to have an opposite effect.  They're going to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off by the 3rd game and delete Magic from their computer and their mind.			"

												Well, this was a pretty huge disappointment compared to the previous iterations... after just a couple of days of playing I am pretty much done. I have only one major argument to make against this game: what made the previous games so much fun was completely left out of Duels 2015. The different themed decks were a lot of fun to unlock and play around with, and had a reasonable amount of depth despite the limited card pools for each. Each deck had its own identity and was very different from every other deck. With the new deckbuilding system, that identity is gone; no more samurai deck, dragon deck, etc... you are very limited in your choice of types of decks to build, and then even more so on your card choices when attempting to construct a deck.My advice:If you are new to the series, skip this one and grab 2013 or 2014 instead. If you are a veteran of the series, find something else to play... I fear this one simply isn't worth your time.			"

												Don't buy the ""Complete Bundle"", it's not actually everything in the game.  You still have to spend at least 11 * $1.99 = $22 more to get all of the premium booster cards and have a complete collection.Also the interface between games sucks. Games these days should not have such slow animations.  It's okay for an iPad/iOS version but not on PC.This was becoming an annual purchase for me, but I'll be looking closely before I spend any more money.			"

												As a long time player of this franchise, going back as far as DoTP2012, I am severely disappointed in this game. It brings only 1 new thing to the table, while removing a massive amount of other things for no apparent reason.Pros:+ Deck building. This has been asked for ages, and finally it's been implemented, just the way we want it! Fully configurable decks, lands, cards, and all.+ The in game UI is beautiful as always. This has been the main selling point of the DotP games for me personally.Cons:- Massive lack of cards. Let's take Ravnica as an example. The Ravnica plane in game has a 59 unique cards, including 10 guildgates. The 'Return to Ravnica' release in real life cards has 274 unique cards. The whole block (which the plane is based on) has 679 unique cards. Some of these cards are in game, as the AI uses them plenty, but the majority of cards remain unavailable to players. Just to show how bad this is: There is a single dual colored card for each of the Ravnica guilds in game accessible to players.- Lack of Two Headed Giant and other Game modes. Some of these modes such as Two Headed Giant have been part of the game ever since the beginning, and have had a massive appeal for Online play. I personally realize that it would be ridiculously hard to balance things like these, but I still wish the game mode had been left in.- Lack of Challenges. Again, this is something that has been in the series for a long time. But in this version, there are no challenges. By challenge, I mean certain pre-configured scenario where you have to use a certain mechanic of series of cards to win the scenario.- Lack of Revenge campaign. This has also been a part of previous game, but is not in this version either. For clarity's sake, the Revenge campaign was a campaign where you redid the old campaign where the AI had improved decks.- Purchase locked content. There are 43 'Premium' cards which can only be unlocked through the purchase of booster packs. These boosters cost 1.79 euro in Sweden, uncertain about US based pricing.			"

												Do not buy. DotP has been plagued with interface issues over the years but this is by far the worst. Menu navigation is built for a tablet, editing your deck is infuriating. Every menu selection is delayed by long transitions of white fog. The board itself animates when you reach the attack phase causing you to wait even more for an arguably ugly aesthetic reason. If you're looking for a card game try Hearthstone, paper magic or MTGO. DotP 13 remains the best installment. This is disappointing dlc ridden garbage.			"

												1.  ATTENTION:  This game has a risk of crash when u launch. No matter how good is a game, the developer should Never sell a game to their customers with this kind of risk. On steam forum you can see endless update of complaining for this bug every day. Lot of players and fans are suffering from this stupid bug which should have been tested and debuged BEFORE the game release.On 1.Aug, they made a 319M patch, but this problem is still not solved.Maybe only 5% players have this problem, but for a game, it is a huge failure and shameEven for this single point, some people should be fired2. Game Pros1) You can cumtomize you deck and it is easy2) The interface looks clean and cool (BUT, see below ... )3) It is interesting that you can explore a planet and meet random encounters to collect cards3. Game Cons1)  Cards are not in good quality nor quantityYou have c.a 300 cards and can make lots of interesting decks by your creative ideas and personal understanding of Magic. However, if you play and test, you will find the White color is a gay lord in this game and actually this game is a TOKEN-to-WIN game. Black is much weakened in 2015 and has no wipe removal spells, thus token strategy is over powerful in 2015You do have some cards for every idea, but you do not have some powerful core cards for a core concept, e.g mill decksIf you played 2013 and 2014, you will find the card quality are much better than this version and the decks are more interesting to play even you can not fully costumize. By this point, even you buy all 10 boosters and built some interesting decks such as ""Cloudshift + Liliana Spector"", still no chance to play againt a noob token deck, that is the reason why I say, 2015 is not Pay-to-Win2. Interface is too horrible for operationThey want to SHOW how beatiful it looks, and you suffer from the operation timeJust to put the icons there and use the interface of 2014 can be much better3. You can only player 1v1 in multiplayerThus, it much depends on your luck and oppo's deck if you want to winA lucky noob token deck can beat you in within 4 turns, u still think your creative idea is awesome?A pro with 2-3 turns no-mana-in row or 3-4 turns all-mana-in row will lose a noob who copies exactly ur ideaIn paper magic, of course you also mainly play 1v1 and DO willl meet the same mana problem.BUT, How Many cards can you play in real life magic game? And How many crap cards in 2015 are you using in your real life magic decks?4. About Two-Head-Giant ModeIn the beginning, I complained a lot about the missing of THG.However, with the card pool provided so far, THG makes no sense, it will be a Token-and-More Token mode or worse, some deadly combo will come out and win within 5 turns A player enters random lobby will have nearly no chance to play against a pre-mate teamThis a not fair and not what we want for THG at all. In summary, I will give 3 of 10 for Magic 2015. I would pay 100$ for a good game which I can share fun with friends, but even 10$ is too much for a crapIf you still no buy, surely can spend 10$ and try the basic version. ( If you are lucky enough to have no crash ) For myself, I will take a serious look on the new card pool in further expansion or DLC before spend my money.			"

												If you are not a big magic fan, I would recomend 2014 over this.  The card collections and progressions are nice, Until you realize a 6th of the game is limited to premium booster packs at $2 a pop.  Bought all the card collections? (which you can unlock in game so why is this an option?) your still missing out on the premium cards.If you are a big magic fan like me, and have spent way too much already,then...you should also avoid this.custom deck building, we have it now, its cool, but even including the Pay to win pool of cards there's nothing super interesting to do here with them when compared the physical game. This pool is emarrisinggly small, even when compared to just one years worth of physical content. Its pretty depressing.Still this is the best AI we've gotten, and the deepest strategy pool we've gotten in this series.  And the packs, while ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, are fairly cheap compared to their physical alternatives.  If you are a fan of this series and want another one, then go ahead its here, you were going to buy it anyway, otherwise you propably wont...and probably shouldn't.			"

												This game is a complete conundrum. In order for you to unlock cards you have to play and beat campaign mode. But in order to do any good in the game you need the right cards. So before you even begin the game you are screwed...unless you paid extra money for the cards to already be unlocked...but then whats the point of the game the game is pretty much completed then if everything is unlocked. It doesn't help that the opponants decks are stacked and you get random cards every match so what you end up doing is restarting the match over and over again untill you have the starting hand you want and starting first. This game is a total waste of money unless you like increadible odds and palying againts the computer that CHEATS AND DOESN'T ALWAYS FOLLOW THE RULES OF THE GAME. Yup you read right. At certain times the PC does NOT follow its own rules. For example it will play cards without paying the mana cost or it will have cards out before you even start playing the match, or it will ignore rules like ""summoning sickness"" for its own creatures and attack with them the round they get cast. This is not a fair game at all why can't it be a simple game of magic where everyone follows the same rules and you just play a regular ♥♥♥♥ing game.

												I've played every DotPW released (on Xbox360) and the games hit their stride in 2012 and 2013. These two iterations were well on their way to becoming more like the MicroProse game that is sorely needed. However, that promise is unfulfilled. This edition, 2015, has plumitted from the prior editions' lofty heights.Stainless and Wizards have turned DotPW into a shallow version of Magic the Gathering Online. Gone are two-headed giant and the puzzles. In their place is a card pool of 300 or so, with the best cards behind a pay wall, and a lack-luster single player campaign.If you crave a casual Magic game, just buy 2013 on sale.			"

If you don't have anyone to play it with, I wouldn't reccomend it, considering the multiplayer is dead. It also lacks 2 headed giant, probably one of the most popular gamemodes of the older entries, and while it does allow for custom decks, the card pool is fairly small. All in all, you should only get this if you have a group of friends you can sit down and play it with.			"

												I do not recomend this game to beginer players.The menu system is a bit slow and annoying. Also forcing the deck building seems a bit much for people who may not know how to really make a synergistic deck. Which the deck builder could use some work feels like it was made for consoles than PC.If you expect to play multiplayer your only options are 1v1, 2v2, 4v4 no two headed giant.They didn't bring sealed back which with this deck building could have been added for more multiplayer options.Hard to tell if I enabled or disabled an option or not but figured it out after trail and error.I like what they did but how is just so meh. I'll stick to playing M14 Duels for two headed. I'll play this fully to beat and unlock stuff but seriously it's lacking good multiplayer options. Give us Two Headed Gaint back and sealed play in and this would be a good Itteration. This seems like it two two steps back and one forward with removing two good things and adding in one that is hit or miss.Ugh premium packs suck don't make me pay to get cards I can only get that way. This game has always been pay $10 play and unlock all the stuff and have fun. Now it's trying to cash in on hey now you have a card collection you can't use elsewhere but only in this game and to get that one mythic you need to buy additional packs. Give a full unlock option not a rando here ya go good luck getting something good. Ugh stupid idea without a pay to get em all option.			"

												So I never bought one of these games before. I usually try them out first on my friends computer since he likes the virtual version of Magic. I on the other hand don't like it. I hated that you can not make you own deck, and had to use the premaid decks that I didn't even find fun to use. So my friend tells me to get this game, because you FINALLY get to make your own deck with cards from the past five blocks. IF YOU BUY THE COMPLETE EDITION...... so thats what I did. I thought all the cards would be added to the collection, like it stated in the description of the packs, but only to find out for some reason. I don't have any of the cards from any of the packs except the weaksauce deck you start out with and loose with a lot. I'm not sure if you get all the cards from the packs for doing something, or you just need to waste more money on booster because it's not like I blow tons of money on real Magic the Gathering. I just want my $35 worth of cards that they said ""added to collection"", not you can get some cards of the blocks that we allow you to get since you got the complete edition. Pros-1. Magic the Gathering is always fun to play online with friends2. Cool that you can build you own decks finally (Not much of a Pro. I explain why in Cons.)Cons-1. A little disappointed that the menu is slow. Not that it's to terrible, just dont know why they haven't figured out how to fix that.2. Complete Edition, is a complete waste of money. SInce I thought you got five blocks of cards free, so you can hop on and play with your friends. Nobody is looking for a long compaing with a weak deck that wins one out of every four times, IF YOU ARE LUCKY.......3.NO TWO HEADED GIANT!!!!!! I mean come on guys. You have been making this card game since 1994 and you ""missed"" the two headed giant mode. I'm not the only one mad about this, especially since this is like the sixth game they have produced. Very dissapointed in this.4.Game play is still slow, but I am okay about this.5.You can't actually build a deck since you have to play hours on end just to get some cards. (I know I haven't played much of this game, but this still stand from mt friends opinion)Overview-I thought this game would be different from the last ones, but they have proven me wrong once again. This is still just as terrible as the last ones. Maybe, just maybe, even worse than the other games. To be honest, make the 5 block collections that I payed for to have in my ""COLLECTION"", whatever that means, and use them to make a deck and play with my friends and this game will be amazing. That's all I want. that plus two headed giant. Can't forget that.I think this can be an amazing game, I really do. Please add this to the game and I will change my review.			"

												this game is ♥♥♥♥ing garbage, and here's why:1. the only thing you can do is free for all, now 2 headed giant,no other game type2.the card collection is too small for a game that only has  its's deck creation going for it.3. there's no way to earn packs without using money, infact this entire game was just a quick buck.4.the campaign is stupidly short with boss battles that are wierdly difficult5. the UI is terrible and seems like they stripped everything off of the game 6.you have to equip decks now and can't switch them in lobbies???7.within the card collection only certain card combinations work.

												Let's start with the positive. You can now fully build a deck from scratch versus changing out a few card like previous versions. And that is the only good thing I can think of.Negatives. Short campaign. No extra modes are unlocked upon beating the campaign. The only custom game options are 2 to 4 player free-for-all. You cannot unlock every card by purely in-game options, you'll need to spend between $24 to $28 to unlock all the premium cards. The UI feels clunky, slow, unresponsive.Overall I feel that this is the worst version of Duels of the Planeswalkers ever released. If you enjoyed previous versions of DotP for the single player experience then I recommend you stay far away from Magic 2015 - DotP. If you only care about multiplayer and you are ok with only having free-for-all multiplayer and with spending between $33.87 and $62.85 to unlock all of the cards then it might be worth it.			"

												My goodness, Wizards has stripped any small bit of good that existed in this series and destroyed it.  This game is wretched on every level.  It feels like it didn't go through any playtesting.  The UI is terrible, the value proposition is awful as players get very little upon purchasing the game.  This version has been stripped of game modes that have been standard in the series.  I was a sucker and purchased the Complete Bundle only to discover that it doesn't actually unlock any cards for use in the game.  From what I can tell, it provides a visual spoiler of all the cards in each set, but doesn't unlock a thing.  WHAT!?  STAY AWAY~!!			"

												Alright, to be honest this game was a huge disapppointment for me.  I had played Magic many years before the first duels of the planeswalkers game, granted it wasn't competitive or anything but I have experience with the actual card game.  I loved the first few games because I was not an expert player.  It reintroduced me to Magic, and grinding to unlock all the cards gave me something to do and work for.  After the first few games I got sick of not being able to build my own deck.  I don't play the card game these days because of how expensive it is, but the video game wasn't quite satisfying my magic curiosity.  With the last game, they gave us a half♥♥♥♥♥tool to make our own decks that to me seemed to always be terrible.  With this game, it is straight up pay-to-win.  I beat the campaing in a matter of a few hours an quickly realized I wasn't unlocking cards anymore.  I would have to pay to get the boosters to continue.  This just instantly turned me away from this game.  The amount of decent cards that are available to be unlocked in the normal campaign pales in comparison to what you must buy.  Maybe they will be able to fix this with a DLC that is worth a dam but I don't see that happening.  I would stay away from this, whether your a hardcore Magic fan or just someone trying to pick it up for the first time.  Go check out some of the earlier games in the series.  Also, the menu system and user interface has always been absolutely terrible with these games.  How hard is it to fix that?  Lazy programming seems to be the standard with this series.			"

												     In theory this could have been the best DOTP yet.  In practice that simply did not end up being the case.  The begining of the game was insanely tedious, you have little control over your starting deck other than some vague summary.  I picked blue/black which was summarized as a control deck, but contained mostly overcosted zombies, and very little in the way of board control interactions.  In reality the starting decks are only marginally weaker than in earlier DOTP games; your opponents decks however are of a substantially higher power level, forcing you to rely on luck and replay matches fairly often. This may have been an intentional gimmick in order to force players to unlock all the cards outright.       That said, if you are willing to put up with a few very unfun hours or willing to sink some extra money into the game then the deck building potential looks to be the best of any DOTP so far.  If you're experienced with Magic you can make some fairly interesting decks. For less experienced players not having certain cards locked to certain decks may add a layer of uneeded complexity.   Finally, the games interace is not very well integrated for PC play.  It's laggy, cluttered and inefficient and was clearly ported with little polish from the tablet version of the game.   Overall the game is probably not worth the price tag, as $9.99 requires a few hours of grinding before the game becomes really fun. I suspect that you'd need to buy the complete edition to have a fun time right out of the box. Unless there a patch to make the begining of the game more fun, or some incredible DLC packs it might be best for casual players to hold off on Duels of the Planeswalkers until next year.			"

												I really want to like this game, but it's just not fun. The deck you start out with is pretty terrible and they give you really hard opponents to try to get you to buy booster packs right away. I couldn't even look at my deck before I chose it, and now i'm stuck with a blue/black deck that i didn't even know had any black in it. I also can't change anything unless I buy boosters which cost $2. If I'm going to buy boosters I'm going to buy real cards, not waste money on fake booster packs. Even the Promo card is so terrible, it's not worth picking it up.			"

												The AI makes really terrible decisions sometimes. It doesn't seem to understand or take into account certain activated abilities on creatures. When the AI does something completely stupid (and does it again the next turn), it takes all the fun out of playing.A specific example is Elder of Laurels and its activated ability; the AI gets confused when the player has enough mana to use it, and will throw the game by suiciding its creatures one at a time.If it wasn't for the AI, I would recommend this game, because its other elements (such as deck-building) are quite good.

												Let me start out by saying I am in general a big fan of Magic and the Duels of the Planeswalkers games. But this is by far the worst DotP game, and there is a few reasons for that:First of all we need to address the menu controls. DotP games have always had clunky and annoying menu's and they seem to get worse every year. You have to scroll through pictures and every time you click on something the menu fades in and out instead of just going to the desired submenu, which gets very tiresome in the long run. There is also small annoying problems like how you play games to unlock boosters, and when you open a booster and get your new nice cards you can go into your deckbuilder from the booster-unlock menu, but you can't go back into the campaign from the deck builder menu, so everytime you unlock one card you want to add to your deck you have to navigate through all the menus again to get back into a game. And with the fade-in and fade-out this gets extremely annoying.There's also the fact that the decks are bad. Now now, hear me out, I know that the starting decks in DotP are always bad, but never like this. I had to complete around 60% of the campaign (Around the end of Ravnica) before I unlocked my first Mythic from a random booster, and it was green while I play U/R.In this game you get to create your own decks which is great and works rather well, but what they don't tell you is that you have to farm boosters (unlocked through 'exploring the planes' aka doing challenges and mini-encounters) and the boosters are completely RNG, so either you play a very underpowered deck or a very overpowered deck. I think this is rather sad since DotP is meant to teach new players Magic and be a casual game for us older Magic players, and a steady balance in all the decks was what made that playstyle work. In previous games the decks were balanced off each other, here it's all RNG.And when it comes to the AI... oh boy... You remember how in the elder games it felt like AI's drew exactly the right cards at exactly the right time? Yeah, here that becomes a normality.All in all it's still a DotP deck but I wonder if the 10euro+extras won't be better off just creating a Magic Online account and get a deck started there. This feels like playing Magic Online with draft decks, so I would rather recommend the real deal.			"

												It has around 300 cards availiable.  Three.Hundred.With 60% being commons, and mythic/rare/uncommon numbers limited respectively by 1/2/3 per deck, you end up with trash draft-tier decks no matter how ever you try with the deck builder.In the end, the game is about who draws that big card first, because the card pool doesn't have enough combos, or denials, or resets.  If you enjoy dropping big monsters and just sitting there trading blows, hearthstone is a better game for you.edit : and the game is a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor port as well.			"

												Well this is depressing, I was a huge fan of 2014, played tons of it, unlocked everything but this game is a bit of a mess. The terrible UI the lack of two-headed giant, the only real good point of the game is the addition of more flexibility in the deck editor. They even seemed to have stripped the ability to make decks over 60 cards and the card selection seems a tad arbitrary even in comparison to the other Magic games. There is a community thread going at the moment to petition WOTC to add back in two-headed giant, if that passes this game might be worth a play. Definitely not worth the money at the current time.

												If you're thinking about buying this game, you may want to reconsider. I regret my purchase completely, and here is why.This is a ten dollar game, with two dollar ""microtransactions."" 2015 claimed it would finally have real deck building, which it does. I didn't know part of that deck building experience was going to be paying money for cards. Yes, you can unlock cards in the game. It's pretty tedious, and the starting decks are mostly so awful that I'm pretty sure they made them that bad on purpose so as to try to get people to buy cards sooner. This might pass on a free to play title, but I already gave you ten dollars. I know one of you idiots is going to say ""BUT ARBY REAL MAGIC COSTS MONEY,"" and while that is true, it is also true that this isn't real Magic. I was under the assumtion that these releases weren't money grabs. My bad, I guess.The above point makes this game Pay-to-Win. No thanks. Again, so is real Magic. I get it, shut up.Speaking of the starting decks, they aren't explained well at all before you pick them. The text on them is almost misleading. You can try a deck out before you confirm that it's your choice, but once you have made the choice final, you're stuck with it. An option to look through the deck first would have been nice here. Even if I play against the tutorial guy with a deck two or three times, I might not see every card in the deck or even get a good feel for it as a whole.Puzzle mode is gone. What. The.♥♥♥♥♥♥If you can deal with all that, go for it. It seems pretty solid other than my complaints, which are pretty huge. At least to myself, I mean.			"

												I do not recomend this game to beginer players.The menu system is a bit slow and annoying. Also forcing the deck building seems a bit much for people who may not know how to really make a synergistic deck. Which the deck builder could use some work feels like it was made for consoles than PC.If you expect to play multiplayer your only options are 1v1, 2v2, 4v4 no two headed giant.They didn't bring sealed back which with this deck building could have been added for more multiplayer options.Hard to tell if I enabled or disabled an option or not but figured it out after trail and error.I like what they did but how is just so meh. I'll stick to playing M14 Duels for two headed. I'll play this fully to beat and unlock stuff but seriously it's lacking good multiplayer options. Give us Two Headed Gaint back and sealed play in and this would be a good Itteration. This seems like it two two steps back and one forward with removing two good things and adding in one that is hit or miss.Ugh premium packs suck don't make me pay to get cards I can only get that way. This game has always been pay $10 play and unlock all the stuff and have fun. Now it's trying to cash in on hey now you have a card collection you can't use elsewhere but only in this game and to get that one mythic you need to buy additional packs. Give a full unlock option not a rando here ya go good luck getting something good. Ugh stupid idea without a pay to get em all option.			"

												So I never bought one of these games before. I usually try them out first on my friends computer since he likes the virtual version of Magic. I on the other hand don't like it. I hated that you can not make you own deck, and had to use the premaid decks that I didn't even find fun to use. So my friend tells me to get this game, because you FINALLY get to make your own deck with cards from the past five blocks. IF YOU BUY THE COMPLETE EDITION...... so thats what I did. I thought all the cards would be added to the collection, like it stated in the description of the packs, but only to find out for some reason. I don't have any of the cards from any of the packs except the weaksauce deck you start out with and loose with a lot. I'm not sure if you get all the cards from the packs for doing something, or you just need to waste more money on booster because it's not like I blow tons of money on real Magic the Gathering. I just want my $35 worth of cards that they said ""added to collection"", not you can get some cards of the blocks that we allow you to get since you got the complete edition. Pros-1. Magic the Gathering is always fun to play online with friends2. Cool that you can build you own decks finally (Not much of a Pro. I explain why in Cons.)Cons-1. A little disappointed that the menu is slow. Not that it's to terrible, just dont know why they haven't figured out how to fix that.2. Complete Edition, is a complete waste of money. SInce I thought you got five blocks of cards free, so you can hop on and play with your friends. Nobody is looking for a long compaing with a weak deck that wins one out of every four times, IF YOU ARE LUCKY.......3.NO TWO HEADED GIANT!!!!!! I mean come on guys. You have been making this card game since 1994 and you ""missed"" the two headed giant mode. I'm not the only one mad about this, especially since this is like the sixth game they have produced. Very dissapointed in this.4.Game play is still slow, but I am okay about this.5.You can't actually build a deck since you have to play hours on end just to get some cards. (I know I haven't played much of this game, but this still stand from mt friends opinion)Overview-I thought this game would be different from the last ones, but they have proven me wrong once again. This is still just as terrible as the last ones. Maybe, just maybe, even worse than the other games. To be honest, make the 5 block collections that I payed for to have in my ""COLLECTION"", whatever that means, and use them to make a deck and play with my friends and this game will be amazing. That's all I want. that plus two headed giant. Can't forget that.I think this can be an amazing game, I really do. Please add this to the game and I will change my review.			"

												This game denifes a new term: AU = Artificial Unintelligence. So called AI in this game is stupid as a rock. And I'm not kidding you. In singleplayer mode computer plays ""curse"" cards on its own creatures, it doesn't take the victory even it's offered to it. So if you don't buy the premium package of cards, you'll have to play tens of hours against this stupid AI and it will not be fun at all.Game is also somewhat unstable. Prepare yourself for some random crashes to desktop and for sound problems (game sounds like to get distorted or go completly mute).User interface is also somewhat clumsy. (It's designed for iPad.) This game needs to be heavily patched or it's nearly unplayable. Multiplayer duels are ""ok-ish"" but with the problems stated above there are many other games that are just much more better and actually fun to play.

												This game is a joke. Why is there even a dificulty level? I turned it from archmage, to mage, to plansewalker and there is literally no difference. No change in card draws or attack or defence choices. First off: The starter decks are all duel decks, meaning two colors. Well if you know anything about those you know that just having a Blue+White deck does not mean ""That playstyle"". Here is a rough definition of the Blue+White Deck: ""Summon flying blue cards and use white cards to power them up"". Well here is the truth, Any white deck your choose has the very same white cards. Yet each White combo deck says different things like ""use white to power up"" or ""summon many white monsters"" or ""enhance your white cards while summoning powerful fire cards to defend"". Second off: Here is the kicker for me: Your DLC you BUY WITH MONEY DOES NOT UNLOCK TILL AFTER YOU BEAT THE FIRST AREA! Not the first person, the first area. And since you have All Combo decks and not a single Mono deck (one color) then it is gonna be a tough time for you.Third off: You pick a deck...you keep it. No way to change unless you restart your game. If you dont like the play style then tough. Buy booster packs...which dont unlock till after the first area. What a sham.			"

												I have loved the previous several years of DotP and played tons on my tablet and my PC. I prepurchased this because of the strong track record of the past years. This was a horrible mistake. I don't care about Two-Headed Giant, so don't think this is a thumbs down just because of that.Pros:-Improved graphics-More customization of decksCons:-Improved graphics means you need a significantly more beastly machine, which is insane for what is essentially a card game. I shouldn't need to swap from an i5 with solid integrated graphics to an i7 with a 760 in it to be able to play fluidly. That's insane.-The UI is supposed to look nicer, but it's nearly unusable. Enjoy clicking the same button in the menus six times waiting for it to actually work. Enjoy clicking and zooming in on a random card while trying to click some other button in a match. Enjoy incoherently placed options!-The power curve is ridiculous. The cards in your initial decks are garbage compared to the combos and power levels of even the first tutorial boss. I've played Magic for 15 years, and it's hard to fight third turn 5/1 first strike creatures when your deck only has 1/1s and 2/2s to feed you.There's no way this game was designed by the same team as previous years.

First time in my life I'M ASHAMED TO HAVE BOUGHT A GAME. Here are some list of things why Magic2015 is garbage: -The UI is horrible.

From deck builder to ""equipping"" a deck, everything is made to be played with a gamepad. You can't even use mouse scroll in collection where they have a scrolling bar. Welcome back to 1980s. -The AI is terrible. In hardest difficulty, it does such stupid mistakes it just boggles my mind how it's even possible to be so incompetent. -The cardpool is BORING. Of the 300 cards we have, a gigantic portion of them are vanilla creatures with no text. Not only they are boring but they are also underbudgeted. I saw some 3/2 for 4 mana with no effect on it, while AI was using a 3/2 for 4mana that had a great EtB effect. If you are familiar with old games card quality, everything is at the quality of the garbage tier. -The mana tapping is incredibly ************. For an example, when you have 3 mountains and 1 island, and have a 1 island cost card in your hand, if you would use a spell with 2uncolored 1mountain cost, in older versions of magic, the game would be smart and save up your 1 island so you wouldn't have to deal with spamming control key all the time. Now it messes you up all the time. Even when not using dual lands. It's like the game uses the only mana combination that will screw you up, EVERY SINGLE TIME. WTF. -Multiplayer is garbage. Appearantly some genius(!) decided you need to ""equip"" your decks. So you go and select a deck and lock in before you join a game. So if you thought you wanted to play your green blue deck but you forgot to change from your previous black deck, well you have to QUIT YOUR MULTIPLAYER GAME, go main menu, change deck, crawl back to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ menus while waiting for stupid foggy animations to happen 5+ seconds each click and go back in. Oh and you enjoyed playing with someone and want to play again? Or quickly swap your decks (like in sealed mode 2014) and keep going? WELL YOU CAN'T BECAUSE YOU HAVE A DECK BUILDER SO EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE GAME HAS TO BE ♥♥♥♥♥♥. -You spend half your time in menus. Yeah, to change a deck, or go to deck builder and change 1 card, you have to click back 5 times, and go click same steps, while struggling to move around stuff with mouse. -Despite claiming they fixed the bugs this year, guess what, so many of my friends can't even launch the game, it crashes before starting. GREAT JOB. -The game is stripped down from all fun multiplayer modes, no 2HG, no planechase, no archenemy, nothing. FFA FFA FFA OR FFA OH MAN SO EXCITING I CAN'T DECIDE. Countless posts about it, our genius lead dev decides to cut down one of the most played game modes from the game. -The campaign is BOOOOOOOOOOOOORING. I spent hours finishing it. And every campaign mission apart from 2-3 were aggro decks. The ones that weren't aggro are the decks that you have to be aggro to beat because at certain point they cast overpowered spells. -Ever since 2012, i played every DoTP game, over a thousand hours in total. And i loved the time spent. But this is the last straw. I'm done with magic. The only reason i was playing DoTP instead of MTGO is that because the game doesn't look like from 90s, Well, this one looks new but has less functional interface than 90s games. 184 of 186 reviews on steam is negative. There are many valid reasons for it.""			"

												I love Magic: The Gathering, and to me this game does not feel like im playing Magic: The Gathering. In Campaign i was playing against Jace and i played a few games on this mission, first couple of times the ""luck of the draw"" was not on my side, and i noticed that everytime we played, his first 3 turns were exactly the same every time, i must have restarted the duel and at least fifteen times to test it, and even left the game and re-opened it and still, first 3 turns... you guessed it, same as the last fifteen games i played. The whole point of shuffling a deck in a card game is to randomize the deck, and when literally the exact same thing happenes fifteen times in a row, i dont think that's exactly ""random"". It hurts me to write this, it honestly does, this is the first review ive ever written and it saddens me that i have to write a relatively bad review about one of favorite things to play. One last thing (a little less relative to the point) in my opinion the Main Menue, Pause Menu, etc. all come up too slowly, but thats my opinion. If you want to play the game, more power to you, im just writing my expirience with the game.			"

												Where are my Minotaur!!!I play MTG on a regular basics and being a big fan of the card game, I was hoping it would be something similar after watching preview for months!!! Only to be very disappointed, firstly not every card is available for your collection, which is understandable if we were playing Modern rules but it doesn't have all the cards for Standard which really frustrated me, as I was hoping I could create my deck from FNM. I was hoping that Hearthstone would kick them up the bum to release something at least competitive but I guess not.  All in all, I'm really disappointed and I doubt I will be purchasing anymore MTG digital games!!! "

												DotP 2015 is probably the weakest installment of the series so far. It has free deckbuilding, but at the cost of added microtransactions to get all the cards. Because os said transactions, the campaign mode is frustrating as your _single_ initial deck is terrible (so as to force you to buy boosters right away instead of progessing naturally). The wonky interface has been made worse by terrible menus. The soundtrack is much weaker. 3D Cutscenes were never good, but now they're just shadows walking around in the fog. The animated cards cutscenes (and zoom ins) are gone. Not only no special multiplayer mode (Archenemy, Planechase) has been added, but the 2HG mode has been removed.In conclusion, the new deckbuilding is largely overshadowed by its downsides and I would rather have bought an updated DotP 2014 with a new cardbase than this.

												This game denifes a new term: AU = Artificial Unintelligence. So called AI in this game is stupid as a rock. And I'm not kidding you. In singleplayer mode computer plays ""curse"" cards on its own creatures, it doesn't take the victory even it's offered to it. So if you don't buy the premium package of cards, you'll have to play tens of hours against this stupid AI and it will not be fun at all.Game is also somewhat unstable. Prepare yourself for some random crashes to desktop and for sound problems (game sounds like to get distorted or go completly mute).User interface is also somewhat clumsy. (It's designed for iPad.) This game needs to be heavily patched or it's nearly unplayable. Multiplayer duels are ""ok-ish"" but with the problems stated above there are many other games that are just much more better and actually fun to play. (e.g. Hearthstone, Might&Magic: Duels of Champions)			"

												Despite many of the negative reviews, I actually really like this game overall. Here's a breakdown.Pros:- You can custom build your deck to a much greater degree than in past DotP games- Reasonable card pool with many great and interesting cards- Good aesthetics though I wish the music would change more sometimes to reflect different environments- A feeling of progression as you unlock more and more cards with every duel won- Interesting ""explore"" feature that lets you grind for more cards (see previous) and give some flavor to the various worldsCons:- Certain aspects of user interface designed for mobile, so you'll have to 'scroll' left and right sometimes to get around- Campaign feels a little short even with the ""explore"" duels. - You DO NOT have any real synergy with your starting decks. This is unlike previous DotP where even a basic deck has some pretty clear synergy and combinations. You'll have to slowly get the pieces over the campaign and by the time you have any real synergy, the campaign is mostly over.  "

You get a starter deck that you have to make work using packs of random cards or pay extra real money for card collections. The UI clearly wasn't built with PC in mind. Multiplayer isn't available until you beat the tutorial and one world of the single player, which can prove difficult if you didn't choose one of the starter decks that do well against the decks in the first world.

												Gameplay is nice until the final boss, Garruk. Final boss was rigged for the advantage no matter what deck you play. You also have to defeat him twice, which I can defeat him once but the second time, his deck is too OP, especially with the terrible deck shuffle, you get a horrible disadvantage.I even took the liberty of building professional decks from tournaments and my own personal deck. You either have absolutely no mana, bad card lineup or Garruk spawns his cards too fast. I defeated Garruk the first time so much I know his lineup inside-out.Gate > Land, Search for Forest > Land, Garruk's Companion > Land, 4/4 Beast > Land, EnchantmentThe game occasionally glitches, and the opponent will only place lands down, no creatures enchantments or instants. Garruk also seems to find a way of getting past my Blue/White flying deck, and my own personal Beast deck with Garruk's Companions and Advocate of the Beast.For $1.99 you can buy virtual trading cards for the game. This is way overpriced and the cards are terrible, you rarely receive any relevant cards that can boost your deck. Most cards are repeated until you have (4) and then goes on to the next bad card. You can also buy collections for $4.99, and I didn't receive any good cards from that either. All purchases in this game are a complete rip-off, just like GTA Money in GTA 5.The creators developed a good game, but should patch Garruk to have the same chance of getting cards as you do. The game is rigged from the beginning, I was able to defeat everyone in the story mode except Garruk.I no longer play this game, the engine that shuffles your cards are horrible, I would much rather play with real cards, and buy real cards to physically posess and not disappear when I delete my savedata.6/10			"

												Duels of the Planeswalker - this is my inital response and after having played a game of it online against another player:It is worth getting if you have problems being able to play Magic elsewhere, or if you are new to the series but even then I would say its sketchy because as fun as it is to build your own deck and face it off your opponents, you can get stuck even at the tutorial depending on your deck you picked - the difficulty may cause a bit of a headache as well but considering I found the AI to be questionable when facing lethal damage... it may or may not affect much.Because most of the game comes - initially at least - from the deck you chooses that you can't switch or do anything with basically (you can modify it but with no cards until you've won the first campaign to unlock the boosters, it may not actually matter).The way you make your own deck is fine and unlocking boosters seem to be both easy and grind-able enough for people like myself who want very specific decks going into the multiplayer (altho', now even I will have to deal with the lack of perfect cards and I say that with a smile) so you're most likely going to be able to get the cards you want.Other than that, its still a Duels of the Planeswalker game with the same things you expect over and over again except two massive flaws in this installment:The menu is extremely clunky to maneuver and takes a long time to get anywhere if it isn't one of the first three icons... and then you'll still have to scroll thru' after that menu another one, and possibly a third one as well. Its clunky, unneccesary and annoying.And secondly, something which disturbs a great deal of people - no Two-headed Giant's mode (which is the same as a 2v2 mode in MTG with special rules)...Overall, the game seems fine but I still wouldn't recommend it unless you have no other way to play Magic.

												This year the developers made some aweful design choices, again.It's still a Duels of the Planeswalker -game, but the solo focus in this addition is Deckbuilding. That's not a bad thing at all, quiet good actually, but all other features and gamemodes have been scaled down due to this. Aweful designchoice.PRO:  - Deckbuilding unlike any other version of DotP  - You'll earn cards fast from playing the campaign  - Game is cheap with only 10 eu at launchCON:  - Menues are clunky and needs time to load properly before you can interact  - No 2HG (2vs2) in multiplayer! ONLY free-for-all 2 to 4 players  - Starting deck is weak and with low synergi  - Multiplayer not avalible before you finish first tierScore:  5/10  - It brings a much requested feature to the series with notched up deckbuilding, but the sacrifices by leave out other gamemodes like 2HG and archenemy leaves Magic 2015:DotP with limited lasting appeal.

												Still can't believe we finally got what we've always wanted from a DotP game, full deck customization. But they managed to♥♥♥♥♥♥it up by making it so the card pool is super limited and if you want to get the best cards you have to fork out extra AFTER spending 35 dollars on the ""Complete"" edition (Which i regret both because this is the worst DotP IMO and because I've essencially cheated myself out of the enjoyment of actually unlocking the cards myself... no one to blame but myself for that though.). Looking through the card pools it teases you with some decent cards in the otherwise abysmal selection, making it seem like ""Oooooh, I'd love to build a deck themed around that sweet goblin."" but then fail to deliver in bringing the selection needed to actually make a deck that feels good to play.They might be able to redeem themselves (Somewhat, at least. I mean saying sorry doesn't make it all better but it helps.) if they make it so you CAN unlock premium cards without paying and release updates to the card pool. But it's obvious that this is the DotP that wanted to get as much money from fans as fast as possible before everyone realized they were paying for something not worth the money.If you do buy this game at least don't get the special edition or complete bundle, it is a regretted purchase.

												Despite the fact that this game is considerably better than its predecessor, I find that I must give it a downvote. This is not necessarily because it’s a bad game; it’s more that I crave better. Currently it’s (for me) more comfortable to play using normal cards, rather than playing this game. Yes, yes. It all is esthetically pleasing, but that seems to all it is. The UI is bad. The tutorial is bad. The campaign is boring and the AI is horible at best. Don’t even get me started on the micro transactions throughout the game.The sad thing is; that this game should not reflect Wizards of the Coast in any way. Wizards of the Coast is a great company and they are really good with art (as seen in this game), but they are not good game designers. I pray that they will learn from their mistakes and make M2016 an, at least, tolerable game. Though, given the past history of Magic (M2014, M2013, etc.) it’s, sadly, not very likely.			"

												Doing away with the tried and true play of supplying focused decks with unlockable cards, Magic 2015 instead gives you a pool of cards to unlock from and build your own deck.  2014 attempted this with the sealed campaign, which failed miserably, so the decision to make this the basis for their whole game is mindboggling.Not only will this turn away new players who will find it impossible to know how to create a deck from scratch (Expect a lot of 5 color 100 card libraries) but in previous titles, segregating all the decks allowed each deck to have unique and incredible abilities.  Now that you can make whatever you want, anything interesting or fun must be removed to prevent exploitation, leaving you with nothing but boring, bread and butter decks.To top of this♥♥♥♥♥♥salad, you start with only a handful of cards unlocked, and are forced to pay to unlock the rest.  If you should instead desire to grind out the campaign with your♥♥♥♥♥♥cards for a dozen hours to unlock them instead, you will still be missing out on the best cards, of which are only found in Booster Packs you are forced to gamble on.  The game has been made stale, and worse pay-2-win, as whoever drops 100$ on boosters will always win.  RIP Magic Duels.			"

												If this game is going to force you to stick with one deck it should at least WARN you and let you preview the god damn cards. I also use a labtop... guess what gamemakers, I don't have a middle mouse button!Sure that is okay in game since the number 1 key works to zoom, but in deck builder, it doesn't work. I cannot for the life of me, zoom in in deck building mode.I enjoyed 2014, but this is about as un fun as a game gets. I don't get the PC game to play endless hours trying to build my own deck (don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind slowly doing this over a LONG period of time, but I usually just hop on for a match, let me pick from all of the starter decks all of the time).I don't think the devs put any thought into these decisions.

												Not a very good start to the game. They give you an incredibly weak deck and have you fight against well made decks in the campaign. Which leaves you with luck and luck only. If you don't get a good hand, you won't win. It's rather annoying, especially when all I want to do is just play multiplayer with my friends.			"

												Still can't believe we finally got what we've always wanted from a DotP game, full deck customization. But they managed to♥♥♥♥♥♥it up by making it so the card pool is super limited and if you want to get the best cards you have to fork out extra AFTER spending 35 dollars on the ""Complete"" edition (Which i regret both because this is the worst DotP IMO and because I've essencially cheated myself out of the enjoyment of actually unlocking the cards myself... no one to blame but myself for that though.). Looking through the card pools it teases you with some decent cards in the otherwise abysmal selection, making it seem like ""Oooooh, I'd love to build a deck themed around that sweet goblin."" but then fail to deliver in bringing the selection needed to actually make a deck that feels good to play.They might be able to redeem themselves (Somewhat, at least. I mean saying sorry doesn't make it all better but it helps.) if they make it so you CAN unlock premium cards without paying and release updates to the card pool. But it's obvious that this is the DotP that wanted to get as much money from fans as fast as possible before everyone realized they were paying for something not worth the money.If you do buy this game at least don't get the special edition or complete bundle, it is a regretted purchase.

												Despite the fact that this game is considerably better than its predecessor, I find that I must give it a downvote. This is not necessarily because it’s a bad game; it’s more that I crave better. Currently it’s (for me) more comfortable to play using normal cards, rather than playing this game. Yes, yes. It all is esthetically pleasing, but that seems to all it is. The UI is bad. The tutorial is bad. The campaign is boring and the AI is horible at best. Don’t even get me started on the micro transactions throughout the game.The sad thing is; that this game should not reflect Wizards of the Coast in any way. Wizards of the Coast is a great company and they are really good with art (as seen in this game), but they are not good game designers. I pray that they will learn from their mistakes and make M2016 an, at least, tolerable game. Though, given the past history of Magic (M2014, M2013, etc.) it’s, sadly, not very likely.			"

												Doing away with the tried and true play of supplying focused decks with unlockable cards, Magic 2015 instead gives you a pool of cards to unlock from and build your own deck.  2014 attempted this with the sealed campaign, which failed miserably, so the decision to make this the basis for their whole game is mindboggling.Not only will this turn away new players who will find it impossible to know how to create a deck from scratch (Expect a lot of 5 color 100 card libraries) but in previous titles, segregating all the decks allowed each deck to have unique and incredible abilities.  Now that you can make whatever you want, anything interesting or fun must be removed to prevent exploitation, leaving you with nothing but boring, bread and butter decks.To top of this♥♥♥♥♥♥salad, you start with only a handful of cards unlocked, and are forced to pay to unlock the rest.  If you should instead desire to grind out the campaign with your♥♥♥♥♥♥cards for a dozen hours to unlock them instead, you will still be missing out on the best cards, of which are only found in Booster Packs you are forced to gamble on.  The game has been made stale, and worse pay-2-win, as whoever drops 100$ on boosters will always win.  RIP Magic Duels.			"

												This game is terrible.If you make the mistake of choosing a deck you don't like you are stuck with it basically forever. (Also it should be noted that you can't see what cards are in what deck before you choose.) There is no way to rechoose or restart the campaign. (You only unlock the other decks when you gain all the cards to be able to actually construct them anyway.)Sure you can build a new deck as you get more cards every time you win a game, but that depends solely on you being able to win with a really crappily constructed deck a huge number of times. (You get maybe 2 or 3 cards of the color you want each win if you are crazy lucky, but, because the starter decks are so bad you probably only win 1 out of 6 games.) A huge number of gametypes and features have been removed from the previous versions. Two Headed Giant is simply no longer an option. Probably because the AI in the game took a huge step backward and they didn't know how to cope. It almost always selects the worst possibly option for any targeting, and seems incapable of choosing cards to autocomplete your decks. (It stuck 4 blue cards into a red/black deck that contained NO ISLANDS)The menu is so slow that I'm pretty sure NASA has less wait time when getting responses from to the Curiosity Rover on Mars. The title screen takes 15 seconds to get past. There isn't anything to load other than the menu, but the developers were so proud of their crappy smoke animation that they insist you watch the whole thing every time. There is also a ton of lag when playing the game. I have a PC capable of running Skyrim on the highest settings with some pretty nice graphical mods, but this CARD GAME lags like a snail through molasses. DON'T BUY THIS! IT SERIOUSLY SUCKS! Go get Magic 2014 if you really want a game like this. Better yet, go get Hearthstone.			"

												After multiple hours of xbox 360 xbox one and a few on PC, I must say this game has matured. (skip ahead if you dont intend to have DLC) If you have got the expansion, grinded all the cards and have the 5 free update packs, you have a variety to play with and can evem make a strong mono-color deck, maybe a tri-color deck. Options are more viable now. Even with all the cards unlocked things can be a little difficult, but a deck may be crafted that comes out ontop and if cards are put together properly i feel that the game can be taken to new heghts, If you plan on paying 15$ for the game, you will have lots of fun. It especially helps when you fight the last boss (garruk) twice and if you restart you have to play both of them all over.For those who dont buy the DLC you still have some options, Tri-decks will not be nearly as viable though, so if you prefer to stay in the dual deck range you are fine, decks made without dlc interference will be a little more rigid, but you can still craft something from the battle packs you unlock and the 5 free update packs. Again, it will be rigid, but sometimes it can be okay to be rigid, some of the cards in the DLC will never find a place in my deck, but boiling soup is a pain in the butt if Griselbrand or a Dragon is on your field. Note: this is still difficult to play if you dont buy dlc, however using the free update packs may help, I refuse to pull an IGN and say ""give them your money"" the game can be difficult, annoying and you may want to throw something, I got angry with it before DLC came out but i will have a rating down below.Overall comparison:2015/2014: 2015 increases versatility, we dont have people running around with a crappy samurai deck nor a supra eldrazi deck, it isnt impossible to win games and have fun.2015/2013: 2013 in my opinion was my favorite, the decks were all balanced so anyone could win no matter what deck people were playing, but in this game we see a little unbalancing issue, there are many ways around it since it is a deck builder and we can have any number of decks (from what i can see) but some cards from some colors are just too powerful to ignore.2015/2012: 2015 is a miraculous improvement, 2012 simply gave us a better version of 2010.2015/2010: the original game that started the series has faded, and in many ways I could say that both have very positive attributes, while two-headed giant is gone, i still have fun absolutely destroying my friends, and i enjoy fighting mirror matches on practice mode. however 2010 had more options for a dual, you couldnt edit decks as much as the other iterations but you could change the life amount, hand size (and for some who dont know there was a ""revenge"" version of nicol bolas for his original deck in 2010 that you could play against in 2-headed giant which was insane) all of this changed the way the game felt.If 2014 were a 10/10 this game would be a 7.65/10 (I argued with myself on this one...)if 2013 were a 10/10 this game would be a 6/10if 2012 were a 10/10 this game would be a 11/10 (vast improvements that made it better than the best possible product)if 2010 were a 10/10 this game would be a 10/10Rating:Overall the game w/ DLC is a 7.5/10 (this refers to how much i wanted to keep playing and had fun)without DLC this game is a 5/10 (in my opinion it really does add that amount of flavor but you might think differently if you play it the base game was good enough for me to play through but not replay over and over like after the updates and expansion)			"

												Magic the Gathering has always been exciting for me; whatever the hand or the colour I use, it is a great way to talk to my friends and have fun. However, Magic 2015 did not fully give me this. At lauch, the multiplayer didn't work too well and I still dislike the menu layout. Although I still definatley recommend the game to anyone, MTG pro or not. When I saw PC Gamer's review on the game, I instantly disagreed. Magic still gives an entertaining game for many hours of enjoyment. It is easy to grasp, but hard to master. A lot of the time, the AI is harder than real players, this shows how considerabley abundant the design of the game is. Whenever I launch this game I get a sense of happiness (even though there is still no two headed gaint which I cry all night about) :). 8/10 from me, a great improvement from Magic 2014! Thank you for an amazing game!			"

												This review will primarily be a comparison between this title and the older iterations.Pros: New cards and mechanics.  New campaign story.  Fully customizable decks as opposed to premade decks with a certain degree of customization.  Booster-pack-style unlocks allow faster progression toward having all the cards available through progression.Cons: Bright white interface and transitions are not easy on the eyes.  Game gives you one deck's worth of cards and forces you to either run through the campaign with it or shell out more money to unlock additional cards.  Booster-pack-style unlocking makes acquiring specific deck improvements a matter of money or time and luck.  Sound and damage effect animations appear entirely unchanged from Magic 2014.  Ads are still displayed at launch but also sometimes appear before a match.  Certain animations and controls during matches are sluggish, such as transitioning to and from combat and trying to un-zoom from the graveyard browser.  Lastly, it has been recited ad nauseum, but: lack of Two-Headed Giant game mode, or anything besides campaign, practice, and free-for-all multiplayer.TL;DR: Consider getting/sticking with 2013 or 2014, much more entertainment and less headache for the money.

I read the forums before buying this and once you get past the screaming idiots demanding a refund, you see people actually giving their opinions on the game. From what i could see, people were saying that the deck building is good, the UI is terrible, the game is too hard and just flat out unfair and also that microtransactions near destroy the game.So buying the game, i went into it seeing if these things were true.

This whole plan will fall through for them however, as the difficulty is where the biggest issue lies in my expeirence.Once going through all the tutorials of the ins and outs of the game, you have a final test.

												MTG fan since Urza era.this game is another method for WoC to make money. +Pros the illusion of deck building reminded my why i switched to FFG's A Game of Thrones which always announces the contents of its booster packs and   the game is competative and relies just on wits and skill instead of how much money you invest in it-Cons -needs hours upon hours of booster pack grinding which you only get through the campain or online gaming which both  i despise, so if youre a single player guy, this game is a no-no. Campaign is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ broken since you start from scratch and the pc already has legendary cards which get summoned in a really ""conveniently"" rate. I seriously doubt that drawing cards is randomly generated since i get my first 10 cards to be mostly land cards at least 3 or four times a day -too many ads about how you can spend more money on this game if you actually have a life and cant grind those tottaly random packs e.g card unlocks, deck unlocks, expansion etc etc .

												Never go Blue/Red, ♥♥♥♥ing useless. You either get all mana or no mana, creatures who are too expensive or spells that don't help in your situation. And yes I know how deck building works, the game always has an out for a killing blow or a good play. Unless you like BDSM don't play. Also you can't change decks easily so enjoy getting pooped on.

												-Horribly designed,  the inferface is too slow , too many loading screens.-Micro transactions get you the best cards , the 10$ pricetag is misleading.-The AI is really stupid and slow which makes the completion of the story boring and really long.-Collecting your bad-free cards takes a lot of time , so you need to play for a while with really bad , annoying , and poorly built decks.-A fine learning experience for players who are new to Magic The Gathering, even though they should play Duels of previous years instead.-Instead of constructed Magic decks, you can only play Limited - quality decks.-They took out a few new game modes from last games , like sealed and two headed giant.-Way less intuitive and smooth compared to previous Duels , for example , the land system is really bad, in previous Duels it would have calculated the tapping so you could have enough mana for your other spells in hand,  this year they just ignored it and the lands are tapped randomly.

												Ok. After 226 hours of playing this game i think its time to write a review. This game is good in some ways and bad in others.THE REAL PROBLEM with this game is that it doesnt have many gameplay mods. for example 2HG. I LOVED playing 2v2. It was one of my favourite mods. And they just took it away from the game without caring about the people that loved it or for those who were just playing it for this particular mod or others.THE REAL CON is that you FINALLY can construct your own decks. Putting in any colours you like, creating your own combos and unique ideas. That and one more thing is what kept me into the game. The other factor that made me play this game for so many hours are the new cards that were added and keep being added to the game.Now i want to say something to the company that made this game.1) Keep adding cards in this game.2) In the next magic game KEEP the abillity and the freedom of constructing your own deck.3) In the next magic game PUT MANY MODS and new cards and make a better ui u can rise the prise a little bit but many will buy it and you will keep the players IN the game. I am going to recomend this game. Only to the players that like 1v1 and prefer to play as a lone wolf. I am not one myself   But i still liked the game even if i am realy disapointed about the lack of mods.			"

												I've been waiting a long time before buying this game. As a former MtG player (two decades ago though) I was wondering how close to the real thing this game would actually be. And now I know...In fact, one of the main gripes I have is that it is exactly like the real thing. That is, you start out with a horribly crappy deck.  Back in the days I've spent way to much money building something better and I was hoping that this wouldn't be necessary in the online version. I know, I'm a naive muppet. Because wizards are all about making mo' money. The other option would be grinding and grinding aaanndd.... Normally I'm not afraid of grinding. I've played a MMORPG or two (or a ""few"" more). I'm actually a bit of a grind monkey. However the grind is exceptionally horrible in Dotp2015. Because you have such a crappy deck you will loose quite a lot. Your NPC opponents, while not all extremely powerful, will at least have a deck that functions. The ones that are strong are pretty much unbeatable at the start.Does it stop there? Afraid not. The UI, oh the UI. It must have been designed by an elderly primate with bad eyesight (and I feel I'm being exceptionally nice for calling you primate instead of a monkey, buddy). Everything takes AGES. You have to scroll through the menu as if you're a console hobbit. Ingame everything is amazingly slow as well. I would hate to see a powerpoint made by these designers. The card floats in, then it has to turn, then it has to glow a bit, then it has to pop in a swirley, then it has to look around the room if anyone needs a hug. It has time bars to let you wait a bit even if no move would be possible at all. Boy did I need a hug...To be honest. I never reached the multiplayer part of the game as I would want to build at least a semi-ok deck to start with. The deck building option was actually why I did pick up this game. But it's quite hard building a decent deck without decent cards. So do I recommend this game? Well maybe if your goal is to buy the wizard a new yacht or when you are completely braindead already and use it as therapy to keep you off the street. For all the other good folks, let's just stay away from this product shall we?			"

												I actually find this game to be a great edition to the Magic computer games. Being able to build your own deck is easily the best part of the game, although the starter decks they give you are absolutely horrible compared to the starting AI decks. Do yourself a favor and pick the red/black combo at the beginning of the game, then grind out cards exploring planes after you beat the first plane to get cards to build a deck of a color you actually want. The game has yet to freeze on me, but I have been playing on a gaming desktop so that might be why. I briefly played on my laptop (stock) and it was slow but it worked okay. I don't know why this game has been getting so much hate honestly, I find it much more enjoyable than magic 2014. One potentially negative aspect is the lack of 2-headed giant, but at the same time I also don't care so....yeah? This game is very well priced at $10; you can unlock all of the cards just by playing the game. As far as the interface of the game goes, I don't really see it as a problem if you play using a mouse. When I used my laptop the touchscreen didn't handle it nearly as well, but at the same time I'm not a gamer so I can complain about having to take a few extra seconds to access a video game: If I want to play, I'll endure five extra seconds of scrolling.Bottom line: If you like Magic, and you want to build your own decks, this is easily the way to go. If you're a nancy boy (or a girl named Nancy), I suggest you knock it off and buy this game anyways.			"

												This game came as part of a humble bundle I purchased.  I wasn't expecting much from it because I was under the impression that online magic games were pay2win crap, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that most of the cards can be unlocked just through playing.  If you are impatient and hate money you can pay a certain amount to get everything immediately.  I usually feel cheated when people play cards against me I don't have access to (e.g. when I play in a casual modern tournament and realize the guy sitting across from me has a $800 deck), but the pool of cards in this game is fairly small and you will be able to make a decent PvP deck very quickly.  I actually enjoyed trying to find a way to turn a handful of bad cards into something usable when I first started playing this game.  It's like playing a draft.  I can't imagine why other reviewers are complaining about the starter decks being weak, do you really need Black Lotus to beat a laughably stupid AI with a deck full of 2/2s?  It took me maybe a day to run through the campaign and I've been only playing PvP since and I find it strange how easily I can get a match, even when I play at odd times in the middle of the night or very early in the morning.  One thing I like about this game is that Wizards seems to have hand-picked the cards available in it.  There are still cards that are much better than others, but it makes the meta unique to just this game.  The graphics in this game are a bit buggy, but overall the interface is nice in an dumbed-down Apple product kind of way.All in all, it's a cool game if you like Magic.  Cockatrice is better, but this is still a nice change of pace from playing the same worn-out netdecks over and over.			"

												I try not to give meaningless reviews, so I put some time in the game before deciding to recommend it. Perspective: I have played the original Magic game in the 90's, and I did get the 2012 edition of the game. I do not play IRL Magic. Pros: 1) DECK BUILDING! I despised that I could not actually craft a meaningful deck in any of the prior games like 2012.         2) Multiplayer seems relatively stable in 1v1 duels, which is what I usually play online.          3) The AI is reasonablystrong, although it does get a bit predictable with extended playing.         4) I am disappointed that WOC seems far more interested in their pocketbook than customers' enjoyment. The  pandering to buy DLC is rather demoralizing. The good news here is that if you just PLAY THE GAME through,  and are willing to go win a few duels online, you can get all of the cards that are available in the DLC for free.Cons: 1) The fact that some of the higher end decks you fight in the single player mode have cards that you are not  allowed access to again speaks to the fact that the game is more about filling WOC's pocket than providing an experience that is as good as playing the IRL card game. That said, I still feel it was worth the $10 or so I spent on the game and the expasion. It would be nice if these cards were added to the player pool at some point.            2) Again, you (don't) get what you (don't) pay for: the single player game is bereft of almost all semblances of a  single player game: animations, cut scenes, etc. There may be a total of 25 seconds of unique graphics in the entire base game, including the intro animation. The original 90's game had a significantly better developed plot and GUI for travelling and having random encounters/duels.            3) Others have complained that the multiplayer lacks certain 3- and 4-player options that were present  previously. I cannot comment on this, but you can read others' reviews for the details.In short, the game is not perfect, but few games are. I find it a good way to blow off some steam playing online 1v1 or vs. the AI, but it is not a game you will spend 100 hours or 100 dollars on. Get it for cheap on sale, and enjoy what is there.			"

												For all of its flaws, I still think DotP 2015 is a great game.It doesn't have many of the features that the previous editions of the franchise did (2HG, Archenemy, etc.), and it doesn't have quite as much laser-focus on the decks it includes; you can build a green ramp deck, for example, but it won't go quite as big and bold as the Eldrazi-spamming equivalents in DotP 2012-2014. That said, if you're willing to experiment, the card collection on tap allows for many flexible and entertaining archetypes, and offers some of the first real support for 3+ color decks (your decks can include all of the Ravnica dual lands, as well as the cycles of Alara and Tarkir tri-lands). If you like building decks, this has a pretty interesting metagame, and you can now unlock all of the cards just through play (no more irritating pay-walls for the premium cards). If you like Magic, give it a shot - it's only $10.			"

												Having played all the other Planeswalkers games, I'd say that this one has a lot of potential, but falls just a bit short. Fortunately, there's an expansion announced that promises to fix the most glaring issue with the game.No, there is no 2-Headed Giant. While I do consider it to be a significant loss, it's not a dealbreaker for me.In my opinion, this is plenty compensated for by the full deckbuilding capability, the large pool of cards, and the rather interesting campaign.I just bought the basic game, and was plenty satisfied with unlocking all the cards, had fun unlocking the acheivements, and  experimenting with various decks.

												Genre - Card Game coversionAs a fan of MTG I would suggest getting this version if you haven't already, through via sale would be better. I delayed getting it as had been MTG'd out at the time of release.I have played all the other Magic the Gathering PC games and the real card game. I also enjoyed the critically destroyed Magic Tactics and Battlegrounds on the Xbox. So I might be a biased fanboy, be warned!There are a few things worth noting before you purchase:There is no two headed giant this time around, which is a shame.This time around you unlock packs as you progress allowing you build fully customised decks, which is nice.There are achievements to hunt.MTG 2016 will probably be out soon.In conclusion:Enjoy via a sale, or wait a bit longer for the next one...

												The game should be optimized for PC, cause some things are really weird:-need to change the configuration file in order to change screen resolution-the antialiasing seems not doing anything (the cards borders will not look smooth neither with 16x)Anyway the game is fun a good way to learn how to play. Moreover, people complains because there are some dlc which you can buy in order to have more cards.. but it's only few dlc and many of those cards can be unlocked in the singleplayer mode. Apart that, all the players are the same and the tactic is most important.This makes a big difference from heartestone in which people can buy how many card packs they want, week by week, and they will defeat you because of bought cards.The multiplayer is fun and the singleplayer too, till when you are able to unlock new cardsThe deck management is very good.I think this game is worth it's price.

Pros:+ great cards+ full deck customization, lots of possible deck builds and strategies (as opposed to 2014)+ found some really good players with interesting deck ideasInterface is annoying, but can be lived with. Cons:- there is no automatic matchmaking, just random lobby joining with ready buttons. There is no real ladder, tournaments, multiplayer mode and ranking does not encourage you to play. - land draw and card draw probability seems a bit unreal compared to same deck composition with real cards. - some players can grief by being afk in lobby or ingame, or crashing the game to force you to leave			"

												Ladies and Gentlemen,Much has been made about this game's apparent step backward, about the developer's cash hungry tactics in its attempt to further monitize their game, about the non-intuitive menus, and about the sluggish performance both online and off.I am not here to talk about any of that.  That's not why I just shut off the game I paid heroic American dollars for, nor is it why I almost exploded my nervous system in my frantic rush to the store page to leave this review.This review serves as a monument to the single worst tutorial I have ever experienced in my entire life.  If you bought this game with the purpose of playing the campaign mode, be prepared to be spoon-fed Magic the Gathering by what sounds like a member of the local rotary club.It's like being taught to play Dungeons and Dragons one paragraph at a time by Frances McDormand, and she won't start speaking until you say, ""Next!""I seriously cannot explain the hatred I have for this tutorial with weak human words.  This is the Jar-Jar Binks of tutorials.  It may have ruined this and the next two games for me.  By the light of the silvery moon, who in the world thought this was a good idea.  I have had viruses more pleasant than this.  Why no option to skip it?  Did you think that you would be robbing us of hearing the dulcet tones of the soccer-est of moms while she reguritates one pre digested morsel of Magic at a time into our waiting beaks?I am going to walk away, perhaps shower, and think about utilizing Steam's revamped refund policy.  I dread going back to this game because of that woman and her mocking, patronizing tutilage.  Do better next time, Stainless, and may God have mercy on your souls.I thank you for your time.			"

												I have played this game enough by now to feel comfortable to do a review. I hope so anyway.In fact, I completed almost everything except collecting the last set of cards.Pros : great introduction to magic, cheap price if you buy the base game only, deck building tool, online play is fun.Cons : starting decks are weak, buying packs was too expensive and got corrected not long ago, multplayer is 1v1 only.This game is mostly done for new players because the game phases are very clear and (after some patching) the mana tap is handled pretty good by the computer itself.I like the Deck building tool but we are quite limited. We don't have access to any complete set which is alright I guess for a small game, but it would be awesome if it was available.The deck building tool is ok but it would be nicer if you could draw hands to see how reliable those starting hands are.Online play is fun but they removed the 2v2 mode and maybe some more. I have never been a huge multiplayer guy but 1v1 only is boring quite fast and now it is the only way to get the premium set as far as I know. Before you could buy the premium boosters at 2$ each which imo was too much for a game that is not related to MTGO at all.I wish this game was linked to MTGO in some way because it would incite players to try the ""real"" thing. The starting deck in  this game are very weak. You can complete the game by adding the cards you unlock over time but it will take a while at first. If you are good, obviously it will be easier and you will know what to change but imo this game is not realy the best thing for experienced players since it is too limited. Its fun, but its not enough for them. With that idea in mind, those starting decks are too weak and boring for a new player to realy get hooked.Well that's pretty much it ... I will just add a part for Wizzard of the Coast in general here ... They should realy start thinking smarter about their licences. Imo having to buy your cards in real life and then buy them again on MTGO is pure greed. Sure, they need to make money but this has stopped me at least twice from trying MTGO. I spend a lot of money on real magic cards ... I wish I could have a big discount (not free) by entering some code on MTGO and get the cards I just bought. Anyway ... maybe some day. They also need to make their MTGO client better. Its slow right now (beta one I tried a month ago) "

												(TLDR This game is a total lie don't waste your money). They promote the game as if you will get to build your own deck by earning cards from recent popular sets such as theros and inistrad, but in reality you have to pay an additional $40 to unlock most of the good cards in the game. You are left with a pool of cards which do not synergize into anything overly fun to play. Even after having grinded 10 hours of inistrad and theros, to the point where I have all the cards I can get from both campaigns, I still cant make aything much better than a poor sealed or draft deck. All I wanted was to play magic without having to spend hundreds of dollars on cards but once again Wizards has shown they don't care about you having fun, they just want you to pay for their digital cardboard.

												The terrible microtransaction system this game has in place ruins what would be a fun game.  Unlike the past duels of the Plansewalkers games, right off the bat at the end of the tutorial (that the game forces you to finish to progress through the campiagn), everyone who already put money into buying the game is on uneven footing.  This is because once you beat the tutorial, you get a single ""premium"" booster pack.  In order to get a premium booster pack after that, you must purchase them for the small fee of $2.  Well those $2 purchases add up and after youve spent around $30, youll be able to have every card in the premium booster set.  What makes things worse is that the cards in the premium set are all amazing.  The developers purposely put some of the best cards to build decks around into the booster set that you have to purchase after already buying the game!  So in order to fully compete or even to have fun against the other players in multiplayer, you HAVE to spend that extra $30 to get the cards you need since, chances are, youll run into a bunch of people who have already paid the extra $30 or so to beat on people who dont want to pay to unlock mandatory content in a game theyve already purchased.  Maybe in the future theyll fix this issue with the dlc, but until they abolish the premium booster pack model, this game is broken and not worth its $10 price tag plus whatever the dlc will be.This is the perfect example of a pay to win game model.  Stay away unless you are willing to throw an extra $30 down the drain to be able to have a fair match with other players in multiplayer.  If you really have an itch to plays a duels of the planeswalkers game, go buy the 2012, 2013, or 2014 versions.			"

												Where to start... Even though I cherish the idea of building my own decks, this version does it from scratch, and now I miss the previous opportunity to amend the pre-made decks. Those were at least more fun to start playing with. In this version, you play dumb decks for quite a long time, while unlocking ""boosters"". The money grabbing idea to pay for the ""fat packs"" is insulting.Most disappointing points of this game:1. Deck building & cards that are available for the first X hours of game (I never thought I would say this for MTG)2. Horrible multiplayer lobby 2.a. Kicks us both out after each game, so we have to send invites again2.b. Private button hidden, see above2.c. I cannot change decks from within the lobby2.d. Voice get interrupted while loading screens (as it was in 2013, at least this was fixed in 2014)3. Silly moving battlefield when changing to the combat phase (I want to play quickly, and the cards keep sliding under my pointer)4. Is known to hang (MP).I am sorry, but this looks very amateurish as if it was purposefully made to annoy and complicate, and slow the gameplay. I am hugely disappointed. I think this will be the last MTG Duels game that I will purchase.			"

												Pay-to-win. That is the best way you can describe this game. The problem isn't that there are micro transactions, this is a card game afterall, it is that the game starts you out with a pretty bad deck and then expect you to play against decks that are more composed and have flat out better cards. There isn't really anyway to consistently get cards unless you pay for them.This is a much better looking game compared to previous iterations and the deck builder is a welcome addition. However, spending money on cards to play against AIs isn't really enticing. It would be extremely distateful if Hearthstone was AI online and it still had microtransactions. You might as well pay for cards on Magic: The Gaterhing Online. You can at least play against real people there and if you really wanted, eventually trade out sets of digital cards into paper cards.All in all, not recommended. Half the fun of Magic is playing with people which this game already lacks. The other half is deck building and collecting which it has, but is no use if no one else values a digital collection on a game that isn't multiplayer. It's like if there was a version of TF2 where hats added stats, hats cost money and the only way to really win was to buy a few hats. After that, you would just play against your AIs while everyone else was playing the real TF2 with friends and strangers. Not fun.			"

												A fun game with a simplistic user friendly layout.  The game itself doesn't require allot from your pc making it accessible for a wider group, not just the people with PC high end gaming rigs wich allot of modern games require at this time. Multiplayer runs smooth just make sure to turn off ""animations"" for the best/fastest gameplay.  I really enjoy the new deck customization features, wich gives you full freedom to create a deck to your liking or you can choose a premade deck if you're new to the game and go from there. I read in some other reviews people complaining about how they have to pay extra to unlock more cards, this is false you can actually unlock all the cards in the game by playing the game or buy the 'special edition' and get all the card unlocked if you're lazy. It'll be nice if they'd bring back '2 vs 2' aka 'Two headed giant' multiplayer option in the next game, maybe even a draft option perhaps?  Personally I didn't mind them taking it out since I like 1 vs 1 and FFA more.As a longtime MTG fan, I'd recommend the game to anyone who likes card games and fantasy.			"

												<b>Do NOT buy this game, not even in a humble bundle! </b>The worst disappointement I've encountered since lots of years! I startet playing Magic in the early 90s with Alpha and kept on playing with just a few breaks. Via pure luck I noticed M14 and loved the game for it was a nice made game with intuitiv controlling and fun to encounter. I have no clue how in hell the programmers could have messed up this game. But maybe I am just stupid and do not get the hidden messages. At least some fun would have been nice but this was nearly impossible too. Installed the game three times to give it a new chance but it was wasted time.... always! View the pro/con list:Pro+ More deck buildung opportunitiesCons- Unfair enemies: pre sorted decks in the campaing instead of random cards and therefore they can use even the worst cards with costs of 9 mana and so on because they know they will have it...- You have to beat this ()=""JU()""$""$)= in order to get better cards- The endboss Garruk is a 'pita' for you have to beat him twice in a row while he changes his presorted decks and you hardly need your top opening hand for him in order to have chance- The overall starting cards are weaker than in M14 which makes it an even more frustrating task to get better decks though they don't stop showing you some ""buy"" buttons for faster programms...- Some mods like 2-Headed-Giant seem missing- There is no tracking of whom you have beaten and whom you have to so you cannot keep score of where to get new cards and where you already got some- Bright white/grey on the battlefield (you cannot change this) and in the menu is no fun to look at for it stresses the eyes. In M14 they used a very readable dark blue/orange combination which was much better to look at.- The battle screen is a thick red line with a bad contrast to the bright battelfield and it lies at about 65% height with no option of extension in battle (very hard to read and aim if many creatures fight)- You have to scroll all the menus all the time because they used a smart phone look instead of listed tabs. And of course you only see your actual path with no hints where you came from though there would have been plenty of space for a small tree/part/etc.Sum upIt makes me sad, mad, disappointed, angry... honestly I do not know. It is one of worst gaming experiences I ever made and I bet R-Type on the SNES in super hard mode. This game is worth no penny and I hope the developers r... let's better not say anything than something bad. Unfortunately there is hardly anything positive to tell.*thumbs-down-down-down-doooooooooooooooooown*			"

												Huuuuuge dissapointment. I adore magic, I play IRL as well as owning PC 2014 and 2013. I was hoping that 2015 would be more of the same (if it aint broke...) but sadly it's really not. It's trying to emulate IRL magic by allowing you to make your own decks from scratch. That wouldn't be so bad if it was an added extra to the decks you get from the base game. Unfortunately, at the end of the tutorial boss (which you have to play, there's no choice to skip it) you pick a deck from the list. A list which tells you nothing bar maybe the colour of what you'll be choosing. Aaaaand, that's it. That's the only deck you get. From that point on, you earn cards through playing the game. Each time you win, you get a booster. But you'll get stuck pretty sharpish as your starter deck won't effective against certain planeswalker decks (Eg; Your deck is black zombie based, and the Planeswalker is white prot. from black), and you won't have enough boosters to make a deck sooo...... Microtransactions. In the other two PC magic games I own, you can buy extra decks for under £1 and they give you enough flexibility to modify existing decks and do on. In this one, you pay £3.99 for a booster which has all the cards from a certain plane. So.... you get a poor amount of really average cards from which to try and build a deck to use. Inevitably ending in a terrible deck. The whole point of being able to make a deck from scratch is that you can choose what it does (milling deck, white weenie, green monsters, graveyard based....). And you CAN'T do that in this game. You just can't. So you just build sub-par decks from boosters with no ability to try and get specific cards like you can IRL, so the whole thing is rendered entirely pointless. As another point, the campaign is MUCH shorter than the two previous versions. I guess they thought they'd get away with it considering that the game is almost impossible without spending a fortune in microtransactions? Sure, that really stretches a game out. Making them too skint to play it properly. Another issue, the menu's are terrible. All very pretty, sure, but a total s**t to navigate. Just quitting the campaign to get back to desktop involves going through 5 different menus. Madness. Big thumbs down, I'm very disappointed.			"

Akward and unresponsive.-Short campaign, and then? multiplayer is all there is.On the subject of the premium packs? Well, lotta overreacting IMO. After looking at them, not a single one of the cards felt neccesary. Would I like them? Sure. Do I overly care? Not in the slightest. Yea, I ended up with 2 packs (one for preorder, one for owning 2014). Only really use a couple of the uncommons i got (paragons) because... well, why not. I got 'em!Basically, fun for the deck building, but the cutting of so many other features (2HG, or any other variant of the game) renders it into nothing but a weakend experience over any of the previous years. damnable shame.

												One of the worst interface ever made , the game is soooooo sloooooooooooow. I'm never able to make the right choise becouse I forget to stop the time , I select the wrong card from the deck , I select the wrong creature , I select the creatures in the wrong order... and the list keeps going. I can't understand how the were able to interpretate the game so badly, expecially the interface, they need to fire the UI designer, but I doubt they have one... half the time I played the game the result was an alt+f4 ragequit becouse I lose a 20 minutes long match just becouse I screw to clic on the right card. Moved by the hunger for money they give out new card just when you win... how can I win if I don't have the cards IN THE BEGINNING? It was fair if they give the players one pack if I lose and two if I win, but instead you just get one if you win, so you are forced to buy the dlc. I spend all my curses and blasphemies for this game ... I can't stand anymore. From such an excellent game, whit an outstanding amount of exceptional artworks, they where able to create just a student project level game...			"

												This game was designed for the tablet first of all. It is no wonder why the PC menu screens are horrendous. Click the continue button (over and over again) and wait out the damn fog special effect before the next screen. I'll admit that my complaints are hardly worth mentioning, but you know what is? WHERE THE HELL IS TWO-HEADED GIANT MODE?! Waste of money..DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!			"

												Bad interface, small number of cards, bad multiplayer matchmaking, that connects you with same idling people everytime, boring  single player mode. Comparing to previous versions - especially first one, you can say that playing M:tG on PC was never so boring before.  However, if you like M:tG, you still can consider it, because of quite low price. Choice is yours.Edit: Nah, I didn't change my opinion. Just want te get a badge for it :P			"

												Hours of gameplay? That's a big fat lie. You only get five extra duels on one single plane. I thought I was getting five planes and it would actually provide me with hours of gamplay.

												Hilariously bad menu UI is by itself enough to make this game nigh unplayable. Unlike in the previous DotP games, you actually *can* build a deck from scratch, which is nice, in theory. In practise unlock decent cards so slow you'll likely never get together a deck that's fun to play before quitting out of boredom. The starter decks are awful, too: there's no synergy or theme, just a collection of bad cards.Oh yeah, and most of the actually good cards are locked behind microtransactions in any case, it's not like you'll ever actually open good cards from the boosters.Lacks most of the play modes from the previous DotP games.Just buy the 2014 one if you're dead set on playing (digital) MtG.

												TLDR:  Show me the moneySo I got this game hoping for something a little different from MTG 2014, more cards, different decks, etc. The game does have new cards from 2015, but it comes with a terrible cost: 24.99 to be exact + the cost of the game. You start off with a deck of your choosing, but they don't let you look through them before you make your final decision. The ""starter decks"" are all bad, just terrible. You can ONLY get all the cards by buying the premium package. You get boosters from beating the campaign mode, but you cannot go back and fight someone you have already defeated to unlock more cards. This is a game breaker for me since I am at point I cannot build a better deck without spending more money, I cannot get anymore booster packs because you cant fight the same person twice and get a booster, and I cannot defeat this AI with a great built deck. The campaign stoped for me at the 3rd person you encounter. The UI was made by a college undergrad. The AI gets a 8/10 deck while you get a 2/10 deck if you are lucky. Good luck getting past the first phase without giving them more money.Should have listend to the other reviewers.			"

												So... Quick and Dirty.Pros: -Customizable Decks. It's your deck, you unlocked the cards. Go nuts.Cons:-Interface OBVIOUSLY designed for tablets/touchscreens. Akward and unresponsive.-Short campaign, and then? multiplayer is all there is.On the subject of the premium packs? Well, lotta overreacting IMO. After looking at them, not a single one of the cards felt neccesary. Would I like them? Sure. Do I overly care? Not in the slightest. Yea, I ended up with 2 packs (one for preorder, one for owning 2014). Only really use a couple of the uncommons i got (paragons) because... well, why not. I got 'em!Basically, fun for the deck building, but the cutting of so many other features (2HG, or any other variant of the game) renders it into nothing but a weakend experience over any of the previous years. damnable shame.

												Pros :- Finally added a booster pack mechanic!- Decks are more customizable than in previous versions of Duels of the Planeswalkers.Cons: - The ugliest menus I've seen in a modern game that seems to actually be trying.- Ugly transitions too.- Card selection is VERY limited if you don't pay extra, and even then you're just limited by the very small total number of usable cards in the game.- If you pick a weak deck at the beginning of the game, you could end up completely stuck very early on.  For example, I chose the GB deck, but then it turned out that the game has extremely few cards that even support the deck's strategy at all, and almost all of the ones it DOES have simply aren't available until you get a lucky booster pack, so it's just a mishmash of weak green and black cards.- If you do get stuck, good luck getting any new cards without having to buy them with real money!- AI opponents have access to cards that the player can never get.  Someone took the time to program these cards into the game working correctly and then doesn't even let the player get them?  That's lame!- Somehow manages to have LESS features than previous versions of the game.- No two-headed giant.I enjoyed Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014, but this iteration of the series is just terrible.  Go buy something else instead.			"

												Okay, here's how I see it. Many people are peeved that this games is either ""too hard for them"" or they are simply not happy with the mechanics of the game or they claim that it doesn't have enough cards. I see it like this. TRY LOOKING AT WHAT HAS BEEN RELEASED FOR THE ACTUAL 2015 TCG AND THEN MAKE YOUR JUDGEMENT!!! The game has almost every card for the 2015 pack. It does take a little bit to get started, I admit. I actually liked the challenge presented to me for creating new and diverse decks. The game play could use a little tweaking, as I have found a few deviations from the rules that I find only mildly annoying. As far as an over-all review goes: I love the game. My suggestion is this: Make your own deck! Figure out what style works best for you and go with that. Expand on it. Optimize it. And when you get to the point that you get tired of your current deck, build another one and start cleaning house with that. This is a TCG-based game, it's not Borderlands, Mass Effect, or ES: Skyrim. It's not made to be a vast adventure that you embark on to rid the world of all evil in a 3-D setting with a diverse character set, customizable characters, and graphics that will blow your mind. It's A TCG-based game. Simple, with a basic story line in which the fate of the multiverse relies on your cards. Simple, fun, and concise.			"

												I want to thank the developers for all the fun that MTG has brought me since my first purchase in 2012 on steam. however, I think this will be my last investment of the MTG games on steam unless the next MTG (2016) will contain a button in the settings to turn off the AI deck stacking.I persomaly dont like playig multiplayer, so single player is important to me. Part of the joy of magic is that no two games are alike because of the luck of the draw. If I were to stack my deck when playing with freinds and eventually caught doing so, If my excuse was to make the game more challenging, I would be called a cheat. please dont prevent me from supporting you in 2016. Add the anti cheat option in your settings for 2016.Forcing a challenging game is not fun. Enjoying fair competition through luck of the draw is. Isn't that part of the alure of MTG?			"

												(TLDR This game is a total lie don't waste your money). They promote the game as if you will get to build your own deck by earning cards from recent popular sets such as theros and inistrad, but in reality you have to pay an additional $40 to unlock most of the good cards in the game. You are left with a pool of cards which do not synergize into anything overly fun to play. Even after having grinded 10 hours of inistrad and theros, to the point where I have all the cards I can get from both campaigns, I still cant make aything much better than a poor sealed or draft deck. All I wanted was to play magic without having to spend hundreds of dollars on cards but once again Wizards has shown they don't care about you having fun, they just want you to pay for their digital cardboard.

												The game is fun to play because it's Magic, and Magic itself is a very good game.If you have a previous version of this game, buying the 2015 doesn't worth.Building your own deck is very fun and enjoyable, you lose sometimes until make the deck idea work, but IT's how Magic works!The worst idea they had for this version: Premmium Boosters (makes Duels of Planeswalker have no reason to exist)To build your deck you have some cards you can collect in the campain, but THE cards, the ones that make different deck ideas work you can only get if you buy the Premmium Boosters (paying of couse!), this makes many players use the same cards in the multiplayer, and it's annoying.For example in my deck i'm using a six mana burn card that inflicts 5 damage because i simply don't have better direct damage option! (makes me miss the lava axe)It's a shame the amount of bad reviews, the programmers of the game deserves more than that, the desingners deserves more than that, all the team that worked in the game deserve more than that, Magic deserves more than that...The bad work was done by the financial team, almost ever they mess up the games we like... when will they learn that ""happy gamers"" = ""cash in long term""?But I will try to fix something (that obviously they will not do):Create a DLC with two or more planes (or regions of planes, whatever) to unlock ALL the cards (and give it for free for anyone that bought premmium boosters), this would take this game from the worst reviews to the best reviews and DoPW 2015 would be the best Magic casual game ever.

After 2014, I had hoped that the series was headed in a really good direction, but this iteration is several steps in the wrong direction.

												This game is TERRIBLY dissapointing. The 2014 version is better in almost every way. Here is a few of the things that annoy me the most:    1. You HAVE to pay quite a lot of money to get all premium cards. There is no way to get it by playing the game like in 2014.    2. They removed Two Headed Giant (playing 2v2). One of the strongest game modes from previous versions.    3. Menues are way too slow and annoying to navigate. They are clearly designed for tablets but will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, playing on PC.   4. Unlocking all cards (excluding premium cards), is way to fast and easy. Can probably be done in like 20 hours or less. In 2014 I have 246 hours played and I have yet to unlock all cards for all decks (probably about 70% there).I would NOT recommend this game.

												Eery year MTG comes out with a new game that is still Magic but has other goals. I beliee it was MTG 2012 which had Archenemy which was my faorite. I am not a fan of pvp. I like to play against the computer. In this installement, There isn't as much of that. I completed all the AI levels in a day. What is good about that is eery round you win you get to open a preset booster with mostly crappy cards and you can make your own decks from scratch. But after my 1 day of defeating the AI, I hae two choices. I can go back and beat the same levels again with a different deck and get no rewards or I can go and play against another player which I am not fond of. Also I miss 2hg and Archenemy. Debatible if I will continue buying them as they come out each year.			"

												I have played this game enough by now to feel comfortable to do a review. I hope so anyway.In fact, I completed almost everything except collecting the last set of cards.Pros : great introduction to magic, cheap price if you buy the base game only, deck building tool, online play is fun.Cons : starting decks are weak, buying packs was too expensive and got corrected not long ago, multplayer is 1v1 only.This game is mostly done for new players because the game phases are very clear and (after some patching) the mana tap is handled pretty good by the computer itself.I like the Deck building tool but we are quite limited. We don't have access to any complete set which is alright I guess for a small game, but it would be awesome if it was available.The deck building tool is ok but it would be nicer if you could draw hands to see how reliable those starting hands are.Online play is fun but they removed the 2v2 mode and maybe some more. I have never been a huge multiplayer guy but 1v1 only is boring quite fast and now it is the only way to get the premium set as far as I know. Before you could buy the premium boosters at 2$ each which imo was too much for a game that is not related to MTGO at all.I wish this game was linked to MTGO in some way because it would incite players to try the ""real"" thing. The starting deck in  this game are very weak. You can complete the game by adding the cards you unlock over time but it will take a while at first. If you are good, obviously it will be easier and you will know what to change but imo this game is not realy the best thing for experienced players since it is too limited. Its fun, but its not enough for them. With that idea in mind, those starting decks are too weak and boring for a new player to realy get hooked.Well that's pretty much it ... I will just add a part for Wizzard of the Coast in general here ... They should realy start thinking smarter about their licences. Imo having to buy your cards in real life and then buy them again on MTGO is pure greed. Sure, they need to make money but this has stopped me at least twice from trying MTGO. I spend a lot of money on real magic cards ... I wish I could have a big discount (not free) by entering some code on MTGO and get the cards I just bought. Anyway ... maybe some day. They also need to make their MTGO client better. Its slow right now (beta one I tried a month ago) "

Despite the inclusion of fully customizable deckbuilding, Magic 2015’s clunky menus, buggy presentation and threadbare content make for an unparalleled gaming disappointment.Magic: the Gathering: Duels of the Planeswalkers 2015 is half of a game and not a particularly good half at that. The clunky menus, buggy presentation and threadbare content make for a huge disappointment that is impossible to overcome. The deckbuilding may be good to a degree, but once you’ve grinded out all of the game’s content just to get to those precious cards that make the game work in the first place, what are you really left with?  Once you’ve got that perfect deck what do you actually do with it?A lacklustre, badly implemented multiplayer with no 2v2 or special game modes simply won’t last you more than a weekend at the most and compared to previous games in this series that is simply nowhere near good enough.Every review I’ve seen of this game so far has mentioned it so I will too; Blizzard’s mega hit Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft has raised the bar for digital card games way out of sight. Duels needed a response to show it could still perform and it’s failed so very badly. If you are looking to play a new card game try Hearthstone; it will likely serve you much better than this shoddy effort.Read the full review at my blog »[www.celjaded.com] "

												Being a long-time Magic player since 1993, I love DOTP 2013 and 2014. I got 2015 during the summer sale when it was cheap, but even then I should have listened to the warnings, because this really is as bad as it gets. Unlike in 13 and 14, you cannot unlock other decks and only have access to some cards by actually BUYIng them, totally contradicting the reason why people played DOTP because they didn´t want to BUY new cards as in other implementations of the game, like Magic Online or even ye olde real version. The graphic interface looks like it´s been done by tablet programmers, it really is that awful. Swiper, no swiping. "

												I should have payed attention the the reviews for this here on Steam. Everything that everyone is saying is true. I will admit, the game is polished and fun to play until you realize that none of the cards provided to you can contribute to any good strategies. Unless you shell out the extra dough for more cards, you will probably only ever get through the campaign with sheer luck. I feel like this game was deliberately designed to anger people to the point of spending more money on it. I wouldn't mind spending a few bucks more on it, but 2 bucks for a booster of ten digital cards and I don't even know what is going to be in it!? Do yourself a favor and spend your money on something else because this is a complete waste even for 10 dollars.			"

												Difficult to win online if you don't buy the card packs up front. Grinding to get free card packs is boring and frustrating. mana flooding and mana screws happen more than in real life by a large margin even with good land spell balance. The format for the actual game is terrible; the menus are clunky, requiring a click just to see the next option on the list. This game is terrible whether you're new to Magic or a veteran player. All around awful buy, you'd get more enjoyment out of lighting the ten dollars on fire.			"

												2 bucks for a booster pack, 5 bucks for EACH ""planes"" set. 20 bucks to unlock all non-premium non-planes cards -_-.VERY limited decks. It's annoying to see the NPC opponnents use decks that aren't even available to players in the game. The cards that are available to players is very limited.Unlocking cards WITHOUT paying takes quite a long time as the only way to get booster packs is to beat opponents in the campaign mode, either through the story or through explore. It can take quite awhile, I'm at 40 hours played and I've unlocked 33% of the cards.  The game sure loves to give me multiples of cards I never use or that are just bum cards. Yes, you can create a fair amount of decks but they more or less feel very much the same. Style of gameplay feels limited because of this.I would say I got my 10 bucks though but if you're looking for longevitiy in a magic series, 2015 is NOT the route to go.I wish I got one of the earlier series as they seem to have far more gameplay options and deck building options :-\			"

												I've been playing magic (draft and standard) for about six months now. I downloaded the game in order to practice deck building strategies and improve my overall technique. I've played the game for about five hours now, and while it's far from perfect, I've enjoyed myself.Pros: Excellent way for beginners to get familiar with the flow of the game, deck-building, lore (though somewhat limited), and overall gameplay. Cons: Terrible menu screen, unintuitive navigating, boring layout (despite beautiful artwork), frustratingly limited started decks, and somewhat weak plot. I don't regret spending $7 on the game, but I see it more as a tool to improve my overall abilities as a magic player, and less of game to play for its own sake. 6/10.			"

												Flushing my money down the toilet would've been a better choice than buying this game.- The game crashes constantly, even on high end machines, often in the middle of a match. Sometimes, it crashes the entire pc, forcing you to restart and lose the progress.- When you start, you're prompted with a choice of ONE deck. The hints are very misleading: i chose the white/black deck that was described as removal based. Total removals in the deck: 3. You can't change your choice and you're stuck with your deck for the start of the campaign, unless you manually edit the save file.- That goes without saying, the deck is EXTREMELY UNDERPOWERED, regardless of your choice. You'll have a hard time beating the early battles, even if you turn down the difficulty to Arch-mage. Be prepared to grind your way through HOURS of frustrating losses, as the AI ""cheats"" constantly. The only way to go around this is turning down the difficulty to Mage, then suddenly every match is a piece of cake but no fun at all.- Even if you somehow manage to beat the AI, you're rewarded with a single booster pack. There's no guarantee the cards in the pack will boost your deck, they can be any color and, yes, you'll get doubles. The strongest cards, though, can't be obtained this way: they're reserved for people that BUY booster packs.- NO 2HG, no Sealed Play.- Clunky menus, that force you to go forth and back to check your progress.- The ""free deck building mode"" is a joke. Despite what the description on Steam says, you'll be very limited with your choices when building your deck, unless (of course) you don't open your wallet and start hunting for premium cards. Building a decent monocolor deck is nearly impossible.Magic 2015 is built around a single purpose: frustrating the player to the point of buying more booster packs through microtransactions. That is all. You won't enjoy this game unless you throw in it a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of money. Even buying the complete edition (30$) won't get you 100% of the cards available, but will leave you at around 90%. In the end, to get the full experience you'll have to pay the same as a AAA+ retail game and that is if you're lucky.This franchise has suddenly turned in a Pay to Win product, and that means that, at least for me, this is the end. I won't buy any more games from Wizards, ever.My piece of advice is to turn to Hearthstone: it's still based on booster packs, but at least it doesn't FORCE the player to spend money just to enjoy the game. DON'T BUY THIS GAME.			"

												I loved 2014, it was a fun game, well designed. 2015 is more than a step back, it's a full kilometer walk back from where it was last year. The user interface alone is enough to drive you mad. There is NO WAY to easilly navigate around the different menus. You'll find yourself clicking 3 to 6 times on tiles to do what you want to do. You'll wait for animations to play before being able to click. You'll multiclick on buttons thinking the first click did not work. You'll curse your mouse when all of a sudden, the wheel stops working for navigating around, only to come back later, at a random time. As for the content of the game, many people have pointed it, lots of being stuck with a single deck at the start of the game, and the disapearance of hot seat 2 headed giant are a bad way to upgrade a game... I'm honestly quite sad with that game, and a bit sorry I can't get a reimbursment...			"

												Okay, here's how I see it. Many people are peeved that this games is either ""too hard for them"" or they are simply not happy with the mechanics of the game or they claim that it doesn't have enough cards. I see it like this. TRY LOOKING AT WHAT HAS BEEN RELEASED FOR THE ACTUAL 2015 TCG AND THEN MAKE YOUR JUDGEMENT!!! The game has almost every card for the 2015 pack. It does take a little bit to get started, I admit. I actually liked the challenge presented to me for creating new and diverse decks. The game play could use a little tweaking, as I have found a few deviations from the rules that I find only mildly annoying. As far as an over-all review goes: I love the game. My suggestion is this: Make your own deck! Figure out what style works best for you and go with that. Expand on it. Optimize it. And when you get to the point that you get tired of your current deck, build another one and start cleaning house with that. This is a TCG-based game, it's not Borderlands, Mass Effect, or ES: Skyrim. It's not made to be a vast adventure that you embark on to rid the world of all evil in a 3-D setting with a diverse character set, customizable characters, and graphics that will blow your mind. It's A TCG-based game. Simple, with a basic story line in which the fate of the multiverse relies on your cards. Simple, fun, and concise.			"

I'm never able to make the right choise becouse I forget to stop the time , I select the wrong card from the deck , I select the wrong creature , I select the creatures in the wrong order... and the list keeps going. I can't understand how the were able to interpretate the game so badly, expecially the interface, they need to fire the UI designer, but I doubt they have one... half the time I played the game the result was an alt+f4 ragequit becouse I lose a 20 minutes long match just becouse I screw to clic on the right card. Moved by the hunger for money they give out new card just when you win... how can I win if I don't have the cards IN THE BEGINNING? It was fair if they give the players one pack if I lose and two if I win, but instead you just get one if you win, so you are forced to buy the dlc. I spend all my curses and blasphemies for this game ... I can't stand anymore. From such an excellent game, whit an outstanding amount of exceptional artworks, they where able to create just a student project level game...			"

												The game should be optimized for PC, cause some things are really weird:-need to change the configuration file in order to change screen resolution-the antialiasing seems not doing anything (the cards borders will not look smooth neither with 16x)Anyway the game is fun a good way to learn how to play. Moreover, people complains because there are some dlc which you can buy in order to have more cards.. but it's only few dlc and many of those cards can be unlocked in the singleplayer mode. Apart that, all the players are the same and the tactic is most important.This makes a big difference from heartestone in which people can buy how many card packs they want, week by week, and they will defeat you because of bought cards.The multiplayer is fun and the singleplayer too, till when you are able to unlock new cardsThe deck management is very good.I think this game is worth it's price.

												Ladies and Gentlemen,Much has been made about this game's apparent step backward, about the developer's cash hungry tactics in its attempt to further monitize their game, about the non-intuitive menus, and about the sluggish performance both online and off.I am not here to talk about any of that.  That's not why I just shut off the game I paid heroic American dollars for, nor is it why I almost exploded my nervous system in my frantic rush to the store page to leave this review.This review serves as a monument to the single worst tutorial I have ever experienced in my entire life.  If you bought this game with the purpose of playing the campaign mode, be prepared to be spoon-fed Magic the Gathering by what sounds like a member of the local rotary club.It's like being taught to play Dungeons and Dragons one paragraph at a time by Frances McDormand, and she won't start speaking until you say, ""Next!""I seriously cannot explain the hatred I have for this tutorial with weak human words.  This is the Jar-Jar Binks of tutorials.  It may have ruined this and the next two games for me.  By the light of the silvery moon, who in the world thought this was a good idea.  I have had viruses more pleasant than this.  Why no option to skip it?  Did you think that you would be robbing us of hearing the dulcet tones of the soccer-est of moms while she reguritates one pre digested morsel of Magic at a time into our waiting beaks?I am going to walk away, perhaps shower, and think about utilizing Steam's revamped refund policy.  I dread going back to this game because of that woman and her mocking, patronizing tutilage.  Do better next time, Stainless, and may God have mercy on your souls.I thank you for your time.			"

												Being a long-time Magic player since 1993, I love DOTP 2013 and 2014. I got 2015 during the summer sale when it was cheap, but even then I should have listened to the warnings, because this really is as bad as it gets. Unlike in 13 and 14, you cannot unlock other decks and only have access to some cards by actually BUYIng them, totally contradicting the reason why people played DOTP because they didn´t want to BUY new cards as in other implementations of the game, like Magic Online or even ye olde real version. The graphic interface looks like it´s been done by tablet programmers, it really is that awful. Swiper, no swiping. "

												Great content, dissapointing implementation. I Hope that one day instead of issuing the same thing with different name every year, the developer would make 1 good game with yearly sets of cards. Pros:+ great cards+ full deck customization, lots of possible deck builds and strategies (as opposed to 2014)+ found some really good players with interesting deck ideasInterface is annoying, but can be lived with. Cons:- there is no automatic matchmaking, just random lobby joining with ready buttons. There is no real ladder, tournaments, multiplayer mode and ranking does not encourage you to play. - land draw and card draw probability seems a bit unreal compared to same deck composition with real cards. - some players can grief by being afk in lobby or ingame, or crashing the game to force you to leave			"

												This game is TERRIBLY dissapointing. The 2014 version is better in almost every way. Here is a few of the things that annoy me the most:    1. You HAVE to pay quite a lot of money to get all premium cards. There is no way to get it by playing the game like in 2014.    2. They removed Two Headed Giant (playing 2v2). One of the strongest game modes from previous versions.    3. Menues are way too slow and annoying to navigate. They are clearly designed for tablets but will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, playing on PC.   4. Unlocking all cards (excluding premium cards), is way to fast and easy. Can probably be done in like 20 hours or less. In 2014 I have 246 hours played and I have yet to unlock all cards for all decks (probably about 70% there).I would NOT recommend this game. Game developers have gone way too greedy, demanding extra cash for you to really enjoy the game. I'm hoping for something a lot better in 2016. - Serph			"

												I have played this game enough by now to feel comfortable to do a review. I hope so anyway.In fact, I completed almost everything except collecting the last set of cards.Pros : great introduction to magic, cheap price if you buy the base game only, deck building tool, online play is fun.Cons : starting decks are weak, buying packs was too expensive and got corrected not long ago, multplayer is 1v1 only.This game is mostly done for new players because the game phases are very clear and (after some patching) the mana tap is handled pretty good by the computer itself.I like the Deck building tool but we are quite limited. We don't have access to any complete set which is alright I guess for a small game, but it would be awesome if it was available.The deck building tool is ok but it would be nicer if you could draw hands to see how reliable those starting hands are.Online play is fun but they removed the 2v2 mode and maybe some more. I have never been a huge multiplayer guy but 1v1 only is boring quite fast and now it is the only way to get the premium set as far as I know. Before you could buy the premium boosters at 2$ each which imo was too much for a game that is not related to MTGO at all.I wish this game was linked to MTGO in some way because it would incite players to try the ""real"" thing. The starting deck in  this game are very weak. You can complete the game by adding the cards you unlock over time but it will take a while at first. If you are good, obviously it will be easier and you will know what to change but imo this game is not realy the best thing for experienced players since it is too limited. Its fun, but its not enough for them. With that idea in mind, those starting decks are too weak and boring for a new player to realy get hooked.Well that's pretty much it ... I will just add a part for Wizzard of the Coast in general here ... They should realy start thinking smarter about their licences. Imo having to buy your cards in real life and then buy them again on MTGO is pure greed. Sure, they need to make money but this has stopped me at least twice from trying MTGO. I spend a lot of money on real magic cards ... I wish I could have a big discount (not free) by entering some code on MTGO and get the cards I just bought. Anyway ... maybe some day. They also need to make their MTGO client better. Its slow right now (beta one I tried a month ago) "

You are being forced through an endless Tutorial with 6 Stages. Afterwards, you find that the Game lets you only play 1 Pre Built Deck for 1/4 of the Campaign. Not only are The Standard Decks all Bi-Coloured, but the card selection iv vastly limited and you cannot win a single Multiplayer Game before Investing another 16 Bucks into so called ""Premium Boosters"".Oh right.

												Overall, this is a good game. True, the interface needs some work as it is slower and clunkier than its predecessors, but there are a lot of good things about it too, and it has the potential to become the best in this great series of games with some patches and additional DLC.I have played all of the MTG games to date, and loved them all. As you can see from other reviews, this one is not nearly as polished. The interface is slower to respond, sometimes causing you to miss crucial opportunities to cast instants and activate abilities, and it can be a little awkward and frustrating to operate. It feels like they rushed an unfinished game out before it was due in order to meet the annual release that we have come to expect. That said, I still recommend the game to both new MTG players and seasoned veterans because of the things that are done right. Most notably, there is now the ability to design your own deck from scratch. Finally! What's more, they've added a deck building AI so that it is not overwhelming to new players that works quite well. You can choose one or two cards that you like, and then click ""auto-complete"" and it will fill in the rest in a way that seeks to compliment what you chose, or you can flesh out most of the deck and see what suggestions the AI offers to improve your build.Some people are frustrated with the start of the game where you can choose only one deck with only a vague description, and then unlock more cards as you grind through the campaign. I actually enjoyed it, and I think it, like the deck building AI, is targeted towards getting new players into the game. You unlock cards at a reasonable pace, and by the end of the campaign, I had slowly but completely transformed my deck, such that I was even using a different color scheme, so I don't see why picking just one deck at the start has upset so many people. More cards and more content will be coming. The first expansion added a lot and I am sure there will be many more. I bought the complete edition from the start so I don't need to pay each expansion as it comes out, and I am satisfied with that. Some people said that by buying the complete edition you miss out on content because you don't have to play to unlock everything, but that is just not true. You still have to play all the way through, including exploring each plane completely, to unlock cards. The only way around that is to specifically buy the Battle Boosters DLC which just unlocks the cards you would get by battling. Anyone who says you have to pay to have equivalent cards to other players is just plain wrong. All in all, if you want a perfectly polished MTG game right now, you'll have to buy last years edition. If you want to build your own deck, buy this one. The interface problems are managable, albeit occasionally frustrating, and they are not bad enough to outweigh just how much fun the game is now that deck construction is possible.			"

												I know that I haven't really stacked up that many hours on this game, but for a decent card game, get this. I know that it is a dulled down version of the original trading cards and some bits may bore you, but honestly, some of the games you play can be reasonably intense. I think if you are looking to get into Magic and learn some of the more important bits, you should get this.One thing which could be improved though is the neverending menu screen and the repeated soundtrack :P 8/10 "

AI decks look fairly well put together, any of the decks you will get to make are just thrown together with whats available. Easily could be saved by a DLC or two that adds a significant amount of cards for you to use.. At the moment I believe there is only about 15 cards in the game.			"

												A solid entry in the Duels of the Planeswalkers series.Allowing you to create your own deck from scratch instead of using augmented pre-constructed decks is a really great feature and something the series desperately needed.Otherwise, it's Magic the Gathering. The gameplay is still smooth and probably the best virtual experience you can get with MTG.My only complaint would be that the card pool is still limited... I was hoping to at least play with the full sets that were included in the game, not a subset of each. Perhaps for future titles, although MTGO will probably prevent this from happening.			"

												This is a good game, far from perfect, but good in the end. the single player campaign is ok, but i feel the AI is cheap sometimes pulling the right cards at the right moment, then again that might just be my perception. the fact that you need to collect the cards from all the blocks by dueling makes it interesting, at least for me, except for the multiplayer part, where people disconnect when they realize they are losing, denying you a battle booster, but that issue doesn't come from the game. the cards available are very limited compared to the real thing, but if you don't have a group to play the paper version i don't think you would mind that much. the deck editor is one of my favorite features, the filters help you out a lot.overall i'll give it a 5/10 and i would recommend you to buy it only if you don't don't have time, friends or money to play the real one(i lack the three of them, thats way i purchased it :P).

												Not as bad as the reviews say.The interface is bad. Unlike in 2014, every menu action is much slower.You won't be able to build a modern strong deck because there isn't as much synergy. However compared to standard there's a lot more synergistic cards. But this is way better than having 80 or so cards to choose from in each deck. Deckbuilding was fun.The game was a bit too hard for me on the default planeswalker difficulty. I couldn't beat the hydra guy with my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cards. On mage difficulty the bots have worse cards and a fairly dumb AI.The story is dumb. Spoiler below.Tip: Try to explore ravnica to get more dual lands asap. Also beating someone unlocks 4ofs for dual lands of your chosen color so choose your colors wisely. The cards you get in your starter deck are all♥♥♥♥♥♥and will be mostly replaced after a few packs. But the colors can help speed up how fast you get your first good rare and your playset of a dual land.They kill off the planeswalker in 2014 >.< wtf story.			"

												Was great until I attempted to get extra cards. Apparently to get cards from a set you have already beaten you need to choose ""explore"". This has you fight certain ""boss"" type decks with every win giving you more random cards to use. All of this I'm currently fine with but apparently if you loose to one of these decks you cannot proceede to fight other random decks until that one is killed. For the First part of the campaign I am stuck on a boss Liliana which I litterally cannot beat as the cards in that boss deck are insanely superior to any that I have RANDOMLY aquired. The starter decks have almost no synergy and seem to have almost random cards just based on the color scheme that the developers chose. As well good luck trying out another color deck as you only get the completly random cards from the booster packs for beating the campaign and the explore option. So I""m now almost required to use the starter deck with a few extra cards I got or use a complete random bunch of other colored cards just to attempt something different.			"

												I understand why this game gets a lot of hate. First of all: if you have no experience with magic the gathering and are just looking for a casual card game I would not recommend this title. The fun comes from building new decks and trying stuff out which you know how to use. If however you have been playing Magic for a while, maybe even Magic 2013 and/or 2014, you might find some joy with this game. Although I must admit losing many fun features like two headed giant and a fast and a fast and simple menu is unfortunate, the new deck builder makes up for it. If you intend on spending many hours with online multiplayer it's easy to lose track of time trying out new decks. That said it is a heavoily flawed game that i would only recommend to people who have played magic before and plan on playing online a lot since the story is short and boring.

I have MTG15 over several platforms, and found Steam THE worst by far. It is better played offline for example, no more crashing. Best played windowed, no more PC meltdown. Once you get past the moronic tutorial the game is a joy to play. They removed a few features that will likely make a comeback, but I feel that players will look back on the whole MTG15 experience and view it as troublesome but worth it. This is a brilliant game that has been very very poorly delivered through Steam. (Don't pay to unlock card content. What kind of moron does that?)			"

												complete p2w experience - yearly installments with with add ons you can purchase but shouldn't, and PREMIUM cards that are cash only and not mentioned much until after you're in the gamecampaign mode: bots with cards you can't have without buying and some (alot) you can't have at all gives the feel of getting out p2w'd without dealing with people. bought the expansions? too bad the premium is the only viable purchase option!pvp mode: it seems money not only gives you access to clearly superior cards, but draw luck of the gods too. every pvp match i've gone into has consisted of the premium cards being layed out in the entire decks intended combo from the start, as well as one guy that wasn't p2w who d/c'd as soon as he got an upper hand in the game			"

												I've been playing magic (draft and standard) for about six months now. I downloaded the game in order to practice deck building strategies and improve my overall technique. I've played the game for about five hours now, and while it's far from perfect, I've enjoyed myself.Pros: Excellent way for beginners to get familiar with the flow of the game, deck-building, lore (though somewhat limited), and overall gameplay. Cons: Terrible menu screen, unintuitive navigating, boring layout (despite beautiful artwork), frustratingly limited started decks, and somewhat weak plot. I don't regret spending $7 on the game, but I see it more as a tool to improve my overall abilities as a magic player, and less of game to play for its own sake. 6/10.			"

												Now that some new content has been added to this, with the expansion this is a decent game to play with friends.  With a better UI and even more content this could be great to play with friends (especially if they don't live close enough to play real magic).NOTE: It does take a while to unlock enough cards to make much use of the deck building aspect & the game forces you to pick a ""theme"" at the beginning before you are eventually able to branch out your deck variety.

												This is my frist review of my first Duel of the Planeswalker version as my first Steam game.  I was very reluctant to try it out after reading all of the negative feedback, however, I have been pleasantly suprised.  Granted I have only played for about 20 hrs and only done Campaign mode but so far I find the gameplay easy, the interface relatively smooth, and the experience enjoyable.  While the game is not as intuitive as I'd like and it would be great to have the full collection of cards...for the money, I think its worth it.As I mentioned, I'm new to Steam and to Duels but not to MtG.  I wasted $10 on way worse than this (Can you say Homelands?).  While it doesn't compare with real life or even MTGO, it is a fun, and inexpensive, alternative.  I suppose if I think of it in true game review terms, I can agree with a lot of the information provided in some of the other reviews (though it crashing has not occurred for me). BUT... If you are not hardcore into video games and don't want to spend hundreds (or thousands) of dollars rebuilding a digital collection of cards, this is a simple and fun alternative.			"

												This is the best version of DotP so far. If you have played the previous releases then you know what you are getting into for the most part. You can build your own 60 card decks from among the cards you unlock and play them in all game modes now. There are some formating restrictions that take some of the fun out of this. You can only have 1 of each Mythic, up to 2 of each rare, up to 3 of each uncommon, and a set of commons. I would have prefered to have the typical constructed rules apply to deck building. They watered down the single player experience some. There is still a campaign and practice matches, but no more Planechase or compareable mode like was in the previous releases. As far as multiplayer goes, Two Headed Dragon was removed from this version for some reason. Other than that, there is the vanilla 1 v 1, three for all, and four-way matches.			"

												The game is fine as long as you don't set your expectations too high by making the assumption that this game will give the exact same experience as playing MtG in paper or online. The addition of deckbuilding is a welcome one. There are card number limits on rarity which don't exist in ""real Magic"", but it just adds another layer of complexity when planning decks, and limits their power - this game isn't meant for players to use decks that are too powerful. Nevertheless, a lot of different deck types are available (1,2 or 3 color decks are are viable) once you get the cards, and although you are stuck with one deck at the start, it doesn't take long to get the cards to change.Otherwise, the campaign is fun enough, and I like the clean interface. Given the price, I'd say it's worth it.			"

												Unlike previous entries, this version is the first one that actually allows you to build your own fully customized deck instead of merely allowing you to tweak one. In that sense, it is closer to what Magic is supposed to be - a deckbuilding game.The game also provides you with a singleplayer campaign in which you traverse different planes. On top of that, each plane has it's exploration ability which allows you to have random encounters. This is nice for those people who prefer to play the game in singleplayer but want to come up against a random opponent.Winning fights earns you cards with which you can adjust your deck or create new ones.Although I enjoyed the game, it is not without its failings. The game did receive a fair bit of criticism which you may find important:- As you play the game, you will encounter many opponents who can use cards that you cannot unlock. If you wanted to play a deck of, say, Slivers. Well, you can't, but you can be pitted against one of those. If you're not frustrated by having cards waved in front of you that you can't obtain, you can ignore this.- The mulitplayer aspect of the game got heavily trimmed down. Special modes such as two-headed giant are gone. This can be important if you enjoyed those modes in previes entries, but if you prefer to play the campaign and the exploration nodes, it won't affect your game.- As you start the game, you will be asked to choose a starter deck, based on two colours. You will then use that deck to fight a basic opponent (something akin to a tutorial). If you beat that opponent, you'll be stuck with your chosen deck. This can be a problem because you're can't actually see the decks when making a choice; you merely get a rough description that may, or may not be accurate.There is a consensus that a green-white deck is a good place to start, although it ultimately depends on your playstyle. Regardless, once you get some traction with your deck, you can use the extra card you win from your encounters to construct the deck you want.- A whole series of cards can only be unlocked by winning multiplayer games. If you're not into multiplayer, you'll either have to get over it or accept you won't be able to collect those cards. Obviously, multiplayer games expose you to people who may or may not be the shining paragon of humanity.- Lastly, you can unlock all the cards by buying the cardpacks in the store, but that would take away a good deal of the fun of earning those cards in game. Do think twice before buying those.In short:If you like to build your own deck without throwing lots of cash at paper cards and can accept a somewhat limited selection of cards to collect, you'll be fine.If you're someone who enjoys the multiplayer modes of previous entries or if you absolutely want to build that one specific deck or if you're okay using pre-constructed decks with some tweaking options, you may want to check out Magic 2014.

												So, bought the game on sale after they removed the paywall and I got the expansion in it. Having played DotP 2012, 2013, 2014 previously and a fair amount of magic cardgame I have caught both pros and cons of the game.All in all I'm gonna give this at thumbs up because totally i'd rate it about 60% score. There's plenty of things to work on, and I hope that they fix really essencial things like 2h giant and stuff like that, but atleast the game provided me with entertainment enough to enjoy it. I wouldn't pick it up for full price tho. Wait for a sale.PROS:Proper deckbuildingThere is a fair amount of cards to choose from (alltho as a sesoned player I could easily wish for more)the storyline and video cutscenes are pretty goodit is extremely friendly to new players and explains things wellAI can be goodCONS:AI can be terribad.no scenario-modes that would make you really have to understand how magic worked in order to beat the encounter instead of hoping for RNGjesus to help you out.no 2h giant mode (that has been present in all previous games)no ""funmode"" (aka archnemesis or planechase which we had in 2012 and 2013)the multiplayer lobby system is horrendous. You cannot pick\swap decks in the lobby, you have to exit to main screen, select decks, find the deck you want to use, equip it, go back, to main menu, and then back to host a new multiplayer game.after you have completed a multiplayer game, it does not return to lobby but to multiplayer screen, so you have to host a new game for each time.the user interface is absolute horrible if you (like me) are playing it from a PC. It is so blatantly made for consoles it seems like they didn't even try for PC gamers.the mana-tapping have more than one time f-ed me over. If you have 4 of mana X and 4 of mana Y, with no cards of mana Y on hand, it will tap -all- of mana Y in order to play card Z which costs X mana. So if you then have a draw mechanic that you were playing towards or returned a card from graveyard with cost Y, then you are screwed and have to wait a turn.The computer blatantly cheats, not even trying to hide it.Computer uses cards you don't have access to, (such as alpha-lands which gives 2 colors comes into play untapped).Plowed through campaign on Planeswalker difficulty in close to one sitting, normal game and expansion. Maybe ~10h or so.			"

												In terms of features, as everyone is saying this mode only has single player, 1v1, 3 and 4 players FFA.  You also cannot play multiplayer until you beat the first campaign boss.  It takes a little while to get to that point, you have about 6 missions in the tutorial that most players would already fully understand if you have played these games before.However the game itself is pretty flawless.  I had a crash playing a multiplayer once but after the win the booster was still awarded and could be unlocked after the match.  There are over 1,100 cards however I do reconmend buying the expansion.  for 5 more you get a whole new set of cards and a new group of guys to fight against which some interesting story to follow, as well as some op lands.It helped me build a powerful deck quicker than most people, but I can see why some people may find it difficult to advance even with it.  Overall the game is certainly worth if you're looking for a solo/single player experience in this genre.			"

												Being able to build my own deck is nice but without 2 player coop playing is a huge deception.I could see that this seems to be a merge of the Magic Online and MTG Duel of the Planewalkers but the reason I bought the Duels was to be able to play WITH my friends and not AGAINST them. Also this games cost money as for Hearthstone does not cost anything but with the almost the same game play. same concept different game play and it is freeafter reading reddit link: http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/2ac4v9/ama_with_nik_davidson_lead_designer_for_magic/at the section:""[–]nikdavidson 10 points 7 days agoIf there's one single decision you can point to me and say ""IT'S HIS FAULT"" about, it would be this one. Quite simply, I was very unhappy with the implementation of 2HG in Duels. The interface scales awkwardly, there's a TON of non-intuitive card interactions, (Serra Ascendant, Heartless Hidetsugu, etc.) and I didn't consider the level of instruction around those issues in-game to be sufficient. Given the focus on the deckbuilder and collection management this time around, we cut so we could focus on making other aspects of the game better.It's worth noting that the overall play numbers on 2HG were not large. It was a beloved niche feature, and one that I'm working to bring back when we can do it right.""I am very disappointed that they would launch a game without coop play and then mentions that they will implement it when they are able to. I feel that i just bought an beta or even alpha version of the game and not the full game. Assuming that there are not alot of ppl playing 2HG is a bad assumption.			"

												While I recommend it, it is solely on the new custom deck building.  Very well done, and makes for vastly more variety in decks.  But there is a lot missing in this version of DotP.  Either this new deck feature completely overwhelmed the code or Wizards just decided to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and cut two headed giant and still leave out planes chase.  Two modes that were very fun in earlier versions.The interface also leaves something to be desired, I liked the straightforward design of 2014 over 2013's scrolling menus, and sadly they decided to try an even worst for of that.This year is vastly easier when it comes to unlocking cards (provided you don't just pay, and I highly reccomend that you don't).  You now get booster packs with 15 cards, no longer just one card with the corresponding deck you just won with.  I still don't have all the cards in 2013 and 2014, but I already have all the cards in this version unlocked.			"

												This game caters not to the new players nor the veterans. The difficulty in the beginning of the game is insane, and the older players like it less becuase they can't use the cards they know how to use best. Furthermore, nobody likes it when there is DLC that makes you more superior to everyone else online.			"

												How did they mess up this franchise? Yay we finally got to make our own decks, but wait you only have a small pool of cards, and those cards aren't very good, and it's frustrating to unlock new cards, and there is no more two headed giant, and the multiplayer is horrid, and it's tedious to play with a friend online, and the UI is terrible, and the AI is terrible, and the premium cards aren't worth buying, and the list goes on and on. Yay we can finally make our own deck though. At the cost of everything good about this series.Do not buy this piece of crap. What have you done Wizards? I will not be supporting this game by buying it's expansions and I will not support this series if this is the garbage they are going to be producing in the future. Shame on you Wizards. Shame.			"

												I will never, ever, purchase one of the Magic DotP games again. To date I have purchased them each year along with a number of deck unlocks. This years version is nothing but a disgusting money grab. They require you to pick a starting deck with little to no information, and place your pre-order perks behind the first campaign boss. The pre-order perks you have ALREADY paid for, mind you. No problem, you are likely thinking... Did I forget to mention the starter deck is full of crap commons while the bosses deck is full of removal, mana efficient fliers, and rares like Entreat the Angels?!?!? On top of that, you have to pay them for the ability to unlock collections. Not for cards, mind you, but for the mear ABILITY to buy packs from them containing cards from those sets. **Pay them... for the ability... to give them more money.** The people behind this game should be ashamed of themselves. Not only will I never recommend this game again, but I won't recommend anything using this IP.			"

												We finally got a full deckbuilder, which is pretty good considering the very limited amount of cards you can use. You can most likely make more than 10 unique decks which is more than what you get in previous games, but the power level is lower and the decks play out more like draft decks, which some may or may not like. I liked the campaign, because all enemies use real decks which are different from each other and the story was okay. Few of the duels did have some special conditions, but the duels for the most part played like the standard duels and less like challenges which I liked, but it's just a matter of preference. The UI looks nice...... but it's very hard to use. Navigation through the menus is slow, and it feels like it was made with only the touch interface in mind. There is no 2HG, but what's worse is that there's no other special mode neither, like Planechase or Archenemy. A lot of the cards that enemies use are not available to the players which is a shame since in some cases giving just one of those cards to the players would open an entirely new deck possibility. The premium cards are day one DLC and make game 4 times as expensive than before if you want to use all the deck types and stay competitive in multiplayer, basically making the game pay-to-win.If you like Magic, 10 euros will at least get you about 8 hours of campaign play. But if you already own some of the previous games, there are not enough differences to justify the purchase. Addition of the premium cards and the removal of fun multiplayer modes actually makes this game worse than before. But even if you do get the game I would advise you not to buy the premium cards, to show the developers that we are against that kind of a paywall, and hopefully they will fix their mistakes in the next installment.

												Half the price of the previous game for half the features and twice the stupidity. I really liked the previous installments but this one is really not worth $10. I would not even pay $5 for this, I would maybe buy it for $2.50 (it's MTG, after all) but the fact that they give us this thing and then paywall some of the content is a ♥♥♥♥ing insult. If hiring someone to do crappy CGI was so expensive they should have just done it all in MS paint. That would have been fine.Here's to more ""good"" game development:+You can get some sweet engine cards and combos for free, so the deckbuilding isn't completely stupid.+The campaign mode is slightly longer than previous installments.+The foils look nicer.+Completely free-mode deckbuilding. You can play any color you want, any number of lands you want, provided you stick to exactly 60 cards.-The AI is dumber than a rock. I might as well goldfish my decks.-You can get most of the cards for free, but the rest has to be purchased 1 booster at a time for $2 each, you can get all the ""Premium"" cards for around $20. $10 for this was already a waste so I'll let you do the math.-Basic deck-defining cards that would greatly enhance decks are behind the aforementioned paywall. The fact I should spend 2-20 bucks just to get one or two Think Twice is absurd. If they wanted to paywall stuff they could have done it for really miscellaneous cards, like Lab Maniac or Soul of Ravnica. That would have been fine.-The menus lag so hard it makes MTGO look good.-Unintuitive interface navigation.-Only FFA mode. Both DOTP 2013 and 2014 had 2HG and then another gamemode, but this one is just ""run your draft deck into mine and see what happens.""-Game locks up frequently, even on above-average computers like mine.If you bothered reading all this and still want to purchase this game I guess you really like MTG, at which point it's actually still a total waste of your money. Either way be my guest.			"

I can finally play the game EXACTLY how I want to and I never know what I will be up against. It's finally the way magic is meant to be played. No more memorizing the decks and knowing what to expect as soon as you figure out what deck your oponent is playing with. Maybe we can see some of these missing features in next years game. It's hard to except these micro transactions and missing features, but in the end, the game is still fun a fairly priced.I recommend this game			"

												This is the first MTG game that I will not 100%. For me it is the worst installment in the series so far. To add a little background I started playing MTG late Ice Age, stopped somewhere around at 7th or 8th edition. Played all of the DotP. Yes, they were sometimes simplistic but for me they were also fun. Magic 2015 is not fun.If you play it mostly for multiplayer, then you can disregard most of my criticism as generally it's a little better overall. You can now build your own decks using the small collection of cards that is available, 300 or so. It's not full magic experience, but it's a good starter. The grinding for the cards takes forever tho (on easiest difficulty should take a day or two of heavy grinding) and you can't grind them all without paying as some are premium, only found in paid boosters. Basically it's better to just throw the additional 20 euro for boosters, yes in addition to the tenner you paid for the game.Anyhow, I play DotP mostly for single player, with some multi as an added bonus. And for single player this is horribad. The menus are atrocious. They look nice and all but I think I spent 20% of my playtime navigating through them. Scroll forward and click an option, and look what a nice animation we have scrolling the menu to show you what you need. Select another option and HEY look at the nice animation we have scrolling the menu to show you what you need. You want to quit? But why, at the meantime HEY LOOK AT THE... you get the idea. It's slow and clunky as hell.You think the starting decks in previous games were bad? Wait 'til you have to face full fledged reanimator deck with your pitiful starter deck. Let's see how your 3rd turn 1/1 can face the 4th turn flying trampling 9/9. Good luck! Needless to say playing the single player campaign is a chore. Grinding for more bad or mediocre cards to improve your pitiful deck is even more of a chore. It's just not fun...What's also not fun. Playing on the highest difficulty. As a seasoned MTG player I played all of the games on Planeswalker difficulty. Won most, lost some. This time around the only thing affected by the difficulty setting is how much lands you will draw. On Planeswalker you're mana screwed 80% of the time. Literally, in 8 of the 10 matches I played I had 2 lands in the first 15 cards, with 24 lands in deck. On the easiest difficulty the game basically plays itself as the AI opponent does pretty much nothing and you can goldfish.It's a damn pity that 2015 is as it is, I had solid 40-50hrs of fun with the previous installments, here after 10hrs I'm spent. Hopefully the 2016 version will be better.			"

												The game itself isn't that badly. It runs very smoothly on my rig. The downside however, is that there is almost no balance in the multiplayer mode. Being someone who pre-ordered the premium package and waited with a ton of anticipation for the multiplayer modes, it has been very dissapointing. If you're not playing white weenies, RDW, RDW goblins edition, or G/R Aggro, prepare to lose a ton. I've got a bunch of different decks, but there is almost no viable way to make a control deck at the moment. This seriously needs some addressing, as magic deckbuilding is fun and rewarding, but not when the only decks that are viable within the card pool are 20 lands and 1-3 drops creatures and pump spells. All said and done, I didn't get the product I had hoped for. I play Friday night magic, and I play MTGO, and I was hoping for an outlet that would allow for a bunch of silly semi casual decks. Instead what I've gotten is an okay game, a meh story, and a multiplayer experience that involves a ton of wins within 5 minutes. Also, if your opponent leaves the game it doesn't immediately count as a win for you, they make you finish out against the AI. Minor annoyance, but if I wanted to be playing against AI I would be playing the campaign mode. Honestly, only buy this if you want the single player experience. If you want something competetive that you have to pay for anyway, just jump over to MTGO. Otherwise, just stick to Hearthstone.			"

												[A Review from an experienced MTG Player]So first off I'll sum it up for people that don't want to read the whole review, They stripped everything away from the game that you love in favour of deck building, campaign is unbalanced, the cards are cool but it's pretty much pay to win. don't waste your time, now on to the review.MTG 2015 has some very interesting and fun cards from the new core set, while you'll still get some of your old favorites you will see a lot of new cards that make you come up with combo's you would of never even dreamed about before and that is incredibly awesome..if you want to pay for them...but...the awesome new cards and the deck building are the ONLY good tings about this game.When i started playing the MTG games on steam i fell in love with them, 2013 was and still remains the king of these games on steam. which is kind of funny since it doesn't involve deck building. Why is this so? well i'll tell you. in MTG2015 they have taken pretty much everything you loved and tossed it aside.Those awesome Challenges? Gone. Really fun multiplayer modes? GONE! yeah that's right, no Planechase, Arch enemy and the big shocker, NO TWO HEADED GIANT, Multiplayer is just straight up Free For All, 1v1-1v1v1v1, No co-operative play to come up with awesome team strats and rule the board.Pay to Win, Since campaign is incredibly unbalanced (Most likely intentionally) you are pretty much forced to pay to unlock the cards, i know we have always been able to purchase cards for these games but back then you would pay for th ecards but still have to beat the boss that owned the deck in order to use it, the pre-made decks you had were awesome and really fun and you felt like you didn't even need to buy the decks but you did anyway just to show your support for a fun and anazing game.There are pre-mades here but you only have access to these pre-mades if you have unlocked every single card within that pre-made..so in other words, grind for hours on end to unlock boosters..or just simply buy the plane sets from the store, since the campaign is unbalanced (I'm talking the AI having the exact card it needs every time and pulling cards for it's a-hole that you can't even get in the game) Grinding for boosters is damn near impossible..so you do eventually just cave and buy plane sets just to beat the game, hence..pay to win.The single player is what you expect in terms of layout, have 4-5 fights against random decks leading up to the fight with a planeswalker and unlock yourself and achievement, that's the way it has always been (Though boss achievements seem to be broken right now and not unlocking for a lot of people, me included) What do you do when you beat single player? you head on over to multiplayer since challenge mode and the extended revenge campaigns are gone. so you hop in to multiplayer and get insanely bored within an hour or so because they removed all of the interesting and unique gametypes for standard FFA play.MTG2015 is a glorified Deck Building and Testing program for the new core set, the gameplay just isn't there anymore, it's pay to win and multiplayer get's boring as hell after an hour or so, Deck building is nice and they new cards are really interesting but these two things are pointless when you can't bring yoursel fto actually play the game, If you love maigc, you'll hate this game..if you've never played magic before then skip this one, pick up 2013, no custom decks but the gameplay is the best in the series.

												It pains me to not reccomend this. It has so many pros, but even more cons. Which is sad, because I've been playing magic for well over 2 years now. I have 2013 on xbox and steam, 2014 on xbox and steam. If I remember right I've logged in 30 hours on each, I know their flaws YET they are still solid games.With this new edition you have the ability to create your own deck, that's fine and dandy. The problem is that one cannot create said deck until they beat innistrad and doing that is extremely hard. Even if you're a pretty good magic player you will struggle in innistrad. The reason why is because you have to use the dreader starter deck. Each starter deck comes with 2 rares, pretty sure no uncommons, and a whole bunch of jumbled up cards. Orginally I started out with the green white deck, DO NOT DO THIS! I've played populate decks, I've played mana manipulation decks, but not a slapped together green white deck.Now you're probably thinking, hehe I bought the bundle i should have everything. Wrong, you have to beat innistrad to fully unlock your dlc. So you too are stuck with the dreaded starter decks. Now nce you beat innistrad you'll probably notice something, there are a lot of good cards but not enough to run solid deck. Well I really shouldn't say that... you can make a solid deck, but you're limited to 300, different, cards in the game. So if let's say you wanna build a bloodrush deck, you really can't. Goblin? Kinda, lotta guttersnipes and decent cards for goblins. Now this lil paragraph is towards those who bought the bundle.Those who do not have the bundle will have to grind! And I mean grind, because you're stuck with the starter deck. The random boosters will, or may, help you improve it but it's going to be hard. The ""Boss"" of each area will give you 2 boosters and a premium booster. So those are always handy, but the starter decks need a lot of love. You can also play against friends to gain boosters! That is something my pals and I figured out last night.The game is, sorta, pay-to-win, though you still need decent knowledge on how to build a deck. The navigation of the menu is like watching a snail race, only for one snail to be taken by a hawk outta utter boredom.Instants, this is the one thing that REALLY ticks me off. Magic 2015 has a slower pace of gameplay when compared to the other installments. But if you're playing multiplayer, you may run into this problem. Constant clicking! the cards are kinda bugged to where you have to smash your hand into the monitor just to select it. Not only that, but it babies the hell outta things. Scenario:You have 2 instances in your hand, a shock and a card that gives you +1 and first strike. On your side of the field you have a 2/1. On your oppenent's field he has a 4/3 and declares an attack. Now you have the ability to destroy this, so you click shock... pop up comes up stating ""You cannot do this, your oppenent is making a choice."". Now you're mentally cursing the screen. So you declare a blocker and attempt to do this. You click continue then select your card there you are greeted with another pop up. ""Your opponent is declaring an attack"". Now you've probably just chucked your computer out the window So thanks to the second pop up, you woud've run out of time to select the two cards that would've destroyed the threat. This happens quite regularrly and the only way to prevent it is to spam the ""Stop time"" button. While in the other games you woulld have NEVER seen this.Gameplay wise... it's pretty solid, I won't lie I've had a lot of fun with it; so have my pals. But there is a lot of problems with this game. If you want to buy it, then go ahead. It's a good game, though you will get frustrated to the point to where you'll want to buy something to give you a small boost. Which is really sad... the other magic games gave you decent decks to play with. This one starts you out with a slapped together deck.The game is fairly new, and maybe they'll add more stuff to the game. Maybe new cards, patch the interface, or something. Till then, I'd wait at least a month before purchasing this game. "

												The 2014 version is less greedy, I mean that its fun to play with your friends and so because you can win cards and also have better variety of multiplayer gameplay. This one you dont want to play it a lot without spending money or just repeat the campaing over and over again which is not THAT fun (sad face). More multiplaye roptions and the chance to earn boosters outside the campaign and store, would be way nicer.			"

												Being able to build my own deck is nice but without 2 player coop playing is a huge deception.I could see that this seems to be a merge of the Magic Online and MTG Duel of the Planewalkers but the reason I bought the Duels was to be able to play WITH my friends and not AGAINST them. Also this games cost money as for Hearthstone does not cost anything but with the almost the same game play. same concept different game play and it is freeafter reading reddit link: http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/2ac4v9/ama_with_nik_davidson_lead_designer_for_magic/at the section:""[–]nikdavidson 10 points 7 days agoIf there's one single decision you can point to me and say ""IT'S HIS FAULT"" about, it would be this one. Quite simply, I was very unhappy with the implementation of 2HG in Duels. The interface scales awkwardly, there's a TON of non-intuitive card interactions, (Serra Ascendant, Heartless Hidetsugu, etc.) and I didn't consider the level of instruction around those issues in-game to be sufficient. Given the focus on the deckbuilder and collection management this time around, we cut so we could focus on making other aspects of the game better.It's worth noting that the overall play numbers on 2HG were not large. It was a beloved niche feature, and one that I'm working to bring back when we can do it right.""I am very disappointed that they would launch a game without coop play and then mentions that they will implement it when they are able to. I feel that i just bought an beta or even alpha version of the game and not the full game. Assuming that there are not alot of ppl playing 2HG is a bad assumption.			"

												I really want to recommend Magic 2015, but I can't. This game is really a sad case of ""one step forward, two steps back."" For example: the new ""open"" deck building system is a great new feature which is marred by placing too-strict limits on how many copies of cards you can use and also makes the single player campaign a chore as you have to grind to get new cards so you can compete with the overpowered AI decks. Another example: the new black/white design aesthetic is clean and appealing, but actually navigating the menus is clunky, gimmicky, and obnoxious--it feels like a console port. This point is particularly annoying to me since I thougt Stainless Games had learned their lesson when Magic 2014 finally had a clean, simple, easy-to-navigate interface.After weeks of playing, my opinion has only gotten worse--constant crashes, disconnects, and glitches with cards. Stick with 2014.			"

												DISSAPPOINTEDThe 4-5 hours I have spent with the game have just been dissappointment after dissapointment.#1. Not being to access my premium prepurchase content (or anything at all for that matter) without beating the first chapter first.#2. Selecting Planeswalker difficulty, yet still being forced to complete the tutorial. (I now know why this is)#3. Finishing the tutorial with the first deck I tried. There was no warning like ""Hey are you sure these are the 60 cards you want to start your collection with?""#4. Multiplayer co-op... I'm just gonna hang my head in silence for a moment for our lost brother...ok so 2HG is such an ingrained part of Magic for me I never even stopped to think that it wouldn't be included. I preordered 2 copies for my freind and I. Now I wish I hadn't. I have over 8000 physical cards and only play these games in coop mode, as a relief from the competitiveness of vs matches. So now there is absolutely no point in me playing 2015 at all. To take it one step further, this whole experience has left a very bad taste in my mouth about a game that I have played for 15 years. As a consumer, the only thing i can do that companies will listen to is take my money elsewhere. Big mistake WIzards, you just lost a long time customer. Patch, Refund, or Riot. Uninstalled.TL;DR DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID!!!!!!! "

												WOTC once again drops the ball in DOTP 2015. One of the few high points in 2015 is the $10 price tag but other than that this game has nothing going for it. An option to freely build a deck from your collection of cards is absent yet again and the decks provided amount to nothing more than intro decks. Also dissapointing are the card collection DLC packs, which are branded as card sets for the Ravnica, Theros, Innistrad, Shandalar, and Zendikar blocks yet only contain 45-50 cards from said block not the entire set.

Slow menus, limited cardpool, LONG grinding to get cards that you want, no 2HG format, etc, etc, etc.You can get away with not buying this game by just reading online what the storyline is, and then playing IRL MtG with your friends, to basically the same effect.

												So suffers the same problems with difficulty as previous DotP games where up difficulty just give the AI perfect hands and the User constant landsd or no lands. THe navagation menu are not nice at all sometime taking 3/4 to register.Only one deck available to start with and you have to choose it blind based only the colours and a brief descripsion of the deck.The auto land tapping function is horrible, tapping land combos that dont make sense(yes i know you can cycle but always the first thing i think when trying to play at a decent pace) Games are Slow, AI takes his time, even with all animation turn off each phase still take too long in my opinion, espcially when your just trying grind booster as this the only way to improve decks without purchasing them.I Think the only good point i can see is the deck building is far better then previous versions all though with the paid for booster i can see MP coming down to whoever spent most wins.The final fight in campaign is a bull, having to fight the same dude twice as the same encounter, making restarts useless and wasting 20+ mins on something your always going to lose due to AI getting perfect hands			"

												It pains me to not reccomend this. It has so many pros, but even more cons. Which is sad, because I've been playing magic for well over 2 years now. I have 2013 on xbox and steam, 2014 on xbox and steam. If I remember right I've logged in 30 hours on each, I know their flaws YET they are still solid games.With this new edition you have the ability to create your own deck, that's fine and dandy. The problem is that one cannot create said deck until they beat innistrad and doing that is extremely hard. Even if you're a pretty good magic player you will struggle in innistrad. The reason why is because you have to use the dreader starter deck. Each starter deck comes with 2 rares, pretty sure no uncommons, and a whole bunch of jumbled up cards. Orginally I started out with the green white deck, DO NOT DO THIS! I've played populate decks, I've played mana manipulation decks, but not a slapped together green white deck.Now you're probably thinking, hehe I bought the bundle i should have everything. Wrong, you have to beat innistrad to fully unlock your dlc. So you too are stuck with the dreaded starter decks. Now nce you beat innistrad you'll probably notice something, there are a lot of good cards but not enough to run solid deck. Well I really shouldn't say that... you can make a solid deck, but you're limited to 300, different, cards in the game. So if let's say you wanna build a bloodrush deck, you really can't. Goblin? Kinda, lotta guttersnipes and decent cards for goblins. Now this lil paragraph is towards those who bought the bundle.Those who do not have the bundle will have to grind! And I mean grind, because you're stuck with the starter deck. The random boosters will, or may, help you improve it but it's going to be hard. The ""Boss"" of each area will give you 2 boosters and a premium booster. So those are always handy, but the starter decks need a lot of love. You can also play against friends to gain boosters! That is something my pals and I figured out last night.The game is, sorta, pay-to-win, though you still need decent knowledge on how to build a deck. The navigation of the menu is like watching a snail race, only for one snail to be taken by a hawk outta utter boredom.Instants, this is the one thing that REALLY ticks me off. Magic 2015 has a slower pace of gameplay when compared to the other installments. But if you're playing multiplayer, you may run into this problem. Constant clicking! the cards are kinda bugged to where you have to smash your hand into the monitor just to select it. Not only that, but it babies the hell outta things. Scenario:You have 2 instances in your hand, a shock and a card that gives you +1 and first strike. On your side of the field you have a 2/1. On your oppenent's field he has a 4/3 and declares an attack. Now you have the ability to destroy this, so you click shock... pop up comes up stating ""You cannot do this, your oppenent is making a choice."". Now you're mentally cursing the screen. So you declare a blocker and attempt to do this. You click continue then select your card there you are greeted with another pop up. ""Your opponent is declaring an attack"". Now you've probably just chucked your computer out the window So thanks to the second pop up, you woud've run out of time to select the two cards that would've destroyed the threat. This happens quite regularrly and the only way to prevent it is to spam the ""Stop time"" button. While in the other games you woulld have NEVER seen this.Gameplay wise... it's pretty solid, I won't lie I've had a lot of fun with it; so have my pals. But there is a lot of problems with this game. If you want to buy it, then go ahead. It's a good game, though you will get frustrated to the point to where you'll want to buy something to give you a small boost. Which is really sad... the other magic games gave you decent decks to play with. This one starts you out with a slapped together deck.The game is fairly new, and maybe they'll add more stuff to the game. Maybe new cards, patch the interface, or something. Till then, I'd wait at least a month before purchasing this game. "

												While I recommend it, it is solely on the new custom deck building.  Very well done, and makes for vastly more variety in decks.  But there is a lot missing in this version of DotP.  Either this new deck feature completely overwhelmed the code or Wizards just decided to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and cut two headed giant and still leave out planes chase.  Two modes that were very fun in earlier versions.The interface also leaves something to be desired, I liked the straightforward design of 2014 over 2013's scrolling menus, and sadly they decided to try an even worst for of that.This year is vastly easier when it comes to unlocking cards (provided you don't just pay, and I highly reccomend that you don't).  You now get booster packs with 15 cards, no longer just one card with the corresponding deck you just won with.  I still don't have all the cards in 2013 and 2014, but I already have all the cards in this version unlocked.			"

												Magic 2015 is a whole new ball of wax.  The developers have decided to take a completely different approach to the interface, campaign, and deck acquisition... so much so that for many of us die hard fans the changes were rather jarring.  Just take a look at the majority of the reviews, all being negative.  I would assert that if you played through the campaign on easy, which is a wise choice for most, you would get a lot more enjoyment out of this installation.I say this because you start the game with an extremely weak deck and very few options to change it.  You are at the mercy of the game and it is definitely hard to be successful.  What makes it even more challenging is that to progress effectively you have to know how to build & tweak a deck.  Having that skill is typical for tabletop players but not so for computer players, who have been content working with the strong pre-made content up until this year.  Now you get a crappy deck and are forced to turn it into gold with very little instruction on how to do so, and no alternative course.Combine this with a horrible user interface, obviously created for tablets and you have a recipe for angry gamers.  Some design choices are baffling, like not begin able to scroll through cards while zoomed.  The menus are very slow and frustrating to navigate.Well, after playing through most of the campaign I can say it does get much better eventually.  By the third stage you have unlocked a ton of good cards, including many multi-color and land gates.  You can easily create some very good decks to meet the challenge of the remainder of the campaign.  The deck building tools unlock after the first stage and are very good.  The basic gameplay during a match is for the most part the same as previous versions.I am a bit miffed that multiplayer includes free for all only.  THERE IS NO TWO HEADED GIANT!  This seems like a major oversight as everyone I talk to plays that mode.Overall I can't recommend this game to a newcomer to Magic, but for an existing fan I would say hang in there and get to stage 3 before you give up on it.  I find that I am learning a lot about deck building and will be a better player for it.6/10. "

												New to the Duels series, so I have only read about comparisons to previous versions (which sound like the 2015 game removed a lot from). Starting from the top, the UI is pretty poor as it forces you to scroll through and suffer long fades. Moving on to the deck builder, while I'm very glad to have the option for complete deck customization, the interface wastes a lot of valuable space and organization options. Additionally, it is rather infuriating (and DEFINITELY WORTH NOTING) that almost every card in the Campaign and AI's decks are not available to add to your own decks - this drives me crazy since the game clearly has the mechanics of the cards built in. However, hearing that the deck builder was not available in previous Duels games is both confusing (since it's so integral to Magic for me) and reassuring - and hopefully being the first game to feature the deck builder can only mean that it will improve with later iterations.Multiplayer is fun, however hearing that they removed options like Puzzles, Two-Headed Giant, and Challenges doesn't make sense to me and seems like a strange choice to simply trade features rather than improve them.All-in-All, if you enjoy building decks almost as much as playing the game, then this game is worth picking up. However if you're looking for long term playability and multiplayer (I've enjoyed multiplayer but mainly because I have a group I play with regularly), then I would suggest researching previous versions of the game to determine whether it's worth it for you.

												Everyone seems to hate this game. But as a total rookie to magic, I quite enjoyed it. This game is ment for players who want to appreciate the mechanics of Magic, without pumping in hundreds or even thousands of dollars to deck build. While it is limited to only a percentage of the official 2015 Magic card line up, it is still a really cool way to appreciate one of the best modern game franchises ever created. PROS-This game makes you appreciate Magic. Stunning Graphics, with great visuals and easy to view card art. The controls are simple and easy to use. Plus the tutorial lets you jump right into the action. - Super smooth gameplay that actually works. You will have to make some setting adjustments from time to time, but once you uncheck the noob only settings, the game works great. - No issues playing people or AI. There's a stop timer when someone plays a crazy card that you'll want to read and the game gives you ample time to make decisions, without making you go nuts if someone is taking too long. - Great card collection, with 100% customizable decks. I read that in Magic 2014 you had to pay money to make more decks!?!?! That's just crazy. Making decks is the fun part, and you can have fun for just $10 up front costs, for sure.- All DLC is actually obtainable without any purchases. Just pay the $10 and you can grind your way to a 90% completed card collection. DON’T BUY THE DLC!- AI seems pretty smart, for the most part. If you don't play right, they will beat you.CONS- If you want to get a 100% card collection you will have to fork over an extra $28. A lot of people hate this, but I had plenty of fun for just the $10 up front. I decided to buy in after completing the game and wanting to compete online against other players for the long term. It's lame, but completely optional and only necessary if you want to compete more hardcore online.- Some AI opponents get pretty challenging and seem impossible to beat. They definitely cheat and get cards they need in their first few hands. You can combat this with “Exile from ratgets Library” cards a little, but it gets pretty frustrating at times. - The menu system is really dumb. It takes forever to switch to a different deck (too many clicks) and while it’s beautiful, I’d rather is just be efficient. - There are no instructions on how you get more cards. I completed the entire game not knowing that I could “Explore” planes to get additional boosters. They need to make this more clear IMO. - The Profile menu system is awkward too. You can click your icon to see messages, but it’s mostly full of stuff the game already told you, like and achievement you unlocked. One important note, is that if you DO win a multiplayer match, you get a booster full of random cards from all the planes, but you have to check on your profile, sift through all the unimportant messages to find the important booster pack one. Awkward to the max yo!			"

												Most of the people who are giving this game bad reviews just dont actually play Magic: the Gathering. This is by far the best DOTP they have released. In the old games, you were given pre constructed decks. In this game you win booster packs and can make ANYTHING you want. It is much more fun to build your own decks and then win with them. The only thing this game is missing is 2 headed giant. If they bring that back it is a 10/10 for the money.			"

												A fun game when it works, but the game's AI is almost unforgivably bad.  I understand this is meant to encourage multiplayer games between humans, but finding a fair and balanced game is just as difficult for a new player, and if a game is going to try to have a single-player version it needs to be more than the token effort this game has supplied.  The number of times the AI opponent clearly anticipates the cards in your hand that it's not supposed to know you have, or will obviously work together against you in Multi-AI Opponent games, will leave you tearing out your hair in frustration.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the game, and have fun playing it, but that's more from the simple enjoyment of M:tG itself.  Purely objectively looking at this game, it is riddled with flaws that in most other franchises would instantly see it uninstalled and never played again.  Buy it if you're a fan, enjoy it while you can, but don't buy this expecting a classic that will change your life.			"

												This is an amazing TCG. If you ever played pokemon, yu-gi-oh, or anything simliar growing up then this is the game for you. More features than those and more skill involved in the effects of the cards. Think of it as the adult version of our childhood card games. Balanced and you do not need the expansion to do well at all, this game is loaded with hours of fun for only ten dollars. The ONLY downside to thsi game is that WotC decided to take out two headed giant (2v2) games which were available in the 2014 version. I do believe that WoTC will update the game sometime soon to include 2HG games. Great customer support as well! 9/10			"

												This is an outstanding game; easily the best one of the series.  It has a strong card pool, it's a lot more balanced than previous versions, and it allows full deck building.  Playing your own deck vs. someone else's unique deck online really can't be beat.  There are other games that try - namely Hearthstone and Might and Magic: Duels of Champions.  Both of those are decent games, but they lack the overall depth, strategy and quality of Magic by a large margin.There are a lot of negative reviews (generally from people with very little actual play time) - and they mostly fall into two categories:1. people who are upset Wizards removed two-headed giant from the game modes.  If you primarily play DOTP for two-headed giant, this is not the game for you.  It is, however, the best 1v1 game there is.2. people who are upset at the premium content, and who label it 'pay to win'.  Basically, there was day one DLC, and it was very expensive (28 dollars for all of it).  However - this content is not necessary - it enables a greater number of deck archetypes, but doesn't actually imbalance the format - at least not by much.  The base game card pool is quite strong.There are other negatives to the game - the user interface is not as good as prior versions, and there's a difficult battle at the end of the tutorial that's difficult to beat for some players so they are frustrated (hint: pick a deck with white or red in it and you'll be fine).But on the whole, the game is outstanding.  I've already built 10 distinct decks from the card pool, and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.  It is the most fun I've had with any Magic game ever. "

												review updated 21/07/2014 based on furthur experience of game.*>>>>review changed to positive thumbs up, would recommend<<<<*(although still affected by negative points)firstly, this was origonally negative review, and i still absolutely HATE the start of the game were they FORCE you to play singleplayer mode for ages before you can unlcok any part of the game.reason for origonal anger of the game,* no customisation at start, force to play singleplayer to unlock deck building* no multiplayer at start, forced to play single player to unlock that* controls feel clunky, seriously have to hammer the mouse button for it to register my select clicks^ given those facts, think of how i felt when i brought this game for multiplayer and didnt even want to touch the singleplayer aspect whatsoever!i wanted hto create my custom deck and play against real opponents. not play a rubbish deck that was entirely useless with cards i didnt choose and be forced to slog out in matches against dumb boring AI.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ok, thats all the negative points, and its also basically a look back on my last review which was negative.now, as you may tell the review has changed to positive, thumbs up.reasons being below* it has more customisation than any DoTP game (when you reach it) (also i said DoTP, not MTGO which beats this for customisation hands down)so freedom of choice in building your own decks and meeting unique decks that other players build.although i think theres maybe lots of cards missing, i certainly couldnt find some select cards i knew from MTGO that i wanted, maybe have to unlock them though.* multiplayer is good, currently missing 2 head giant but they could add it in future maybe in a update (if they do) but tbh i like 4 player free for all better anyway.this is better than DoTP 2014 .. but thats just my opinion. no more relying on pre built bot decks, make your own :) thats good and the only way magic should be played!

												Have only put a couple hours in so far, but I'll update this if I end up feeling differently.The core game is fine and similar to 2014, very beginner oriented but that's OK.Biggest complaint is responsiveness.  Needless exageratted animations for *everything* that lurch slowly on my system.  We should be able to play a card game simulator on integrated graphics in 2016... it's not asking too much.  And the UI seems designed for a touch screen- a lot of the mouse control is unintuitive.Will keep playing but these are my biggest gripes so far.			"

												Awesome game, cheap for the amount of hours you can play it. Multiplayer means it doesn't lose its appeal for me. With the addition of new cards its only going to get better. The ability to constuct your own decks makes it the best version and I've played them all. sure its not perfect, a lot of haters don't like the fact its lost 2Headed Giant, while not everyone plays 2HG I can understand why that would annoy them, hopefully they'll reintroduce it.Oh and the interface is a lame port from a touch screen system and is pretty clunky on the main menu.Definitely recommend it if you like Magic!

If you really, REALLY like these guys, then sure, you may give it a shot but I'll tell you this: I don't recommend this title. They removed many things as they added new things and the negatives do not outweigh the benefits. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and continued playing. It was bittersweet.You should consider playing previous versions of MTG instead, which I would suggest 2013 out of all the releases. This ones just a huge disappointment for any MTG fans (I'm not an MTG fan but I was disappointed in this game).			"

The game series is easily a top 10 for me and this game itself is a top 50.  This game works well and runs smooth.  Downside, not many people pley it and very expensive.  A lot of material to play through, and really fun to build your decks and work on different strategies.  7/10 (no game is perfect).			"

Posted: July 25, 2014
												First, go read some of the negative reviews of this game. Many of those reviews are really accurate.Secondly, have you played the heck out of Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014 and 2013? Both of those are really, really good, and if you haven't unlocked all the decks, beat revenge mode, and unlocked all the cards for at least a few of your favorite decks, that's a better way to spend your time than playing Magic 2015.But if you've exhausted Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013 and 2014, and you've still got an itch to play Magic, and if what you've enjoyed in the past hasn't exclusively been the Two-headed Giant mode, then you're Duels of the Planeswalkers 2015's target audience. That happens to describe me perfectly, so I've really enjoyed this game.Negatives:1) No extra game modes. No Two-headed Giant, no Archmage (DotP 2012), no Planeshift (DotP 2013), and no sealed deck (DotP 2014). I happened to find these modes a cute diversion, but reading other reviews I see that a lot of people really loved them. 2) Awful menus. For unfathomable reasons, Stainless Games thought we'd all enjoy an animation of the buttons on the screen rushing off to one side, then a new set of buttons rushing on to the screen. That makes navigating from the campaign level you just lost to the deck building screen take about 30 seconds. ""I don't want to be looking at this set of campaign levels"", woosh, woosh, ""I don't want to pick a different set of campaign levels"", woosh, woosh, ""I don't want any kind of single player game"", woosh, woosh, ""I want to deckbuild"", woosh, woosh, ""I want to edit this deck"", woosh.All of the wooshing is way, way more painful than it should be. If it's annoying to read, it's way more annoying to watch every time you switch what you're doing. It's like adding load times to a game because you have an idea of a funny message to pop up during load times.3) A pretty lousy first hour. There's some tutorial that you can skip, then you pick a pretty lousy two-color deck, and then to complete the tutorial you have to win against a really lousy opponent. I'm pretty sure you're a big favorite, but it's Magic, so you can definitely lose this ""tutorial"" match. Once you've completed the tutorial, you're locked into the lousy two-color deck you picked -- you've got 60 cards and you've got to play with them. Next you play against some AI decks. I breezed through these, but other people struggled. I suspect that the issue is that some of the two-color decks match up well against some of the AI decks, and if you picked a deck with a bad matchup, you're stuck trying over and over until you get lucky. If you get stuck here, it's awful. For the first couple of matches you unlock just a handful of cards in your two colors. Even a couple of matches down the line, you're going to have just a small number of cards in your colors and not enough outside to justify changing colors. This contrasts with the previous games, where if you didn't like how the red deck matched up against the second opponent, you could throw it all out and switch to the green deck. No such luck here.Later in the game, this gets MUCH better, better than any previous DotP game, but it's bad at the start.4) Less to unlock. Unlocking all the cards in the previous DotP games took about 50 hours. Here, you'll unlock everything in about 25 hours. Maybe that means less grinding to you and sounds like a feature, but I feel like unlocking all the cards was the fun part of playing, so to me that counts as content.5) High-level online play will require buying additional cards. In addition to the cards you unlock by playing (or by buying the inaccurately named ""complete edition"") there are additional cards that can only be unlocked by buying ""packs"". These packs are really mini-expansions to the game -- there's something like 200 more cards, many of them duplicates, that can be purchased in chunks. The chunks are random, so the first pack you buy will have different cards than the pack I buy, but if  we buy all the chunks, we'll have all the same cards in all the same numbers.The cards in the packs aren't really better than the cards you unlock by playing, but they might fill a role that can't be filled otherwise. Those of us who don't buy these packs are definitely at a disadvantage against the people who do buy them.6) Some perverse choices about the card pool. Nessian Asp and Akroan Colossus are both 5 mana green creatures with reach -- not identical by any means, but pretty similar. However, there's no green 4-drop that you want to attack with. This mix of redundancies and gaps is pretty typical.Positives:1) New deckbuilding is a big deal. While, as I said above, there are some weird gaps in the card pool, it's really cool to be able to build any kind of deck you want. 2) Great set of opposing decks. Building cool decks is great, but playing against cool decks is also important. Unlike previous versions, which had the opposing decks be the mirrors of the ones you could unlock (plus ""challenges"" with weird decks draw cards in a fixed order), DotP 2015 has about 40 unique decks to play against. These decks use a variety of strategies, and have access to a broader cardpool than the players, so they're able to execute weird strategies better than players.3) ~25 hours of single player gameplay. While previous version of DotP have had even more content, 25 hours of play for $10 is still a great deal. So all in all, even though I have a lot of reservations, I'm glad I bought this.			"

If you want, however, you can get a bit creative.  I recommend it for anyone, even if this is a slightly more difficult entry than years past.I have purchased no premium boosters and have no plans to.  The worst part of this release is definitely the age old mtg issue of buying a little extra win.  the premium cards dont break the game, but I wish they weren't there.			"

												I can remember year after year with the previous magic the gathering games that people wished to create their own decks and now it is in this version everyone is not happy.  I get these Magic the Gathering games every year and are always happy due to the fact that I am realistic and understand that they are just a way to get people hooked on buying magic boosters for real. I understand that hasbro/wizards cannot put every magic card in these games otherwise people will not buy the physical game.  When you think about it for $10 you would get around 3 magic boosters or this game which has hundreds of cards and the ability to play against the PC or real people.  In summary great value for money and great game when you think about how much $10 would pay for in real life magic cards.			"

												The only reason I'm playing this is because it's an MTG game.  MTG is a good game.  This is a bad game that you can (kind of) play a good game inside of.  Don't bother.Edit:  They recently added Sheoldred, Whispering One to the game, so now I get to not only lose to this ridiculous card in my playgroup, but I get to lose to it online too.  I just uninstalled the game and I regret that I can't throw my computer into a river so as to never have to deal with that unfun card in this unfun game that I play a now unfun card game in.  This is no longer a game.  This is torture.			"

												SPOILERS!: This game is abviously better for those who have even the slightest bit of knowledge on MTG. Let's get on with this review.Now yes, this game is hard at first but when u poured in countless of hours just trying to find a deck that can beat the tutorial deck easily thats where the fun part begins....and by that i mean realizing how this game works in terms of deck colors and what not and how to use the combos in the deck you choose to beat your opponent.But besides that, this game is also a far greater version of it's predecessor (at least imo). It's very fun, not really noob friendly, makes you rage at RNGesus for giving the opponent a better 1st hand than you. Another thing is, once you get the hang of this game, you can start creating your own deck and improving agaisnt other players WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT POINT.Its harder to actually find a pub match rather than just playing the singleplayer.But once you do find a game with someone and get to the point where u have a 14/14 creature with flying and they have to counter to it, you basically achieved that point in the game where you graduate from MTG school and realize that there is so much more in this game than skills, its about knowledge and understanding of what ur deck can do.TL;DR Just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ buy the game and play it and just get that x5 14/14 creature with flying on ur field TODAY!10/10 would get mana flooded again ;)			"

												Over all, I really like this version of Duels of the Planeswalkers. They've added a deck builder, which I find is super nice. I never really was a fan of ""unlock cards for this only one preconstruted deck and you only may put these cards in this one specific deck"". A little bummer is, that they haven't had time or resources to put in neither two-headed-giant nor planechase mode, which wasn't really a reason not to buy it. The cards of the several shards coming with this game are unlocked without ever paying for additional unlock-packs quite fast if you have the difficulty set to ""Mage"" in the settings.After you've unlocked all cards, for me it is really fun to construct deck and test them against pre-constructed campaign decks or even against my own decks.A big negative in my opinion is the really really super slow and unprecise interface which sometimes bugs out (mouse wheel doesn't work anymore and you have to drag-n-drop to maneuvre).Also, if you already own Magic 2014, you get a free Premium Booster. If you have Magic 2015 pre-purchased, you've got an additional Premium Booster. Both of those Premium Booster each count towards the ""free Garruk's Revenge DLC as a compensation for buying Premium Boosters"" campaign, Wizards started with the 2014/11/05 update, which was also the DLC's release date.Sadly I'm not allowed to write this in the review of the DLC since I haven't explicitely ""bought"" it from the steam store, but more got it unlocked within the game itself.I accidentally bought the Garruk's Revenge DLC before I started Magic 2015 after the 2014/11/05 update, but the Steam Support was kind enough to undo my payment and refund the money. Cheers and Thumbs Up for the great support!			"

												Pretty good game. Finally, they have given the option to create your own deck from scratch! However, two-headed giant has been removed, which personally i dont like as i used to play that a lot with my friends. The game is enjoable to play through though you cant really compete online without either completing the story first or using micro-transactions. Would be a lot more fun if micro-transactions didnt seem so necessary and give you an advantage over others though.			"

												Pros:Far more freedom in deck building, similar to the drafted in 2014 but with a larger card baseAvoids the previous calls of 'wah wah op deck', replaces with complaining about a colour generally.All colours are somewhat competitiveManual land tapping.Cons:Interface is clunks and bunks (as WMG would and did say), not being able to select deck at the match duel screen, instead having to go to profile or whatever is a big backstepNo 2 headed giant? Just.. why? 2hg is incredibly fun and makes this game for more socialOverall a good addition to the series, could become great with some tweaks and additions.

												Don't buy it. Go get 2012, 2013 or even 2014 but 2015 became ""pay to win"".You no longer get several decks to play with. You choose your color at start and get ONE deck that is sub-par at best (to encourage you to purchase their ""Premium"" cards)Microtransactions everywhere, Booster packs $$$, Premium cards $$$, Foil cards $$$. all of which are allowed online.Yes you unlock cards as you play, but you have to play a lot (at least 5-6+ hours) to get enough cards to build a deck of a different color. that will most likely be sub-par itself due to limited selection of ""free"" cards (even though we payed $10 for the game). Interface is slow and clunky as it was made with touch screen in mind, what should take .5 seconds on PC takes 5 seconds because of god awful menus and UI. Deck building is improved and the actual battle UI is ok, and thats about all i can say positive about this one.In short, became a cash grab, run far, run fast.			"

												Player base for this game is toxic. They will not hesitate to deride you for using the pre-made decks or even using a deck similar to the pre-made ones for perceived lack of originality when the reality is that you're just a new player and you haven't learned enough of the various card interactions or may simply lack the cards to create an ""original"" deck. There is a chat window even in 1v1 multiplayer so you can talk to your opponent and i've gotten to the point where I simply ignore it. It seems like every time my opponent wants to speak to me, it's to make some snide comment about the deck i'm choosing to play.The funny part is that a majority of the player base uses web sites like nogoblinsallowed.com or tappedout.net and there is simply no such thing as a totally original deck.This game is played mostly by elitist mouth-breathers and if you decide to buy it I encourage you to ignore your chat window as your opponent WILL NEVER have anything constructive to say to you. No wonder MTG Lite...I mean Hearthstone is so much more popular.			"

												Disregard all of the bad publicity this game gets and give it a try. It`s worth the money, it`s the price of two irl boosters and offers more gameplay than a booster boxHowever, it indeed feels like a step backwards when compared to previous games in the series.Pros: - Full scale deckbuilding, nice and functional- An interesting single player campaign, with the added bonus of the Explore feature- It`s nice building a collection- The boosters that are sold separately are fairly priced and none of the cards is actually required to make a decent, competitive deck (considering the deck posibilities of the set) Cons- No 2HG- No challenges- The power level of the cards in the set is really low - think Theros block power level - and the cards themselves are kinda boring- The premade decks are kinda low powered, uninteresting and ultimately boring. They used to have personality, now it`s completly lostAll in all, i still think that Magic 2014 is the best in the series but 2015 is a step in the right direction. If next version of Duels (or maybe a DLC) brings back 2HG and a bunch of new, higher powered cards are added , Magic 2015 will probably take the throne as best in the series			"

												Based off of comments here I seem to be the only person who has been enjoying this game and thinks it is worth the $10.There is a lot of blowback about micro-transactions and having to buy booster packs to beat the campaign mode, which is how you unlock cards to build decks. I pre-purchased, and go some kind of extra booster for that, but since then I have not bought any and am on last duel to beat game on normal difficulty. I find it funny that people are upset about microtransactions, when to succeed in the ""real life"" version of the card game you gave to buy cards and boosters to successful. Yeah, a person who spends more money might have an advantage, and guess what? Same goes in the real world. Just play, have fun, and don't worry about if you win or lose.			"

												NOTE: I recommend this game at $9.99 - any additional ""special edition"" upgrades or whatever are a total waste of money and should NOT be where your money goes. What this is not: - an online replacement/playtesting tool for paper magic players who don't want to pay hundreds, if not thousands to maintain an online collection. - worth investing more than $9.99 in- designed for PC - a challenge for real, competitve magic playersIf you can accept these things, then you are not going to be disappointed by DOTPW 2015. It is a short campaign with a decent amount of replay value, it is better executed in ""most"" regards vs. the previous iterations of this game. The AI is generally not challenging at all, even at the hardest levels, so if you are a good magic player, and you concede games quickly to poor RNG, you can easily finish this entire campaign in about 3-4 hours (you will note I have 7.2 hours on record, and that includes a reasonable amount of messing around and farming the post-campaign content) Duels was clearly designed for tablets, so with that said, you may well just want to buy it on a tablet :), as the menus ask you to ""swipe"" the screen with your mouse, which is inaccurate to say the least, and infuriating in more cases than not. What duels of the planeswalkers 2015 has improved on... The overall game UI is solid, and is an excellent educational tool for those not necessarily too familiar with the game's rules. The mana-tapping complaints I have seen are really not a concern if you pay attention and use mana-cycling. Not being able to target your opponent's cards by default is something you MUST turn off. No spoilers, but there is a specific opponent where your life is a ton easier if you can target their cards. I would also turn off the handicap of allowing the AI to order your blocks for you - but do so understanding that assigning blocks is a bit of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥so you may well order incorrectly anyway. The presentation of cutscenes, videos and even some voice acting is new to DOTPW with this edition, advancing on ""motion images"" of the previous incarnation. The underlying story of Garruk and his obsession with being a hunter is nicely realized and while the transitions from plane to plane are a touch, weird, it's all good and nothing that detracts from the overall story experience. The collection management has decent filtering, the packs you get after each victory generally have at least a couple of good upgrades for your current deck, and by about plane 4 or so, you do get to have some real flexibility in adjusting your deck to handle the current task at hand (i.e. sideboarding in artifact or enchantment removal, etc)  The whole deck building interface is quite basic, however. So don't expect it to make it easy for you to see your deck at a glance. Who is Duels of the Planeswalkers 2015 for? anyone who is generally speaking a fan of Magic the Gathering, but is on the more beginner to intermediate side. The tutorial is good, the tool tips are accurate and useful, and the overall experience is very much intended to hand-hold the player with less experience. If you pay attention well enough, you will get a good introduction to core concepts such as the stack, correctly timing your instants and abilities and attacking before playing cards (something the AI does, and the game correctly (for the most part) recommends to you).  Anyone who is a bit more skilled who feels that $10 is a decent value for 7-10 hours (or more if you really get in to the multiplayer aspect) of magic-based entertainment. It is sad to note the loss of the puzzle/challenge mode. This might have been a mistake to exclude since such things are generally speaking one diversion which entertains the more advanced player. Keep your expectations low, and this game will be pretty much everything you want - and it's a heck of a lot more fun to play than full fledged Magic the Gathering in the recently launched v4 online client!

												EDIT:I'm changing my mind. I'm really enjoying the card pool. There are some rather interesting complexities and intereactions within the seeming restrictions. It can be a neat way to play.Dont get me wrong, I still hate the ridiculously time consuming menus and inefficient deck building UI. I miss two headed giant like crazy, although 4 player actually has people playing it now so its a novel substitute in some ways.- - -I will never understand the people that made the decisions involved in putting together this years version. I really want to like this and I've waited months and months to do so. But the following points are incredibly difficult to get past.- Dead Giants. Removal of Two Headed Giant due to lack of budget and/or questionable priorities- Menus of Eternity. One at a time icons that fill your entire screen. What should take five seconds to navigate can easily take over thirty seconds.- Menus of Sexy. Lovely fading effect that likely drained an unjustifiablly large percentage of the budget. Who sexys up the least important part of a game at the cost of everything else? Definitely a questionable priority.- Themeless Themes. They describe each deck like they do all of these amazing things together, but only the most laughably small amount of cards that reflect each theme appear to have made it into the card pool. This is even more pronounced in contrast with last years distinct and solid themes.- I've Got Bugs.Should be a super-fun tribal deck, not a constant pain in the UI♥♥♥♥♥- Deck Select.You cannot change decks as you set up a multiplayer game. You must equip a deck in a previous screen, requiring you quit out and try get back in. So just to get an arbitrary language tie-in with an artifact type, we now have to do things the hard way.- Lobbying for a Lobby.Where is the multiplayer lobby after a game? It seems like it just drops out to one of the main menus after a game but once in a while it will go back into the game set up screen. Which one is it? Do we have a real lobby or is it just random?- Yawning Pool.I understand a good balance of card power, but it feels like I've been zerg rushed with meh. While there are a couple of fun and interesting cards, it feels like you have to use scraps dancing around them to complete a deck. Card synchronicity is really quite lacklustre. Gimme some of the AI's cards.- Bigger is Not Big.The entire marketing spin is spearheaded with 'Hunt Bigger Game'. If you did an audit and comparison of mean and/or total creature size between this and last years version, I'd probably be willing to put money on us actually hunting smaller game this time around.- Deck Build Build.There are a bunch of filters that are buried (like the old school pun?) in panels at the top and bottom of the screen. All of these filters would easily fit directly above and below the cards. Plenty of room. There is no need to make them an extra click away with another click to get back. Functionless complexity is infuriating. Though if I must settle for the ridiculous summaries instead, why not give me my colour break-downs in them? Everything else seems to be listed.- Joining the Rebellion.Jump onto a multiplayer 'Quick Match' and it queues you for a quick match. Lies. There is no 'Cancel' button, so more often than not you are stuck in a massive white 'Joining' screen with absolutely no way out.			"

												You can design your own deck, a huge improvement. The game got also more reasonable with the expansion: the chance of getting the battle boosters for free is good news. Still the selection of decks is much worse and unbalanced than in 2013 and 2014... Token decks are clearly more powerfull than the rest, also boring to play with and against... Luckily, most of the people don't carry them, so duels are more diverse a fun than before. I don't mind not being able to play 2HG, wasn't my thing. For the 20 bucks I expent I wasn't expecting more, it's a good game with some defects.P.S. After some hours of playing, probably the thing that annoys me more is that you can't play play again against the same person in a duel. I don't understand what reason could th programers have to do this, it's a nonsense. Please, change it.			"

												I know this years DOTP wasn't very well received, but I actually think it does a BETTER job at doing what it's supposed to. The cards might not be as strong as in 2014 (or 2013, which had razorsharp decks), but on the other hand you can finally build your deck as you like. And in that regard, the cards are stronger than in 2014's Sealed Play (where you could also construct your own decks).Also, with the addon, you can unlock the boosters by playing multiplayer matches, so the pay-to-win factor is gone. Considering that everyone gets the same cards to play with, it's still interesting to build decks that are ahead of the crowd.On the technical side, it also starts up a lot faster than its predecessors, something I also wanted to mention. The UI is still a bit cumbersome (are there really many people playing this on their tablets?), but the main menu got a faster animation, so it's a bit better than before. Overall, considering that you can finally BUILD decks instead of just finetuning them, I think this game is worth its money.			"

												Based off of comments here I seem to be the only person who has been enjoying this game and thinks it is worth the $10.There is a lot of blowback about micro-transactions and having to buy booster packs to beat the campaign mode, which is how you unlock cards to build decks. I pre-purchased, and go some kind of extra booster for that, but since then I have not bought any and am on last duel to beat game on normal difficulty. I find it funny that people are upset about microtransactions, when to succeed in the ""real life"" version of the card game you gave to buy cards and boosters to successful. Yeah, a person who spends more money might have an advantage, and guess what? Same goes in the real world. Just play, have fun, and don't worry about if you win or lose.			"

												Disregard all of the bad publicity this game gets and give it a try. It`s worth the money, it`s the price of two irl boosters and offers more gameplay than a booster boxHowever, it indeed feels like a step backwards when compared to previous games in the series.Pros: - Full scale deckbuilding, nice and functional- An interesting single player campaign, with the added bonus of the Explore feature- It`s nice building a collection- The boosters that are sold separately are fairly priced and none of the cards is actually required to make a decent, competitive deck (considering the deck posibilities of the set) Cons- No 2HG- No challenges- The power level of the cards in the set is really low - think Theros block power level - and the cards themselves are kinda boring- The premade decks are kinda low powered, uninteresting and ultimately boring. They used to have personality, now it`s completly lostAll in all, i still think that Magic 2014 is the best in the series but 2015 is a step in the right direction. If next version of Duels (or maybe a DLC) brings back 2HG and a bunch of new, higher powered cards are added , Magic 2015 will probably take the throne as best in the series			"

												I have to wonder how many people who rated this game poorly or recommended others not to get it have actually played  Magic 2015. As someone new to MTG, I had nothing but fun playing the main campaign and multiplayer. I still have more cards to unlock, but to those who say you ""need"" premium cards to have fun or be competative in multiplayer either have a lack of ingenuity in deck building or, again, just haven't played the game at all. Will you beat every pack out there without the premiums? Probably not, but then again, if that matters that much to you then you shouldn't have a problem spending the little bit extra for the rest of the cards. This has been a wonderful introduction to MTG and well worth the ten bucks I spent. Just got my first set of paper cards today now that I'm hooked on the game. I recommend this whole heartedly for all beginners to MTG and, despite the hate out there, even some veterns of the paper game enjoy Magic 2015.			"

												DotP 2014 was a lot better. I can't quite point to exactly why, but I felt lost playing through this game. I'm not even sure now how ""finished"" I am even though I think I beat the final boss. Maybe its just me, but it was sort of all over the place as far as progression and story. Games with day 1 dlc already start out with a lower grade for me and I will not pay for it and this game reinforces why. It felt incomplete. Its missing features and extras that previous versions had. Being able to build my deck was kind of novel, but the cards are still pretty limited...unless you buy all the extras I assume, but I'd rather spend that money on real cards or even in the online version.I preordered this game and don't totally regret it, but I won't rush to do it next year for sure.

												Don't buy it. Go get 2012, 2013 or even 2014 but 2015 became ""pay to win"".You no longer get several decks to play with. You choose your color at start and get ONE deck that is sub-par at best (to encourage you to purchase their ""Premium"" cards)Microtransactions everywhere, Booster packs $$$, Premium cards $$$, Foil cards $$$. all of which are allowed online.Yes you unlock cards as you play, but you have to play a lot (at least 5-6+ hours) to get enough cards to build a deck of a different color. that will most likely be sub-par itself due to limited selection of ""free"" cards (even though we payed $10 for the game). Interface is slow and clunky as it was made with touch screen in mind, what should take .5 seconds on PC takes 5 seconds because of god awful menus and UI. Deck building is improved and the actual battle UI is ok, and thats about all i can say positive about this one.In short, became a cash grab, run far, run fast.			"

												Player base for this game is toxic. They will not hesitate to deride you for using the pre-made decks or even using a deck similar to the pre-made ones for perceived lack of originality when the reality is that you're just a new player and you haven't learned enough of the various card interactions or may simply lack the cards to create an ""original"" deck. There is a chat window even in 1v1 multiplayer so you can talk to your opponent and i've gotten to the point where I simply ignore it. It seems like every time my opponent wants to speak to me, it's to make some snide comment about the deck i'm choosing to play.The funny part is that a majority of the player base uses web sites like nogoblinsallowed.com or tappedout.net and there is simply no such thing as a totally original deck.This game is played mostly by elitist mouth-breathers and if you decide to buy it I encourage you to ignore your chat window as your opponent WILL NEVER have anything constructive to say to you. No wonder MTG Lite...I mean Hearthstone is so much more popular.			"

												I want a damn refund.I had thought that all the reviews bashing this game were just hype.  I could not have been more wrong.  This game suffers from HORRIBLE balance issues.  Your starting decks, quite frankly, really do suck, and do not work as advertised (blue spells do not ""bounce"" in the blue/green deck, for example, and the green creatures do not have the ""when entering the battlefield"" effects promised.  The only exception to this is the black/white deck, but only barely, as it does indeed have a whopping three cards with lifelink)  In fact, no matter what color combination you choose, the cards you get for your color are always the same.  (you get the same blue cards for a blue/black as you do for a blue/green or blue/red).  Also, your starting decks do not have a ""base"" card:  that one powerful card that you build your deck around.  To compound matters, the greatest strength of this game is also its greatest weakness:  the emulation of booster packs.  the cards you get are entirely random, meaning you can (as I have twice now) wind up with no new cards to add to your deck before fighting the stage one boss, something that is absolutely critical.  Do NOT make the same mistake I made.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  Buy Dream Pinball 3D or Air Control instead.			"

												You can design your own deck, a huge improvement. The game got also more reasonable with the expansion: the chance of getting the battle boosters for free is good news. Still the selection of decks is much worse and unbalanced than in 2013 and 2014... Token decks are clearly more powerfull than the rest, also boring to play with and against... Luckily, most of the people don't carry them, so duels are more diverse a fun than before. I don't mind not being able to play 2HG, wasn't my thing. For the 20 bucks I expent I wasn't expecting more, it's a good game with some defects.P.S. After some hours of playing, probably the thing that annoys me more is that you can't play play again against the same person in a duel. I don't understand what reason could th programers have to do this, it's a nonsense. Please, change it.			"

												I know this years DOTP wasn't very well received, but I actually think it does a BETTER job at doing what it's supposed to. The cards might not be as strong as in 2014 (or 2013, which had razorsharp decks), but on the other hand you can finally build your deck as you like. And in that regard, the cards are stronger than in 2014's Sealed Play (where you could also construct your own decks).Also, with the addon, you can unlock the boosters by playing multiplayer matches, so the pay-to-win factor is gone. Considering that everyone gets the same cards to play with, it's still interesting to build decks that are ahead of the crowd.On the technical side, it also starts up a lot faster than its predecessors, something I also wanted to mention. The UI is still a bit cumbersome (are there really many people playing this on their tablets?), but the main menu got a faster animation, so it's a bit better than before. Overall, considering that you can finally BUILD decks instead of just finetuning them, I think this game is worth its money.			"

												If you want to play duel of the planewalkers go pick up 2014 people still play and it a vastly better game.  This game features a small card pool with a very low power level.  And even fewer good decks that can be made out of the pool.  Aside from the boring card pool, you can only get some of the stronger cards if you pay extra to buy packs, a joke and money grab.  To top that stink pile off they took away one of the games most played modes, two headed giant for no reason.  Also the menu navigation is clunky and slow, as well as not being able to change decks to play against the same opponent.  This was a rushed piece of garbage that wizards should be ashamed of especially since there last few itterations were so good,			"

												This game is a great way to get in to the card game if you're a beginner (like I was), and unlike the actual irl version of it, you will always have someone to play against! On the downside, it has a few things that could be tweaked to make it better, for instance the menus are a bit slow, the difficulty progression is a bit staggering, but most of all I got quite annoyed at how you cannot change your starter deck. If I had been one of the developers, I would have made a quiz that hands out a recommended deck to the player, so that people who are new to the game wouldn’t chose one that they would later realize that they felt uncomfortable with (like me).All in all; It is worth its cost, if you are into magic or just card games like these in general, then you'd probably like this game as well! Imagine all the money you'd have to spend to build the decks you can get in game, and in that sense its definitely worth it! "

												This is a great game if you're learning to play MTG or if you're getting back into it. It isn't as diverse for veteran players, but there are still a good amount of cards, and lots of content to unlock. It's very fun, and the multiplayer works nicely.			"

But it's flaws sre still prevalent. Most people who buy this game already know what they're in for, M:TG lite.			"

												As someone who has played Magic off and on for the past five years or so, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun, semi-casual Magic experience.  While DotP 2015 has its technical faults, it more than makes up for them by offering a package that is fun, educational and has a sharp looking user interface.  My favorite things about DotP 2015 so far are the in-match suggestion and the in-game card info features.  If I'm not sure about my next move, I can ask for a suggestion and the game will offer advice, like enchant a creature, or attack with a certain number of creatures while still having other creatures for defense.  The card info feature lets you zoom in on a card and will offer more info on a certain ability or term if you are unfamiliar with it.  I imagine more experienced players would be turned off by these, but I assure you, they are totally optional and can be disabled if you wish.  Another thing I like about DotP 2015 is the sense of progression.  You get to test drive several different decks of various colors and playstyles in the tutorial and once you beat the first boss, that's your starting deck.  After that, you begin a journey that will send you to several different planes, each with around six unique fights.  I will admit, it is a little frightening being locked in at this point with practically no way to change, but you have to press on.  You can augment your current deck or build new ones by winning campaign battles or random duels and earning booster packs.  Booster packs contain about 7~10 cards or so.  Yeah, it's grindy, but that's the point.  To the more experienced players, the tutorials are optional and many of these features can be turned off.  If you're still not sure, I would say try cranking up the difficulty if you still need a challenge.  To the newer players and people like me, looking for a fun Magic experience without embarassing yourself in public like I do at booster drafts, this is pretty cool and well worth the $10.One more thing regarding the microtransactions/DLC:  I hate microtransactions and in-app purchases in general, so before I tried DotP 2015, I was extremely wary of the idea of subjecting myself to a scam.  I don't plan on purchasing anything beyond the base game and at five hours in, I don't feel pressured into buying anything.  There is nothing ""in your face"" about it.  There is an unobtrusive button in one of the menus that says 'shop' where you can choose to buy special booster packs or foil stickers if you want.  I'm a very cynical person when it comes to monetization strategies like this and so far, I don't agree with a lot of criticism of this game.			"

												I would reccomend playing this if you like magic but beware, this game annoys me because they make you feel like an idiot that does not know how to play magic because even if you pick veteran difficulty they require you to go through this long♥♥♥♥♥tutorial explaining the entire game over again like I've never even heard of magic before..... Kind of insulting if you ask me but got over it. Then they didn't give me the cards I bought for extra $$ right away so I could not make a decent deck to start the game,  had to make do with the weak decks they let me choose from and ripped my hair out as I pulled mana card after mana card with nothing to spend it on. After several restarts later I was able to beat the first set of enemies and unlock the cards I payed for which was pretty painful. Other than that I like the card game of magic a lot and this plays it just fine, has new art, and runs pretty smooth for the most part. Also, I do not know why I can't use instant spells when in the blocking phase of battle because from what I understand you can play an instant at any time, including when I'm about to block so I can blow away a monster when attacking but hey...maybe I'm wrong.

												I don't really understand where all the hate is coming from. Online play was my favorite in 2014, and I have found myself not even having a huge desire to play online yet because of how fun the campaign and getting cards is. Plus, multiple entrirely customizable decks saved for whenever you want to use them? I love dotp 14 but this one is way better, it's such an awesome game. The online matches I HAVE played have been balanced and fun. They did a great job on this game. Even if I somehow was never able to play the game again, the time I *have* played it for was well worth my $10, but I'm not done playing yet!			"

												The ONLY thing new about this is creating your own deck. The single player is not true AI, it's deck manipulation that detects player disadvantage and changes the rest of the game to amplify that fact:-If you start the game with a deck it doesn't like (especially a custom) you'll rarely get a usable starting hand-If you are short one mana source early, it will make sure you don't get it until it's too late-Whatever spell you need to turn a game around will be mysteriously absent from your drawsIn the actual card game I've NEVER gotten this many bad hands in a row. A few of the archtypes that I have looked at to play have a smattering of cards, not actually enough to make them effective (mostly missing finishers). In the collection, you can get up to 4 commons, 3 uncommons, or 2 rares which makes decks that are rare heavy seem exessively random. If you're an experienced player this game will sour your experience, and if you're a novice it'll bat you around until you're fed up and want your money back.As always: the multiplayer experience changes with deck match-ups.

												I've seen a lot of hate thrown at this game, and a lot of it is simply unwarrented.  First up, the deck builder is awesome.  It's a great way to get more experienced players into the yearly Magic digital release.  I've seen many complaining about having problems getting through certain sections of the game with the pre-built decks.  I have tried 3, and had no problems.  My only guess is that the problem is in their gameplay, not the AI.The game is far from perfect.  The removal of two headed giant is a shame, one that will hopefully be rectified with a patch or perhaps to come back in the first expansion for the game.  I am disappointed by the fact that some cards can only be unlocked via in game purchases.  These cards are not needed to complete the single player campaign, and a great deck can be constructed without them for multiplayer, but after looking at the cards you get from the premium packs, players who buy all of them will have a distinct advantage.Even with the above criticism, its still a fun title available at a budget price.  You'll get your money out of it if you purchase it.  There's so much hate for this game, and much of it is unwarranted.			"

Yes, there is no 2HG. Yes, the software is not the most responsive at times (not very noticably though). There are plenty of little things that people nitpick on (and they are correct), however they really aren't as detrimental as they are made out to be. And IMO, I like ffa better than 2v2 anyway. Also, building decks from scratch is such a benefit, I think it outweighs the detriments.TL;dr. If you like MTG, at the very least this won't be a waste of your money.			"

												UPDATE #2:They made the 'premium' cards be obtainable through play without paying anything and gave the expansion to everyone who preordered or bought any premium cards before the release of the expansion.There are some fun new cards and them realising their mistakes and cutting the pay to win aspect out made this a much better game. They also sped the menus up which is a big improvement. I now recommend the game. At least if you preordered it or bought a premium before (because then you'll get it for free once you start the game up). Otherwise it's a dodgier purchase, but still ok.UPDATE #1:After unlocking all the non-premium cards and fiddling around in the deck builder, I must say, it isn't as bad as I thought. You can make some interesting decks. Wish there were more cards to make themed decks easier to build though. They could allow us to use all the portraits we come across, not just the ones we have now. Some of the AI, achivement, or title portraits look really nice, but you can't use them. Shame, as it would add some extra incentive to go for them. You do unlock some personas, but they're mostly rehashed from earlier versions.There's still a fun game here, especially in multiplayer. It's just a shame that it's hidden under many inconveniences that add up over time, and monotone grinding (to be fair, it's faster to unlock everything than in 2014).---I had more fun playing the Hearthstone expansion Curse of Naxxramas for 4 hours than I did playing the single player of this for 16 hours.The Magic part of it is good, 'cause it's Magic. That's to be expected.However, the UI is clunky, and the whole digital and software side of things is unenjoyable after some time. It's like a downgrade to 2014, even with the 'deck building' which has mostly underwhelming cards to choose from.This version lacks soul. Unless you're interested in the cards and art, don't bother with this one. Try 2014 instead.			"

												Seriously, I purchased this to play the game and hopefully use my laptop for the foreseen future. I did not however intend to want to punch the screen of my computer in until not only the LED lighting but the screen itself shattered. This is a legitimate step DOWN from the tabletop game and possibly MTGO (which I did not like the layout and presentation for).Let's break this down:Beginning Content:After a quick click through tutorial for those who already know the game, you get to make your choice of colors. Then you can take it a step forward and pick a secondary color for the deck. Unfortunately it seems if you don't pick a specific color combination, you're going to be at a hopeless disadvantage. And it has to be the deck archetype that matches with that color. In my specific instance, I chose black with green as a secondary. That didn't last long either. And even after, you have nothing except the update content, which is next on the review.Update Content:Underwhelming, plain and simple. It seemed pretty obvious they were saying one thing when developing this. The black and red cards were practically screaming. While I found getting young pyromancer good, I still hated it. And it really isn't very tipping of the scales for the single player campaign. In general, the card packs seemed useless. When I saw these packs being put into the game from the Steam page for it, I was excited. Just to have the game s**t on me with a mediocre pool from sets I would be normally excited for.Single Player:Frustratingly stupid. Honestly. I must have had to change my deck layout 5 times to figure out the one thing that worked and even then, I had to get a lucky pull. On the first actual opponent post-tutorial. Seriously. Do people not understand that even knowing it's just a game, people get impatient and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off? Then you expect us to play against opponents that literally pull the same s**t the entire time? Every damn match? No matter what!? I refuse to play any more of this bulls**t and I'm still only in Theros fighting the god damned minotaurs! It doesn't help that the ""prize packs"" from each game don't give you a damn thing.Multiplayer:Nothing you haven't seen playing the physical game on a table. 3 games and I saw the exact same deck by 3 different players. Uhh. Standard Play? Seriously. The same ""Tier 1"" decks that you have no fighting against unless you pop the wallet out to give yourself a fighting chance.Actual Gameplay and Other Features:So the gameplay is the same as it's been for the DotP games. I feel the timer doesn't really add to the game but it also doesn't tale away. It just saves the time of hitting a button. But what I'm aiming at is the deck building layout. I personally never was a fan of how decks were built on these games and the limited and pointless pool of cards that don't do anything to improve your mood.Overall really. REALLY weak in a game that looked promising for a set full of high value cards. While it seems like the developers wanted to try giving you some help to fight the unfair odds with these added update contents, it just looks like a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥damage control hotline. Your starting deck seems even more limited even with these additions. The AI is frustrating and even if you know what's coming up, it feels like you're purposely screwed over with what card you draw. The tagline being used is enough to catch you but instead of ""Hunt Bigger Game"" it should be ""Hunt the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for 20 minutes trying to find the right deck""			"

												One of the single worst games I have ever played graphics wise. You have to click on everything two or three times for anything to happen, and the cards are always shifting around and performing unneccesary animations that take forever to execute, even if you turn as many as possible off. I've had the misfortune of playing this on both PC and Kindle, both ran like absolute garbage. And if you can stomach the awful menus, it also takes about 10 hours of grinding just to get to a place where you can compete with the AI. The only reason for this is because card unlocking takes forever and they don't start you with enough cards to build a competitive deck. Online MTG should not be a difficult thing to execute. This is the most embarassing in Wizard's long line of overpriced, sub-par Magic games. Play 2013, 2012, even Magic Duels...at least you'll be able to, uh, play the game. I only bought it because it was on sale, and play it when the card sets in the other games get boring. But I don't feel good about myself when I do.			"

												Still a good game, but you grow tired of seeing the same things over and over again:Pro :Build your own decks out of available card poolThe single player campaign was more exciting that previous versionsCons :No two-headed giantTedious match making processThe userinterface tries to be flashy, but in turn makes it hard to navigate and very clunkyWas expecting more DLC to bolster your card collection and maybe bring in old sets or new sets as available downloads.When attacking someone with several or more creatures makes it it possible to declare blockers.Addditional suggestion : maybe run tournamenst for those interested to pit their decks against each other, or do sealed or draft tournaments as in normal magic.Keep the version fresh, not just here is 2015 liek 2014, next thing you will get from us is 2016, because if that's the case, I wont be buying 2016.oh and mac and linux compatibility, ios but not mac or linux come one, dropping hte ball.Badly.I hope you take this critiscm to heart.Thanks "

												It is hard to say yes or no about if I would recommend this game. The game is really fun. Great game play, it is MTG. Story isn't bad. Interface is easy to use. I bought the Garruk expansion, the special edition content and the innerstrad and alara dlcs. I have issues with the content. The cards are pretty limited. Also you can't unlock alara or innerstrad boosters in the single player game. I just beat the game and the expansion and I had a good time doing it. I feel that they could have put more content in, there are alot of MTG cards in the world. Also the single player story could have been longer with more card unlocks, I like to play this solo and I don't think I should be punished for that.			"

												This game is much better than Magic Duels Origins, which is also on Steam. The majority of negative reviews are complaints that were valid prior to the games' numerous updates which have since taken place. The game is now very well polished, finished, and you can easily earn all of the cards for free if you just put in a bit of time. The roster of available cards here is by far the most fun out of all the DOTP games, and there's a ton of variety to work with. It doesn't take years of grinding to earn the cards either, unlike a certain other, newer installment... The campaign is also pretty good if you care about that, and the AI isn't awful when played on the highest difficulty. The explore feature is pretty cool if you can't handle playing online, although it's less extensively replayable than Origins' version of the feature, the design of the decks you play against is far less repetitive and also far less poorly constructed. Downsides include a soundtrack that is generally inferior to Magic 2014, the lack of 2headedgiant mode (I don't know why people care so immensely about this, it would be nice to have all kinds of modes in DOTP but there's never been any consistency across the games in that regard.), and an arguably imbalanced meta (Though there's so much variety theoretically available to you that if you have a friend or two you don't need to succumb to the good ole' cloudshift combo, spider spawning combo, Doubling season tokens, Jeskai control sweepers, 20 counterspells Izzet deck, truefire paladin killing you by turn 3, etc. etc.)-but this last point is something inherant in all DOTP games, only this time you get to build your deck so you at least have more freedom to try and combat the meta. While you can also build your deck with Origins, it takes about 10 years to unlock cards that aren't garbage-unless you plan on spending an amount equivalent to real world MTG, which defeats the purpose of playing this game virtually to begin with. The complaints regarding bugginess and p2w are no longer prevalent in this game, UNLIKE Magic Duels Origins, which is why, in my eyes, this game is currently superior, and will remain so until the newer game on the block becomes both reasonably functional and accessible. Unless you're a 2HG fetishist, in which case this game is worthless to you.			"

												They purposefully give you a some of the worst cards in order for you to pay for the extra packs.  They left out a lot of cards with effects, like doublestrike, and some of the boss' decks are unbelievably powerful.  Once I grinded enough, I was able to unlock the right cards to let me win but that took way too long and was definitely a waste of my time.			"

												I wanted to like this game so much, but it's just not worth the price.You don't get access to 'all' the cards (AI opponents get access to cards not available to players), the AI has a horribly visible bias on their starting hands, and the game is very prone to crashing.   A LOT of the significant cards are behind paywall.It's convenient to play with friends at a distance, though, the invite system via steam makes matchmaking very simple.It's not as good as 2014, worth getting only if on sale.

												There continue to be serious issues with online play.  I can connect to a match only about 20% of the time. There also appears to be a bug that cause the match to freeze when playing online, and the only way out is to concede the match to your opponent.Overall the game is fun, and will be much more fun if the server issues can be fixed.  Also, the menu system is rather clunky and slow, and should be improved in next year's iteration.			"

You get more used to the interface/control scheme after a while.I have played one of the most challenging and entertaining games of Magic using this, so if you like playing Magic too –Well, I guess this is your game.Cons: When the board is full of tokens, unblockables and flyers (You don't need to be Edric to know that's my jam) I need a little more than 30 seconds to assign blockers. The interface is rather clunky and it's hard to know what's selected and what is not.			"

												I've seen a lot of negative reviews of this Magic game and there are some things that really annoy you. The microtransactions which don't actually explicitly tell you you're only paying to instantly unlock something you can actually unlock yourself ingame is one. Another is the difficulty setting essentially only changing how you and the opponent are drawing.I've had a problem with the menu system in the Magic games since the original. It's terrible and they really should study some other games and make it more intuitive and less obstructive.On the up side, you can make your own decks now which is what I wanted from the first game and all its followups. There is so much potential with Magic and how you play the actual ccg they could use to make a magnificent computer game with, but they're content at the moment to just remake the same game with a few tweaks each year and hope people fall for their dlc traps.After the backlash this latest iteration has received I hope they really go back and have a good think about how to make the next one something special.All that being said, I do recommend this game if it's on special. Don't buy the dlc, maybe the expansion if it is also on sale. If, like me, you enjoy trying new deck tactics and synergies and weird colour combinations then you'll enjoy it. You'll need to grind out the cards but that's not too long.			"

												I'm a fan of Magic in real life. But this game doesn't capture any of the feeling. The user interace is terrible, it's difficult to make modifications to your deck, which is a shame because they decks they give you initially are pretty bad. It also doesn't help that the single player opponents' decks often completely outclass you. I have given up many times in frustration because the opponent played at least a rare card every turn, whule my deck only had maybe 3 in my entire deck. The way it feels right now, it feels like a poor man's Hearthstone. That's saying something considering that Hearthstone is free to play, while this set me back $20.			"

												Even after reading all he comments I have decided to buy this game.Love the game, not to complicated, loads of free choice in building a deck and it feels balanced enough. For example in building your deck you are limited to:4 of each common3 of each uncommon2 of each rare1 of each mythicBecause of the above  the likeliness to make a 5 turn winning deck are low due to not being able to play uncommon, rare and mythic cards 4 times in a 60 card deck.This slows the game down a notch and let beginners learn magic, in a way they can fight back and enjoy magic.  I for one played some magic real live and some pre-release events.  But I still like this game  very much. But I can understand if you are used to playing legacy format this is to restricted and boring. Or if you like to play any other format than magic 1vs1 or 3 and 4 free for all. If that is the case this is not your game.If you want to play magic on some sort of even level for only the price of a couple of booster packs this is a great game with loads of cards to build a deck. In this version of Duels of the Planeswalkers you have no pre design you need to follow. You can build a deck with all cards in the game available no matter which colour or combination you play. There for It is a bit more free compared to DotP 2013 and 2014.To be able to play all cards you require the game magic 2015 and or the Garruk expansion or the Alara cards expansion.In Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013 and 2014 you where capable of building bigger, better, faster and stronger decks. In those older versions there was also support for other game formats like duel headed giant and sealed. DotP 2015 only supports 1vs1 or multiplayer free for all. Which makes DotP 2015 best choice for beginners and me for playing some fair magic against other people or the computer. Pro:Fair deck building chance.Great card choice.Like the fact you unlock boosters.Some interesting bot deck’s and moves.Great value for money  Cons:you have to buy and the game and a expansion to have access to all cards.No extra game modes "

The main problem was that you can't unlock the entire set of cards unless you pay$$. The introduction (I guess this was introduce in the 2014 version) was a cool feauture but the number of decks you can build with the available cards and have chances of winning are like what 5? And that's pushing it. What is even worse is that the decks you can make are way weaker than the previous versions. Compared to the 2013-2012 the game has lost its ""arcade"" feeling and seems to me that turned into a $ sucking machine...

												In all honesty, the developers did a lot of decent work in designing the new setup. There are a ton of improvements and a much more dynamic base in terms of the game itself. Sadly this came at a severe cost in that it's not very fleshed out. The game is more or less a simple shell, and while it has a lot of potential for future improvement it's currently just too bland to warrant playing for an extended period of time. There's just too little substance to keep you interested and there are a few frustrating flaws with the current layout such as an overly complex and somewhat slow menu UI and a long and tedious introductory phase to the game that denies you access to most of the game's features untiul you can beat the first major story section. It just doesn't pay off as it currently stands. I would not recommend buying the game unless/until a future DLC arrives that adds more gameplay features such as new gamemodes and a more diverse lineup of cards. I really want to love this game, but so far the only appeal for me comes from the hopes that the modding community will be able to better utilize the new features than the developers did.			"

												TLDR: Don't buy this game as it contains:  Microtransactions.  Unplayably bad starting prebuilts.  Unfun grinding.  Weird deckbuilding restrictions.  A very one dimensional card pool.  None of the alternate play modes you liked from previous versions.  Repeat DO NOT BUY.I *hate* this game.  Why?  Because it's not even slightly fun.  I love MtG. I play it every weekend.  I've enjoyed other versions of DotP.  I did NOT enjoy this hot wet mess of unadulterated P2W crap bloated with unfun, frustrating, and punishing grind.  If you push through the grind, you will have nothing to show for it unless you pay another 4x for the best cards in this cesspool of a card pool and even then you will only have 4 man free for all for multiplayer.Build your own deck from scratch they said.  B.u.l.l.s.h.i.t! You can now choose every card in the deck, but don't expect to have many good choices as most of the cards in the game are embarassingly weak, especally compared to the cards in the decently build AI decks AND the microtransaction cards you may see in online multiplayer.  The biggest problem is that there is very little mass removal (or even spot removal!) available outside microtransaction land and what there is is basically one star affairs that can't handle the AI's creature synergy strategies.  Expect to see your deck flounder against the Synergy Solder deck time after time, retardless of what angle you come at it from.The starting decks have absolutely none of the charm of the previous versions' prebuilt decks because the prebuilts of this version are total train wrecks of trash commons.  Almost every card you start out with isn't worth bending down to pick up off your FLGS's bathroom floor.  Expect endless muligans looking for a perfect hand just to have a tiny chance of victory.   You can approximate the experience by taking your last prerelease deck to a FNM, replace the 5 best cards in your deck with commons found on the floor, then beg for endless muligans.  If by some miracle you win a game, pick up a few more trash commons off the floor and repeat.However, rather than each victory with a deck giving you an additional powerful card, you get a ""booster"" that contains mostly unplayable crap to add to your ""why would I want this in my collection?!"" pile. I could grind on a random selection of the repeatable decks (they mostly get old really fast as you never have the removal necessary to effeicently defeat their creature synergy and aura strategies), but why bother?  You rarely see anything worth playing and you would need the patience of a saint to build even a scrub fnm level deck.  AND THEN THERE ARE MICROTRANSACTIONS TO ACCESS OTHERWISE UNAVAILABLE CARDS.  At least that's what I've heard, because I'm sure as hell not paying another $40 into this mess.  I already regret paying the money I already have for this game and I bought it in a humble bundle! So basically, I think if this is their bold new direction, this is the last DotP I will ever buy.  It looks like 2013 with it's planechase was the best version of DotP, and that is only if you don't count the original Microprose version that 17 years ago blew this pathetic pile of crap out of the water.  This game is a shameless cash grab and unworthy of anyone's time.			"

												I a big fan of Magic ... This is very dispointing:Can't create a proper deck since you can only have 1 mystic, 2 rare, 3 uncommon or 4 common of a kind in you deck and collection . I do not see why their made it os but it doesn't work.The gameplay og graphics are okay But all in all ... It sucks ... still waiting for a proper magic in the online world			"

												Worst magic the gathering i've played in my 8 years of playing. Design that delays its so called feature that allow free building combined with blatant pay to win micro-transaction makes you feel nothing less than infuriated the whole time playing. Menu screams incompetence which nearly rivals sonic freerider menu. The range of deck that is available is very few unless you pay for shiny cards and unlockables are fewer than ever. Online feature sports less feature than any of the previous installments, If you are one of those duelers, good luck since lags and pause button abuse will make you want to play princess maker instead.

												I've seen a lot of negative reviews of this Magic game and there are some things that really annoy you. The microtransactions which don't actually explicitly tell you you're only paying to instantly unlock something you can actually unlock yourself ingame is one. Another is the difficulty setting essentially only changing how you and the opponent are drawing.I've had a problem with the menu system in the Magic games since the original. It's terrible and they really should study some other games and make it more intuitive and less obstructive.On the up side, you can make your own decks now which is what I wanted from the first game and all its followups. There is so much potential with Magic and how you play the actual ccg they could use to make a magnificent computer game with, but they're content at the moment to just remake the same game with a few tweaks each year and hope people fall for their dlc traps.After the backlash this latest iteration has received I hope they really go back and have a good think about how to make the next one something special.All that being said, I do recommend this game if it's on special. Don't buy the dlc, maybe the expansion if it is also on sale. If, like me, you enjoy trying new deck tactics and synergies and weird colour combinations then you'll enjoy it. You'll need to grind out the cards but that's not too long.			"

You will run over the campaign with some decent matches / strategy, and there will be always someone waiting on multiplayer 1v1.Great game even at full price. Only cons are♥♥♥♥♥♥menus target for consoles and lack of a detailed ""card text search"" when deck building.			"

												In all honesty, the developers did a lot of decent work in designing the new setup. There are a ton of improvements and a much more dynamic base in terms of the game itself. Sadly this came at a severe cost in that it's not very fleshed out. The game is more or less a simple shell, and while it has a lot of potential for future improvement it's currently just too bland to warrant playing for an extended period of time. There's just too little substance to keep you interested and there are a few frustrating flaws with the current layout such as an overly complex and somewhat slow menu UI and a long and tedious introductory phase to the game that denies you access to most of the game's features untiul you can beat the first major story section.

												I must say that this version of magic isn't that good, but still ok. I'd recommend the 2014 version to you instead.- They have added some free card packs for you to enjoy !- 2015 doesn't have a 2 headed giant mode (2 vs 2 for those that are new to this), and the 2014 version had it.- There are a few gitches and lags in the game for instance: if you choose the color of your first deck, scrolling with your mouse doesn't work. Except scrolling worked every other time in 2015, but not when choosing a color ?- The game forces you to play with a deck with 2 colors, i prefer 1 color at a time actually.- (I think the design of the cards of previous version were a lot nicer than those of the 2015 version)- I am still waiting on a version which lets character animations fight with each other when fighting, would be awesome wouldn't it ?- Be careful which deck you start with, as you can't change it.- Those white light backgrounds hurt your eyes a bit.The 2015 feels like a step backwards compared to the 2014 version, so if you like magic, buy the 2014 version ;)There are mixed reviews for this game. Magic 2015 is an ok game with some flaws yes, but it still plays as a magic game.Hardcore magic fans will get their annual satisfaction with this version, but I recommend the 2014 version to the newcomers.Thank you for reading & feel free to check out my other reviews.

												This is a good version. Combos are neat and accessible, it's worth to invest the money to unlock some cards. Decent campaign, fun multiplayer. It's much better then Origin and lot of players comeback to it and for good reasons.			"

												Having a blast with this although i do believe the AI cheats so ^^^^ bad sometimes. I am playing it on plains walker so i expect it to be hard but drawing the card you need every single time its needed is just ridiculous. All frustrations aside though it is really fun and i would recommend it just for the card library alone. I play magic duels origins as well and this has way more cards in this although i do believe the GUI on Magic Duels is a little cleaner but thats just me. still farming for some cards to build the decks i want but i should be .. only had the game 36 hours..

												The Good:It has a good appeal to Magic fans. With many ways to customize your deck and very smart AI. The different planes you go through are pretty cool and have there own unique challenges. It is great if your into the Magic mythos; it is a fan pleaser.The Bad:Once you unlock all the cards in your collection, then you'll be bored of this game. Your basically limited to some cards from the many different blocks. It would be better if the game had all the cards from all the blocks included in this game. I wanted to make an all enchantment deck from Theros, but I can't. Another thing is that you are restricted to how many cards your allowed in. For example, 4 commons, 3 uncommons, 2 rares, and 1 mythic rare. I don't mind much, but I do want four Quickens in my deck.The Ugly:The game is really laggy because you need a high grade processer in order to speed up the graphics. Multiplayer can be problematic when someone lags or you become disconnected constatly. If you are not a big fan of supreme lag and connection problems, then don't buy this game. "

												This is a great way to start if you have never played the card game and want to get started. If you have friends to play with it is better to just go buy the cards and play the real game. Still recommended for people who just want to try and see if they like it without having to buy a bunch of cards.			"

												I've commented on this game before, but it was the same as everyone else's critcism. So here's something different:This is a good game for those who have never played DotP before. You have a limited assortment of cards you can choose from, it helps you with building your own deck, and the card repetoire isn't filled with convoluted spells that might confuse beginners. They've since improved the ""pay to win"" premium packs and allowed players to win them in Multiplayer games. I think this was a wise decision, because it will fill the online servers with more players than it would've had before. The biggest critcism about the older DotP is you're stuck with the select decks given to you. You don't have much freedom with how the decks are built. The thing is, you're actually given a lot of choice with what you play: Want to play with Zombies? Here's a deck with 30 unlockable cards. How about Slivers? Cool, here you go. You are limited in what you can play in the decks, but if you're building a casual elven deck, are you going to play Llanowar Elves/Elvish Mystic? You probably are, so the game includes cards like that.They didn't allow you to play a ""powerful White/Green"" deck because they wanted each deck to have a theme. The problem this specific game faces is that it doesn't have any specific themes in the card repetoire given to you. You can try to make a mill deck, but there aren't enough good mill cards. A mono-red burn deck isn't viable because there are only one or two solid burn spells. Reanimation isn't worth it. You need to always play a well-balanced deck with a good amount of creatures complimented with some removal spells. That's the best deck you can make. While this game helps beginners build decks and understand what's a strong spell or not, experienced players will not enjoy the changes from 2014. There are far too many issues with the game itself to enjoy it.			"

												So many of the reviews I have read repeat the same points....but I have decided to post mine also as maybe a sort of therapy for myself.I have played every DotP since the original.  Last night I played through the 2015 tutorial all the way through.This is by far the worst release.  Awful, clunky interface.  Even experienced players have to grind through the tutorial to open basic functionality, such as multiplyer.  No Two Headed Giant.  Paper thin story line (as usual).  And no bank of premade decks to play with (I am talking about playing right away).The major enjoyment for me in this game USED TO BE easily and quickly customizing the many prebuilt decks, and then jumping into some 2HG games with my friends.  The many deck choices and options kept the matches fresh, at least until the next expansion came out.That enjoyment is gone.			"

												Two-Headed Giant game mode is gone. As of when I started playing this game (January 23, 2015), there was NO two-headed giant game mode to play co-op with a friend. The only reason I have been buying this series of game (the planeswalker series) is for the robust, co-operative two-headed giant mode.As of the 2015 version, two-headed giant is NOT included. If you are buying this to play co-operatively with a friend, DO NOT BUY IT, as the game mode is not there.			"

												Seriously, I purchased this to play the game and hopefully use my laptop for the foreseen future. I did not however intend to want to punch the screen of my computer in until not only the LED lighting but the screen itself shattered. This is a legitimate step DOWN from the tabletop game and possibly MTGO (which I did not like the layout and presentation for).Let's break this down:Beginning Content:After a quick click through tutorial for those who already know the game, you get to make your choice of colors. Then you can take it a step forward and pick a secondary color for the deck. Unfortunately it seems if you don't pick a specific color combination, you're going to be at a hopeless disadvantage. And it has to be the deck archetype that matches with that color. In my specific instance, I chose black with green as a secondary. That didn't last long either. And even after, you have nothing except the update content, which is next on the review.Update Content:Underwhelming, plain and simple. It seemed pretty obvious they were saying one thing when developing this. The black and red cards were practically screaming. While I found getting young pyromancer good, I still hated it. And it really isn't very tipping of the scales for the single player campaign. In general, the card packs seemed useless. When I saw these packs being put into the game from the Steam page for it, I was excited. Just to have the game s**t on me with a mediocre pool from sets I would be normally excited for.Single Player:Frustratingly stupid. Honestly. I must have had to change my deck layout 5 times to figure out the one thing that worked and even then, I had to get a lucky pull. On the first actual opponent post-tutorial. Seriously. Do people not understand that even knowing it's just a game, people get impatient and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off? Then you expect us to play against opponents that literally pull the same s**t the entire time? Every damn match? No matter what!? I refuse to play any more of this bulls**t and I'm still only in Theros fighting the god damned minotaurs! It doesn't help that the ""prize packs"" from each game don't give you a damn thing.Multiplayer:Nothing you haven't seen playing the physical game on a table. 3 games and I saw the exact same deck by 3 different players. Uhh. Standard Play? Seriously. The same ""Tier 1"" decks that you have no fighting against unless you pop the wallet out to give yourself a fighting chance.Actual Gameplay and Other Features:So the gameplay is the same as it's been for the DotP games. I feel the timer doesn't really add to the game but it also doesn't tale away. It just saves the time of hitting a button. But what I'm aiming at is the deck building layout. I personally never was a fan of how decks were built on these games and the limited and pointless pool of cards that don't do anything to improve your mood.Overall really. REALLY weak in a game that looked promising for a set full of high value cards. While it seems like the developers wanted to try giving you some help to fight the unfair odds with these added update contents, it just looks like a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥damage control hotline. Your starting deck seems even more limited even with these additions. The AI is frustrating and even if you know what's coming up, it feels like you're purposely screwed over with what card you draw. The tagline being used is enough to catch you but instead of ""Hunt Bigger Game"" it should be ""Hunt the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for 20 minutes trying to find the right deck""			"

												Even after reading all he comments I have decided to buy this game.Love the game, not to complicated, loads of free choice in building a deck and it feels balanced enough. For example in building your deck you are limited to:4 of each common3 of each uncommon2 of each rare1 of each mythicBecause of the above  the likeliness to make a 5 turn winning deck are low due to not being able to play uncommon, rare and mythic cards 4 times in a 60 card deck.This slows the game down a notch and let beginners learn magic, in a way they can fight back and enjoy magic.  I for one played some magic real live and some pre-release events.  But I still like this game  very much. But I can understand if you are used to playing legacy format this is to restricted and boring. Or if you like to play any other format than magic 1vs1 or 3 and 4 free for all. If that is the case this is not your game.If you want to play magic on some sort of even level for only the price of a couple of booster packs this is a great game with loads of cards to build a deck. In this version of Duels of the Planeswalkers you have no pre design you need to follow. You can build a deck with all cards in the game available no matter which colour or combination you play. There for It is a bit more free compared to DotP 2013 and 2014.To be able to play all cards you require the game magic 2015 and or the Garruk expansion or the Alara cards expansion.In Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013 and 2014 you where capable of building bigger, better, faster and stronger decks. In those older versions there was also support for other game formats like duel headed giant and sealed. DotP 2015 only supports 1vs1 or multiplayer free for all. Which makes DotP 2015 best choice for beginners and me for playing some fair magic against other people or the computer. Pro:Fair deck building chance.Great card choice.Like the fact you unlock boosters.Some interesting bot deck’s and moves.Great value for money  Cons:you have to buy and the game and a expansion to have access to all cards.No extra game modes "

												I'm a fan of Magic in real life. But this game doesn't capture any of the feeling. The user interace is terrible, it's difficult to make modifications to your deck, which is a shame because they decks they give you initially are pretty bad. It also doesn't help that the single player opponents' decks often completely outclass you. I have given up many times in frustration because the opponent played at least a rare card every turn, whule my deck only had maybe 3 in my entire deck. The way it feels right now, it feels like a poor man's Hearthstone. That's saying something considering that Hearthstone is free to play, while this set me back $20.			"

												Not a fan of paying for premium boosters, it should also be accessible through gameplay like after beating 100 players online.The online matchmaking is a bit unstable and slow.BUT, the deckbuilding element is a strong and good addition, the set of cards available is a bit too small so there's a lot of similiar decks out there, but before you unlock all the cards it's a good challenge to help decide what should go in and what should be left out of a deck.I still enjoy it too much even though the premium boosters were a lame move...UPDATEThe premium boosters will be unlockable throug playing as soon as the update hits! Now its worth the 10€.			"

												This is actually the best DOTP to date! I think its good that the bots can get amazing cards that you cant because it makes the game a challenge and thats what games are supposed to be. Sure, the game has a grindy nature but thats the point of duels. For those of you complaining about the in-game-purchases they don't do anything and can still be unlocked in game (premium boosters are now battle boosters and are unlocked by winning online matches which is good). The deck-building is amazing too as you can customize land (which is useful because the game liked to give yopu 30 lands in a 60 card deck :/) rating: 8/10 it misses out the last 2 by it not having 2HG :(			"

												I've not played much of this game, so perhaps it it just my limited experience, but this game seems to slow everything right down for no real reason.The UI is terrible, it takes ages to actually place a card, if I want to see what either mine or my opponent's cards, I need to click, then zoom in to see it, which fills up most of the screen, then click to zoom out. Instead of having a top down view of the mat, the game has a weird angled view of the gaming board. When your opponent plays a creature or a spell, it displays the card until you either click on the card, or on continue, then it takes a few seconds for the card to actually be placed on the mat. When you attack, the board opens up, slowing it down further. When you do choose to attack, you either have to hammer the continue key to get them to attack at anything other than a snail's pace.It seems the game has been slowed down for no real reason. If you look at MTG: 2014, it is quicker, this game is crazily slow compared to Hearthstone.			"

												Got this game as a preorder, because I'm a sucker for those. Opened up the game and was immediately blinded by the glaring white that this game has. Like every Duels game, it's covered in advertisements asking you to buy more cards both in-game and out of it. The campaign's fairly straight forward, and the deck creation's actually pretty fun. In a way, I enjoy it a bit more than DotP 2014's deck system, not because you get something more powerful but because you can do what you like and you're not stuck with those one or two decks that are straight up better than the rest. In summary, pros: Fun deck creation Decent incentive to beat everything in the form of boosters Plenty of extra battles, if not many interesting onesCons: Blindingly white No 2headed giant (2v2) Enemy AI is ashamedly stupid Enemy decks usually quite beefy to make up for it Plot is kinda dumb DLC even worseBuy Duels 2014 instead. It's a much more solid game, and probably far cheaper.			"

												The biggest addition to this over the previous versions of Magic are the create-a-deck feature. However, that is the only upside. Everything else, the game play, the cards, the strategy, was either equal to the 2014 version, or worse. If you're looking to play Magic, cards are always the ultimate best, but barring that go with Magic 2014			"

												Magic is always good right? No matter what its the best thing since gasping for air ... or so I thought! Actually the normal boardgame Magic is wonderful. This digital game however is not! It lets you build decks partly on the kind of cards your particular deck unlocks. This means different decks unlocks different cards to  keep the tactical advantage of building your deck OUT OF THIS GAME!Onto the verdict:+ Its Magic+ Relatively balanced starter decks - Obnoxious menu navigation ( I really mean it - the menu navigation really suck!

												Having a blast with this although i do believe the AI cheats so ^^^^ bad sometimes. I am playing it on plains walker so i expect it to be hard but drawing the card you need every single time its needed is just ridiculous. All frustrations aside though it is really fun and i would recommend it just for the card library alone. I play magic duels origins as well and this has way more cards in this although i do believe the GUI on Magic Duels is a little cleaner but thats just me. still farming for some cards to build the decks i want but i should be .. only had the game 36 hours..

												The Good:It has a good appeal to Magic fans. With many ways to customize your deck and very smart AI. The different planes you go through are pretty cool and have there own unique challenges. It is great if your into the Magic mythos; it is a fan pleaser.The Bad:Once you unlock all the cards in your collection, then you'll be bored of this game. Your basically limited to some cards from the many different blocks. It would be better if the game had all the cards from all the blocks included in this game. I wanted to make an all enchantment deck from Theros, but I can't. Another thing is that you are restricted to how many cards your allowed in. For example, 4 commons, 3 uncommons, 2 rares, and 1 mythic rare. I don't mind much, but I do want four Quickens in my deck.The Ugly:The game is really laggy because you need a high grade processer in order to speed up the graphics. Multiplayer can be problematic when someone lags or you become disconnected constatly. If you are not a big fan of supreme lag and connection problems, then don't buy this game. "

												So many of the reviews I have read repeat the same points....but I have decided to post mine also as maybe a sort of therapy for myself.I have played every DotP since the original.  Last night I played through the 2015 tutorial all the way through.This is by far the worst release.  Awful, clunky interface.  Even experienced players have to grind through the tutorial to open basic functionality, such as multiplyer.  No Two Headed Giant.  Paper thin story line (as usual).  And no bank of premade decks to play with (I am talking about playing right away).The major enjoyment for me in this game USED TO BE easily and quickly customizing the many prebuilt decks, and then jumping into some 2HG games with my friends.  The many deck choices and options kept the matches fresh, at least until the next expansion came out.That enjoyment is gone.			"

												I was glad that they gave the player the ability to build their own decks rather than using just prebuilt decks, like in previous iterations.  That is where my praise for the game ends.  The list of available cards is extremely limited & I found myself praising mediocre 1 drops for winning countless games.  That being said there are a few truly good cards at your disposal, if you are interested in purchasing digital booster packs with real world money.  The deck building rules for the game are too constricting and prevent players from developing decks that are actually fun and interesting to play.  You are allowed a full playset (4 cards) of commons, 3 copies of any given uncommon, 2 copies of a rare card, and only 1 copy of any mythic.  It is important to note that these deck building rules also only apply to players so the ai will be running full playsets of their win conditions at all times, if not more.  The single player campaign is incredibly sluggish and tedious.  You will more than likely find yourself playing the same match over and over again because your bargain bin control deck and limited removal power just can't answer that 5th mythic rare bomb the ai dropped.  This game is terrible.  Save your money.  Play Hearthstone.  Not kidding.			"

												Again, the gameplay is bugged. Still the same bugs appearing (freezing up in the middle of spellcasting) that have been in the game since the 2013 version. It would seem to me that these kind of bugs should have been found and solved before the release.Also the unlocking of cards is kind of random now, whereas in older versions you could more easily play the decks (colours) you'd want and unlock the cards a bit faster. The new ""battle boosters"" seem to be more or less random, which makes it more like ""real"" magic. But that was never really the point in this arcade type of game.Oh well. bought it for some gaming and didn't expect much. It is really a shame that the bugs (which cost me a perfectly winnable game at least twice, possibly more) are still in the game.			"

												As a new player to Magic, I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into when I pre-ordered this iteration of the series. So far, I am happy with my purchase. Magic 2015 is my first experience playing Magic and I am happy to be playing. I understand the gripes of the (future) DLC, as can be represented by Magic 2014, yet, a Premium/Gold edition is sure to come out in a year at a greatly reduced rate. While this shouldn't be the case, for beginners, Magic 2015 so far seems like a great stepping stone, but buyers should perhaps buy previous complete Magic games before purchasing 2015 at full price (I hear 2013 is fan-favored). In addition, problems with UI are greatly exaggerated. It has some clunkiness to it, and if I click slightly too early I have to click again to enter an area. It could be better, but don't let that stop you from picking up Magic 2015.			"

												Magic 2015 so far has been alright.(Personally I'd wait for Discount or Expansions)Lets get into this review shall we?- Few Problems        Crashes <--- This is happening to alot of users.                   #1 Turn off AntiVirus (Or add the game to exceptions list)                   #2 Verify Game Cache                   #3 Go into the config.cfg file located in 'steamapps/common/magic 2015' (roughly) and change                         ""[aamode] 0"" and ""[vsync] 0"". You can also change the resolution to your actual screen resolution.                         (Don't ask why this works~ For some people it just does).                   #4 If all else fails Redownload / Submit ticket to steam support.        Lack of Two Headed Giant (WTF WHY WOULD YOU REMOVE THIS?!?).        Cards aren't really balanced... Theres alot of really game-breaking crap in this one                   ((Which is why I suggest waiting for expansions))        Loading Flipping Screens. Whoever decided that there needs to be a loading screen         ...or an advertisement between EACH AND EVERY SCREEN.. Needs to be thrown in a room with Garruk.       Lack of Return to Lobby (Game throws you back to main menu after a game).       ^ If your playing with friends THIS SUCKS SO FREAKEN MUCH.Ok Ok Now that the Rants Done.. If you can get past all this other crap... the games actually fun.The cards workThe Effects workIt looks ShineyThe Campaign is amazing. Its Both challenging and lengthy. It allows you to do 2/3/4 player matches now. Lots of deck customisation. (not locked to pre-constructed decks). Honestly I'm having fun with this game. I do recommend it but If you want optimal Fun to cash ratio... Wait for it to go on sale or an expansion to come out.			"

												You can agree with the not recommended reviews, you can agree with the recommended reviews.This however will be a recommended review (as you can see) that I think you should highly agree with.Worth the money?Let me start by saying, I'm decently new to magic. Only about 16 hour on DotPW 2014 and a few paper decks to play casually with friends. After buying the amount of paper cards I have. I can say this game is far worth $10. For $10 you can get two $4 boosters and a few 50 cent cards. Thats less than 40 cards with the potential to get doubles. This game gives you around 300 cards to choose from. (around 1000 if you include doubles). So its easily EASILY worth the money.Worth the money compared to paper magic covered.Pay to win?Now, this game has preium boosters. Cards that can only be obtained through extra purchases AFTER buying the game. I think you can buy 12 boosters before having all the cards. I got 2 for preordering and owning magic 2014. This is a VERY small amount of cards from the overall pool. If you don't want to play this game because you can't/dont want to afford the extra boosters. If you think thats bad, have fun learning paper magic against people who will spend $1000s on thier decks.These cards are NOT overpowered. Yes. they'll help make a good deck, but also, you can already make enough good decks. I have won and lost against people with and without premium cards. You can do just as well with someone who has the premium cards without them. They just add extra play styles / synergies to be used to your liking. Not pay2win covered.So its worth $10... Just becuase it gives you a lot of bang for your buck doesn't mean its good...My review of this game. The best part about this game is the card pool. The card pool that everybody has access to. The same cards are owned by all the same players. Nobody got lucky with a mythic rare in the booster pack. Every online duel I've been apart of has been extremly close and fair fights, other then when I screw up! (Like I said, pretty new to magic) The reason I'm giving this game a thumbs up is because. It feels VERY balanced. I absolutely love how close almost all the duels are. Sometimes you do really good, sometimes you do really bad. sometimes a simple one versus one duel can last almost an hour of teeth grinding anticipation of what the card in your enemies hand is. Like  I mentioned earlier, nobody can spend $1000 on a deck, eveybody has the same cards, and it truly is a WONDERFUL competitive experience for people who enjoy card games. Along with the balanced aspect of this game, I have yet to encounter anybody rude in this game, people willing to talk and even sometimes people who inform you on how to get better and when they see you make a bad move instead of just taking advantage of the situation, they will even inform you on your ""mistake"" if you will, and teach you how to get better MID-GAME. The people who are trying to beat you will HELP you get better AS THEY PLAY YOU!!! That's unheard of from other multiplayer games I've played. I really hope all negative reviews  slowly fall from the front page. This game is really fantastic.			"

												There are so many bad reviews of this game, it's ridiculous.  Most of it is about petty stuff overblown.  For some you'll have to go into the config file and change the defaults for display.  I had to do that with all the Magic for PC releases.  It's not something outside the average PC gamer's accumen to have to open the config file in notepad and change resolution, fullscreen, or refresh rate so that the game opens properly.  It's also not uncommon to have to complete a tutorial (for which they reward you with with a few cards.), or have to complete at least the first tier of campaign to get access to your premium unlocks or boosters.  That being said, if you bought the complete bundle your collection was stocked the moment you defeat Avycyn at the end of the first tier of the campaign.   It's so well stocked in fact that there's almost no use in buying premium boosters.  There were more than enough cards to build many good decks.  So i was relieved to not be riddled with microtransactions.  I don't see where people who buy premium boosters will have much advantage over anyone who had bought the complete bundle, or were patient enough to slowly unlock it all in the campaign.   Bottom line...buy the complete bundle, and pay to play issues won't be a problem.  Many complaints were also out about having a starter deck at first.  Once you've finished the first tier you can go build custom decks from scratch from the collection.  Plenty of cards for good decks, and cards in decks share to other decks automatically.  The deck builder is decent and filterable.  If you don't like some aspects of the interface and ai (like auto lands or lengthy animations) the settings panel lets you turn them off. Aside from not having customizable backgrounds, and acknowledging no mp 2hg... i'd say this edition has lost little and gained much.  Deckbuilding and multiplayer make this worth the price at the complete bundle...cheaper than buying real cards.  If you liked the last edition, or just enjoy MTG, then this is pretty awesome after about an hour of tutorial and tier 1 of campaign.  I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars...			"

												Underrated, over-bashed, under-appreciated.Try before you buy. Decide for yourself.I have played Dotp 2012, 2013, and 2014, and this one was so much better than the others, I actually had to buy it.The deck building was an amazing addition that has been a long time coming. I love to design and build decks, it's what I did IRL, and with the underwhelming card pool of the up-coming Standard, I am more than happy to see the card pool available in this digital version.Speaking of card pools, many complain it is too small, fact of the matter is though, there are MANY more good cards than ""useless"" cards in the card pool, if you were to add in the number of ""useless"" or ""underwhelming"" cards that you get in a core-set release, the card pool would be well into the thousands.Whilst the ""bundles"" are wasted money(unless you ONLY care about online and don't want to play single player to unlock the cards), there is ""Premium Cards"" you can pay for(I didn't), I have played against premium decks online, and they seem to be balanced well. You CAN pay for premium content, but you don't NEED to in order to win. Something for everybody.I am usually reluctant to pay the price of games, and many times, simply refuse to play the game due to the cost. However, Magic 2015 is well priced enough that you will easily get your money's worth if MTG is your thing. I would highly recommend this to any MTG Fanatic or Casual Player.The in-match user interface is also one of the best in the series, not to mention runs smoother and faster. The downside is, they STILL use the stupid scrolling menu system that is STILL clunky.In short, don't believe the bad reviews, take a look and decide for yourself.			"

												For beginner Magic The Gathering players I recommend this game. It introduces you to both pre-built decks with the chance to customise them or create an entirely new one by yourself. Due to the limited card pool it also makes initial decision making for combos etc a lot easier however as an advanced player it will be the less obvious combos that win you games. The campaign is relatively easy but can get tricky if a viable deck is not being used which is understandable for any campaign. It can be a bit tedious to get all the cards but it adds more satisfaction when you collect every single one. Even if you get bored there is still achievments, avatars and titles which can be unlocked through gameplay. However with all of these positives I don't however recommend this for veteran players unless you enjoy a limited card pool. There are also frequent glitches that cause me to exit the game when navigating menus every 30-60 minutes. I myself thoroughly enjoy the game and like finding those combos and deck combinations that most others will miss.			"

												Would not have recommended before the change to ""premium boosters"" (now ""battle boosters""). There are no longer cards you have to spend money to acquire (aside from the Alara cards in the Garruk's Revenge expansion). The cards that previously came in a Premium Booster are now unlocked by beating players in online multiplayer.UI is certainly sluggish, and when the stack gets a few spells on it it can be difficult to target the permanent you want with the mouse. Gameplay is right on par with the 2014 version, but the ""set"" seems to have more instants and creatures with effects than 2014. Being able to build your own deck(s) is a feature that should've been included for a long time now, and the loss of 2HG, or Sealed, or Planechase (etc etc) is not worth this feature, but it is fun to have ""your"" deck and open cards in boosters that would be perfect for it.

												It is the Games first good attempt at multiplayer custom decks... As far as I am concerned they did a decent job... still has some bugs and the game needs small tuning, like the ability to switch your deck while in a session with another player without having to leave the multiplayer connection.. they also need to add the 2 headed giant game mode and a planeswalker game mode would be nice as well. as these are not implemented into the game, hopefully soon they will... There also needs to be more at stake within the multiplayer matches such as anting up a rare card of your collection and loosing it for good if you lose, as alot of players like to prematurly leave matches at the slightest twinge of anxiety. and thet ALSO need to get rid of the computer taking over for said quitters when they rage quite. Other then these percpectives the game is very well constructed and I am glad to see fully customizable decks introduced into multiplayer matches.			"

												The fact you can now build your own decks... is GREAT. People complaining that you're stuck with a color you choose in the beginning, obviously haven't explored the game enough. Other than removing 2 headed giant from multiplayer, it's a solid game. Great game.			"

												Before we begin: I bought the basic game version in which you have to unlock everything, and my review is based on that. At time of this posintg I have 90% of cards unlocked, and I've played plenty of multiplayer.Short answer: 7/10. The core of the game delivers as promised, but certain aspects of the UI need polish, and certain design desicions will upset people.Pros-Full deck customisation: You can choose exactly what cards from your collection you want in the deck, with full 5 color support if you so choose. You can add lands in any combintion. The editor even lets you do stupid things like add Islands to an all red deck. The editor stat breakdown make things like your mana curve and color wighting clear.-AI knows what it is doing: the AI is fantastic, easily on par with DotP 2014 but entirely capable of dealing with the literally infinite combination of deck designs-Match UI performance improvement: The playfield UI responds much better. There is no real framerate lag to be had, unlike previous games.-Card collecting mechanic: You are rewarded bosters for single player or multiplayer matches. Cards are obtained in random boosters, however the game ensures it does not give you card you cannot use (like a 5th copy of the same common). This makes the grinding relatively painless as you dont end up with hundreds of dead cards. As a result the grind is the least severe of all DotP games.Cons:-Out of game UI is horrible: There is no persistent multiplayer lobby. You cannot change decks while in a multiplayer lobby. Menu transitions are incredibly slow for no apparent reason due to a weird 'fade to white' transition effect. All of these are direct steps backward from 2014 and are very unlikely to get fixed. All in all this adds a lot of annoyance to playing.- No cards for losing multi: This is mostly a quality of life thing, but you cannot earn cards for say losing x matches in multi, or even coming second in a 4 player game. This forces you to grind away in single player just to be competative. It makes getting new people involved in the game difficult-Certain game modes missing: This is not so much an issue for me as others, but sealed deck and Two-Headed Giant modes are both gone, and man is the internet butthurt about it. A lot of the negative opinion of the game is being generated by this point alone.-Some cards only obtainable through real cash transaction, or not obtainable at all: AI have cards in their decks you cannot collect, and odd choice considering it would literally be flicking a switch to make them obtaininable in a booster (they would have to be fully coded for the AI to use them). Some cards only accesible by RMT, and then its randomised booster. Since you cannot collect junk copies of cards you'd need to spend about 30 bucks on premium boosters to get everything. A lot of negative community opinion is that this is P2W, but frankly its not a big deal, the cards arent essential.All in all, the game is fantastic, but definitely read up on the difference in features before making a purchase. If you don't care about two headed giant and like the single player AI, then you will definitely like this game.			"

												Now that I've unlocked all the cards and played a few rounds of online with other people, I felt like writing up a review for this since it's a drastic departure from the other Duels games.The presentation of the game is wonderful. I like the new look, but like every previous entry it still suffers from being slow. The menus are slow, the game is slow for the first turn or two once you get into a game, and navigating menus is quite bothersome due to how many sub menus you sometimes have to click through to get where you want to be.Deck building has at long last arrived. That would be a good thing, if they didn't try stretching a 298 card list to cover a basic archtype for each color pairing. While there can be some crossover between different archtypes, most cards will fall into a very specific subset that it places the deck building process on a set of rails. Do you want to build a graveyard themed green/black deck? You can do that, but there are only a handful of cards that will really make this type of deck work. The deck building process is so limited that I almost would say there are preconstructed decks. Still, at least they give us the illusion of choice, right?The campaign itself is very fun. I was thrilled to see that they had added cutscenes. (Hey, Wizards! I'd still like to see a computer animated Magic movie!) The campaign inserted a few battles akin to the challenges from the previous entry which I feel really helped break up the campaign some instead of playing either regular duels or the challenges.I'm a long time Magic player so the initial difficulty didn't seem to affect me, but I had a couple friends try this out as an introduction to Magic and both have been struggling with the initial tutorial. The beginning decks are absolute garbage with very weak creatures and very little to no synergy between them, making the first real duel a struggle. I had to step in and tell one friend what to do turn by turn and apply some more advanced understanding of Magic to help them beat the first red/green deck at the end of the tutorial. That's absolutely inexcusable, especially when it's set to the easiest difficulty. Finally, let's talk about the elephant(s) in the room.People are absolutely infuriated that they decided to put in premium packs. Yes, I understand that every other Duels game you paid $10 and got to play and eventually unlock everything. And yes, the premium packs could have costed $0.50 or $1, but then I started thinking that no matter what, this game is still a far less expensive investment than paper Magic or MTGO. And if you don't want to pay for the premium packs? Don't! There are only a select few cards that I could argue are reasonably worthwhile from the premium packs anyway. Squadron Hawks, Think Twice, Hall of Triumph, Skullcrack, Stoneforge Mystic, and Kozilek are the only things in there that are generally useful. The rest are win more cards and junk that wouldn't make the cut in a highly optimized deck anyway.2HG was removed from the game. While I'm bummed about it, it doesn't change that I'll get about as many hours out of this as I would any of the previous Duels. If this is the *only* mode you enjoy playing I would definitely stay away.Speaking of things being removed I was disappointed to see that we didn't get any gimmicky format. Conspiracy had released recently so I was almost expecting to get that in here. Alas, all we have are duels and FFA multiplayer.Now, I know I just got done listing off a whole bunch of things wrong with the game, but overall, it's about what I expect from any other Duels game. It's something to play a few games of casual Magic with and to get friends into Magic (though you should help them with that first tutorial fight so they can start unlocking cards and replace the trashy deck). To everyone else who are looking for more formats, more cards, and higher challenges come join me on MTGO!			"

												rofl this turned hilariously pay to win good luck getting through campaign with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ commons your only viable option is to churn out another 20 bucks to these jews in order to  unlock all the cards gg wp Magic. Also if your a veteran Magic DoTP player then look away this game is definatley catering to noobies with  literally a FORCED tutorial and  obnoxius tips and hints [i selected A lot when it asked how much m,agic i played stop this tips and hints crap already] and worst of all the deck customization is a COMPLETE letdown of all the good cards that are in cirrculation right now you get NONE of them instead you get to pick the unwanted crappy commons most players use as coasters/toilet paper  dont expect to have fun with actually INTERESTING decks like [ the ones they give the NPC's] rakdos ,mono black devotion bounce and burn or blue mill. The cards that you get have ZERO synergy with one another but your just expected to throw all the ""stronk"" cards[ a 3/3 vainlla for 4 mana inst strong and you know it] into a deck i found myself constantly jealous and envious of the NPC's decks in story mode it it hurt even more knowing id never be able to duplicate them due to poor selection of cards also btw due to♥♥♥♥♥♥cards dont expect to beat the story mode any time soon unless you buy the DLC'sTL;DR  -2/10 save your money for the next one hopefully theyll actually listen to the community this time			"

												I like the deckbuilding freedom that this version allows. The cards you start off with are not super, but I was able to beat the campaign without having to spend any money. I unlocked a lot more cards along the way, so now I have enough to make several decks that can win games. I think this game is perfect for a casual MtG player who likes deck building but only wants to spend $10.			"

												For a person interested in getting into MTG then i would say this is a good buy. You get to learn at a good pace and see what range of cards, abillites, and focuses there are and to pick 1 or 2 that you feel comfortable in without buying a deck and finding out that you don't suit the colour or focus that deck has. It also gives you an introduction into building a deck form scratch and if you are looking to get into MTG properly then it is an invaluable skill which should be learnt.As for the experienced MTG players out there this game would only act as another base on which to play, but with the added restrictions of the cards avalible in which to build a deck from.On the whole I think it is a nice starting point for people looking to get into the Magic universe and a good place to learn and play about with the 2015 set so it gets a thumbs up from me.

												I'm a sucker for MTG. I'm a little disapointed in the absensce of puzzles in this iteration, but the enemy decks are fairly challenging. And it's always nice when you have full deck-building capabilities. Even though I'm a frequent flyer at MTGO, I always relish a relaxing single player session as opposed to a frustrating♥♥♥♥♥♥whoopin' to some guy who spent 1000 bucks on a deck. But hey....that's Magic. I think the most useful aspect of the Duels of the Planeswalkers series is that it acts as far less intimidating jumping off point for those who want to learn the game in an economical way. For seasoned players, you may not care much for MTG 2015. But for those who can't resist all things Magic, then this version will keep you busy for a while.			"

												Despite the endless stream of complaints, I've been enjoying this game immensely. The base game is well worth the $10 price, and if you want to play competitively online you can buy the additional boosters for a reasonable price (I haven't felt the need to do so, and they have already said there will not be more premium cards in future DLC). The added deck builder really distinguishes this game from the others in this series, and I am learning a ton about Magic deck building as a result. I will easily put 100+ hours into this game just like last year's version. Definitely recommended for those interested in digital card games!			"

YES... we need much more cards, certainly! That's why we need to pressure the devs to lauch DLCs with a consistent number of more cards (400 to 500 in each future DLC would be awesome).			"

												As You Will See I Have Only Played 3 - 4 Hours But I Feel That My Opinion Has Been Formed And Will Stay This Way For Sometime. You Will Find The Reasons For This Below =-DAfter Reading Other Peoples Reviews Of This Game I Didn't Have High Expectations As Everyone Said It Had Some Major Flaws. Although I Think Is Have Some Problems None Of Them Affect The Gameplay Itself And The Pros Outweigh The Cons.I Am Massively enjoying This Game Compared To Magic 2014 As The Implemented Feature Of PERSONAILSED DECK CUSTOMISATION Has Changed This Digtal Game Franchise Massively. Although It May be Just To Compete With Blizzards Card Game HEARTHSTONE, They Have Executed It Rather Well In My Opinion. Some Of The Newer Cards And Some Of The Synergy Is Pretty Incredible.It Brings A Refreshing New Section To The Game To Which Has Usually Just Been A Re-Release Of The Same Game Year After Year.The Single Player Is Longer And More Enjoyable As It Feels The AI Is Now Alot Smarter And Makes Matches Harder Which is Definately A Good Thing As The Older Magics ( 2014 And Earlier ) Were Fairly Easy.And Now Onto The Only Con I Have Really Found. THE MENUS. THEY ARE VERY SLUGGISH TO TRAWL THROUGH. But Other Than That It's An All Round Superb Game. For Just £6.99 It It Such Great Value In My Opinon. Especially With The New Features.Anyway, A Short Review Of The Things That Stood Out To Me. I Know Other People May Disagree With The Above But THEY ARE WRONG. Lol Jokes. But Seriously It's Rather Enjoyable And I Foresee Much More Replayablility Than The Other Magics. "

												Update for the 26/11/2014So the new dlc is out, got some nice cards with it but same problems i had when it first came out.Lots of lovely cards at the AI's disposal but you have no access to them? I mean these cards are clearly in the coding, so why not let me unlock them in game? So many times i fight a deck that has loads of cards perfect for my deck but i cant use them becuse there not in the ""collection"".Then there is the ""top decking"" nature of the AI. Always seems to have the perfect card to screw you.Still looking for cards from Magic 2014 as well, please please please give us a dlc for that.Still a 7 out of 10, i'd recommend but you are going to feel the same frustration i have.Original reviewWhat can i say, its a good game but it feels lacking again, just like the previus ones in the same way. I want more cards, not some poxy collection of genericly good cards with some pre ordaned deck types.Im happy to recomend it but its distinctly 7 out of 10. Yes you may have added a deck builder, but its boring when there are no fun cards to work with. I'm finding myself looking for cards from Magic 2014 that havnt been put in the game, and crying a little inside when i find there not in the ""collection"". That coupled with the fact the ai can seem very 1 sided in boss fights, yea no.I hope there will be some sort of updates to make it much more enjoyable.			"

												As somone who has not played MTG in a few years i found this game to be amazing. The deck creation tool gives you a very underrated amount of freedom. I think the micro transactions are a better option for some players, but for those who want to spend their time grinding through the planes and collecting cards the booster reward system is a very rewarding experience. I suggest to pick a random deck at the start, I began with blazing intellect and lost to vampires over and over again. After a couple of booster packs your options really start to open up. After finishing the first plane you should be able to craft more than one duo colored deck. They will be mediocre at first but over time you will find yourself building and tweaking decks for specific encounters. This game is seriously extreme.			"

												Bought this game for the sole purpose of playing against my wife. The amount of hoops you have to jump through to be allowed to play multiplayer games is ridiculous. I've played MtG for a decade, so I was already annoyed that I couldn't skip the tutorial, and then to figure out we both have to beat the stage 1 boss before we can do multiplayer was very frustrating. Games should not be frustrating. Uninstalling this game now and going back to MtG 2014! Very disappointing!			"

												     MTG 2015 is a net gain of zero for Wizards of the Coast.  In a nutshell, the expanded deck builder and revamped multiplayer came at the expense of playability and variety.  The DOTPW series remains a better option than traditional MTG or MTG online for players who don't want a large investment of time and money, but it is far from perfect.The Good:MTG 2015 did and excellent job on the deck builder/booster packs.  Booster packs are now earned following most campaign and multiplayer matches, and the set complements the base decks very well.  The multiplayer mode is much improved in terms of speed and reliability.  Unfortunately, the planechase and two-headed giant modes have not been replaced, but the faster gameplay is a welcome improvement.  Pay-to-play is still present, but has been scaled back to allow success without additional spending.The Bad:The user interface and menus are fashioned after a tablet OS.  Regardless of your gear, it responds as a touchscreen tablet would: slow, stuttered, and at times unresponsive.  Visually, it is appealing (provided you maximize the graphics), but after a few minutes of navigating the menus you won't care.The mandatory tutorial would be bearable were it not for the voiceover.  Think nagging mother meets special education.The Ugly:One of the most frustrating themes of the series is an apparent lack of play-testing.  MTG 2015 is no exception; browse the forums and you will see thread after thread lambasting Wizards of the Coast for their shoddy execution.  Beyond the more obvious glitches, a number of poor choices in button  placement and user interface render the gameplay clumsy, yet unforgiving.  One of the more glaring oversights is the continue button: as your main phase comes to an end, the continue button becomes the skip attack button.  This sort of haphazard design should never have made it into the final product.The Funny?:The script is hilarious.  I'm sure this wasn't their intention, but it is laughably bad.  The best part about beating the game was the three minutes of mouth-breathing, sophomore attempts at fantasy writing.  The game is worth beating, if for no other reason than hearing this gem of a script.When all is said and done, the game is still worth its price.  For $10, you get access to a wide variety of cards and decks, all of which can be used in an improved multiplayer.  The user interface and gameplay seem to have regressed in functionality, but the game looks good.  Gameplay issues aside, DOTPW remains a quicker and cheaper alternative to other MTG venues.  Consider this title recommended with reservations.			"

												I really like magic 2015. Specially to play with friends! I have seen no bugs so far at all in 2015, as 2013 would get stuck sometimes after a long battle wich would be pretty annoying. I love the option to make youre on deck just the way YOU want it. It feels much more real for me. Ive seen crazy combo's and ive made some lovely decks myself. The only minor point is the micro transactions and that you have to do the first campain before you can go multiplayer. On the other hand it makes ppl practice before they start multiplaying...wich also seems fair. Choose the started deck well cos youre gonne be stuck for it for at least the first campain.  *Kitsuneki salute*			"

												3 out of 5. Best if used on a system for gaming, or newer maching 3 years or less.  May need to upgrade the video card otherwise. Minor bugs, and no 2HD, but still fun for casual play w/ friends who you can't normally play w/ face-to-face.Easy Acheivement hunting. makes for a fun day of gaming.			"

												Well the game is like the others, which is good. BUT not only is the menu swapping slow as crap, but they took out 2-Headed Giant.....FAIL!!! Was also expecting this to follow the actual game itself for once, if you call this Magic2015, then make it that, dont include cards from many sets that are not even valid in standard. Theros and its expansion sets should have been the only ones included, and then add DLC as the 2015 sets come out. "

												This game has obvious flaws but most games do.One of the best features about this game, is that you can customize your own decks. However, this can be an issue for some people because of a few reasons.1. There really aren't a lot of cards to choose from. (Not really a bad thing in my opinion but it does limit your deck building options.)2. Token creature spam. I hate token creature spam. I've played Magic since revised edition and stopped playing a while ago because of some new mechanics I thought were stupid. This was one of them.3. People feel like they have to buy premium boosters. ( More on that in a minute )One of the worst things about this game is choosing a pre constructed deck for the first part of the campaign until you unlock the deck builder. These decks have a TINY description with absolutely no listing as to what cards are containded in them. It wasn't hard going through the first part of the campaign with it, I just would have liked to know what I was getting to make a better choice at the beginning.Premium boosters:You don't have to buy these. I've read a few reviews in here, saying that the only way you can win multiplayer is buying these. Sure, there are good cards in those packs but its not putting you at a disadvantage if you don't buy them. At least in my opinion. It all depends on what kind of deck your attempting to build.Not to mention, most new games cost $50-$60 now. This one is $10. If you spend another $10-$15 on premium boosters, your still no where near what most games cost these days. Its not like this is one of those games where you have to dump hundreds of dollers into it. I'm going to recommend this game for people that like MTG. Its ten bucks and worth a try. If you have to think hard about spending $10 on a game....you probably should get a job or manage your money better and spend it on bills or food.R.I.P. Two headed giantEdit: Now that I have quite a few more hours into the game, there is one thing I have noticed. This thing makes the game extremely unenjoyable. While playing multiplayer, 90% of the time as soon as an opponent realizes that victory is not 100% certain, they quit.  I've had people quit out of the game while still at 20 health and 7 turns in !!! This is MTG people. The draw gods can be cruel. Deal with it and grow up. If the game is definately lost I can understand a gg and concede but just because you aren't getting the cards out of your deck you want when you want them, isn't a good reason to quit. I swear games aren't bad, its the people who play them that make them bad.			"

												Adding the fully customized decks was the only positive thing that this iteration of Duels of the Planeswalkers did.  One step forward, five steps back.  Lets start off with this:  The starting decks are horrendously bad.  Especially considering some of the decks of the AI opponents that you have to face, which borderline on overpowered.  Not to mention that the AI cheats quite frequently.Then, there is the attrocious UI.  Very unresponsive.  It's common to have to push a button two or three times to get the menus to work.  Then there is the completely unecessary network of mini menus.  It's a horrible system they developed all because this game is an Android port.I would actually recommend the 2013 version far above this horrible game.

												Very disappointed in this game. You either get way too much mana or not enough. Your opponent goes first most of the time and the game play is very predictable. It's very hard to beat Garruk and when you do you have to beat him again? It took me long enough to beat him once since he gets the perfect cards every time. Beating him twice is very frustrating and nearly impossible. Not to mention if you want to get in or out of the game you gave to go though 5-6 clicks to do either.			"

												As it is the first Duels of the Planeswalkers to really focus on building your own decks, releasing you from merely playing pre-constructed decks or that poorly implemented draft mode of 2014. I'd reccommend this game to anyone interested in MTG, and fans of the series.Cards are unlocked randomly through 'boosters' won by beating certain opponents in the game. Opponents from a specific plane will earn you boosters from that plane. (Ex. Innistrad challenges get you Innistrad boosters.) With enough games, you will eventually unlock them all, as there is a set amount that you can get of each card, usually varying on their rarity. While the card pool could always be more expansive, and therefore, better, the available cards selection is already pretty good in the base game, something I imagine they will add onto as they release DLC throughout the year.I would not, recommend buying any of the 'unlock' DLC, for it merely allows you to use all the cards you can easily open up for free by actually playing the game. Another Con would be the lack of planeswalker cards (despite the name) , and the lack of any new modes, much like the previous three years introduced. But For only $10, and the ability to make your own decks, I think this is worth a purchase.			"

												So I've gotten a decen amount of time with this game, and I'm going to say its far an away an improvement over the previous styles of the game. First I'll get my main gripes out of the way.1. No Two Headed Giant multiplayer mode. This was a great game mode, no idea why they didn't include it, it was in the two last versions of the game. Just plain, WTH?2. The menu system/UI. There is a lot of animation and blur effects while navigating meus that are unskippable and take time. Basically 5-8 seconds to go from one menu to the next section. It's annoying at it's worst. Also there is a blur/field of focus effect in game that makes cards illegible unless you zoom in on them. It can take 15-20 seconds to back out of all the menus far enough to quit out of the game. Also just annoying but not game breaking.3. The sopratic advertisement for the MtG 2015 core set. They will flash this ad at you in game, maybe 1 out of 5 matches that you launch. It's mildly annoying.4. No more creating a deck of 40-100 cards. All decks have to be 60 cards. Not sure why they did this.5. No longer a ""random deck"" option during a match. I used to love having it pick a random deck to play with.6. Premium Boosters. So they're geting into the pay to win category with this. (Given that the physical card game is quite inherently pay to win) But you pay 2 dollars to get a booster of powerful premium cards you can't unlock otherwise. This is bound to♥♥♥♥♥♥off other opponents online if you play with decks relying on these cards.7. There are key vital cards missing from MtG 2014, that the NPC players will use against you, like Rampant Growth, and the artifacts that heal you for each color card you play. (Maybe they will get added to the Premium card collection later?)Everything else is golden, it's basically the Magic game I always wanted them to make. You no longer ""unlock decks"" and then grind through 40 wins with that deck to access all its available cards, and then customize the deck with only the deck specific cards. All that is gone. Now you start with a premade decks, and with every win you get a booster that earns you cards to your collection. Then you can go an make a custom deck from your collection, with NO LIMITATIONS! Build any damn deck you want, you're no longer trapped in premade template decks. Also the Sealed Deck concept is gone, because this new way of custom decks makes it obsolete. I've read reviews complaining that there is less in this game than previous iterations. When it comes to Two Headed Giant I agree. And yes the Challenge mode is gone, but to me I couldn't care less, it was a silly thing, a puzzle game made from magic cards that was all about precision timing. Everything else, is a consolidation into a more functional and efficient format. It's kinda like arguing that 1 lb of popcorn is more better than 1 lb of gold, because it has much more volume. Volume doesn't mean value, and this game has more value. Previous versions had the ""grind"" as I described to unlock every card in a deck, and this game has a grind too, but it is much more pleasant. It is the grind to unlock as many cards as you can to complete your collection. You're now unlocking cards that go into your universal collection that you can use in any number of custom decks. That makes tham way more valuable, and you time way better spent unlocking them than in previous games. Overall: 9/10			"

												I was expecting more from this game considered how Magic 2014 was. But in my opinion the game has some good and bad parts.pros:- you can create your deck how you want to , you will not have that feeling like when you have a limited deck like in Magic2014 and you see a great card in an other deck that fits in your deck but you can't add it. in Magic2014 when you fight an opponent and see the first card he plays you immediatly know what deck he uses.- now the card collection is farmed faster , you get a booster with 10 cards not just 1 card like Magic 2014- in multi-player i saw you don't receive boosters so if you play with your friends will not matter who wins that much. in Magic 2014 the winner receives a card , so you want to win at all costs.- same price- less overpowered cards like ""destroy all creatures , destroy all creatures and destroy all creatures for a cheap cost"" and other cards like Primordial Hydracons:- the interface moves slow..- you have to buy some boosters to finish the collection but you dont receive copies of maxed cards so its a bit of a good stuff here also- they removed 2 vs 2 option but still if you play with a friend you can communicate to not attack each other			"

												**First off, I've beaten the game, and I play every battle on Planeswalker difficulty (the hardest)**This game is one that takes some getting used to.  First off, you get to choose a starting deck to begin with, and you can only use those colors, and that deck until you've cleared the first plane (which is Innistrad btw).  Then, after you defeat Avacyn, you can access any other cards you've unlocked (like I did after purchasing the complete edition).Once you've done that, you can explore the plane you were just on (which is the first option in the plane list, but it doesn't unlock until you've beaten the plane's boss), and get boosters from that plane to add to your card pool.Then, the game gets a bit more fun.Now, they removed 2 headed giant, but I never really played that variation, and if you go back to Magic 2014, that was one of the main things, because you team up with Chandra to fight the main enemy, so that was kind of their thing.I'm sure it'll be added at some point, but until then, the game gives you the option to make your own deck, which is a very nice change, instead of just modifying another precon that is still limited in what you can add.The game itself plays solid, although sometimes the flashy screens do require multiple clicks to get it to register, which can be frustrating.As for the gameplay, I've noticed that your difficulty does affect how the opponent reacts.  On the easier ones, I've noticed they will sometimes not attack even if they can get a clear shot through, while on the harder ones, their skill is bumped up considerably.The most frustrating part of the game is when it seems that your opponent always gets key cards that just obliterate you on the harder difficulties, but that also forces you to consider alternative methods of play.  You have to play more cautiously, as they will drop cards you don't expect.  In this game, you may have to take new hands a couple of times, until you get a workable hand.  You get one friendly 7 mulligan, then it starts penalizing you by reducing the # of cards you draw each time you mulligan, but you can reset this by simply restarting the duel.While in general, DOTP is a great game for introducing people to Magic: The Gathering, this game does raise the difficulty, which I found refreshing, as in previous games, playing at the hardest difficulty I just obliterated the AI.One thing I didn't like, is how some opponents (namely, Kiora and Garruk, as well as others) use the old-school dual lands (Bayou - GB, Tropical Island - WU), and you don't have access to these cards.  I felt that was a bad choice by Wizards/Stainless because it would be nice to get your hands on them, as the best you can get are the Guildgates from the Return to Ravnica block.One thing that does bug me are the presence of Premium Boosters.  I got one pack for pre-ordering, and the cards inside were completely awesome, it sucks that I don't have any other way to get more of them unless I buy more boosters.  In addition, I can't use my Steam funds to buy them because the overlay doesn't seem to work (I've followed all fixes, nothing has worked.  Couldn't get the overlay in Magic 2014 either....) so I'm SOL at the moment.Another thing that bugs me is multiplayer, how sometimes, even though there ARE games going on, it says ""no games available"" in multiplayer.  I don't know why it does that, but it's frustrating at times.And finally, one thing that doesn't bug me, but saddens me a bit, is the fact the game wants you to build multi-color decks, without additional lands that would help in doing so.  Making multi-color decks without more land options is tricky, and very problematic at times.  2 colors isn't a problem, but when you make it 3 (which I run in RL, btw), you seem to never draw what you need, or you don't have enough to play the cards.Pros:Game does play smoothlyAbility to completely make your own decks.Card pool is nice, does seem to foster creativity.Storyline is decently thought out, and is satisfying when you beat the final duel. (No spoilers here!)If you have an Alienware computer, your Alien FX changes colors based on the turn, and what is being done (red when attacking/being attacked, etc.)Cons:Paid boosters, and the fact that it is glitchy about letting you purchase them.No 2-headed Giant (not a deal-breaker for me, but many people are raging over it.)The AI does seem to cheat a bit on hands when you're on the higher difficulties.Steam overlay doesn't work, I have to keep alt-tabbing out to talk to friends who are also playing.No really suitable lands for more than 2 color decks, and problematic when making those decks.Overall, I do recommend this game, especially if you're an avid Magic player like I am.  If you're new to the series, or if you're rusty, I recommend the older series, before jumping into this one.			"

Posted: July 21, 2014
												So, before I begin my review let me just say that I'm a huge fan of Magic the Gathering. Been playing it for a few years and I've played prior Magic the Gathering titles: 2012, 2013, 2014. With that said, let me delve into my review of the game.THE EXPERIENCEFrom the beginning you have the option to play through the entire tutorial or skip to the final battle (a nice option for those familiar with the game). I skipped to the final battle and was poised with choosing a deck to play with; I ended up rolling with black/blue since I love being mean and figured it would get me through the campaign fairly easy with the lifesteal/control combo I was thinking up in my head. I beat the the final stage in the tutorial and that was when my fate was sealed. I had no way of changing decks, and I had to win my way through with the deck I chose. I was stuck on the first Plane and first opponent for quite awhile; once I got past that though I was on a winning streak and unlocking more and more cards. Several hours later, I've completed the campaign and have unlocked a good amount of cards to deck build with, as well as improve my original deck. After completing the campaign there are still several cards to unlock through random booster packs that you win as you defeat opponents, and each Plane has a ""Explore"" level that pits you against a psuedo-random opponent to test your mettle and wit. Although it was a rocky start, I'm really hooked now.THINGS I LIKE1. Unlocking cards through boosters, and being able to have complete control over deckbuilding: choosing the number of lands you want (dual/basic) and how many colors you want to run in your deck, choosing your own spells to create your own synergies, and the amount of cards available (running a WUB lifegain/control deck like I originally wanted thanks to the cards available)2. Replayability is high for me personally. I haven't finished everything that I can possibly finish in this game yet. Also, being as OCD as I am I'll probably want to unlock 4 of every card thats available just to maximize my deck building options and build that perfect deck.THINGS I DISLIKE1. In game purchases - I just never liked them to begin with, and I think it's a terrible idea. If anything, maybe they could have added a thing where you earn points when you win matches, and you can use those points to buy boosters or something like that. Besides, using real money to unlock cards kind of takes away from unlocking them the good ol' fashioned way.2. Unlocking decks - being stuck with a single deck in the very beginning can be brutal depending on which one you choose, they should have let you switch between a couple at first like they did in the previous iterations of the game. My suggestion with that is to look up the deck lists online (which I think someone already mentioned in the comments) before you decide which one you want to use.I enjoyed my time with it, and I recommend it. It's not so bad once you get a little further in the game.P.S. make sure you manage your lands manually with the Left CTRL button, otherwise it's going to use lands in a truly terrible and unefficient way.

And having the ability to build a deck from scratch, choosing from ALL your cards is just fun!Just don't buy the complete pack, as it does take away the pleasure of collecting the cards yourself!

												A lot of critics, and it took a good week or two for this game to actually run, but I like it.  I played DotP 2013 and 2014, and DotP 2015 does add quite a bit more with the deck building.  I've played Magic since 1994, and I do not pretend that this game is an exact simulator of the actual card game.  If you have that in mind, this game is fun and offers a challenge.  It is an enjoyable Magic-like game, where you encounter the same themes from MtG cards.  If you buy all the best cards, to craft the same deck some other person conceptualized and won a tournament at, to stomp everyone you meet, you won't enjoy this.  You actually have to think and work at it.  Consider it a draft, where you get what you get and have to craft something usable to beat the competition's better deck.  Yes, it might take a while and be frustrating at times, but why buy/play a game that you can just walk through with no effort?  I'm having fun and have beaten several of the opponents.  i'm looking forward to many hours of fighting/struggling to get through.  Put yourself in the right frame of mind, and have some fun!			"

												heh heh I got you now Wizards of the Coast. This was the worst experience of my life. I bought the expansion and everything and only got 20 cards for the black deck to begin with. THat's not even enough to make a complete deck to play with.Other games in this series like 2014 you get a COMPLETE set of cards per color. But, not in this pos game, It no longer has 2 head giant or anything but 1 v 1 pvp now. How boring. Like I want to sit and play for hours against a computer oponent to unlock more cards and I certainly don't want to have to play sniveling KIDS 1 v 1 to get more cards either. So like greed corporates are they give you another avenue to get your cards BUY them and I certainly ain't gonna give them anymore money so I got a STEAM REFUND and I still get to post a review. How nice. :)			"

												Many critics (by critics I really mean MTG DotP players) have downvoted this game due to the fact that it did not live up to it's standard unlike it's predecessors. Magic 2013, 2014 have been great because of the different Multiplayer mode it offers, such as 2-Headed-Giants. Which everyone freaks the f♥♥k out when it is not included in M15. There are many flaws in this game, to list it out1- The menu bar takes a really long time to load2- The menu bar is not suited for PCs, it's suited for Tablet, rather.3- There still is no ""CANCEL"" button available when waiting for Quick Match4- Multiplayer Modes do not have 2-Headed-Giants, only 2, 3, and 4 player free for all are available5- Restarting a duel takes a longer time compared to M14 where it just restarts instead of loading and having to click ""Continue""To that, there are some good points to this game, minority compared to the crap this game offered1- Deck Customization2- Dynamic graphics and slicker gameplay......That's about it. If you want to rant about M15 go ahead, don't rage at it giving a thumbsdown just because it doesn't suit your expectations =.=			"

												Great game, nice to finally be able to build decks from scratch. A bit too heavy on the microtransactions, especially with almost 15% of the cards only being obtainable via premium boosters (luckily, they are precoded to give you the cards you need).One major problem though, the game seems to randomly crash on my PC (4770K quadcore i7, 16gb RAM, 4gb GTX680, SSD, so shouldnt be any problems) - it shuts down without any error messages. This needs to be fixed ASAP.			"

												Great game.  I've played this on both PC and mobile iOS, and the only issue I have, really, is that on the PC version (Steam) the controls within the game, as far as zooming in on the card, so as to get more info or to simply see the text better, is that the controls I set to zoom do not work.  Google queries have shown this to be a problem with all that do not use a mouse.  Maybe there is a fix that I'm unaware of?			"

												This game has a really good layout and great gameplay, as a fan of magic the gathering I enjoy the card game immensly but my main disappointment is with buying the card colections, it says in the game that you can unlock all Innistrad and Theros cards, but unfortunately only a small fraction of them are actually in the game. It would be nice if all cards in a set actually meant, All Cards, the reason I purchased the Theros DLC is so that I can build my physical deck and put it on the computer so I can test it out against the game and other players. My deck is a Theros block deck and the idea of unlocking the block online meant I could use my own deck in the game. It was quite misleading. I love everything that is in this game, the gameplay, graphics, soundtrack and usibility, I am just disappointed about the lack of actual cards in the game. I really hope that all cards will eventually be added, because then this will be the perfect game for me.			"

												I love this game.  I love making and testing my own decks and finally there is a PC version that lets me do just that.  I have gone through the negative reviews on 2015 and I would like to address them one by one.  They seem to fall under three catagories:  microtransactions and building your collection;  the UI;  and the game variations available.First, the card aquisition issue.  Disclaimer:  I did purchase all of the premium boosters about half way through the campaign.  Granted, the way that WotC did this was kind of sleazy;  they could have been more up front about the costs involved.  But really, for $10 you can get 80% of the cards and have a lot of fun.  If you want to compete at higher levels and get the whole set, it will cost you about $25 more.  People have also complained about the difficulty of the campaign with the starter cards and yes, it is hard.  It takes some skill and patience to progress but I loved it.  I went through the first three campaigns without the premium cards, getting about 30% of the basic set in five hours and had a ball as my deck slowly got better.  And yes, my cards were as bad as everyone else's.Second, the UI.  It is terrible.  The in-game UI is the best one yet, but navigating the site is a huge pain in the a$$.  If I had to choose which UI would be great, it would be the one that IS great; the one in-game.Third, the game variations available.  I'm not really qualified to talk about this because to me, MtG is like chess, it is a two player game and that is all I want.  If the the main reason you play MtG is for 2 headed giant, then don't buy the game.  I'm guessing they are going to add this as demand seems pretty high.To wrap things up, I suggest you do the same thing I did.  Pay the ten bucks and try it out.  If you like it, buy the premium boosters and go from there.  Buying the cards that you can earn by playing seems like a waste to me, but hey, whatever floats your boat.  Once you've completed half the campaign you have enough cards to gain some flexibility and your decks can start to get very interesting.  If you love MtG as much as I do, I think you will end up loving this version.			"

												Despite some initial bugs and the rare crash (right now usually when I choose Custom Game in Multiplayer), this has been the best Magic for PC version yet. Finally, we can make our own decks, the way we want to, and collect cards; instead of just unlocking predetermined cards for predetermined deck builds.My only complaints are that they took a step backwards in terms of the in-game menus. in 2014 they gave us a snazzy list menu that was easy to navigate quickly. However in 2015 they reverted to a scroll-through menu with giant pictures. What's worse is that other than what you have selected, all other pictures are blurred and the text for them disappears so that you cant tell what is forward or backwards other than remembering what and where they are. The other things that bother me are the bright white screens which are bad for people with migraines. Last but certainly not least, every time you complete a multiplayer game, all players are booted back to the multiplayer menu rather than a lobby. This forces you to recreate a game every time, and reinvite your friends every single time. What's worse is that it STILL does not remember that you want your player slots set to PRIVATE, making you take extra steps to kick random joiners that get in before you can set all spots to private and then invite friends.All in all, custom deck building completely outweighs these issues. Just depends on how much annoyance you can deal with.			"

												So I read a few angry wanna-be fanboy reviews about this game and they're horribly mistaken.  This is a badass game, you finally have complete control over building decks, there are even special lands on top of it.  A lot of people seem to have carried over their rage from not having 2HG, tough; things change, learn to get used to & enjoy something new.  The menus may seem slow, but it's rather nice effects they have that make it appear as such, soothing & gradual transitions from one screen to another.  The U.I. is very easy to get used to; you can navigate everything you need to very easily & smoothly.  Those that are upset that you can purchase premium boosters need to relax, this is a company at heart that you're purchasing a $10 dollar game from.  According to sources, you only have to purchase 14 of them to get every single premium card in the game & it won't give you duplicates, it knows what you have and will give you something new.  Times that by 2 and you have $28 bucks plus the $10 this game costs and it's still under the price of a lot of games.  Even if you purchased the complete bundle such as I have, that's about $5 bucks shy of the average big title/popular games you can buy.  So the kids who don't have a job are probably the ones complaining, pay them no mind.You want an awesome game that is loads of fun and will never get old with making & editing endless decks; pick this beast up.  Magic 2015 - Duels of the Planeswalkers is a hell of a blast you can play with your friends or even solo.  Even though there is no 2HG, you can set the meta for it w/ 3 other friends in 4-Player FFA and just take turns handing the win to your team's partner, wow that took such brain-power... sad others couldn't think like that.  And to those who are wondering why 2-Headed Giant isn't in this version, here's the answer from the company itself.  The rules of 2HG don't allow you to have more than 4x of a type of card per team/side.  So with the complete deck building option, there would be no way to regulate that since chances are people would sometimes have say 6x of a certain card combined in both their decks.  This is a smart move and keeps it legit to real-life MtG, I respect them for this decision to be honest.  The Magic proes would just build insanely over-powered combos abusing certain cards and the beginners wouldn't have too much fun.  Everyone needs to understand that these MtG - DotP videogames are basically Magic: Lite.  Intended to get people into the game who don't know it & provide a fun hobby/pass-time for the vets.  It's not going to be everything you could imagine the real game to be.  I wished 2HG was in the game, but it's not; just get used to something new and have a good time!  Only thing that could make this better in my opinion would be to actually have Planeswalker card types & mechanics.			"

												If you like Magic but you still wish for some balance in the game.. This one does have a few OP builds as does any game with a fraction of the diversity that the sealed played single player allows but after reading some of the bias reviews I would have to say most commenters are hating just to hate.  Someone said the game ends up running you 50 dollars and thats just a flat out lie... I spent 10 for it and have almost 90% of the cards... and with the exception of a couple that you need to pay to get after I have the best cards in the game or the ability to build a deck to take the cards down I dont have.  People ♥♥♥♥♥ when things change or they arent good at them so most of these reviews are probably just people that suck.  I will say I wish the match making had not only an MMR set up but a better queue up system... that had been all the magic games downfall... Maybe they will stop making one 10 dollar game a year and make a 30 dollar one that is amazing.One person said the interface lacks luster... Stfu noone cares about your opinion on whats pretty little ladyAnother said hearth stone is going to be a magic killer... Hearth stone was made by Blizzard.. who made WoW... and isnt there a new WoW killer every 6 months that fails?  Hearth Stone may be up there with Yu Gi Oh some day but Magic killer is a joke			"

												Finally, you can build your own deck! (see edit)I don't understand why people are claiming this game is P2W at all, you buy the game, and the expansion and you can unlock the cards via campaign against a.i and remaining by winning online duels. Good system in my opinion, nice carrot on a stick and I get excited when I see new White cards in my booster packs. At time of this review I have 11-12 hours on it and plan to spend more time with it.  The achievements are fun and offer incentive to play a few games differently. I plan to gift this game to a few friends out of town I use to play MTG w because you can build a  deck and challenge your friends online.The cons: There isn't a Twin Headed Dragon option. (see edit)if you lose against an a.i opponet a few times, you'll win because their openers will somehow remain the same so you can plan against it. Better A.I next year please. I'm happy w this years iteration, I've put more hours into then any of the previous console ones simply bc deck building. You can Pay to have foil variations of your cards or to unlock the remainder of the cards if you'd like.** Edit: Thanks to a comment from Eorx Wordrend I now know you CAN use more than 60 cards in a deck.

												this is the worst iteration of magic I have ever played. it might also posibly be the worst game I've ever played. Wizards should be ashamed to have their name associated with this product. the catalouge is a joke the decks that you play against are always stronger than the ones you can build. on top of that even if you have a ""5 Star"" deck you only win about 25% of your games and thats set on easy. I have been playing Magic for about 15 years so you could say I know a thing or two about building a deck and playing the game. most of the rules that the computer playes by are not even rules and it makes illegal moves constantly. all in all this is the most frustraiting game I have ever played and almost ruined magic for me. I would stay far far away from this Giant P.O.S			"

												Personally, I cant hate that much on this game.I have been playing Hearthstone for some time now, which was truly the first real card style game I had ever played. I decided to get this becuase I am interested in actually playing magic, but I needed to learn how.Sufice it to say, this is doing a magnificant job at teaching me the workings of MTG. Its not perfect, but for $10 I thought it was a great deal so I could learn before really diving head first into the MTG pool.			"

												I purchased the game without reading th reviewed because I enjoyed the 2014 one so much.  If you liked the 2014 one and are hoping for the same joy I can assure you it is not to be found here.  Obviously the gameplay of magic is always going to be the same.  However, this game makes progression extremely frustrating (start with a basic deck and play against AI opponents with constructed decks that are flat out better).  Because of this you will either win by chance...which is annoying...or purchase cards to build a good deck.  I was so frustrated I stopped playing after putting in 3 hours trying to grind booster packs.Could be a good game but the game is set up to force you to buy boosters.			"

I ended playing against players with decks a lot more constructed than mine.- After a few hours of play, the game does't have more challenges to keep the player amused.- The fastest way to get gold to buy booster packs is to farm AI in hard, wich you need an aggro deck well constructed. Pros:- Its MTG!. "

												Compared to many of the other Magic Duels of the Planeswalkers, this one is the closest feeling to the actual card game in that it allows full deck manipulations. The cons far outweight the pros.  No 2headed, no Arch Enemy and having to ""buy"" cards is just horrid.  You can't even collect all the cards, your limited in what you end up with.  No puzzles, which where fun.  The campaign is super short.  So yeah. 1 step forward, 2 steps back.			"

												It's worth the 9.99 to make your own decision.  I read a bazillion comments on this and they all scream the same things.  It's pay to win.  You start with a weak deck and have to get lucky to win in campaign.  I started with a red/white combo and have won 90% of my campaign matches thus far.  I would call it challenging if you are a fair to good MtG player, but not overly so.  Yes, you can buy the cards sets, but I've managed to tweak my deck pretty well just from winning 5-10 matches.  Not quite the grindfest others would have you believe.  Oh yeah, and finally I CAN FULLY CUSTOMIZE MY DECK!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												I must admit that I was very apprehensive when it came to purchasing this most recent version due to all of the negative reviews.  WIth that being said, I'm ultimately glad I did!  Pros:1.  Truly able to construct your decks with very minimal (if any real limitations)2.  Graphics and gameplay have been tweaked over so slightly and are minimally better than previous editions.3.  The game itself is still only $9.99 and regardless of what people are saying here, you DON'T need to purchase anything further to build your decks.  (See the conclusion for further details).Cons:1.  No additional play modes (ie: Planechase, archenemy etc.).  Also, the removal of 2HG is a big drawback...2.  Slow menu systems but tolerable.Conclusion:I will highly recommend this version of my long time favorite with a few exceptions.  If you enjoy playing other game modes rather than Free for all or campaign sessions vs. the AI then this may not be for you, at least until they bring something else into the game in the for of DLC etc.  As far as the deck building goes, I love it!!  As I previously mentioned, you can basically create whatever type of deck you want with the cards you are awarded after each victory in the form of Booster packs.  For me, that is the fun for me.  I enjoy griding away for booster packs and unlocking certain cards through those methods.  That is the whole point of the game for me.  Also, please take note that you do NOT have to purchase anything!!!  Not even premium boosters for the Mythic cards because you can get nearly all of those in the booster packs you win!  I haven't played a ton of hours and have only unlocked approximately 10-15 packs.  Through those packs I happened to receive 2 Mythic cards.  One of which, The Inferno Titan, is one of my MTG favorites of all time.  I imagine it is as difficult to get the Mythic cards as it would be if you were to purchase the paper copy booster packs.  It makes sense.  With this being said, however, you will need to purchase some of the premium packs if you want some additional cards (including 2 Mythic) but it is certainly not necessary but merely a preference for some, I suppose.  The additional cards to be unlocked in the premium certainly are not overly powerful or game changing in any way.  When all is said and done, if you enjoy griding away, building your decks, and playing a fun all around game then do yourself the favor and pick it up.			"

												So I feel like many of the reviews here are unjustified. First you can have as many decks as you want you just have to play though the campaign. Any Review that is telling you that you cant play as many decks or you dont get different colors simply has not played quite long enough. I think I am around 6 hours in and I am on the final boss of the campaign and I might have beat that last night if I didnt need to go to sleep.That said This game is finally what magic should have been for years. First off 50% of the fun of magic ""THE GATHERING"" is to build your deck. Finally I can Build my deck 100% from me. Is it true there are card limitations in terms of what is a option yes but of the cards and lands you can choose there are tons. So you really can build different decks and have fun with them. You can also modify existing decks.You can unlock anything without having to pay you just have to play. This is sort of a case were the journey is part of the fun So yes you might not have all the cards but you can unlock them. I have unlocked about 30% just by playing though the campaign like once. I am sure I will get more as time passes.A few Negatives are the menu's kind of suck but game itself is fine the only thing that sucks is if you click a card and drag it you will have to play it so think before clicking this didnt happen to often. Also when you play a card sometimes it uses the wrong lands which is a issue sometimes I think this one is a big one if you play a 2 color deck as sometimes it will use your green land for white etc. The last negative is lack of 2 headed giant and other game modes they only have like 2vs2 or 3vs3 etcOverall though WE FINALLY have a magic game that allows you to build your own deck and you can unlock cards for free. Personally I think its a good game I would recommend it even for 9 dollars. I would not pay for the extra decks as it gives you nothing that you can unlock for free and its not Like I have not earned like 20 booster packs already.			"

												It took a few games for Wizards to realize, but finally we have open ended deckbuilding as promised. The game is enjoyable, and unlocking boosters by winning games versus the AI has a great feel of progression. There are quite a few achievements and portraits to unlock, and the battlefield looks nice and clean. You can save your custom decks, and you can unlock 5 sets of cards to create them with. There now is online matchmaking as well, it seems Wizards took the comments from the comunity to heart, and finally added the things to the game we always wanted.There are, however, quite a few flaws with this game, including but (probably) not limited to:1. If you want to equip another deck, you have to go back to the main menu to do so. In the campaign this is only a minor inconvenience, but when playing online this becomes quite bothersome. Speaking of which:2. Earlier versions of MtG:DotP had Two-Headed Giant, a really nice way to play co-op. In 2015 it is gone. The reason for this? It would be really hard to balance, and one of the rules of THG is that the decks of one team combined may not have more than 4 copies of the same non-basic land card. I understand this, but still I think this is a step backward.3. The amount of content has drastically decreased. Aside from there being no special gamemode (like Planechase or Archenemy), the game also lacks challenges and a revenge campaign, both of which were present in earlier versions.4. You can create your own decks, but there are a lot of cards you simply cannot get your hands on. I am not even talking about the ridiculous paywall you have to breach before you unlock all the cards from the Premium set, I mean this: You will play against a lot of AI decks that will have interesting cards in them, whilst not being available to you. When you did grind yourself through the sets to unlock all the cards for a set, you will notice that about 70% of them are really bad cards. Like the standard 2/2 for 2, the 3/2 flyers for 4 mana, or that 3/4 vampire for 5 that will get flying as long as you pump 2 life in it each turn you want him to. And not only the creatures, the instants and sorceries as well. 5 mana for an instant speed destroy target creature, it cannot be regerated? No thank you!5. Programming AI may be the hardest part of making a good player vs. AI game, but the AI sometimes makes really stupid mistakes. I have seen the AI sacrificing an unblocked creature to its Bloodflow Connoisseur before it did damage (and I did not cast spells at that time). I have witnissed a Boros charm being cast to make all his creatures indestructable, which is not a bad manouver, but it is questionable to do so in his end step (again: no spells cast from my hand). Also the AI sometimes simply won't attack you when clearly he would make a great trade, has twice the amount of creatures on the battlefield and has a great chance of lethal damage next turn, all because you have some mana untapped and one or two cards in hand. And not only the opponent AI is flawed, the automatic mana-tapping function is random as well, sometimes leaving you with all the wrong mana so you cannot cast the other spell in your hand (luckily you can turn this off). Same goes for auto-assign damage to blocking creatures, which you, and I urge you to do so, can turn off as well. By the way, I played the game on highest difficulty, so maybe it is their way to make the game harder, but this does not explain the AI behaviour.6. The battlefield looks nice and clean, but every combat step it will slide apart to uncover some red moat. It's only a visual thing, and this is my own opinion, but I got annoyed by it after playing a couple of games. I don't  like the black border around selected cards in your hand either.7. The menu, and speaking of which: the whole interface, is clearly ported from the console versions of the game. Scrolling through the menu is painful, and the sliding circles they are made up from are unclear. Scroll to zoom bugs out unless you replace your cursor away from the centre of the screen, and while the menu is usable with a mouse, I reverted back to using the keyboard for it most of the time.8. When you first start up the game, the game asks you whether you are an experienced Magic player, and if you have played earlier versions of this game. All they do with this info though, is setting the difficulty. I clicked the equivalent of 'I know everything, I played Magic and the DotP games for years,' and after picking a starter deck the next stop was the tutorial. I played the first one, only to see if you would get some unlocks for them, but alas: No such thing. Then I clicked the 'Skip Tutorial' button, as for me it was more a torture than a tutorial, and I got the screen: ""Congratulations! You have proven yourself worthy!"" I liked the irony in that, I admit. Then I had to defeat a deck for real, using my severly underpowered starter deck. I say this because the largest creature I had was a 3/3. Most of the cards in the deck were borderline useless, and there was NO WAY to change the deck, or unlock more then a single card for it. It was hard fighting against 5/5 vigilance  angels, let me tell you. But then again, highest difficulty. And I was glad it was kind of difficult to get throught some encounters, losing a game sometimes was refreshing (and sometimes painfully annoying).Final verdict: I don't really know. The game has much potential, but I am afraid we won't be seeing any of that until 2016. I have bought the game and had some fun with it, even though I knew much of the game was a step back compared to its predecessors. If you want to get some deckbuilding going, play against (not with, because of the lack of THG) friends or archenemies, then by all means go for it. Do not bother with buying the DLC though, it does not unlock anything you cannot get by playing the game, and the foil conversions... Well... Let's just say I don't like it when the cards in my R/B Vampire deck behave like Edward Cullen.			"

												So, I've played the game for about 15 hours.  I like it, and it's very playable, but the Microtransactions are.... wacko.In the beginning, the game was furiously hard.  I started with one and only one deck made of commons, and immediately had to fight a single color recycling zombie deck.  And next a deck using fancy multilands.  I had literally ZERO cards beside the deck (which I felt had been overhyped.)Unlike Hearthstone, the game only gives you one deck, and I was starved for any new cards.I purchased a microtransaction to unlock all the sets, (because I'm an idiot, and I thought since the card logos all said MAGIC 15 I was not actually getting any of those other sets... ) and suddenly I had EVERY CARD.  The set went from 5% to 87%.   I had maybe ten legendaries, multiple copies of rare cards, and so on.  I also stopped getting reward packs for defeating the campaign bosses.I actually rather wish I'd only bought one expansion set, but there is no undo button.   I am not a 'cheat code' kind of guy.   Still, it wasn't *totally* game breaking.I really wish they had studied Hearthstone a bit better, giving players several deck for free, giving smaller rewards more often, giving card rewards for playing, and allowing players to gradually develop.  The game does have an auto-deck feature.  I can insert one or more cards, and the AI will make a deck around those cards.If someone bails from a duel, I believe the AI takes over.  There are several minor tweaks and gripes.  There was nowhere in the tutorial where it said ""PRESS CTRL TO CHANGE HOW MANA IS TAPPED""  I have some trouble seeing the opponent's cards when they come out, and can't read them without zooming and checking INFO.  I can't even LOOK at fancy lands without clicking off a setting.   "

												So Let's start from the top. Now that they've Finally listened to the players and fans and allowed us to actually build a deck and use it properly the MtG games in my opinion are finally worth it. My issue however is the same as it's been since the first one. There's no such thing as random in this game. More often then not When you build a deck you are either going to get Mana flooded or starved. Me and a friend tested it , we played 30 games each. Using 60 card decks at the reccomended Mana levels.Out of those 30 games I had 5 where I got an even distribution of mana to Spells. She got 2 games. (even being 1 or 2 mana for every 3 draws). I was starved 8 Games and Flooded 17. She was starved for 13 and flooded for 15. So we adjusted or Mana respectively , adding and removing no more than 4. Each time depending on the method used we got starved more often or flooded more often. This isn't a game breaking issue. Online against other people however it can become irksome. They have yet to properly imploy a way to actually shuffle the deck. I'm not sure why or what they use however it is not actually random Another issue is the game can't handle over powered cards, (See my Screenshots) you can break the game. But that's not the end of the world , as in a PvP it's not likely you'll get your card that strong. Now that the annoyings out of the way. I'd still reccomend this game, it doesn't have much of a footprint , the art work is fantastic , the Campagin story is good and it's MtG. The game is fun , and even with the annoying little bits , it's still worth the 10 bucks and the Nerd rage on planeswalker difficulty to unlock all the cards. I do wish however they'd stop changing Planeswalkers decks. Or at least allow us FULL access to every card used in this game. As a lot of NPC decks aren't available (or even their cards) to players. Maybe I'm just bitter because I miss my zombies.((EDIT))I'm adding this part here seeing as I just read a lot of reviews talking about ""pay to win"" and ""slow interface"". 1 - To fix a slow interface , play it in windowed mode. The slow interface is because the refresh rate of the game doesn't match your screens actual refresh rate (EVEN if you change it in settings) Playing it in windowed mode , will resolve this 9/10 times. Also to add on you can set your windowed mode resolution to 1920x1080 to mimic full screen and it will still resolve the sluggish issue.2 - This is definitely not a pay to win model. You can unlock every card in the game by playing through the story. It's long and tiresome but it's a Trading card game. Deal with it or buy to unlock them all except the hidden premiums which you unlock through completion and achievements.3 - The removal of Co-Op play. Yea this was a HUGE mistake on WotC part. Just stupid to remove the ability to play WITH your friends instead of against them. Really no idea why they'd do that. 4 - Someone added that now you can finally adjust Mana? You always could. So to summarize; - Don't be lazy and assume it's the programs fault when you get sluggish activity or lag. It could very well be , it could also be your hardware. Find a work around , it takes maybe 2 min to figure out a system that works. - Just because you can unlock through purchase doesn't make it pay to win. Pay to win means you can ONLY get very HIGH end and RARE cards THROUGH purchase. All cards you can purchase you can unlock in game with some diligance. That is by definition NOT pay to win. You're just lazy if you think it is. - Removing Co-Op was idiotic - It's not an Actual RANDOM shuffle- Yay Custom Decks- Buy the $10 over $30 and do the work to unlock the cards- WotC For the love of God , don't tease us with cards we'll never be able to touch- WotC Enough with the Character deck changes (Liliana's deck doesn't even reflect her anymore) I will agree with the non-recommenders and say this. The previous Magic (2014) was better. The only change they made that makes me want to play this over it's predecessor , is the custom deck.			"

												It's fun with 4 friends trying to beat the crap out of each others decks only to find out that they only get mana cards and nothing else. The campaign feels at point unfair when the AI pulls out all the best cards out of his deck when you are gaining the upper hand but hey that's AI for you. I think the game is best in multiplayer and the campaign is just there to keep you occupied when not playing against humans, thus you can buy the collections and concentrate on the good side of Magic 2015 and not waste time on the campaign. And if you don't like losing matches go ahead and be P2W and buy those booster packs you fool.  But otherwise can't really come up with anything bad except there is no real reward of playing the game unless you win.			"

												I've Played MTG Since 2000, And I will always be a fan.  But Im giving this a 3/5 It's a good game if you like MTG.   Gives the player the feel of actually playing.  Limited cards is a downfall for now.  Micro Transactions are also a downfall.  But if you continue to play the first stage of each Plane the Exploring you will get a booster pack.  I have even bought more cards after playing this.  With the 2014 game I was a huge fan of the challenges hopefully they will bring it back in the future.   Well worth it if it goes on sale.			"

												Magic 2015 - Duels of the Planeswalkers has gotten a lot of harsh critique. While many of the arguements against the game are true and have their reasoning I think people are way too irrationally annoyed over the fact that two-headed giant is missing.The game is a downgrade in a few ways in comparison to Magic 2014. The soundtrack is not as good, but it's hard to top 2014's soundtrack which is just outstanding. The menus are badly designed and ridiculously slow - which is most likely due to the game coming out on tablets/smartphones, so for some reason they didn't want to bother creating a seperate menu navigation system specifically for the PC. At first I thought the card selection seemed a bit lackluster, but after playing the game for 40 hours I've got to admit that there are a lot of decktypes that work and so far none seems to be overly dominant. Yes, some decktypes could use a few more cards (equipment based decks, zombie/vampire decks and more) but they can even that out with upcoming expansions. As for the pricing - I have absolutely no problem with it at all and I paid 30 Euros for both the game and all the premium boosters. For someone that can't play Magic: The Gathering in real life due to the lack of other players in my vicinity Duels 2015 is the perfect option for me. I come home, boot up the game, grab my virtual deck and dive into the competitive multiplayer duels. Thanks to the rarity limiation of cards (1x mythic, 2x rare, 3x uncommon, 4x common) none of the decks can be overwhelmingly powerful (atleast so far). The premium cards are good - no doubt about that, but the game is still playable for 10$ and you easily get your moneys worth. What annoys me a little is that they are giving out very powerful cards to the AI which you can't obtain afterwards. These cards being actually implemented in the game but not being obtainable seems kind of greedy. The missing sealed and two-headed giant game types are also a step back from the predecessor. These choices from the developers seem very questionable and that's what stirred up the community hive. I still think it's a good game and I want you to notice how most negative reviews on Steam come from people that played the game for about 2 hours. You don't write a review based upon 2 hours of gameplay.Pros:- Deck customization - about 300 unique cards (972 in total if you count the multiple ones)- Fairly challenging campaign- Battle UI is improved and works well- Interesting and not overpowered card choices- It's Magic:The Gathering, fun is ensured.Cons:- Horrid menu navigation and clunky interface- Some deck types lack cards to be properly playable- Pricing is unclearly stated - you need to pay about 20 Euros more if you want the full card collection- Some connection problems and bugs persist- Teases you with some cards during the campaign but they remain unobtainableBasically every flaw of this game is fixable with a proper patch and expansion. The developers should get rid of most of the bugs over the next few weeks. Fixing the menus should also be very high on the priority list - just get rid of these slow animations and make the UI more PC oriented next time. 972 cards is not a bad amount of cards but I wouldn't mind paying 50 Euros for double the card collection size and just stop teasing us with cards in the campaign already! Just implement them in the expansion and make us pay 20 Euros for all the cards instead of adding these premium boosters. That pricing model seems kinda silly. If it's effective financially for them I can understand the publisher/developers in a way, though.			"

												I recommend this game, if you like to play Magic: The Gathering.  Pros: Awesome card game with multiplayer and fun deck building.Cons: I have never been so sure about a game cheating to make it more difficult to unlock modes and cards in my life.  This game can be very frustrating because the computer never has trouble with mana or spell/creature cards.  Every game it has what it needs to defeat you easily, while you are struggling to either get land or spells/creatures.  Last, the computer can see what you have in your hand. Need to be a lot of fixes to make this game playable long term, like Magic 2014.			"

												So after playing the game for a number of hours I got some stuff to say.I'll start by saying that over all I had a fun time. There were a few times when the auto land would ruin my game, but after learning right-ctrl can change the land you use it was no longer a problem.Like others have pointed out the starting cards you get suck balls, you'll have to grind a little to beat the first boss or get really lucky. It's a liitle bull♥♥♥♥♥♥to be honest, their cards are just plain better than ours with a lot of synergy. Changing the game to easy is recommended.I do not recommend buying the Complete Bundle or the All Card Collections. Having all the cards after beating the first boss makes the rest of the campaign feel like a chore. Sure grinding out the booster packs well take more time but at least you have a reason to spend time in the campaign.Also people complaining about it being pay to win are just whining for the sake of whining. After playing a good number of multi-player matches I've not once blame my lost to premium cards. And if you look at the premium cards, with the exception of a few, they're not that good.Like I first said, overall it was a fun time, and if you like grinding and magic then I recommend this game.

												It has a decent amount of cards, but i felt kinda cheated by the ""collection"" part of the extra content you can buy either in the complete edition or the single sets. when i think collection i think all of the cards in that set, not just a small amount of them.The game plays much better then past versions. Giving you the option to add the mana you want, instead of the computer doing it for you and paying with the wrong types of mana. I recommend this game to anwone looking to get back into magic on a later date, but dont have the funds to do it now. The game will get you back on track for what you can look forward to with new cards, rules, and everything that comes in between. 7.5-8/10			"

												If you buy this game, only buy the basic version. I paid the base price and I enjoyed my experience very much. I do not agree that the premium cards are devastatingly good. I have been able to defeat players online and the campiagn quite easily using nothing more than the base version. I have also tried almost all of the starting deck options and each of them works pretty well once you can modify them with the cards you unlock in the booster packs. If you put in the time to unlock the cards you need, you can make any deck type you want, or make one of the pre-builts live up to its full potential. I love this game for two reasons: Deck Building and a campaign that actually tells a story. Maybe 2014 had a good story as well I wouldn't know, I've only played 2013 before. But compared to 2013 this games campaign mode was a joy to play through.  I'd recommend that if you have a tough time with the deck you chose, when you still have a chance to pick/repick a deck, go with either Green/White or Red/White (maybe even Blue/Green?). Those decks have access to easy lifelink spells or healing abilities that you can expand upon with the boosters and they will get you through tough fights. Also, you slowly unlock the other archtypes as you unlock the cards necessary to fill them out, so if you are stuck at some point you can at least switch to these. My experience was great, I paid base price and I don't feel like I need to pay more to win. I feel like I made a good purchase. I do admit, I miss planechase from 2013 because it added such an element of chaos to the game. I never used 2HG but I can see why people bemoan its absence. What I say to that is they could be brought in later, and also I value the ability to finally build my own deck above them so I see it as a zero sum move as in the game is still a good deal at its base price despite these features not being present. Its a good game, only buy the base version or else you'll most likely regret your purchase. Have fun deckbuilding and exploring your abilities as a player.			"

												As long as you have prior knowledge of Magic The Gathering, it is a fun experience. Nearly everything is unlockable by just playing the game, and the art style looks nice and bright. If you are new to the game you might have problems with trying to make a good deck though because most of the starting decks you recive are horrible, but with the new deck customizations, it is easier to make a better deck than in other DoTP editions.

												Magic the gathering 2015.   This game is most similar to 2014 version of the game however there are some pros and cons compaired to previous versions. I put in 42 hours so far in two weeks.  Which is quite alot however I believe I am burned out of the game now.  I got all the cards unlocked and see no point in playing by the end of this week since they took out my favorite online style of play 2 vs 2 or originally called 2 Headed Giant.   Sad since I obviously enjoyed the game and got my money worth.  Here's a short list of my pros and cons for you.  The cons are much longer and more descriptive because I want them to improve those features next year maybe some of you would agree.Pro:1. Cards Unlock faster2. Customization of the Decks3. Saving of Decks (customization)4. Campaign seemed longer and more rewarding5. Compared to previous versions better rewardsCons:1. Story was not as intresting as I liked the fire one last year, I heard little of any voice over between the movies.  They didn't even bother to read the description which is only one paragraph per enemy.2. Demo they added voice work into the demo yet the story had no voice over only text.3. Movies were boring and short.4, Two Headed Giant was removed a major thing to me instead replaced with random 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1 kind of bull. No one is playing that style it's not fun and you can see when you look for games no one is waiting for anything other than 1 vs 1.  I only played this 70 hrs which is half the amount I played 2014 version mainly because of Two Headed Giant removed.5.  The interface was really much slower compared to previous versions. 6.  Going in and moving between menus was a huge pain also you had no idea with the new system who was even in the realm when exploring.  I couldn't see a progress statistics unless I flip between menus which took a very long time the speed should be near instant.  Also after you win or loose they have a white screen which has a image you can't make it out what so ever also theirs text which you can not read it's too white it's the stupidest transition I ever seen since it takes 5 seconds between windows and you can't even make out the text or image.7.  Borning multiplayer 8.  AI for MANA is worse than last years AI for picking mana.  I had to self pick everytime to avoid major problems.  I could go through hundreds of stupid mana choices but it was obvious and no reason to for example choice all ""PLAINS""  *3 when I still white cards in my hand and a lot of left over ""Swamps"" yet no black cards in my hand. 9.  Lame excuses from magic developers 10.  Full blown advertisments between screens for ""Magic Toolbox"" or ""Friday Night Magic"" sickening like android.  If your going to advertise like some jerks at least give me a 50% off coupon or something.			"

												I must admit that I was very apprehensive when it came to purchasing this most recent version due to all of the negative reviews.  WIth that being said, I'm ultimately glad I did!  Pros:1.  Truly able to construct your decks with very minimal (if any real limitations)2.  Graphics and gameplay have been tweaked over so slightly and are minimally better than previous editions.3.  The game itself is still only $9.99 and regardless of what people are saying here, you DON'T need to purchase anything further to build your decks.  (See the conclusion for further details).Cons:1.  No additional play modes (ie: Planechase, archenemy etc.).  Also, the removal of 2HG is a big drawback...2.  Slow menu systems but tolerable.Conclusion:I will highly recommend this version of my long time favorite with a few exceptions.  If you enjoy playing other game modes rather than Free for all or campaign sessions vs. the AI then this may not be for you, at least until they bring something else into the game in the for of DLC etc.  As far as the deck building goes, I love it!!  As I previously mentioned, you can basically create whatever type of deck you want with the cards you are awarded after each victory in the form of Booster packs.  For me, that is the fun for me.  I enjoy griding away for booster packs and unlocking certain cards through those methods.  That is the whole point of the game for me.  Also, please take note that you do NOT have to purchase anything!!!  Not even premium boosters for the Mythic cards because you can get nearly all of those in the booster packs you win!  I haven't played a ton of hours and have only unlocked approximately 10-15 packs.  Through those packs I happened to receive 2 Mythic cards.  One of which, The Inferno Titan, is one of my MTG favorites of all time.  I imagine it is as difficult to get the Mythic cards as it would be if you were to purchase the paper copy booster packs.  It makes sense.  With this being said, however, you will need to purchase some of the premium packs if you want some additional cards (including 2 Mythic) but it is certainly not necessary but merely a preference for some, I suppose.  The additional cards to be unlocked in the premium certainly are not overly powerful or game changing in any way.  When all is said and done, if you enjoy griding away, building your decks, and playing a fun all around game then do yourself the favor and pick it up.			"

												So I feel like many of the reviews here are unjustified. First you can have as many decks as you want you just have to play though the campaign. Any Review that is telling you that you cant play as many decks or you dont get different colors simply has not played quite long enough. I think I am around 6 hours in and I am on the final boss of the campaign and I might have beat that last night if I didnt need to go to sleep.That said This game is finally what magic should have been for years. First off 50% of the fun of magic ""THE GATHERING"" is to build your deck. Finally I can Build my deck 100% from me. Is it true there are card limitations in terms of what is a option yes but of the cards and lands you can choose there are tons. So you really can build different decks and have fun with them. You can also modify existing decks.You can unlock anything without having to pay you just have to play. This is sort of a case were the journey is part of the fun So yes you might not have all the cards but you can unlock them. I have unlocked about 30% just by playing though the campaign like once. I am sure I will get more as time passes.A few Negatives are the menu's kind of suck but game itself is fine the only thing that sucks is if you click a card and drag it you will have to play it so think before clicking this didnt happen to often. Also when you play a card sometimes it uses the wrong lands which is a issue sometimes I think this one is a big one if you play a 2 color deck as sometimes it will use your green land for white etc. The last negative is lack of 2 headed giant and other game modes they only have like 2vs2 or 3vs3 etcOverall though WE FINALLY have a magic game that allows you to build your own deck and you can unlock cards for free. Personally I think its a good game I would recommend it even for 9 dollars. I would not pay for the extra decks as it gives you nothing that you can unlock for free and its not Like I have not earned like 20 booster packs already.			"

												It took a few games for Wizards to realize, but finally we have open ended deckbuilding as promised. The game is enjoyable, and unlocking boosters by winning games versus the AI has a great feel of progression. There are quite a few achievements and portraits to unlock, and the battlefield looks nice and clean. You can save your custom decks, and you can unlock 5 sets of cards to create them with. There now is online matchmaking as well, it seems Wizards took the comments from the comunity to heart, and finally added the things to the game we always wanted.There are, however, quite a few flaws with this game, including but (probably) not limited to:1. If you want to equip another deck, you have to go back to the main menu to do so. In the campaign this is only a minor inconvenience, but when playing online this becomes quite bothersome. Speaking of which:2. Earlier versions of MtG:DotP had Two-Headed Giant, a really nice way to play co-op. In 2015 it is gone. The reason for this? It would be really hard to balance, and one of the rules of THG is that the decks of one team combined may not have more than 4 copies of the same non-basic land card. I understand this, but still I think this is a step backward.3. The amount of content has drastically decreased. Aside from there being no special gamemode (like Planechase or Archenemy), the game also lacks challenges and a revenge campaign, both of which were present in earlier versions.4. You can create your own decks, but there are a lot of cards you simply cannot get your hands on. I am not even talking about the ridiculous paywall you have to breach before you unlock all the cards from the Premium set, I mean this: You will play against a lot of AI decks that will have interesting cards in them, whilst not being available to you. When you did grind yourself through the sets to unlock all the cards for a set, you will notice that about 70% of them are really bad cards. Like the standard 2/2 for 2, the 3/2 flyers for 4 mana, or that 3/4 vampire for 5 that will get flying as long as you pump 2 life in it each turn you want him to. And not only the creatures, the instants and sorceries as well. 5 mana for an instant speed destroy target creature, it cannot be regerated? No thank you!5. Programming AI may be the hardest part of making a good player vs. AI game, but the AI sometimes makes really stupid mistakes. I have seen the AI sacrificing an unblocked creature to its Bloodflow Connoisseur before it did damage (and I did not cast spells at that time). I have witnissed a Boros charm being cast to make all his creatures indestructable, which is not a bad manouver, but it is questionable to do so in his end step (again: no spells cast from my hand). Also the AI sometimes simply won't attack you when clearly he would make a great trade, has twice the amount of creatures on the battlefield and has a great chance of lethal damage next turn, all because you have some mana untapped and one or two cards in hand. And not only the opponent AI is flawed, the automatic mana-tapping function is random as well, sometimes leaving you with all the wrong mana so you cannot cast the other spell in your hand (luckily you can turn this off). Same goes for auto-assign damage to blocking creatures, which you, and I urge you to do so, can turn off as well. By the way, I played the game on highest difficulty, so maybe it is their way to make the game harder, but this does not explain the AI behaviour.6. The battlefield looks nice and clean, but every combat step it will slide apart to uncover some red moat. It's only a visual thing, and this is my own opinion, but I got annoyed by it after playing a couple of games. I don't  like the black border around selected cards in your hand either.7. The menu, and speaking of which: the whole interface, is clearly ported from the console versions of the game. Scrolling through the menu is painful, and the sliding circles they are made up from are unclear. Scroll to zoom bugs out unless you replace your cursor away from the centre of the screen, and while the menu is usable with a mouse, I reverted back to using the keyboard for it most of the time.8. When you first start up the game, the game asks you whether you are an experienced Magic player, and if you have played earlier versions of this game. All they do with this info though, is setting the difficulty. I clicked the equivalent of 'I know everything, I played Magic and the DotP games for years,' and after picking a starter deck the next stop was the tutorial. I played the first one, only to see if you would get some unlocks for them, but alas: No such thing. Then I clicked the 'Skip Tutorial' button, as for me it was more a torture than a tutorial, and I got the screen: ""Congratulations! You have proven yourself worthy!"" I liked the irony in that, I admit. Then I had to defeat a deck for real, using my severly underpowered starter deck. I say this because the largest creature I had was a 3/3. Most of the cards in the deck were borderline useless, and there was NO WAY to change the deck, or unlock more then a single card for it. It was hard fighting against 5/5 vigilance  angels, let me tell you. But then again, highest difficulty. And I was glad it was kind of difficult to get throught some encounters, losing a game sometimes was refreshing (and sometimes painfully annoying).Final verdict: I don't really know. The game has much potential, but I am afraid we won't be seeing any of that until 2016. I have bought the game and had some fun with it, even though I knew much of the game was a step back compared to its predecessors. If you want to get some deckbuilding going, play against (not with, because of the lack of THG) friends or archenemies, then by all means go for it. Do not bother with buying the DLC though, it does not unlock anything you cannot get by playing the game, and the foil conversions... Well... Let's just say I don't like it when the cards in my R/B Vampire deck behave like Edward Cullen.			"

												So, I've played the game for about 15 hours.  I like it, and it's very playable, but the Microtransactions are.... wacko.In the beginning, the game was furiously hard.  I started with one and only one deck made of commons, and immediately had to fight a single color recycling zombie deck.  And next a deck using fancy multilands.  I had literally ZERO cards beside the deck (which I felt had been overhyped.)Unlike Hearthstone, the game only gives you one deck, and I was starved for any new cards.I purchased a microtransaction to unlock all the sets, (because I'm an idiot, and I thought since the card logos all said MAGIC 15 I was not actually getting any of those other sets... ) and suddenly I had EVERY CARD.  The set went from 5% to 87%.   I had maybe ten legendaries, multiple copies of rare cards, and so on.  I also stopped getting reward packs for defeating the campaign bosses.I actually rather wish I'd only bought one expansion set, but there is no undo button.   I am not a 'cheat code' kind of guy.   Still, it wasn't *totally* game breaking.I really wish they had studied Hearthstone a bit better, giving players several deck for free, giving smaller rewards more often, giving card rewards for playing, and allowing players to gradually develop.  The game does have an auto-deck feature.  I can insert one or more cards, and the AI will make a deck around those cards.If someone bails from a duel, I believe the AI takes over.  There are several minor tweaks and gripes.  There was nowhere in the tutorial where it said ""PRESS CTRL TO CHANGE HOW MANA IS TAPPED""  I have some trouble seeing the opponent's cards when they come out, and can't read them without zooming and checking INFO.  I can't even LOOK at fancy lands without clicking off a setting.   "

												I've seen alot of bad reviews for this game and I too initially had the same reaction. But after playing for an hour I found that only having one deck arcchetype initially wasnt a problem (i currently dont use archetypes, rather i've built two custom decks). And you don't  have to pay for cards to have a good deck. ive made to very good decks just with cards unlocked from booster packs obtained through playing the campaign (which i think was much better than 2014's). The menus are a little annoying at points, but i think the game is really fun over all.			"

												I bought the complete edition and had a blast playing this. Looking at all thumbs downs and comments you would think this is the worst game ever made. It isn't. All I see is a lot of crying for 2hg which was not a big deal for me. Can't wait  for the dlc, magic was always a steal at 10.00 to me. Cry harder guys, I liked it and I am only writing this to put a rare thumbs up in a sea of thumbs down.			"

												I was really hoping the community would revive to a point where it's a little more than alive, seeing that the magic scene at the local toystore is pretty much dead, replaced by casual phone gaming, kendamas, and console/handheld gaming. It's also a sucker punch to the stomach as ""magic"" is generally considered something that is generally frowned upon, as opposed to chivalry or following certain ethics/code of honor. The frustrating gameplay, rage-quitting mid game, and people who simply say, ""I quit!"" and do not come back to the world of magic are frequent, and I can't really say that I blame them. The gameplay of this game is pretty fun, lots of cards to play around with, and although there are no key cards from theros/m15 set on paper like the planeswalkers or the god cards, you can still make a pretty good cheap goblin deck that can melt faces most of the time. I think they might work in the paper magic scene too. Only if that was still a fad. It's a very good introductory title, and there are a lot of helpful tactics and tips in the tutorial. I understand it might be too much for a lot of people to pay $9.99 for an age old title, but if you still like old fashioned magic, you might enjoy a few hours off from this.			"

												In my opinion this game is by far the best in the ""Duels of the planeswalkers"" series (I own all since 2012). Notable improvements are:- You can build decks out of a fairly large cardpool (~800)- You can play against the decks you built controlled by the AI- The AI is fairly decent on planeswalker levelThese improvements come at the expense of some of the game modes that were previously available, but to be honest I didnt spend that much time in the alternate game modes anyway. I am much happier with the deck editor it really extends the lifetime of the game for me and it will make any expansion with new cards (which there will surely be) much more valuable too.Before I got the game I was worried about the negative reviews, but they are largerly exagerated I think. Here are some of the most common negatives mentioned in the reviews and how I experienced them;- Yes the menus are sometimes a bit slow to respond, so I sometimes had to click twice or wait a second. This was not a big deal in my opinion.- You start out with one deck (you choose 2 colors after the tutorial) and have to make cards available to improve your deck. People complain that the starting deck is too weak. I did not share this experience. I picked the blue/red deck and played on the highest difficulty setting (planeswalker) and never got stuck/frustrated. The rate at which you get new cards means you can improve your deck pretty quickly, after winning ~5 games I could change my blue/red deck into a blue/white deck with lots of fliers and a white mythic, for example.In conclusion, I think this is the best game in the ""Duels of the planeswalkers"" series so far and it is easily worth $10.

												Edit:With a complete playthrough, the game is actually good. There's hightened replayability, and while it sucks that you have to unlock ""premium"" cards with purchases, that's how this game plays in real life. You have to BUY cards. This may seem a bit of a jolt to the casual player who has played previous iterations of the game, and if you like playing with sealed decks, then this is definately not your cup of tea. This version requires you actually study cards and figure out combinations on your own. They aren;t just handed to you, aside from the weak starting decks, made so to inspire you to imporve and evolve inot something devistating.Something to address that many people seem to be complaining about, (aside from 2HG, which sucks if you don't play with people you can talk to or trust) is the mana selection for casting spells. before you actually cast, hit the CTRL button. This button triggers your mana selector and you can highlight the lands you want before casting the card.This game dosen't hold your hand like the previous versions, and in a way, it's somewhat refreshing after you adjust to it. And if you find the AI is too difficult, you can lower it.All in all, continue to play the game when and if you get it. Work with it. It's like clay. At first it's hard, awkward, and unyielding, but the more you work with it, the easier it becomes and the more proud you can be for making your own deck(s) that have been proven against the AI.Original Review:Well, I bought the Complete Bundle and was somewhat displeased that I have to unlock the content I paid extra for, which is four card sets. Having heard that you can fully build decks in this game, I thought I'd throw a little more money down, knowing full well that a PC version of the game is much cheaper than the physical cards. I'm not really sure what to make of it. I feel like I know the game, and yet, this iteration feels so alien to me. Winning cards after AI matches also sometimes dosen't help with the deck you start with. And the starting decks are clunky at best. Many AI matches require you pull the prefect hand to really beat. So there's this obligation to constantly reset the battle in hopes for a better hand.Pros:Actual deck buildingIt's MTGSleek UI (Avatars don't block as much space as they used to)Cons:Clunky starting decks.Pales in comparison to previous iterations of the DotP franchise.Highly obligatory restartsYou will need to drop money for cardsNo Planechase modeNo Two-headded giant modeMenus still not easily navigatedI really expected something better. I find myself suffering from buyer's remorse.Somethings to note: you CAN change your deck, you just have to navigate the menues and select the deck you wish to equip. All the starter decks are available to you.What I'd have liked to see:A Nezumi deckBenefits for veterans who own the previous iterations			"

												I don't have that many hours under my belt yet, but my first impression was similar to some other players who gave negative reviews, although as I played more of the game I warmed up to it.  Like som others on the forums, I also assumed that there was a glitch preventing me from using the decks I paid for until I looked up that you had to progress through the capaigns to unlock them.  The campaigns are relatively easy though, and it isn't hard to unlock the cards.  If you get stuck on one of the later campaigns try switching your booster cards around.  Unlike other players, I like the interface, and don't mind the slight delay between menu switching.  Once you get used to it, you start to adapt by hitting escape instead of using the mouse to back out of some menus.  Using both the keyboard and mouse made the navigation more fluidic for me.  If Stainless Games decreased the time it took to switch menus, that would be even better through.  The AI isn't perfect, and makes mistakes when you solo, but humans make mistakes too.  The AI rarely makes miskes though, and I haven't played any other game where the AI is flawless anyways.  The deck builder is excellent, and the gameplay interface is also superior to many other card games out there.Overall, this is a solid game, and worth my money.  Some of the criticisms about Magic 2015 I have read are valid, but for me at least, those problems are not game breaking enough to post a negative review, and depends on how sensitive you are to interface details, profit models, and minor gameplay mechanics.  The argument against pay-to-win isn't baseless, but ignores the fact that almost all card games you download on a computer have a similar profit model at heart.  In this market it would be highly unusual for any other profit model to exist.  As a result, it is to be expected, and shouldn't be a shock to players at all unless this is their first time buying a game that uses microtransactions.  Selling a NEW game with a relatively popular title for $9.99 should be a clear indication that the company intends on using microtransactions to pay for the rest of their overhead in making the game.  There are also other clues such as player defined tags in Steam, and forum comments, so I am not sure why so many people were surprised about this, and reeled so hard against it after they bought it.  This is how the real card game works as well, right?  If you are on a budget, and can't afford anything more than $9.99, then you most likely will still get $9.99 of enjoyment out of the game before you get bored of the grind or how the interface works.  If you can afford the microtransactions, or even the $19.99 or $34.99, then you will get that much more enjoyment compared to other games with similar price tags.			"

												At first I was very frustrated and disapointed with this game but after time i came to really enjoy it. I now completely recommend it to anyone who wants to take up the challenge. I'm hoping however that Wizards of the Coast will come out with a massive update to 'fix' the issues many peple have with the changes they made from previous DOTP's.PROS: -Unlocks through 'free' boosters packs after you win a duel.                (DO NOT purchase the complete edition as that only unlocks these cards and takes out       the whole point of the game)            -Deck building. A welecome change even though it has its challenges. See cons.            -addictive fun once you have a deck that you like to play multiplayer.CONS: -starter decks. vague discription and then you are stuck with it. no preview, nothing. Will take time to build a capable deck meaning it will be a frustrating start.- terrible UI, hard to do what you want it to do- removal of co-op (2-headed giants), challenges, archenemy.-NO ability to 'rematch' in online play. - Custom decks (Deckbuilding); very few amount of cards that you are capable of unlocking (298). This game could benefit from alot more for more deckbuilding options.- The AI however does have these decks with extra cards so you will get very frustrated playing those decks YOU want to build yourself but can't when you are playing through the main campaign.-There just isnt enough of the cards of a particular type to build a deck thats fun. You can't even get a Doomblade or Pacifism. Lol.- Pay to win ""premium boosters"". Truly not needed.So even with the many CONS outweighing the PROS I still find this game fun. I just really hope WotC come out with a much needed update.Please add:        -rematch option       -2-headed giant       -more cards       -fix to UI issues			"

												Two things:Don't buy the complete edition, all the cards in it can be unlocked by playing the campaign, save your money for when expansion sets will innevitably be released.Second off I never really like two headed giant so the only downer in this whole game for me was the slow loading screens, and hell I'd take a better UI and actual deck building in exchange for that anyday.

												Slow tutorial and poor interface, but the bones of magic are still strong in this version. More so, i'd argue, than in other versions - the ability to create your own decks adds a LOT of value. The fun of creating a workable deck arround an obscure card is offset by the frustrating and time consuming menus, but overall I had a lot of good times!			"

												Best DotP yet. They really opened up the deckbuilding, so you can spend a lot of time earning new packs and making new decks out of them. Tons of value for just the $10. There are premium packs that you can buy that come from a different card pool. They're not necessary for play, but they  open up some other deck archetypes if you want to make new kinds of decks. Cons: the menus are really clunky and irritating to navigate. Works better with a controller than with mouse and keyboard. Low graphical performance on some laptops. IAPs are hard to understand.			"

												I've seen a lot of negative on this game but I have played 4-6 hours so far and have enjoyed it very much.  I played the physical game for 20 years on and off, and just don't have time anymore.  This is the perfect way to get a magic fix and it only costs $10.  I am disappointed they took out two-headed giant mp format.  The deck editor is not bad once you unlock the card filter.  I also like that everytime I beat a single player game in campaign mode I unlock a new pack of cards.  The game play is very solid you have about 5 seconds to pause the game after any action to use card effects or instants.  My typical match is 5-10 minutes.  Overall i'd give it 8 out of 10.			"

												I purchased the game without reading th reviewed because I enjoyed the 2014 one so much.  If you liked the 2014 one and are hoping for the same joy I can assure you it is not to be found here.  Obviously the gameplay of magic is always going to be the same.  However, this game makes progression extremely frustrating (start with a basic deck and play against AI opponents with constructed decks that are flat out better).  Because of this you will either win by chance...which is annoying...or purchase cards to build a good deck.  I was so frustrated I stopped playing after putting in 3 hours trying to grind booster packs.Could be a good game but the game is set up to force you to buy boosters.			"

												If you like Magic but you still wish for some balance in the game.. This one does have a few OP builds as does any game with a fraction of the diversity that the sealed played single player allows but after reading some of the bias reviews I would have to say most commenters are hating just to hate.  Someone said the game ends up running you 50 dollars and thats just a flat out lie... I spent 10 for it and have almost 90% of the cards... and with the exception of a couple that you need to pay to get after I have the best cards in the game or the ability to build a deck to take the cards down I dont have.  People ♥♥♥♥♥ when things change or they arent good at them so most of these reviews are probably just people that suck.  I will say I wish the match making had not only an MMR set up but a better queue up system... that had been all the magic games downfall... Maybe they will stop making one 10 dollar game a year and make a 30 dollar one that is amazing.One person said the interface lacks luster... Stfu noone cares about your opinion on whats pretty little ladyAnother said hearth stone is going to be a magic killer... Hearth stone was made by Blizzard.. who made WoW... and isnt there a new WoW killer every 6 months that fails?  Hearth Stone may be up there with Yu Gi Oh some day but Magic killer is a joke			"

												Finally, you can build your own deck! (see edit)I don't understand why people are claiming this game is P2W at all, you buy the game, and the expansion and you can unlock the cards via campaign against a.i and remaining by winning online duels. Good system in my opinion, nice carrot on a stick and I get excited when I see new White cards in my booster packs. At time of this review I have 11-12 hours on it and plan to spend more time with it.  The achievements are fun and offer incentive to play a few games differently. I plan to gift this game to a few friends out of town I use to play MTG w because you can build a  deck and challenge your friends online.The cons: There isn't a Twin Headed Dragon option. (see edit)if you lose against an a.i opponet a few times, you'll win because their openers will somehow remain the same so you can plan against it. Better A.I next year please. I'm happy w this years iteration, I've put more hours into then any of the previous console ones simply bc deck building. You can Pay to have foil variations of your cards or to unlock the remainder of the cards if you'd like.** Edit: Thanks to a comment from Eorx Wordrend I now know you CAN use more than 60 cards in a deck.

												DO NOT BUY DLCIf you decide to buy this game be sure to only buy the base game. DO NOT BUY DLC. If you do it will unlock everything you earn in the campaign, you can earn all the DLC. If you have played any of the others (2012-2014) it is the same thing they did with the DLC in these games.The game itself is the best in the series since Planeswalker or MTGO. You can build your own deck finally with only being restricted to the number of cards you have unlocked(you can only have 4 in a deck). You can unlock cards in Booster packs that you earn through beating the trials during the campaign. One thing I noticed that I haven't seen in the other reviews is that each realm has an explore option i.e. explore Ravinca. This will give you a different opponent each time not found during regular Campaign progression (until you unlock all the cards) and each time you defeat one of these foes it will give you a booster pack with new cards. However, there is a limit to how many booster packs you can earn per plane and achievements for earning all the packs per different planes.From what I have seen it is only getting bad reviews because of the fact that people buy all the DLC with the game and go to play it only to realize that everything is already complete. DO NOT BUY THE DLC. Other than that it is an excellent game for single player MTG fans***EDIT***You will have to buy Garruks expansion. it is only one plane with the cards delved the same. other than that it it is the only dlc you can not earn....in This expansion you are limited to using Garruks deck(through the first play through). Also when you play online you WILL get your cards when people leave the match early. They fixed it so AI takes the players place and will continue to play. After the match go to the Deck Manager and you will have a booster pack waiting (if you won).			"

												Basicly mtg has always been about cashgrabbing. But when it comes to computer gaming, i personaly cant stand pay to win games. If you buy a game, that should be it. I could easly have bought a good mtg online game, for full price, if it was about skill to win. The previous mtg dotp games, you could mostly play without grinding a billion hours or buy slots etc. In this game, its not and cant recomend it therefore. Also, this game is dull and has zero inovation, in comparison to the older mtgs out there.			"

												The last 3 weeks I really struggled if I should buy this game. After it received so many bad reviews I was sure this game must be unbelievable bad - to say the least. Well I still did bought it because it is not that expensive and I could not believe it could be this bad. And I have to say, I'm really glad I did. What turns me away from the previous games of this series, was the lack of personalized deck-building what makes a Magic-game pretty useless, as I think. Now that we got this gimmick its just awesome. There are several cons. which were put forward against this game and I don't understand most of them. For example, I didn't recognized that the menu is that slow. In fact, if you use the keyboard its much faster than the menus in many other games but I have to admit, its structure is a little,... well, you have to get used to it. Many other people claim that the decks you choose at the beginning are way to weak. Well, I choose the black/white deck and until now, I just entered Ravnica, I just lost 2 duels - and I didn't played Magic since years and even then only sporatic. I now even obtained lands for different manatyps which I always wanted to use in Shandalar. Because I didn't played the other games of the series I, of course, can't say anything to the removed features from previous games. But if the developers now only include a dungeon/world - environment to the game, as it was in the old DOS-game, it would be a 9 - 10 in my book.So if you like Magic and want to have a little duell from now and then, you should do yourself the favor and invest those 10 Bucks. I think its really worth that.			"

												My honest oppinion after almost nerding it non stop after release. In pro's and con'sPros :  -Freedom to build your own decks. -Addicting way to unlock cards/booster packs. (much better than the old way, where you had to win 30 games pr. deck) -Decent cardpool, and I actually do like alot of the new cards, though I do miss many of the old ones. -It's MTG.Cons : -No 2 Headed Giant. This is IMO a complete and utter mindboggling mistake on the development side. The only reason me and so many of the people I play with have spent 100's of hours in DOTP is due to 2HG. It needs to come back in an expansion and it can't come too soon.  -Clunky UI on PC, but it's been that way since forever.  -The decks you can build are nice and solid, but I do feel like a lot of old cards shoulda been here.Overall : I really like the game, but I can't see myself actually playing it anymore already, due to 2 Headed Giant not being there. It was the sole reason why I've spent countless hours in the previous titles. Why it was removed it beyond me, and when you checked multiplayer games in 2013 and 2014 there were _ALWAYS_ many 2v2 games in 2HG up..... Always. Huge mistake to remove it and it needs to come back.			"

												     I actually enjoyed the game.  I was happy to finally see a Magic the Gathering video game with full card customization after all of these years.  Many people don't seem to understand that in order for this to work, it is necessary for us to begin with a chosen starter deck, and then earn the rest of your cards.  You can easily farm new cards in the first node of every level to enhace and perfect your deck.  Also, many do not stop to check the default settings in the options menu.  I found it best to try different settings that would benefit my playstyle the best.  For example, I believe that you should be allowed to adjust the amount of lands by default on the deck creation screen.  Also, it should be easier to understand how to choose which mana to tap for all spells, rather than let the game choose for you.  With that being said, of course I feel there some grey areas that should be addressed.  I do not mind if WotC/Hasbro wishes to sell extra booster packs, but all of the cards should always be available to earn in game at a reasonable drop rate.  We already payed for the game.  We should not feel forced to pay more for it. The artwork is very nice, but whats up with the brilliant white screens?  I didn't check but also can I change the card table?  Also, I imagine there will be an expansion pack with more things to do like two headed giant, but will there be more new cards?  I would also like to see a few more of the older edition cards like lightining bolt, and classic counterspell cards.  One final gripe is that I seemed to have trouble connecting to a multiplayer game.  It just seems to time out.  Anyway I would recommend this game if you like Magic the Gathering, but I would probably wait for an expansion pack or two to come out to fully appreciate it.  Especially if you are new to the game, or have only played the previous versions of this game.			"

												Given all of the terrible reviews this game has had, and being a guy who gets his jollies from deck-building specifically, I had to buy the game and see for myself. I just beat the game, so I've definitely given it 'a chance,' and I'll probably play it a bit more. Why am I packing the gun so tight? It's very simple: this game is someone's idea of a Pay to Pay to Play.First off, the good points: I'm fairly happy overall with the deck-building aspects in the sense that you can literally build versus only unlock and substitute. I'm also really happy at the base price of the game: at $10 it means that more people can get in and that makes for more diversity in the meta. Despite complaints to the contrary I'm actually okay with the UI and just wish there was a way to turn off all the fancy effects to get the game to run better.Now, the stuff that really annoyed me: The complete edition isn't complete; you're short-cutting your way through most, not all, of the card collection aspects. The game, had it wanted to capture the casual audience, should have allowed for card trading, which this game doesn't, because that's what keeps most people in the community, not just playing the game. That's some seriously lost opportunity, Wizards. The entire reason I started spending real money on Magic was because one man talked to me about deck building and gave me a bunch of commons, giving me the sense that I was now part of something much larger.The card diversity in the game is exceptionally limited. This may have initially been to prevent 'power building' (there are also limitations on the number of duplicates you can have in a deck that don't follow standard) but it really keeps people from feeling the potential of certain sets, particularly Zendikar's 'man lands.' The fact that NPCs in the campaign use some of these missing cards furthered the feeling of frustration.Overall, I'd recommend the base game to someone who was interested in seeing what Magic: The Gathering was all about, but would steer someone who's actually played the game before away to another product. The complete version left me with a terrible taste in my mouth.Rating: 6/10, I would NOT recommend buying the Complete Edition			"

												This is my first MTG game that i've played but i really like it the tutorial explains everything and has good design this is so far my favorite game on steam right now, i don't know why people right bad reviews about it is there something im missing? The game is not P2W and it is challenging even on the easiest mode! So, for new people like me don't worry it won't be TOO EASY it took me almost an hour to think of a way to defeat the first story boss until i finally found a way it was so simple i can't belive i didn't think of it AT THE BEGINNING. 10/10 Love it.

												I have to counter (heh) what everyone else is saying, this version finally has what everyone's been asking for, custom decks. The game feels just like dead tree Magic, with the exception that you actually win booster packs and don't have to buy them.  So you have the options to either play the game or buy boosters, just like at the store. On the starting deck, it seems like no one's bought a premade deck before, all you get is the colors and flavor text on the box. If you want to know the actual card list, you pay your money and open the box OR you look online. Furthermore, archtypes are unlocked as you progress through single player, so you do end up getting access to the decks you did not pick. Mana selection is possible, but not obvious, I had to look up ""WTF is the mana key"", it's left ctrl btw, and you can decide how to pay for a card. So...Good:Deck building - finally, and including multiple decksCombat hasn't been changedBad:UI is slowUI is clunkyOld game modes that I never played are missing? Still has 3 and 4 player FFA, btw.Couldn't start with a mono-red deckSo for the base price I neither feel ripped off, I'm happy with my purchase as a matter of fact, nor do I expect any less attempts to sell boosters out of Wizards. But the fact is, the game hands out random boosters if you just play and win, online or against the AI, so your starting deck doesn't stay weak for long. To me, this is way better than previous years where you had to play single player to unlock single cards.In conclusion, I've wasted hundreds of dollars on real boosters in my youth, getting them for free is actualy rather refreshing. Personally, I would not pay for the card collections, I'd rather search for the cards in-game. The game otherwise is just like previous years with the exception of the less memorable game modes, so if you liked an earlier one, this is about the same.Other thought:If ever there was a game that needed Steam trading integration, this is it. I want to sell my rares!			"

												There seems to be a great deal of negativity surrounding Magic 2015, but as a player who's dabbled with the card and PC games over the years, I'll simply say this;...I like it!Sure, maybe some things are a little awkward to navigate at first, but I got used to that fast and I'm fine now thanks.  There's an awesome mode missing?  A two-headed giant or some such so you're going hate the game for that?  Ermmm, OK...that seems a little petty and weird.  There are some awesome ways to play with here regardless...We have deck construction now.  Once you reach Theros in the single player campaign, you can build and save as many decks as you wish, and change which one you wield.  However, unless you treated yourself to the Complete Bundle, you'll take a while after reaching Theros in the Campaign to unlock a great many cards to build another deck you can play with.  But you  CAN change your deck if you build one, save it and change your deck choice by going to your profile...or just click your persona image at the bottom right.To help you unlock more cards, each land you explore in the campaign has an explore bit.  You can replay this multiple times to repeatedly unlock more FREE cards.  You DON'T need to buy the Complete Bundle unless you want all the cards form the get go of reaching Theros in the campaign to deck build.  Just play to win...If you'd like to muse on which deck colour combination to start with, please take a look here; http://community.wizards.com/forum/mtg-duels-planeswalkers/threads/4107676Just...ignore the naysayers and take a look for yourself.  I think you maybe pleased it you don't broach the game with preconceptions and expectations.  That's an approach that always disappoints.  I have this game...now Hearthstone can suck it!  :P			"

												Personally, I like 2015 well enough. Granted card selection is limited, and it is even moreso, if you don't get premium boosters (I did not), but I actually like the decks I built near the end of the game. I mostly played mono white with decent amounts of life gain, and it turned some of the hardest duels into a joke (I removed and locked down Garruk's deck before he could even hit me). I have heard quite a few people complain that trading 2HG for such limited custom deck building is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but imagine what the game will be like after the expansion(s) come out; I can only imagine that the payoff for getting them will be far superior to that of buying the expansions for previous Duels titles because you will be able to use the new cards in whatever decks you want; that seems pretty cool to me and I already really enjoy the base game. Heres my pros and cons since you guys like that stuff:PROS:Cards unlock quickly enough (I unlocked them all, and it did not feel too grindy)You can design decks as you please (YOU CAN EVEN SET HOW MUCH LAND IS IN YOUR DECKS!)Single player offers a good amount of challengeCONS:Menus and animations are slightly annoyingSome people will find single player too challenging (I feel like CPU decks are stacked somewhat on the hardest difficulty)The CPU uses cards you cannot get (this is kind of annoying)I think the CPU decks have more of the same rares in them than you can put in your decks (not sure about this)The starter decks are not the best (should they be?)That all being said I should say that many complainers are ill-informed. The land system is not screwed, the game simply no longer gives you good suggestions, but you can still pick what land you wanna tap; it's just that in the previous games the computer kinda helped you pick better land combinations as defaults, but, as someone who plays with real cards, I always hated that anyway. I would also say that unlocking everything takes less time than it did in 2014, but maybe that is just my experience; I unlocked all the cards after sitting down to play the game twice (granted I did play for several hours each time). I get that it is annoying that you have to play through the first chapter before you can really start deck building, but the first chapter was kinda easy (especially in camparison to the rest of the game), and I think that it (the first chapter) takes maybe a couple of hours (if even) if you are hardcore struggling with the difficulty. Also, I have won plenty of matches without buying premium boosters, so I do not really think the game is pay to win.Anyway, I really like the game, and it is a fine time to move on from 2014, which I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of.

												Before purchasing this newest updated to MGT:DotP ask yourself this.Did you buy this game without reading a review and were looking for two headed giant mode?  Do you expect that the starter deck that you choose should win every match easily?Do you feel that are the best MGT player in the world so that this game should pose no challenge and you will win every duel?If you answered no to the first three questions stop right here and pat yourself on the back.  If you answered yes, you may find more satisfaction playing 2014.  2015 returns many features of the first MTG computer game back to the player that have been missing for a long time.  You will be asked to pick your favorite color of deck and given a few options based on that decision.  This starter deck is just like most starter decks in that it has a ton of commons, a few uncommons and a rare.  Finish the tutorial and you are rewarded with a second rare for your deck.  It will next be up to you to optimize the deck as you proceed through the story which will be challenging to start.  After each win your deck has the potential to grow in strength.  Just like in the real world you are rewarded with booster packs which does not always guarentee you a card that helps your deck.  After each plane you have the option to stay on that plane and play random matches for a plane themed booster or move on to the next plane.  Each plane has its own set of cards you can aquire and it will be up to you if you wish to continue your journey and speed through the game or to take some time and aquire additional cards to increase the power of your deck.  As with most MTG:DotP games there are a couple planes that you will traverse through and several challenges per a plane.  If you enjoy the freedom to customize your deck as you see fit and found the previous versions rather limiting then 2015 is a solid purchase.  Multiplayer to start is limited to 1 player per a deck and hopefully gets an update soon.  For the price of $10 you have the ability to get around 80% of the available cards with an additional set being only available via purchased boosters. If the idea of having to spend some extra money to have all available cards for multiplayer turns you off you may want to pass on 2015 and purchase / stick to 2014.			"

												This game is a wonderful way to bring new players to Magic: The Gathering while still being a challenge to experinced players. The new way in which the deck is customized is the best among all other Duels of The Planeswalkers and I believe is what makes this game unique among them. And for the first time since the 2012 version it's possible to make a three colored deck in DoTP. Overall I think this game is great and an imrovement over all others Duels of The Planeswalkers games.			"

												You can build your own decks now, finally!  But let's clear up what's angering people and to what i see why this is getting so many negative reviews:You must complete 2 things:  First the  tutorial.  although,  you may skip to the last battle of the tutorial,  Second you must also compete a few (i believe 3) missions of campaign before being able to create a new deck.  After that collecting cards is fast and easy.  Campaign can be replayed with a mission called  ""explore [plane name]"" i.e: Explore Ravnica, available on each set of missions for one booster pack.  There are five sets of missions via campaign.   Booster packs offer 14 cards with one rare.  That's a lot for getting cards. Multiplayer battles offer a booster pack after each win.  Have a friend?  You can easily grind matches to get boosters.   Boosters are also offered after almost all campaign missions first time through.There are many new cards and more in general from previous editions of Magic the VG.    There are so many bags of tricks available for seasoned magic players to enjoy an online version with slick U.I and graphics, mostly intelligent A.I and its relevant!   that is worth the cost of money.Vs. battles don't take 20 mins to find.There is no 2HG.  I personally hope and completely believe that fact will change in the future with a patch or possible addition of some form.  It is disappointing but, currently irrelevant to my satisfaction.Bottom Line:Whatever level of enjoyment you found from other years;  you will find  this one extremely more pleasing..  9.99 -- Worth it.

												First of all, I wrote this review after I have beaten the single player campaign, unlocked all non-premium cards, Personas, Titels and achivements exept those requireing 100 multiplayer wins.This is no ""I couldn't beat the first boss, qq."" kind of reviews. I played throgh the entire game without paying anything extra and it wasn't only managable, but also fun.If you want the tl:dr version, I will include it at the bottom of the review.At the start of the game you get asked how much expirience you allready have with Magic. And this time they really mean it. I choose ""Planeswalker""(hardest difficulty) and some of the later encounters really gave me a beating. This time the difficulty doesn't only change how well the Ai plays, but also how many strong cards they have. If you see yourself facing overwhelming odds, considder lowering the difficulty.After finishing the tutorial you get to chose your first deck. You have 10 total to choose from, one for every possible 2 color combination. During the tutorial the game briefly explains the stengths of every color and there is a short description of how the different decks play like but you cannot playtest them before locking in your choice.Once you have choosen your deck you are more or less stuck with it. Your deck are the only cards you start off with and to change it or make a new one you first have to unlock new cards. In the long run it won't matter what deck you choose from since you can unlock all non-premium cards by defeating the AI. Unlocking cards has also been speeded up from previous games. Instead of unlocking a single new card every time you defeat the ai you now get a booster containing multiple cards. It will still take some time but unlike M14 (where after 180+ hours i still haven't unlocked all the cards) it's much less of a grind.The big addition to M15 is the ability to freely build your own decks. With 30 deckslots and a nice cardpool it is what a lot of have asked for since the beginning of Duels of the Planswalker. You are free to add as many colors and lands to your deck as you like. However, beeing able to build your own custom decks isn't only upside. The overall power of the cards is lower then it was in previous versions. You can only add 3 uncommens, 2 rares or 1 mythic with the same name, to your deck. This way players can't run for example 4 Brimaz and 4 Baneslayer Angels in their deck and simply crush everything. When i first heared of this i thoght this may be dealbreaker for me but it turned out I liked it because it makes your rares actually feel rare.Some of the filter options in the deckbuilder are locked depending on your progress in the singleplayer campaign to not overwhelm new players. It's a minor annoyence for those who want to use them early in the campaign but at that point your collection shouldn't be so big as that you need them anyways.I have allready mentioned that the Ai is more challenging this time around but it's also fun playing against non-Boss encounters multiple times. Previously non-boss encountes where scripted where the AI would play the same cards on the same turns every time you faced them making them verry predictable after facing them for the first time.In M15 they now use actual decks, are no longer scripted and are a lot of fun to play against multiple times.Allthogh i enjoyed most of the changes to the game it's the same as with every other duels of the planswalker: It's taking a step in the right direction while also taking a step the wrong direction somewhere else.This time around it is the menu and it's navigation. it's the worst it has ever been and makes even trival things like changing decks a pain. You can tell it was made with tablets in mind but playing with mouse and keyboard the menu is just horrendous. It is slow, clunky and a big step backwards from M14.Gone are also Revenge mode and the challenges of previous versions. While I suppose the higher difficulty serves as an replacement for Revenge solving those unique and often crazzy puzzles of ""how to win this turn"" gave a really fun and unique spin to magic. they didn't have much replayability but i enjoyed them none the less.Two-Headed Giant, a popular 2 vs 2 gamemode is also no longer available.I will also briefly touch on premium boosters. The way I see it for 10€ or whatever the currency is you are paying Duels of the Planswalkers is a steal compared with the actuall cardgame. You even get a real booster with printed cards using the code you recieve when buying it.Premium cards act like additional dlc and for those who enjoy the game and are willing to pay more. Having additional cards is always an advantage but in this case a verry and I mean verry minor one and those premium cards are in no way required to beat the game of compete with your friends.Overall I'd say If you like magic and/or liked the previous duels you most likely will enjoy this one too. A lot of things have changed but the core, as in the actuall game, is as good as ever. But now you can build whatever you want out of the cardpool you are given.If you are new to magic and interested in it: Duels of the planswalker is the best way to get into it. It is cheaper then the printed cardgame and magic online and with the smaller cardpool it's easier to get into it without beeing overwhelmed.It's especially worth considdering if you are facing the same decks over and over again in Hearthstone and sick of waiting for curse of naxxramas. ;DI know this was a really long read and I hope you found it enjoyable and helpfull.tl;dr:the good:Free deck building!!!challenging AINo more scripted encountersthe bad:Menu hard to navigate on pcNo 2 headed giant and challenges			"

												Excelent game for the price. Perfect for casual players who want to have access to some cool cards and easy deckbuilding. I don't always have money/time/available opponents to play paper magic, and that's why I keep purchasing the new versions of the DotP series. It does not replace paper magic, the card pool is a bit limited and there are restrictions on how many copies per rare/mythic you can have in your deck. I think it helps keep the game accessible, casual, and fun. I know I'm not going to run into people in multiplayer who obliterate me by turn 3, I can reasonably expect that the games will be closer and more fun.There are cards that can only be accessed by paying, but it is not a huge number, and there are plenty of cards to play with otherwise.Took me roughly 20 hours to complete the single player campaign and collect all cards that you do not have to pay for.

												I really don't get the amount of negative reviews here from people who barely played the game. It's just too early to say its P2W or give any form of insight on how the booster system works.  Also, this is not Hearthstone this is Magic. The AI isn't hard at all, if someone is familiar with magic. I played through most of the campaign on medium difficulty  and only lost once against an AI enemy.The game has beautiful graphics and audio, as well as an clean and user friendly UI. If people really want to know if they should buy this game or not, they should wait some days to get reviews from people who played it for many hours.			"

												Magic 2015 is good value for its base game. It is not suppose to replicate the real magic experience but a more arcade like version of MTG.Duels of the Planeswalker, across its five iterations, has been created as a place where people who have never played Magic: The Gathering can learn its basic rules and strategies and make those mistakes without other people watching. Online modes are available, but in design wise Magic 2015 is at its core a single-player-focused experience.Magic is a game where strategy evolves from additional choices. It's hard to argue against with people saying that you gain more advantage by paying more money. At the same time, I feel like that impact has been minimized to the point where people are having a fantastic Magic experience just spending the $10 on the core game.Although the game has its problems, the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and future patches may add back features that players have enjoyed.As long as you don't engage with the currently available DLCs, I think the game stands on its own.

												Bought it on sale and I'm new to the series. I don't have any nostaligia for the 2014 version mentioned by so many on this board. I'm very happy with this quality product I bought and have a lot of fun already unlocking cards by playing the campaign and login to play multiplayer games to earn more booster packs (cards).I was curious and bought the 2014 version to compare. That was a big dissapointement. First of all I don't find any multiplayer matches in the 2014 version while I find every second one in the 2015 version.U cannot use your whole database of cards in the 2014 version because of some deck restrictions. In 2015 you can.In the 2014 version you cannot organize your cards and decks. In the 2015 version you can because of filters and other things to keep overview like naming your decks and see some info about your deck (strenth and weaknesses).If you buy the expansion pack ($1,59) at the moment you can unlock all cards there are in the game. The other DLC is just a quick way to unlock them without playing. I think it is very rewarding to unlock them myself so I did not buy any of the DLC.So for around 5 bucks you have a high quality product with beautifull cards and a many hours of rewarding gameplay if you are new to the genre like I am.

												First if you buy Magic 2015, just buy the 9.99 version and consider buying some boosters later on (there are a maximum of 14 boosters which will give you all premium cards).  With 9.99 spent and some grinding you can unlock 90% of the cards in the game.  Overall thoughts:  I had a very nice experience playing Magic 2015 with only a few bumps.  First and formost the game is fun to play and there are a large number of interesting PvE computer enemies and decks to play against with interesting challeneges that will often require you to shuffle your deck around some to adjust against there tactics.  Likewise once you have unlocked a fair number of cards it is extremely fun to play online multiplayer against other players and see the different decks people have built.   There are quite a number of interesting tactics which work in the multiplayer games with the free cards available.  The premimum cards allow a few other tactics but really are not required to be competatively viable in multiplayer games.  I quickly worked up 50 hours of play over a week before my vacation and had an extremely fun time playing.  If you only buy the base game at $9.99 you should have a very fun time with your money really well spent.  I strongly recommend you do NOT buy the special or complete editions of Magic as you are really just unlocking content early leading to your playtime having very few unlocks as you play through (and spending extra money on something you would unlock for free).Pros to Magic 2015:  Many PvE enemies are availble with interesting decks to play against.  The marjority of the cards can be unlocked for free.  The $9.99 purchase gives you many hours of enjoyment without requiring any addtional money spent.  The PvE game is quite challeneging and ramps up in difficulty nicely.  The updated UI plays well during games and is easy to learn.  Deck building works great and is quite balanced with the current available cards.  Multiplayer games are a blast and there are many interesting tactics that you can use.  You cannot get more copies of any card than you could put in a single deck, so you rappidly will fill out your entire card collection.  When buying premium boosters you know you will get the full set after 14 boosters exactly (you can't buy any more as your set will be complete).Cons to Magic 2015:   Difficulty can be very high early for some players (lower the difficulty to the lowest when you start out).   Once you complete the tutorial you are locked to your current starter deck.   It takes a while to buildup enough boosters to build a new deck/color approach.   There are less immidiate features and game modes than past Planeswalker games.   Premium cards cost quite a bit for what ultimately is a small sub-set of the cards (~$30 for the 14 premium boosters).			"

												Magic 2015 is a game based on Magic: The Gathering where you collect cards, build decks, and battle opponents. They've made several Duels of the Planeswalkers games, and I've played all of them.Magic 2015 is a huge step forward for the series, yet also a huge step back. It's really pretty frustrating.This game finally implements the one feature people have been asking for since the beginning: the ability to make a custom deck from scratch. You get a pool of cards that builds over time, and you can build your own deck out of the cards you have, and it's a major improvement. The game has several ways of helping you build a deck, or you can hand-select each card, like I did.If it wasn't for that, though, this game would be among the worst in the series. There's a somewhat diverse selection of opponents, but the difficulty curve is all over the place. It puts you against a big green deck really early, and that's a tough deck to face with only a handful of starter cards. The puzzle mode from previous games is gone. No alternate play modes either, such as Archenemy or Sealed from previous games. What's worse is that the card pool, even when you've unlocked everything, just isn't quite diverse enough, so there aren't that many great decks you can build out of it. If my opponents can make a Sliver deck, why can't I? As a side note, the menus in this game are really slow and animation-heavy. Magic 2014 had way better UX design... what happened?The microtransactions in this game aren't as bad as the infuriating Sealed Deck mode in Magic 2014 (I'm still mad about that), but they keep a few cards locked out of the main game unless you pay more to unlock them. They're good cards, too. The white Paragon, for example, would be an amazing inclusion in the Convoke deck. I think they're usable in multiplayer too, so this could be called a pay-to-win mechanic (you can still build acceptable decks without those cards, but they really help).There are two other pluses that I haven't brought up yet. Fighting random opponents in single player is a good inclusion. I wish there were more, though... there are only a small number of opponents per location. Also, as someone that follows the card game's storyline, it's nice to see what actually happens to Garruk (and Ob Nixilis).Ultimately, I would still recommend this game if you're interested in Magic, though I don't think I could recommend it over Magic 2014. They're not asking for much with the $10 price tag, and I don't regret having spent the money on this. Magic is still fun. Also, it's nice to build decks from scratch for a change. For now, steer clear of the extra paid content.			"

												Wrote this for someone who asked on the forums. Figured I may as well copy/paste it here.The bad:UI is slow, clunky, obnoxious to navigate, and all-around one of the worst UIs I've ever seen out of a professional developer.Repeated in-game advertizements for other Magic products; these were in previous versions, but usually only appeared once at specific points in the campaign; in 2015 I get an ad screen 1 out of every 4 games.Full game experience doesn't unlock until after finishing 20% of the single-player campaign; even people who paid extra for unlocks specifically to skip the single-player have to deal with that.Usual technical issues and broken card interactions that we've come to expect from Stainless.Small number of cards locked behind a paywall; none of them are required, but some of them are quite good. Your collection will never be complete unless you shell out an extra $28.Two-headed giant game mode removed. The game was nowhere near as popular as its proponents would have you believe, but it was still fun, and the fact that it was removed does suck.Crappy starter decks; once you finish the tutorial you're stuck with whichever deck you chose until you unlock enough cards to build a better deck.The good:Game is far better optimized than previous versions, especially 2014. I can actually watch videos on one monitor and play the game on the other without having the game lag horribly this year.Full deckbuilding experience with a good variety of cards and possibly viable strategies despite the limited card pool and pay-only cards. Up to 30 slots for custom decks.Players always get priority to cast spells and activate abilities between first strike combat damage and normal combat damage; in previous versions, this only happened if a triggered ability went off during the first strike damage step.Much better single-player campaign overall; large variety of opponents, and no stacked decks for the AI this year.Unlocking cards is light years faster than in previous versions.Still the cheapest way to enjoy Magic without dipping into the legal grey area of unofficial products like Cockatrice and Magic Workstation.Overall:Solid. If they hadn't designed the UI exclusively for iPads with a focus on pretty effects at the expense of functionality, it would definitely be the best version of DotP to date.As it stands, it's still a good deal for $10.

												I started playing Magic 2014 and really liked the game itself, the interface and the strategy required to win. I just played a few houres of Magic 2015 and not just the interface, but the game structure is much better and much more instigating than 2014! The graphics are improved and the campaign method to get more cards and start with a single deck makes the game far more interesting to be played. Congratulations to Wizards! Great game!			"

												Yes they took out 2hg, but multi player still has 1v1, 3player (why?) and 4player. Its simple enough to go into a 4player game and say...""hey you two on a team, us two on a team."" I bought the 10 dollar version and being able to actually unlock packs to upgrade my deck is way more fun than 2014 unlocking a predesignated card each time, pulling 7 random cards and getting the ones you want makes it way more rewarding and kept me playing longer than i ever did in one sitting of 2014. You can skip the tutorial on the second or third mission, and get right into picking your deck, yes you have to beat the first area to unlock full customization which is lame, but its nothing that breaks the game. Overall i already have had more fun with 2015 in one day than i did in 2014.			"

												Oh boy, this game. Where do I even begin? If you're someone who's looking to get into Magic: The Gathering and heard about this title as a good way of doing so, you've been fooled. This won't win you over. And that's a shame, because it does have some things going for itself. It just represents the incredibly fun game of Magic in a very slowpaced, mindnumbingly stupid way. However, if you're someone who's already familiar to Magic: The Gathering who is just looking for a lighter version of the game to enjoy themselves with, this might be the game for you. Provided that you're the patient kind who doesn't mind overlooking the flaws and pacing of this game. And trust me, you will need that patience.Let's look at some of the pros and cons of this game:Pros:-Customizable decks. A decent card pool to choose from and many fun decks that can be created from it. This is where most of the appeal will come from, if you do decide to get it. This is its best feature and one it sorely needed. - Very fun to play with friends or even just online vs strangers. Great way to test your deck ideas and tweak them to perfection. - It's still Magic: The Gathering. If you love the game, chances are you'll love this as well. The basic concept is still fun and the card pool is decent enough that it allows you to make several fun decks and pull of many fun tricks with it. Cons:- The game handles slowly and clunky. You have to sift through various menus and options to get to where you want to go. Every. Single. Time.- No rematches. When you finish a game, the opponent disappears and you get kicked back to the opponent selection screens. If you enjoyed playing against them and would like to do so again, you can't. Unless you remember their name and try to find them that way. But who really wants to do that?- No deck selection in the lobby. Deck selection has to be done before hand and can't be changed in the lobby. If you want to change, you have to go back to the main menu, change it and then go back to Multiplayer. Why? Who greenlighted this as a good idea? Why the step back? - Premium cards locked unless you pay an additional fee. While the premium cards don't make or break the game, per se, this is still a horrible and incredibly greedy design. - The first deck you choose is literally the only deck you can play with for a substantial amount of time, so you better pick something you really love. It's very limiting and frankly a gross oversight. A big part of the appeal of this game is its versatility and by forcing one deck on the players for a substantial amount of time, you basically cheat them out of that. Final Judgment: 6.5/10. It's an improvement on the older version in some respects, and a step backwards in others. It won't win any new fans over with its current design. If you decide not to buy your way through, as I strongly recommend you do, it takes a long time and much grinding to unlock everything, but by the time you have everything, you'll be intimately familiar with the game (and its often clunky mechanics) but the endgame is where you'll have most of the fun. In short, it's like a long car ride to Disneyland. After a long, rocky, uncomfortable ride, you finally get out, itchy and sore but happy to finally be at your destination and ready to have some real fun. If you can wait that long. I'll give it a tentative thumbs up, but that's just because I'm slightly biased and hopeful for the future of this franchise, so keep that in mind.			"

												Summary: Is the game worth 10Eur? Yes, but many downsI started playing magic at Revised and owns the DoP 13, 14It is sad to see that the games gets worse and worse. DoP13 was very good with great balanced deck. Me and my friends have been having much fun in 2HG.In DoP14 they introduced some decks that were very overpowered (annhalitor deck) and the other deck couldnt do to much about it. This resulted in that me and my friends got bored very quickly. I was not fun.With DoP15 2HG is removed! Yes I am not joking.The horrible deck mixing or randomization from the other games is still here. = sometimes you play games with 20 lands and no creatures or spells OR you simply get no lands at all. Sure it COULD be the case, but it happens way to often.My main concern however is that this i a buggy console clone. You need step through alot of menues rather then reaching the main menu directly or simply click the option you want directly. Many of the built in functions will choose things for your worst. Especially mana selection. However you can hover over the card and press left Ctrl.Some of the timers take very long time considered you or the opponent have no option to do anything.BUT when I really want to cast an instant, I often end up being to late and not able to stop the timer, this is very annoying.A interesting bug was when I got cards from the deck I had played against before, a card I dont even have in my collection!!A stupid bug was that the autoland function added a swamp to my deck, when I did'nt even had a black card in it.It might be an ability that used black mana that led to this.I think it is unfortunate the game did'nt turn out better since now there is compitition (Heartstone)Instead of winning over new Magic players from Heartstone this game might actually scare them away. I don't know if this game is targeting new players. The tutorials are very simple but I think the start decks could be better. And some decks you play against are very balanced.			"

												I pre-purchased this - and nearly didn't play after reading the wave of negative reviews.  But glad I did play - it's easily the best in the series.   The 'grinding' that everyone is ♥♥♥♥♥ing about is THE GAME.  There's easily weeks of game play alone unlocking all the cards, Ive been having hours of fun doing this.  Deck building is great.  The AI is good.   The gameplay quick and intuitive.  I do agree the menus are slow and clunky.  Regarding the 'paywall'  - I'm not far enough into the game to feel I need to buy premium packs yet, I guess I'll feel the pressure online or on higher levels when I'm up against the very best decks, I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.  But for the 6.99 you'll get your money's worth - after that, if I do have to pay up,  it's probably no more expensive than buying a console game for £40, and I can't see the injustice in that if the game is worth it.

												the transitions in the menus take way too long its super annoying. if you want to unlock all the cards in the game you will have to pay an extra 13$ to buy all of the premium booster packs. also there are adss within the actual game sometimes when you explore the realms which can be a bit annoying. The deck customization is pretty awesome and much better than the previous magic games as you can make any deck you want to with all the cards in the game instead of having preset decks with minimal customization. Sadly they removed pretty much the best game mode that was in magic 2014 two headed giant though there is still a 4 player option it is free for all so kind of dissapointing.The gameplay is good. Menus Suck. Deck Customization is #1. No Two Headed Giant. Have to pay real money for certain cards.Great game improvements could be made in a lot of places though. Buy the game its fun and who knows maybe in the future the game will be updated in certain areas to make it better.			"

												This Game has some negative reveiws but I personnally like AND recommend this game.Magic 2015 is a £7 game with micro transactions. After the tutorial, The game allows you to get Booster Packs from beating your opponents and build your own deck from most/all the new sets of magic while starting you off with a deck of your choice. there are 5 planes, with 4+ Set duels for you to progress through. But, there is also an 'Explore' button that chooses a random battle for you to face that, like the set battles, give you a booster pack to open. I would talk about the Multi-Player but I haven't tried it personelly yet as I have spent my time happpily building decks and beating the main game.Now, everyone hates microtransations but I don't mind this game's micro transactions because they are not forced, during loading screens, it will either tell you about magic in general or tell you about your current scenario. The only place you'll find the Microtransactions are in the store tab of the main menu and on this page. Unlike games like Call of duty, This game doesn't mention new DLC packs or Customisation packs everytime you open one of the multiplayer menues or deny access from a lobby as it goes into a new map.Pros+ Fun Gameplay+Fair Story+Deck Customisation+Booster packs are easily obtained (as in you don't have to beat on estimation 30 battles for a Pack OF 5 CARDS, like in hearthstone)Cons-There are Microtransations-A few Bugs (Yet not game Braking and will hopefully be patched soon)			"

												Magic 2015 - two steps forward, one step back.Magic 2015 gives users what they have been screaming for ever since the first ""dules of the planeswalkers"" the ability to create your own deck. Which is sexy and awesome. BUT there is a catch.<<--microtransactions-->>yes...2015 treads the line of ""pay to win"" unless you buy the complete bundle your going to have a hard time, you get one starter deck, that is very lame. And you are going to be flogged by the AI and players (if you go online.) If your able to sack up and make it through the campain slowly unlocking boosters that oddly give you the cards you dont want, you can slowly build a deck that is able to hold its own. and yes it is very possible i purchased the 9.99 version and from my 13 hours of gameplay i am now able to win 3/5 games online and have completed 85% of the campain, not too shabby. ORi could buy all the cards right now (including the premium cards you cant unlock for free) go online look up someone elses OP deck. copy it. And be able to steam roll through the campain (which would only be for the achievements since i would have all the cards already and no longer need boosters) and be able to stay very competitive online with the best of em. And it would only take me less than an hour to so.Personally i spend enough of my money on real magic cards, so this doesnt please me, and many other users would agree.Is the game fun? yes its magic, if you like magic your gonna like this gameis deck building worth it? Yes if you enjoy building real life magic decks your gonna like this gameso yes i would recommend this to previous fans of the Magic video games and fans of Magic in general.are there more strings attatched than previous versions ? oh hell yes.Do i feel they should have made the game 15 bux and cut out the microtransaction BS? your damn straightSo the choice is up to you, Keep the hand you draw? or mulligan and wait for the eventual Magic 2016....and hope they fix things.This game JUST passed my recommend-o meter so take that as you will.P.S. Navigating through the menus is PAINFULL, i reccomend a hot cup of tea and some biscuts to help you get through it. "

												TL;DR in the front.It's like any other traditional TCG video game, you have to grind to unlock cards or pay for the full edition which comes with block sets of cards. This causes early game to be very hard/slow, but allows extra gameplay value for those who care for good deck composition (or those who have big wallets!). 7.5/10Pros:+Full deck customization allows various play styles and mixed sets to be used+Sharper, more clean look overall and menus appeal to the eye more than ever+Very large gameplay value as you can grind for cards to include into your deck and change you game plan+Amazing tutorials for beginners to learn how to play and jump straight into the action+Includes very recent cards to the actual MTG meta including cards from the entire Theros blockCons:-Slower menus, there aren't that many, but you can notice the clunkiness in it.-The attempted cash grab will affect the online meta game due to the ability to buy packs and collections-Grinding may feel like a chore at some points, especially when starting the game off-The opening decks are awful and getting more cards using them is a hassle (I recommend easier difficulties if you are desperate-No Two-Headed Giant mode meaning there are only head to head solo matches left for online play.Now for the review:The menus seem to move slower than in the last game due to the enhance visuals that make them look cooler than they actually are. It only takes moments to get into the action so that is negligible. The gameplay itself is VERY TOUGH given the circumstances when you start. You are given a choice from a few premade starter decks, and are shoved along into the hellish Magic universe. As you would expect, a premade starter deck will be buns and the computer will not care one bit, and that's the point. You grind to get somewhere, if you don't want to grind in a TCG game, you must have been living under rocks because that's how they are normally formatted.What set this game apart from it's previous installments is that you now have FULL deck customization at your disposal, allowing you to not work off a shell and give you the freedom to create decks using cards from a wide range of previous sets that have come out in the last couple of years (even including the Theros block). Creating the decks however is dependent on how much grinding you are willing to do to get the cards, or how much money you want to spend to get the cards. BUT THIS MEANS IN NO WAY THAT YOU HAVE TO BUY PACKS. They are simply cash grab packs that you may unlock by simply PLAYING THE GAME YOU BOUGHT. Most vets of the series may complain that they have to grind hour upon hour to play online with a decent deck to stand up to online competition, in that case either buy the complete bundle or actually sit around and play Magic like your inner nerd wants you to.The opponents are more versatile, they no longer run on the ""Encounter"" system as they did in the previous installments and now have a wider variety of gameplay/decks so you aren't playing against the same AI that does the same exact thing every time.Overall the game is not too much better due to some of the cons killing the pros in the long run, but if you're looking for a MTG game that lets you play MTG in the most realistic format, this is the game for you.

												I came into this game very skeptical and at first I didn't like it.However, after playing it for some time, I've really come around.The freeform deckbuilding is actually very good, and once you actually get some cards, making new decks is quite fun, and it makes the multiplayer a lot more varied than previous editions, where you could tell a player's strategy right away from the color he was playing.The biggest disservice this game does is that the opening decks are very poorly made.  Getting through the single player campaign the first time is just terrible, because your deck is really just bad compared to others.  This gets better once you get some cards, but getting to that point sucks.Yes, there is premium content, but as far as I've seen I can still make good decks while just pretending it doesn't exist.  If you want the premium content it's an extra $25 ish dollars, so that really does suck.  But overall I feel the game is being hated on more than is deserved.			"

												This is the best DotP I've played, and I was playing a lot of 2014 and 2013.-Most possitive thing is that, you can build your own decks by useing 60 from almost 1.000 cards!-Player profile is really expanded, there is so much informations about your stats and playstyle.-A lot of new AWESOME cards, to♥♥♥♥♥♥off your opponents.-Don't be afraid of boosters, u can unlock +/-850 cards very fast for free, you get one booster for one win, so unlocking cards is A LOT faster then in previous versions!-You dont need premium cards, to crash your opponents, even since they are really cheap. -> its +/-120 cards.-Also i found Al better then before, mainly because u can play vs. your own decks.-Leaderboards is finally fixed.Only one thing that i miss a bit, is 2HG.

												Magic 2015 - two steps forward, one step back.Magic 2015 gives users what they have been screaming for ever since the first ""dules of the planeswalkers"" the ability to create your own deck. Which is sexy and awesome. BUT there is a catch.<<--microtransactions-->>yes...2015 treads the line of ""pay to win"" unless you buy the complete bundle your going to have a hard time, you get one starter deck, that is very lame. And you are going to be flogged by the AI and players (if you go online.) If your able to sack up and make it through the campain slowly unlocking boosters that oddly give you the cards you dont want, you can slowly build a deck that is able to hold its own. and yes it is very possible i purchased the 9.99 version and from my 13 hours of gameplay i am now able to win 3/5 games online and have completed 85% of the campain, not too shabby. ORi could buy all the cards right now (including the premium cards you cant unlock for free) go online look up someone elses OP deck. copy it. And be able to steam roll through the campain (which would only be for the achievements since i would have all the cards already and no longer need boosters) and be able to stay very competitive online with the best of em. And it would only take me less than an hour to so.Personally i spend enough of my money on real magic cards, so this doesnt please me, and many other users would agree.Is the game fun? yes its magic, if you like magic your gonna like this gameis deck building worth it? Yes if you enjoy building real life magic decks your gonna like this gameso yes i would recommend this to previous fans of the Magic video games and fans of Magic in general.are there more strings attatched than previous versions ? oh hell yes.Do i feel they should have made the game 15 bux and cut out the microtransaction BS? your damn straightSo the choice is up to you, Keep the hand you draw? or mulligan and wait for the eventual Magic 2016....and hope they fix things.This game JUST passed my recommend-o meter so take that as you will.P.S. Navigating through the menus is PAINFULL, i reccomend a hot cup of tea and some biscuts to help you get through it. "

												The game is slow paced, and there is a lot of grinding but none of that bothered me.  What did was losing all of my decks, cards, game progression etc.  One second I was playing fine, the next the game crashes, then it was like I hadnt played at all.

												A vastly improved game over its prequels. For the first time you can build your own decks with the booster packs you win. Still doesn't nearly compare to the real life version of MTG but for what it's worth, it does a great job at providing some entertainment to both new and veteran players.			"

												I know most people so far are upset by this game, but I have a different opinion. I actually like this game, the fact that it finally has a deck builder is great. That being said, there are some serious problems.Firstly, the menu feels like it is being controlled by a TV remote ( it responds sort of... when it wants to). The second big issue is that the Premium boosters do feel like pay to win.Maybe I got lucky or something but I did not run into the issue that my starter deck was weak. I chose the Red & Black deck and it worked very nicely to unlock other cards.To wrap things upProsFinally a deck builder that actually works.Unlockable cards (it might just be me but I enjoyed that mechanic)It's a fun game for ONLY $10 (I personally have gotten at least $10 worth of fun out of this game.)ConsMenu is slow... really slow sometimesPremium Boosters are essentially pay to winNo built in resolution setting? (Unless I missed it. Also I should not have to change an ini file to change my resolution,)			"

												PROS-deckbuilding is fun-the enemy AI is good for the most part-multiplayerCONS-the campain is still scripted in a way that gives the NPCs a smooth flow of lands and casts(especially counters) while youre just sitting there either land starved or cast starved, most of the time-you need to grind the campain to have access to all the cards-you need to stick with the starter deck you choose and(a.) they are not the same as the intro packs(b.) they suck-limited game modes. was expecting a true multiplayer sealed play-land taping AI is pitiful but still, its fun, quite a bit frustrating in single player but fun.

												Great for beginners, awesome for veterans, fun all around. I've been playing for about a year and a half and have picked up quite a bit, and I would say this is much better than the previous titles in that you may now build decks from scratch and earn booster packs. Gameplay is smooth no matter how good you are, and it never ceased to be interesting. One game your opponent may be bombarding you with white weenies, the next they may be totally landlocked. That's just pure Magic right there, and that's exactly what this game is.			"

												I bought Magic 2015 on the 2nd day it was released and it was totally worth it. One of the biggest reasons why is because of Wizard's decision to do away with pre constructed decks. Magic 2014 had great pre constructed decks but it made me feel lazy and uncreative. Magic 2015 lets you choose your starter deck and allows you to modify it and make it stronger as you play through the campaign. I just beat the campaign and it was my deck building decisions that made me feel like I had actually accomplished something.			"

												Magic 2015 has it's ups and downs. Firstly they finally added a feature that lets a players build their own deck from scratch. When starting out you are able to choose a starting deck of your choice. As you win against AI's and multiplayer games you will receive a booster pack every time you win. These booster packs contain around what I assume is 7-10 cards. Now the down side to magic 2015 is that they removed 2 headed gaint. Magic regulations are that in a 2 headed-gaint game a teammate may not use anymore than 4 of the same cards. Since decks are now custom built it would have been extreamly hard to put 2 headed-gaint into the game. Another downside is that the menue for the game can be laggy and slow. There are times where you might have click a lot to navigate to certain places.They also did a really good job of balancing out the cards which I felt like was a problem in magic 2013. Some people have been mentioning that there is a micro-transacting option that allows you to use actual money to buy you boosters and have been complaining about that. It's just basically sort of like a shortcut if you dont want to take the actual time to earn all of the cards. I would highly recommend magic 2015 just for the fact that you do have the custom-built deck option in this one.			"

												I do like this game as i am a big fan of MTG, but on the warning that it is kind of limited, the ability to creat your own decks is cool but the game only supplies you with around 500 different cards, and it doesnt even have all of the cards which have been released in the magic 2015 booster packs IRL. On top of that the game is very limited in multiplayer to just 1-4 player free-for-all which is quite annoying as 2 headed giant was one of my favourite game modes. I dont know if they will be adding more cards and multiplayer game modes in the future but at the moment i would still reccomend magic 2014 over this.			"

												First of all, I dont know why there are so many people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about This game. You are never going to get The same experience online as you are with the Table top card game. Srsly.... Stop hoping and dreaming for a game that would never probably exist, Wizards of the coast is a Business and to be honest they have made litereally one of the Best card games in existance. With that being said, This is a pretty solid game if you are an actual player of magic. If you have a 100,000 cards In real life and you want to be able to Make Decks With cards from every series. Then your Hoping and dreaming for something thats never going to be made. This game Delivers magic the gathering to those who want to play it and dont have the time to go to a Gaming store to find matches. Micro transactions... Hmmm... I think people are forgetting that while 5 dollars for card collections ( or any set for that matter ) , IRL those collections cost  over 200+ dollars. And thats not even for a Play set thats just one copy of every card... So you can stop complaining about that.the game costs 10 dollars, And the Card game itself in real life costs ALOT more than that. So if your trying to cheap out by playing magic 2015 expecting for 10 dollars to have a digital Version of every card then your just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I think people Confuse wishful thinking with Reality. There is a great deal of cards, Deck building is pretty Awesome. Game was fun, and its pretty aweful that people would flat out say SOOO much bad stuff about it when most of it is Unfounded. You have the option to face hundreds of thousands of people online in magic without having to buy every card, and go and pay a Fee to enter a torny at some Comic store.... Weigh in the price of this game IRL then Complain about microtransactions.			"

												I've been a huge fan of the MTG franchise recently and I have also played MTGO (Magic the Gathering Online) and I can understand why they restrict this games so much compared to how real magic is played and my only wish for this game is that they finally add in some Planeswalkers. So hopefully next year what I think are some pros and cons of this game are:Pros:- Fully customizable deck building compared to its predecessors- Great way to learn about Magic for beginners- AI's seems to be more random where as to other versions they had pre-set plays so they were much easier to predict- Finally free from pre-set decks is a big plus for me- You now earn booster packs and not singles and it feels GREAT! to open every new booster I earn from winsCons:-Slow menu transitions- Resolution options are a pain because I like to max out my settings to the highest quality but every time it gets reset when I exit the game- Almost no multiplayer modes (However I do love the approach of a ranking system built into the game now)- Not enough cards in this game's set collection in my opinionI don't believe this version of the game is pay-to-win as people claim it is, I believe Magic requires skill, strategy, and card synergy along with knowledge to become a better player. The micro-transaction isn't new to game its been there from its older versions. Overall Score for this game would be 7 out of 10 if they added more multiplayer modes than I would boost my score to an 8 but I figure they are planning to add more cards to the set in the future :)			"

You can't even build a working deck that isn't a joke in a real game, in real life. Also, the fact that cards are stuctured all wrong (commons upto 4, uncommons upto 3, rares upto 2, mythic only 1) is stupid.

												Alright, i don't normally post reviews but with all the controversy i think i'll throw my two cents in.WotC did exactly what they set out to do with this one. They gave us a large pool of cards and said make some stuff.This title is getting a lot of hate and downvotes because people are mad about two headed giant and an alternate style of play are not present. These are the same people who have been complaining about how they want to be able to make thier own decks for the past 4 years. They give you what you want and you still complain. How irritating. Moving on.The boosterpacks you can buy for $2.00 are in a seperate pool from the unlockable pool. As someone who has bought all 14 I can easily tell you the premium pool is not some amazing set of cards. In fact i feel there are only around 9 cards of worth in the entire pool. Aside from that you get to pick a starting deck featuring your favorite guild.( OMG YAY!). During the first 4 matches you will be stuck with this damned thing. Yes they all suck. Yes it is rather challenging to get past this.( Personally enjoyed the hell out of not knowing what was in my deck.) After you complete the innistrad block you gain access to all the cards you've unlocked thus far and begin the grind. As an avid player of all the electronic titles and paperback i completely enjoyed this title.TLDRPROS:-Fully custom deck-Story was interesting-The visuals on the ui are beautiful-Finding out i have been pronouncing garruk's name wrong for 8 years. (spell it Garrek you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s)CONS:New UI is slow and sometimes seemingly unresponsive.-Multiplayer games are somewhat laggy when you have a considerable amount of cards on the field-The timer for triggers and spells are sometimes too quick to stop time and respond-Multiplayer doesn' hae an aftergame lobby, which in turn makes it hard to keep playing with the same people and make friends.I hope this helps anyone who is looking to buy this game.-ZellTheCurse			"

												Firstly Campaign is very short and the plotline is very thin, though enjoyable, it lacks anything different from previous games. In fact it lacks alot from previous MTG, I feel theres not alot to do once the single player is completed. Challenges & Planechase would of been a nice addition. Deck building, although a much wanted feature, lacks alot. The card pool is minimal and doesn't allow for alot of variation, the collections feel like they're pre-built decks from previous games.Multiplayer gets boring quickly, 1v1 doesn't feel that competitive whilst 4v4 is a bore. No 2HG is a big let down.Lots of features are broken, namely the shop and also a click to see the leaderboards results in CTD.Interface looks very polished and probably the best of all the MTG thus far, though a little slow and unresponsive at times.Overall I would reccomend this game now, as its only in its infant years it has lots of potential and WoTC have plenty of time to mature it.

This edition has some improvement over Magic 2014, you can build your own deck, and you unlock a whole booster pack when you win a game, instead of just randomly unlock one card for your pre-built deck. That being said there is a lot of downsides to the game, It honestly feels a bit clunky after playing 2014 including a fog around the edge of the screen, and general slowness in changing between steps.  There is no true window mode, which means if you're playing on dual screens it is stuck on the primary monitor.      It is also irritating to  see  your opponent play a card and think, ‘That would be perfected for White Red deck’, only to find out you can never have it. Though apparently you can hack the game to allow access it. The starting deck is also very low powered, though once open a booster pack or two you can start amping up. I am ambivalent  towards this, as this fit most CCG style games i have played, you buy a fairly basic starter deck’  and then buy booster packs to upgrade or modify it to suit your gameplay style.     The multiplayer almost seems to have taken a step back, as there is no longer a two headed hydra (two on two) game play, you have to leave the match to change decks, and you have to beat the first camping boss to unlock the multiplayer. Finally it still has some of the issues I had from 2014 including no option to turn off the timer in multiplayer. If i’m playing against my friends, we’re chatting and hanging, no need to feel rushed, let me set the game up with no timer, I can just yell at my friends to go. Where as if I am playing against a random person then I should be able to choose to set the game up with the timer on.        All in all  a solid if generic Magic game for the price.

												It's a decent start, it took them a long time to figure out we like making our own decks. now they just need to add things like co-op player battles, arch-enemy mode, and stuff that we liked from previous games. hopefully they'll add them to this one but for now it's just a decent game.

												People are complaining alot about the 2015 game, but i think most are on the hate train and although the game isnt perfect its alot of fun. Yes you have to play alot to unluck all standard card (and premium card must be bought), But isnt that the point in RL magic aswell? If u want a great deck in RL u need to spend money aswell...I saw review that were way off, you can grind boosterpacks in SP.And although i dont like the fact you can choose only 1 deck and have to do it with that the rest of the game till you get more cards, i think it still is alot of fun. For 10 euro i dont think its expensive compared to RL magic, and if people like it they can spend all they want in RL. "

												I really don't know why the front page is full of negative reviews. I have played Magic (the physical one) for many years and when it finally came to steam in the dotp format I was overjoyed to play it again. Every year a new one comes out, with better features than the last. Do have to agree there's alot of hate for not having the 3 game modes in the 2013 version but that doesnt affect me as I enjoy this for single player mostly.I also never buy any card packs because having to play the game to earn cards keeps me coming back and I usually rack up 30 or so hours per release which for £6.99 (in my book) is great value for money.

												Firstly Campaign is very short and the plotline is very thin, though enjoyable, it lacks anything different from previous games. In fact it lacks alot from previous MTG, I feel theres not alot to do once the single player is completed. Challenges & Planechase would of been a nice addition. Deck building, although a much wanted feature, lacks alot. The card pool is minimal and doesn't allow for alot of variation, the collections feel like they're pre-built decks from previous games.Multiplayer gets boring quickly, 1v1 doesn't feel that competitive whilst 4v4 is a bore. No 2HG is a big let down.Lots of features are broken, namely the shop and also a click to see the leaderboards results in CTD.Interface looks very polished and probably the best of all the MTG thus far, though a little slow and unresponsive at times.Overall I would reccomend this game now, as its only in its infant years it has lots of potential and WoTC have plenty of time to mature it.

												I have been seeing quite a few negative reviews on this game, and I agree that it has its problems. Biggest issue I had was that if you selected a deck that you did not enjoy off the start there was no way to undo it and select a different one. The game still does a good job of teaching new people the basics and concepts of magic, as I had 2 people I am living with learn from it. And the game is not so difficult that you can not beat it with what it gives you, as I (18+ years of exprience) completed the game on max difficulty without purchasing any cards and my brother (3+ years of experience) also beat the game without issues. The only other issues I really have with this game is the push to get more money out of it by forcing people to buy boosters to complete the card collection and giving the NPC's cards that you cannot obtain in the game. I still feel it is a good learning tool, a fun game to play through, and worth the time and money. Hope this helps.			"

												Very solid entry, solid tutorial, and solid multiplayer, I'd have to recommend it to those who have had an interest in getting started on MtG for the first time. The multiplayer is great, although I don't quite understand why it would be restricted until after the first set of duels is accomplished, maybe they just wanted to make sure new players would have a solid understanding of how the various card mechanics function. If you want to do serious multiplayer then I recommend just getting started on the physical card game, as thats pretty much where WotC makes the most money on this game, these virtaul DotPW's games are just ment as an introductory start to the physical game at a reduced cost. However if you just wanna play casually then this game is perfect for that purpose. Some consider it a pay to win game, although most if not all the cards can be unlocked via gameplay. The starter decks are kind of screwy but if you know what you're doing its not so bad. Its a shame that most people who play video games can't really afford to do so, if 10$ is too much for anything less than perfection you probly shouldn't buy it.			"

												I've been reading a lot of bad reviews, or what I would call negative reviews on Magic 2015. I don't understand why this game is getting all the hate when I feel it's the best one yet. I get that a lot of people don't like the whole redesign of the game. Not having pre-created decks like it's predecessors. They think it's harder to get a good deck but it's really not. You still just gotta play through the campaign. Unlock your boosters and build a card collection, instead of a unlocking decks and building a deck collection, then you go and create decks out of the card pool. It's not even slower like some have said. Yeah you are kinda stuck to your starter deck color choice until you at least finish the first plane but it's no different then having 1 maybe 2 decks unlocked by the point in any of the previous games. Plus before you finish the final tutorial match you can change and re-choose which deck before you continue. A lot of people don't realize this and/or are too lazy to spend the time and practice with all the starting color combos then complain when they don't like their choice. That's your fault if you didn't. That being said all the decks can win just fine. I think the redesign of the game was an eventual change and they should've done it sooner. They finally added a Create a Deck feature that fans have been asking for since the first game. It was the biggest requested feature and we now have it! And yet people complain about it because it's not like the other games... Seriously? It doesn't restrict you to a pre-created decks and small card pools that you can change maybe 20 cards in and out but instead a much larger card pool of all different colors. The only restrictions are;A) What you can make work. If you can make a viable 5 color deck nothing is stopping you from doing so. If you would rather  make a 3 color deck and it works nothing is stopping you. If you just want a simple mono color deck go ahead. Still if you want the standard two color combo deck you can do that too. They've opened up your options and give you the tools to make the deck you want, albeit even if it's from a limited card pool still but it's much larger than any of the previous games.B) The unnecessary restrictions on card rarity and how many you can have in a deck. The official rule of having 4 copies of one specific card in a deck isn't how they chose to do it unfortunately. You are allowed the normal 4 of any one card as long as it's a common. You are only allowed to add 3 of any one card if it's uncommon, 2 if it is a rare, and only may have 1 mythic rare in a deck. I understand what they are trying to do by keeping it balanced or not allowing too many powerful cards but I disagree with doing so. It's balanced already if everybody is playing by the same rules and is allowed to have the same 4 of any card. If my friend puts 4 mythic rares of specific card in his deck for a better chance to draw that one it's fair because i can add 4 mythic rares to mine too if i so choose. It's all about creating a better deck, better card synergy anyways. What combos and what cards work together. I think they should reconsider this for the next game and just stick with the official rules of 4 of any one card.  Now I want to talk about this notion that they just want to suck more money out of players. ""microtransactions."" For as polished a card game as MTG is. With satisfying competitive card-duelling and great art $10 is more than fair price. And that's ALL YOU HAVE TO PAY. You can unlock every card in the game by doing campaign and going back and doing explore plane and facing a random opponent (this years version of challenges). If you just want to zip through the campaign and then jump on multiplayer you can unlock cards that way too. By playing multiplayer duels against friends and winning you get a random booster pack. All the cards in the game can be unlocked except the premium card pool, which is a small 50 cards or so side pool of cards they offer to players who want to further expand their collection and have more options when creating decks BUT i can tell you right now you don't need any of them cards to make plenty, AND I MEAN PLENTY of decks.I have beat the game's campaign and am currently unlocking the rest of the cards, my friend already beat the campaign and unlocked every single card in the game and never had to pay anything but the price of the base game. We both have been making tons of decks with just the cards we unlocked and we're beating players who have boughten premium cards. So listen people if you put in the time with the game's campaign and play a lot of games you can definitely unlock the cards to make plenty of good decks, different colored decks, and not have to spend a dime extra than the price to buy the game. If you want to you can and that's fine it might let you make your deck better but It's definitely not pay to win. Trust me. The other common complaint I hear is ""fewer features than its predecessors,""  Yeah so they took out some modes like Planechase, Archenemy, and two headed giant but so what. Magic is mostly a 1vs1 game anyways and they still give you the ability to do a 3 or 4 player match, 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1 and 4 player matches are better that way than on teams. I too wish they would add in more casual multiplayer formats so we have more ways to play and maybe they will yet but it doesn't take away from the game.Overall it's a great game, probably the best one yet, and I've had no real problems with the game. Except for a few issues with how smart it is by auto tapping the lands and not doing it right but they give you a option to choose which to tap so you can manage it manually yourself but I would think the A.I. would be smart enough to tell I have a green colored card left in my hand and to not use all my Forests in play but it don't. That and I have had issues with applying settings and the windowed mode not working right now but my friend hasn't had these same issues. I just can't believe how overwhelmingly negative everybody is on this game. They finally give us the one feature everybody has been asking for and everybody hates the game. Full deck creation is the one feature everyone's wanted since the first game and now people complain because it's not as simple as previous editions where they made the deck for you? Pfft. GTFO Tips/Suggestions:Use this site[community.wizards.com] to help choose your starting colors, and remember you can re-choose and keep re-doing the final tutorial battle against the cyclops to test out each starter deck BUT once you click continue you're locked in and cannot change colors. Then you must win to unlock booster packs and build your card collection if you wanna make more decks or different color decks. Immediately after you've chosen a starter deck go through Innastrad and unlock Theros. Then if you like your deck you can continue through the campaign or you can start doing Explore Innastrad and Explore Theros to unlock boosters and you should quickly have a semi decent collection to be able to make a new deck. You'll want to complete the campaign though because each plane offers a different card pool so to get all the different cards you'll need to unlock the different planes by progressing through the campaign. The above link also shows a list of unlockable cards for each area (plane) sorted by color at the bottom of the post below the starter deck lists. So if you're trying to get a playset of a specific card make sure your in the right area. The cards in the boosters are not random, if you win in Innastrad you'll be getting cards from the Innastrad pool of cards. You can view them all in the Card Collection page on the main menu.Take some time and look ahead like i did before choosing your colors and you'll enjoy the game more than if you just pick willy nilly.

												Fun ARCADE version of MTG.  This is not the tabletop game, nor like magic online.  Deck customization is not there, and some of the rules are streamlined for ARCADE play.  If you want a quick 15-30 minute MTG match, then you'll have fun.biggest complaints i have seen, and my comments:Menus can be slow - its not a dealbreakerMy intro deck was black/white - it sucked, still sucks, but ive slowly made it better - making bad decks better is fun to meMana tapping took a little while to figure out - (press left cntrl when you are hoving over a spell beofre you cast it, and it will display your mana tapping options in purple)  now that i know what key to use its finei havent tried multiplayerSome of the decks you go up against are wacky - but fun to watch develop - the AI tries and mill you to death or take you out with a 22/22 trample hydra lolwell worth it for 9.99 - im having fun			"

												People are pretty mad about this game. Some of their complaints are even legitimate, like the lack of 2HG. I have no idea what brought that decision around, but it was a poor one. Even still, this game is *easily* worth ten dollars. You get a whole lot of Magic for your ten dollars. Sure, the starter decks aren't super strong, but isn't that the point? Upgrading your deck, trying out new ideas as new cards are available, that's what's fun about it. It does have a few issues, but seriously. It's TEN DOLLARS. That's like one meal eating out, at a cheap place.			"

												I love MTG. My issue with this game is that they do not allow you to play with all M15 cards. In fact, you have to purchase them as an additional DLC. For me, there is no substitute for playing MTG in-person with a friend at the coffee shop or local game store so I guess this game is really only for people who might otherwise never play Magic. In that sense, it is a good introduction to the game. I would suggest, instead, going to your local game store and purchasing (for $20) the 2015 Magic Core Set, which gives you something like 250 cards. That way, you can play MTG the way it was meant to be played (in -person) and avoid the headache of this digital ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.			"

												I do not like this one as much as magic 2014, but you can completely build and customize your own decks which is great. You do NOT get all the cards that there are in real life. i was greatly disappointed to see that there were only a few elf cards and not many of Jace's deck. I understand that this has different decks than the previous game, but I was still disappointed. It says full deck customization which is true but it only gives you so many cards to choose from.... yes i'd recommend it but i'd say get magic 2014 before this one, that one is better by a long shot.

												Duel of the Planeswalkers 2015 is a casual Magic experience that finally includes an aspect that players have been looking for; deckbuilding and collecting has returned. The game plays out a little like the old Microprose game. After a tutorial, you are handed a deck of two colors of your choosing, which is somewhat mediocre, and from there, you can explore the planes of the multiverse, and face the unique challenges of the campaign to collect cards, and improve your deck. The experience overall is pleasant, even if some color combinations are a bit more challenging than others, and with the option of unlocking the card pool early, you can have interesting and challenging duels with other players online. Overall, you get a lot of value out of this title. The challenges are fun, and the little campaign story is a nice tie-in with the Meta Story, which is a fun touch.There are the typical DotP complaints here. The Interface is confusing at first, and there are times where you are forced to wait when you would rather be skipping, and there are probably settings that let you change this somewhat, but they are not easily seen. The game also feels like it wants to use a control pad over key and mouse, but it works fine either way.Graphically, we are pretty and we are boring at the same time. The Battlefield is a dull silver/gray that becomes a bluish tint when you react to the opponent's spells. The cards are nice looking, and I get a thrill when Guttersnipe attacks with it's little lightning attack. Overall, if you are patient, the combat animations, while repetitive, feel good, particularly if you have board wide effects going off.Overall, if you are into card strategy games, Magic the Gathering, or are just looking for a casual fantasy experience, you likely will enjoy your time with this title.

												Was slightly worried about all the negative feedback in the comments however after buying and spending a few hours playing the game I wasnt dissapointed. It took a little more time to get started when compared to the 2014 game however this opens up the booster pack concept that was intruduced previously. Didnt have a lot of problems progressing either dispite the terrible and very vague starting decks you must choose from. Finish the first 4 or 5 matches with poor cards and you unlock the full deck editor. This is the point when you will notice a lot more cards coming in. Buying the base 9.99 game gets you everything you need if your willing to grind a bit for the cards.Con'sThe game is more focused on selling microtransactions over the previous games. Deck packs you can purchase have a poor discription so you dont know what to expect. Options are limited. No option for random colour specific packs. 1.99 price tag for 10 cards that could be total garbage and nothing saying your guarenteed 1/10 rare. Soundtrack in my opinion was not as good as the 2014 game either.			"

												At first glance this game appears to be ""Pay-to-Win"" but after playing it for some time now,  I realized the following :1.) There are 6 card pools in this game - InnistradTherosRavnicaShandalarZendikarPremium2.) 5 of the 6 card pools are completely free as long as you are willing to invest the time to play games and win. You get a booster pack of 10 cards for each victory within the ""Explore Realm"" mode. You get a smattering of cards here and there for playing the campaign as well.3.) I unlocked 4 of the 5 Realms for free (I bought Innstrad for 5 bucks before I realized we were getting free booster packs for winning within the ""Explore Realm"" mode). So WoTC / Stainless has given away 5 of the 6 card pools. 4.) I also unlocked 14% of the premium pool for free along the way (random draws in the free booster packs I was unlocking) 5.) There is nothing game breaking in the Premium Card Pool. I have competed quite well w/o having the premium cards.So overall I can not honestly say this is ""Pay-to-Win.""  I think WoTC was more than generous to make 5 of the 6 card pools unlockable and even allow a small chance of getting premium cards in your random draws (In the booster packs). As far as the game itself .... it is merely a re-skin of the last 3 editions with the same mechanics and glitches. Some minor cosmetic alterations have been added. The game table is drab grey with confusing geometric designs on it. The table now opens up and makes a huge red line across the table for Combat. Clunky mechanic IMO. the game menus are absolutely horrible. They are slow and come with an annoying ""Muwaaaaaoohhhhhhhh"" type deep bass sound that will drive one insane after a few minutes lol. Overall though ... for 10 bucks and the ability to get most the cards for free .... this is a no brainer for any Magic fan.** EDIT** 2-8-2015 -  This game has been out now about 7 months and it handed people what they were clamoring for from the release of the original DoTP ... Full Deck Customization. The ability to build your own deck from scratch. All the crying and complaining for years people did to get this ability and all one sees across the table are what I call ""Cookie Cutter Clone Decks."" Copies of the pre-built decks within the game with slight modifications to them. I can count on 1 hand how many original themed decks I have seen across the table from me in MP games. It is like people lack the imagination, skills or abilities to create something original. You know from the 1st land practically what type of deck someone is playing anymore ... it has become that predictable. I see this problem as a direct result of the publics' general ""I want the easiest possible win with the least amount of work"" type mentality anymore. There is a sore lack of creative genius out there as it pertains to deck making. This problem will not be solved anytime soon as long as the general public is wanting that easy win quick gratification for little to no work type mentality. Now to sit back and watch the guilty burn down the house with their flames lol.			"

												I've been hearing a lot of negativity towards this edition of magic the gathering etc etc long title blah. Anyways, this is the first mtg online game I have ever purchased after 8 years of playing paper magic. Is it a comprable experience? Hardly. BUT it is still a reasonably fun game if you enjoy magic despite the faults that I can agree exist.I'd put this into a list but screw lists, they're classist and I dont dig that, maaaan.So some nice things in no particular order are that the game looks pretty sweet sometimes. If you never had to touch the menu I'd say the menu was great, but you do so that kind of ruins it. Seriously. Dont even TRY to menu with the mouse.Continuing on this sweetness, the cards themselves are great looking as usual, and the customization of avatars and deck boxes are pretty wide and pleasant. If you love magic like I do, you'll also pee your pants a little when opening a new pack. 9.99 to open like 50 packs (sure they're online packs, but whatever) is pretty sweet. And if you need your fix like I do, 2 dollars for premium packs is not TOO terrible, particularly because you'll only need to lay down like 20 bucks for all of them.Lastly, while the selection of cards is a touche dissapointing and baffling at times, I think that the selection also stimulates some creativity. I got like 30 hours of this game (as of writing) by making all sorts of decks that I can and seeing what works and what doesnt. Its surprising how deep this game can get with 400 cards, and while it would be nice if they gave you the selection that your CPU enemies are offered, its still pretty great.Bad stuffs be down here, so if you think this game blows skip all those things I said before and read this part. Unless you already read it, then good, because ha ha I made you maybe think positive thoughts about this game. Okay.So the menus are baad like a drunken goat. You click and click all over and sometimes it registers and sometimes it takes you somewhere you didnt want to go and... Just read any other review, its one part I think they all got right.Another problem is the AI. During the early game (Before you've made a jacked deck) the opponents decks are STACKED. It took me longer than it should have to beat the first plane almost entirely because my deck was underpowered in comparision. I LIKE that you start with a somewhat weak deck and have to build it up on your own... but the enemy should have weaker early decks to compensate for it. This was some really poor design.Finally, there should be more cards, and you should get more than two rares, one mythic, and three uncommon, because seriously what is this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I hope they do SOMETHING about that or I'll be butt hurt. I want my four Baneslayers. Please, Wizards. Deliver.Alright, so thats my review, and for my conclusion, I'll say this:Its a good spend of 10 dollars if you really like magic and cant find people to play with all the time. I feel that a lot of people are giving it a harder time than they should, and while there are some cons, I think there are more pros than people give it credit for. There's a good deal of custimization. Online isn't too much of a pain, although more options would be nice. The selection of cards is both constricting and liberating, forcing you to play a little differently than normal and maybe experiment a little. Is this a good thing? In some ways yes, and in others no. I think this game is a bit of a mixed bag, but if you shake it a little then I've found more good things than ill comes out of it.The menus are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible though. Heard the old ones are worse, so there's that.Hope I could help.			"

												I was looking through the reviews and I don't think people are giving this game enough credit. For starters, I saw a lot of reviews stating that the game is ""absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; and I would have to disagree. Some people are upset because there is an option for microtransactions. While this might seem like a money grab, it necessarily isn't. Keep this in mind, the microtransactions are there for people who do not have time to play the game as frequently as others. It has been stated in a few forums that a player can unlock every single card in the game just by playing the game, thus making the microtranasctions an option and not a ""pay to win"" mechanic. Let's take a look at Hearthstone, Blizzard's card game. They have have a similar formula to this game in that you can unlock every card in the game by playing, or by spending money through microtransactions. There are professional players who haven't spent a dime on the game, and they are just as good as the players who have spent money on the game. It just proves that in order to be a good player you need skill, and the same goes for this game. While expendable income would help one acquire the cards faster, it is in no means necessary. Moving on, another topic I saw in the negative reviews, is that the starting decks are awful. While it might be a bit unfair to not be told what cards are in your deck before you pick it, the decks are not aweful. As an example, I chose the rakdos starting deck and beat all of Innistrad, Theros, and some of Ravnica on the hardest difficulty with little to no modifications to the deck. Sure there were a few games I lost because I had a bad hand, or the AI had a much better hand, but that doesn't mean the decks are garbage. Now I suppose I have only seen the Rakdos deck so as far as I know the other decks might actually be aweful.Overall, I would say this game is a nice change in the Duels of the Planeswalkers series and I look forward to playing it more. However, if you are not willing to make your own decks and spend a few hours playing games with AI to unlock cards then I can not reccomend this game to you. I hope this review has been helpful, and thank you for your time.TL;DR   The game is good and some reviewers are angry.			"

												The Magic 2015 game is getting a lot of flak, and much of it is deserved. I must say I came to the same conclusion as many of the reviewers here, that this game seemed a bit money grubbing, however after giving it a second chance I actually beat the first 4 bosses and cleared the first zone, Innistrad, and I must say I was wrong. While the game was wickedly hard on Planeswalker due to the appalling starter deck, once you clear Innistrad the game comes into it's own.The game comes off its ""tutorial rails"" and lets you progress and build your deck as you would expect from every other installment of the game. The game hasn't really changed, except that you unlock boosters through ""exploring"" the different zones, eg. fighting premade decks for the zone, randomly selected. The starter deck will continue to be quite bad, until you unlock some boosters, but they really are just letting you build whatever deck you want from the pool of cards. While, yes the game is a grind, so has every other installment   Pick deck  Grind other decks to unlock cards for the played deck  Rinse repeat til all cards are unlocked for the deck  It is still pretty much that, except the deck is just the ~300 cards that can be in the booster packs. I've actually enjoyed playing it, once I got over the hump of having a terrible starter deck and actually got some useful cards. I'd even say I enjoy it more on it's card building mechanics and card pool system than any installment previously, and I've pretty much completed the other 2 (MTG 2013/MTG 2014). I must say it does have its issues, such as the default mana tapping seems to be dumber than in 2014, I will have a hand full of blue cards and it will tap all my blue leaving only white, which 2013-2014 never seemed to do, but once I figured out the mana-tapping key it got easier. I do wish the ""smart"" mana tapping came back, as it is a bit tedious to change it for every card. The menus need some definate fixing but, on the whole the game itself is pretty solid. TLDR;   The mana-tapping priority seems to have gotten worse since 2014, and can be very frustating. Use L-Ctrl to select the correct mana-usage The menus really are slow, but navigating is easier if you use the scrollwheel, and not clicks.  The starter decks are amazingly bad, and the first 4 campaign battles are very hard on Planeswalker, I would recommend taking the difficulty down until you get a good card base, even if you are a veteran player.  The game is not very revealing as to what its goal of play is in the very beginning, but given a bit of time, it shows it may be a better game, than the other installments, barring some bugginess, and a very high barrier to entry. NOTE: I did notice the lack of 2 Headed Giant from multiplayer, which kinda seemed pointless to not support, but I never really played multiplayer so I can't comment on how that has effected my own personal experience, nor does this review cover any multiplayer functionality as I prefer the singleplayer campaign.

												*** EDIT at 278 hours played ***Another year, another MTG Duels of the Planeswalkers game. As always the game offers an arcade style way of learning how to play the classic 1993 card game, which is easy to learn and hard to master. -DECK BUILDING AND CARD POOL-This edition finally features custom deck building, although you start off by selecting two colors and receiving enough cards to start playing with those colors. At multiple points, later on in the campaign, players are enabled to pick starter packs of different colors (called 'archetypes'). Winning additional cards is achieved by winning single- and multiplayer games, at which point players receive a booster pack that contains random cards that can be used to adjust your deck or build new decks. As a player I'm personally very happy deck building is introduced, because in the previous edition certain decks were way too popular to my liking, making the multiplayer rather boring (decks like Avacyn's Glory and Chant of the Mul Daya).At first glance a card pool of 300 different cards - plus a so called 'premium' card pool of 40 or so that can only be accessed by buying booster packs for real money - may sound limiting, but seeing you'll receive some of these cards 2-4 times, it all adds up to plenty of chances to express your creativity as a player in deck building (EDIT: since writing this review the premium card pool has been made available to all!). Newbs can also use an auto completion function in the deck builder if they are unsure on how to finish up building a new deck, but remember trial and error and streamlining your own deck is part of the fun of the game. Nevertheless, a card pool of 300 cards for an annual edition is a rather limited number when compared to the over 600+ cards that real magic introduces every year.Speaking on deck management, this function has been greatly improved in this editon with plenty of filters, like the ability to only show newly won cards. Also, last edition would not handle alt tabbing very well. Magic 2015 handles alt tabbing perfectly: when you enter the game again after al tabbing the changes on the table are updated properly. Also, I haven't had any disconnects or opponents disconnecting so far, so the netcode might have been improved as well.-GAMEPLAY AND GAME MODES-As in last edition the campaign is split up in a number of chapters, each comprising of 5 duels and an exploration event featuring 5 duels. The game also comes with a good tutorial that, sadly for veterans, is mandatory. Apart of that there is of course a multiplayer mode that features 1vs1 quick matches and 2 to 4 player ffa. Although this game certainly enables players to enjoy single- and multiplayer Magic, the small number of game modes and a lack of a decent lobby system to continue playing with the same players after finishing a game feels limited when compared to last year's Magic 2014.Especially the 2vs2 co-op type experience will certainly be missed, which perhaps was necessary to prevent partners from using identical decks or perfect combinations and ruling the leaderboards. Why this game mode, as well as sealed deck mode, is ommitted is unclear. Why not give players the choice to play the game modes they enjoy the most?-USER INTERFACE-One of the biggest downsides of this edition, however, are the menu structures and animations. Very banal things turn into such a drag with the horrible way these menu's are designed and animated. It takes too much time to go from gameplay to the main menu and to the deck builder, and then back at it again. Players with multiple decks who win a couple of boosters will have to spend a lot of time in the deck builder to update their decks with the newly additions, watching the clock tick while they have to go back to the main menu after editing a deck each time to start working on the next, unable to simply switch decks from the deck manager. Similar problems become apparant throughout gameplay. Another example is the fact players cannot simply pick a deck from the lobby before a single- or multiplayer match. Instead they have to 'equip' a deck before hand. Also, when a player restarts a match he should be able to immediately choose whether he wants to pick another deck or do a quick restart with the same deck. In reality a couple of seconds are spent every time to watch the menu's pop up or disappear using mist forming animations that, seeing players will have to do this a lot, become very annoying after the first half hour of gameplay. It's cumbersome stuff that reminds me of the way Gran Turismo 5 on ps3 handled it's menu's (EDIT: browsing through the menu now goes a lot smoother after patching!). In fact the menu's have been made worse in comparison to Magic 2014, with big icons players have to click through on a full hd resolution pc monitor instead of having complete menu's written in letters on a single screen.As stated before, also lacking is a decent lobby system. After playing a game both players get thrown back into the multiplayer selection screen, and do not go back into the lobby to pick a deck and go at it again. This was a bad design choice, limiting social interactions in the multiplayer environment of Magic 2015 and it really makes you wonder how much love the designers have for this legendary card game. In the last edition the lobby's were always full of afk hosts coming out of games in which all the other players had already left and going afk while loading up the lobby. In this edition, there is no real lobby system at all. Why this option was picked over the installation of an afk timer for hosts after each match? I have no clue. It seriously is hard to imagine the designers of this editon played last year's Magic 2014 at all... A very sad thing indeed.-CONCLUSION-All in all, some very odd design choices from Stainless Steel that have been in the business for many years. There's no decent lobby system, the menu's have never been worse, as well as missing game modes. Still, looking at pure gameplay mechanics this game is a great strategy game that can be recommended to anyone. And as a whole Magic 2015 is a functional video game, offering many hours of great strategic gameplay with deck building for only 10 bucks. There's a reason this trading card game has been around since 1993! Sadly, this edition hardly feels like the next annual chapter in a long running series. However, at the end of the day the core gameplay is more or less perfect and this game does offer an accessible yet rewarding Magic The Gathering experience to all. Recommended!			"

												Pros:- MTG ( who doesn't love magic?)- Least buggy so far (we all know that duels of the planeswalkers are always crammed with buggs, 9 hours in and still bug free.)- Sleek design (menus are abit slow though)- Deck builder ( a real one this time)- Cheap ( 10 Euro is not that much)- New player friendly (people complain about weak starting decks, but these are great for new players, you learn the game and gradually make it more powerfull as you learn the game. and as for more experienced players, the game is pretty easy, barely any challenge at the hardest difficulty it just takes time and you're being lazy.)Cons:- Lack of game modes (no 2-HG, Challenges, Planechase or anything alike)- Mediocre card pool (almost 1000, sounds like quite alot, but it feels lacking in certain areas, id personally like to be able to build some more unsuaual archetypes.)- Premium boosters ( cards that you can't unlock though gameplay? uncool.)

												3/5 starsOk, lets get this out of the way. This is the worst interface i have had the pleasure of using. Clunky and frustrating. Designers obviously never heard of a mouse. -1 starOther than that its a fun game. Dont worry aobout the reviews saying you are limited to one deck. You pick up everything as you go. The battles are not that bad. They are a bit challenging and you have to have a bit of luck but any easier and i would be insulted. the progress and finding cards is what make it a game. The designers did an excelent job here in progression. In fact its less grindy than earlier games.  Every time you win a battle after the first few you get a big dump of cards not one per win as in earlier games. +5 starNow it is true that you cant get all the cards playing the game, there are some you have to get from buying packs. But to tell you the truth i dont miss them so far. I dont htink it is a big deal. -1 star			"

												Another Core set, another Duels of the Planeswalkers. This year we get something fans have been demanding since the first game in this series: custom deckbuilding, which is both this game's biggest draw, and its biggest drawback.It's awesome in that it fully simulates the experience of playing the real game, and it allows you to make the type of deck you want to play - any combination you want, not just the 10 basic decks present in most DOTP games (with more available as DLC); you're free to play Bant, Esper, Gruul, whatever you want.It's disappointing in that you're stuck with a relatively small card pool, and can only choose one starter, two-colour deck as a base at first. To expand your options you need to throw yourself against a wall of tough AI opponents with impeccable card draws (if I had a dollar for every time the AI had the perfect solution for my deck's bomb cards when I finally got them off, I'd be covered for the next Steam sale), or drop money on the card collections. This has already♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a lot of people off.Unfortunately, there is a simple solution for this problem that could have been easily implemented: the middle ground. Give us the option to build decks on our own, but also allow us access to the types of prebuilt decks that the series has used all along (or at least more of the template decks you get to choose from). If my custom deck isn't suited for a particular challenge, let me switch to Jace's deck, or Elspeth's.Aside from the deckbuilding, this game is great overall. The campaign continues last year's awesomeness, and this time the plot actually feels more relevant to the greater MTG storyline this time, with some sweet cutscenes as gravy. The achievements, personas, and titles offer a reasonable challenge to obtain, bringing a lot of replay value. So in the end, my recommendation is complicated. Having played through on the iPad already, I can say this is one of the best games in the series despite its flaws, but really, it's just expanding on a the already-solid foundation. The deckbuilding option is divisive, though, and I have to say Duels 2014 is still the superior game.			"

												READ BEFORE LISTENING TO NEGATIVE REVIEWSI didn't want to write a premature review, but after reading other reviews I see I have no choice.People seem to be bashing this game for the most stupid reasons. I've seen people bashing the game because the campaign is too hard... Not really I've only lost once and restarted once and I am on the seconed chapter. I was gonna say it's to easy... I'm playing on normal difficulty and I am some what new to magic. The first magic game I owned was 2014. I also seen someone say that you only get to choose one starting deck and that is also false, you choose between 4.The deck building goes a little like this:You choose your starting deck type (white, blue, green, etc.) than you build on from there. You don't choose from different decks each game. The one you initially picked is what you get (You can probably go back and change it). As you unlock new cards you add them to your deck as you see fit, and after you beat the first boss you get to choose a box art from like 50 choices and after that you give your deck a name of your choice.Pro's-Excellent GUI-Much better deck building-It's Magic!-Tutorial is really helpful and a good refreshment-Small changes to gameplay functions-A much more clever a.i-Campaign is pretty good-If you actually play the campaign you don't have to worry about buying anything with real moneyCons-Some gameplay things are annoying, but you can easily turn them off in the settings-Menu still seems a bit cluttered "

												I like the new black/white interface, looks and feels great. Deck building is easy and fun, love the direction they took it. AI is challenging. Opening boosters you win from battles feels very rewarding. Game looks fantastic in borderless 1440p. I have not a single bad thing to say, LOVE this game.			"

												Ok, lets see...I played Magic 2015 now about 12 hours, straight.Magic 2015 is not quite that bad, as everyone sees it, but there are a few things bothering me.Magic 2015 Pros/ConsPro's (+) : (kinda) new Board Design (Feels more alive (imo))                 No restricted Decks (U can make your own, when u have the ideas for it (Only 2015 Edition Cards))                 U can have a lot of fun with friends or even versus random People with the variety of new Decks.                 Story in Singleplayer is interesting, as it was in 2014 and 2012 and so on.                 Soundtrack is really goodCon's (+) : Describtion of your Starter Deck (u can only guess whats in it)                 U can only have 1 Starter Deck in the Beginning - u get more as u progress through the storyline                 Payment Model - (Yes, i bought the whole Card Collection, ""BUT"" it's a bit frustrating to see that u pay like 20€ / $                        for not having every card! ( U only get Premium Cards, from buying Premium Boosters (1,79€ / $)))                 Multiplayer - No 2HG (Two Headed Giant (2v2)), u get kicked out of the lobby after playing a game (frustrating                  if u are playing with a friend), u cant change your deck in the Game Lobby.                 Singleplayer - I played the whole Thing through, took me about 3 hours (1 hour for the First Two Planes), its a nice                 Story as i said, but the last Fight against Garruk feels Scripted. (played 2 decks against him (starter deck/aggro))                 Starter Deck was kinda ok, got a bit frustraded as i saw how many removal he got, but i had a chance.                 Then i tried out the R/W Aggro Deck, lets see i played against him 5 times. Everytime i played with this Deck i got                  the exact same Cards  over and over, only removal no minions in hand (even after mulligans). It felt Scripted. Enough of the Harsh Words.Final Review : i would give this game a solid 7/10 as far as i can tell.                      Its a nice game, looks polished, we got our own choice of making decks (even if its only 2015 edition),                      but i really dislike the little things like getting kicked out of the lobby after a game and u cant change your                      Deck in the Lobby.                      If u are a really Hardcore MagicFan, u can absolutly buy it, brings a lot of fun and dont cost that much                       (9,99 for the Game and if u cant wait to grind out the cards you need, you need to spend 32€, with Boosters ,                      around 50€) (Boosters are luck based, just like in RL) I hope, i helped u out a bit with this review.Sincerly, Lightning "

												I buy the Duel of the planeswalkers games every year because (not counting the mountain of dlc) they are cheap and a great dose of Magic: The Gathering. So here's what's different in this year's game:This year, with the 2015 version, you get to make your own deck! You still get a pre-made deck at the beginning which you get to modify as you get new cards or create a new one if you have enough cards. Playing through the campaign you unlock booster packs for each win and new decks for defeating specific opponents. Unlocking every cards in the basic set can take over 30 hours but opening a 10+ card booster pack after a win is always more fun than unlocking cards one at a time was in the 2014 game.The game emphasizes 60 card decks, which is good. You can still build bigger decks but that is usually not optimal. In DOTP 2014, every new card unlocked was added to your deck after a win  so you ended up with a 75+ card deck unless you took some cards out after every win.The draft mode is gone, I really liked that mode and almost bought more slots to get additional draft decks. The only modes available in this one are campaign, cpu matches, and 2-4 player free-for-all online matches.The menus were conceived for ipads and are terrible for pc. I play with a controller because this seems like easiest way to play the game (and is how i played all the previous versions) but having the slightest mouse movement take the button prompts away is kind of a bummer. From the main menu you can press the select(back) button to resume the campaign mode and modify your current deck but still have to navigate to the decks menu if you want to equip or create a different deck...Also, while you can build you decks from scratch, there are some limitations. You only have 3 copies of uncommon cards, 2 copies of rares and 1 mythic card in your collection. I haven't compared but I don't think the entire sets are available to unlock, either.With all said and done, I have enjoyed my time with the game and might mess a bit more with the deck builder and play some additional online matches. I think for 10$ you get a really good game.Update: After a free update, all the premium boosters are now rewards for playing online games, which is great! Gives people an incentive to play more online matches and complete the card collection without having to pay for unlocks.			"

												The game is incredibly fun. I've easily gottten my $10 worth out of it and will likely get many many more hours of enjoyment even if I never touch the premium cards and can't play 2v2.If you like strategy games at all, you'd be crazy to pass up this game for $10. It's a steal.			"

												First of all, don't look just the bad reviews! It's unfair treatment to a very good game.   This Magic videogame is better suited for people that play real paper ""Magic The Gathering"" but it's still good for anyone that likes trading card games. I would say it has a higher learning curve than the older releases (mostly for those who don't play paper MTG) and couldappear bad at first with very limited options. If you devote some time into your deckbuilding this game will be as fun as the other MTG DOTP games if not more. Because now you have a ""my deck"" feeling that's closer to the real MTG.   Strongly recommended for paper magic fans!Those that are used to the super powerful preconstructed decks of the older versions BE CAREFUL. Don't expect this game to be the same. This needs some time to get used to even if you bought the complete edition.TL;DR score:  9/10 (for MTG fans)                        6/10 (for beginners. it should have a more detailed tutorial system for those that need it)Single Player: 7/10 (a slow repeatable process for unlocking the cards but challenge is good at Planeswalker difficulty)             Story: 2/10 (I like to see a nice story even in this kind of game. I think this is the worst of the series.)  Multiplayer:  9/10 for duels 1v1 1v1v1 1v1v1v1 (the whole feeling is better and the queue is faster I think)Game Modes: 3/10 (No 2head-giant [2v2], no Planechase or Archenemy, no Sealed, no puzzles!! Come on Wizards!Player Profile: 9/10 this surprised me. Has information on most things.Personalization: 5/10 I expected a lot more to be added after some years of the same things.  Shop: 5/10 I see this as a good thing.  And no you CANNOT win just from the premium booster cards!            The bad thing is the way they implemented it in game while you can buy the free(unlockable) cards through            Steam. The pricing of the unlocks is unfair, not the premium boosters!This is the end of this review. Whoever has read it to the end thank you. "

												Despite what everyone is saying about this game, it's pretty sweet. I see a lot of complaints about the transition time, either those people have slow computers or they have the attention span of a goldfish. The transitions take 3 seconds, this isn't a long transition time. Another complaint I see is about the menu UI and how confusing it can be. If your IQ is above 9 then you can figure it out pretty quickly. Lastly, I see complaints about the difficutly and starting with a weak deck. I agree with this one, to finish the tutorial it took me a good 5 games and yes the deck you start with is weak. But on the other side, I don't want to start with a strong deck. I'm not a player that just wants no challenge and basically wants to have the game beat the second I start. I like earning my way, it's like real life; you can't just have a good deck to start with. You buy cards, you make your own deck, and improve it from there. Also these may be weak decks but if you're smart enough and skilled enough it's not THAT hard to beat the beginning enemies and start earning cards. I'm not sure what people are looking for with this game, but they're not looking for a Magic the Gathering experience. The game is a lot of fun, and personally I hated 2014. I love that in this game I have free deck building instead of being restricted to stupid decks. If you like Magic, and are looking for a video game that simulates Magic, this is for you. If you're looking for a pay 2 win game that you just want to dominate at for a week and forget about it, stop gaming. I hate your kind.			"

												a REAL review here with the pros and cons~i do admit it has its dumb moments, but it didnt fail to deliver the expectations and fun a MTG game has to offer.Pros:Full customization of decks, really awesome to see there are hardly any game breaking cards other than the ones AI uses @_@.The balance is definitely right, having the rarity restrictions certainly helps to pace out the game in multiplayer, and you would get at least 2 turns to recover from being mana screwed.The interface is pleasing to the eye and actually doesnt suffer from Mirror's Edge syndrome whereby the dark/white contrast hurts your eye. The people whining about it are totally exaggerating.The card filter is able to filter out new cards too,for example if you only go to manage your deck after opening 5 boosters,it is still able to filter out all the new cards you received. i suppose it works by locking in the period between the last time you managed your deck and the current. Works like a charm since I tend to forget what cards i got and dont wanna browse through the library to see if i have got cards to improve my deck.The AIs this time are so much more improved,no longer scripted for starters,and the difficulty level doesnt really seem to affect how they play either, except on planeswalker they seem to have alot more ""luck"". But hey, at least they play smart now.i highly recommend just playing on Mage mode,you often will get mana screwed by their unique way of shuffling cards(as usual),to prevent constant restarting and frustration,just play Mage mode, you will have a more enjoyable experience and are less susceptible to negative reviews =pThe premium boosters in contrary to popular belief, is not game breaking. After i unlocked the 2 free premium boosters from pre-ordering and owning magic 2014(loyalty bonus?what a shock~), i didnt use any of the cards as it just doesnt fit in my deck. But now with the ~80% unlocked library, I did manipulate it around so i can put my 2 Stoneforge Mystic to use.Yes, the premium booster helps out in making themed decks more complete, but you could just improvise since this game is now FULL DECK BUILDING.Cons:Campaign difficulty level spike is non-existent, the AIs just use different deck themes, but are all strong. Starter decks are really weak and takes a lot of patience and luck to win until you had sufficient cards to mod your deck competently,leading to many complaining about the game being bad compared to the previous versions(which actually isnt).For players who only bought the base game, they will be unlocking boosters and probably switching out cards like after every battle at the start since the deck is so weak. It does have a convenient option to manage your deck at the page where you opened your booster,however,after saving the changes,you are BOOTED back to the menu. Assuming you are farming for cards before wanting to progress or because of difficulty handling a certain opponent, you had to press Single Player--Campaign--Innistrad--Explore ,every single time you make your deck changes.The menu speed aint really slow mind you,but repeat it for 30 times you would find it slightly offensive.Otherwise, you could just resume campaign progress by clicking on your profile pic on the bottom right,then press the campaign to continue where you left off.Considering the limited pool, creating a good mono color deck for now is not optimal,yet we are given the worst dual lands and the mixed colors variety are abysmal. It also makes your deck potentially like a deck from draft even with fully unlocked library whereby your red deck is short of burn spells(because there isnt a lot),your equipment themed deck is lacking in equipment etc. You will envy the AI for having fun themed decks sometimes while you are stuck with decks with little synergy.The cards filter only works in the library, it doesnt work in the deck. So when you are trimming your deck, for example you wanted to take out a spell but doesnt know which to pick off, and wants to compare the spells you currently had in deck, you cant. Look through all the cards manually please~			"

												Gonna go against the grain and recommend the game.We've all been asking for customizable decks in this franchise and they're here.What some people are missing is that this DotP is not supposed to compete with paper or online magic.  So the card pool is not particularly deep, and if you understand that going in, you won't be disappointed.  If you want ALL the cards, pay a heck of a lot more to play Magic Online.  I'm gonna make clear what the pay model here is.  In DotP 2015, for your $9.99, you're getting most of the experience.  You'll need to do a little grinding as you play through the campaign to unlock the planes and all the cards from them (in the form of booster packs when you win).  I think these battles are pretty fun, especially since the computer decks use more powerful cards than you have access to.  So it's a bit of a challenge and your deck can't be garbage, especially against the bosses.You should NOT buy the plane unlocks that are $4.99.  Those are just a shortcut to unlock all the cards in the plane, but it doesn't take long to unlock them on your own.  Plus you're killing whatever incentive you may have had to play the campaign.You also should NOT buy the special edition, collectors edition, or any of that crap.  They don't include the ""Premium"" cards.The ""premium"" cards aren't necessary to win but they tend to open up a lot of deck archetypes you couldn't build effectively otherwise.  To get all the ""premium"" cards you will need to purchase 14 boosters at $2 each, or $28 in all.  If you pre-ordered, you get two boosters for free.  If you own DotP 2014, you get one booster for free.  The most you should ever spend on this game is $9.99 + the $28 from boosters, if you so desire.  But the game is fully playable for $9.99.Personally, so far I like DotP 2013 and 2014 a little more, because of the powerful and interesting cards at your disposal in those titles, but this version offers the ability to truly make a deck your own and I'm very excited to see what the metagame in 1v1 duels will be.  As others have mentioned, 2v2 isn't included, which is a terrible decision, but I didn't play that mode much in the past regardless.			"

												Wow, people are really negative about  this one. There are two (perhaps three) cons that strike me when I play it, other than that I love it so much!Menu system is awfully slow (This sucks... no denying it)They removed two headed giant (Yeah, this was my favorite mode, but they made up for it by making multiplayer work)(The game is not too newbie friendly, but magic, especially on PC, is not the worst when it comes to a steep learning curve. You have to experiment a bit. Try out one strategy, what works, what doesn't and then try something else until you find a deck that's fun to play. )Other than that, I can't really find too many faults. This is the game I was hoping they'd make from the first time I played magic on a console. People complain that you start out with a weak deck. Yes, yes you do. But that's the fun part to me at least and resembles playing magic in reality. You start out slow and as you get more cards more strategies unlock for you. At time of writing I've played 12hrs, 4 of which were online against other players and as far as I can tell, they've finally released a game where bugs and glitches doesn't ruin online play. I've yet to encounter a bug or a crash. I've had so much fun going up against other people and when you win, you're rewarded with new boosters giving you even more incentive to keep playing. To conclude, if you want to play this game, be prepared to spend a bit of time in the deck builder, testing out builds. That's not for everyone, I know, but that's the main focus of Magic 2015, the freedom to make your own decks at last. WoTC has finally made the DotP game magic players wanted			"

												If you liked the simple, evenly matched, and especially inexpensive Magic 2014, well those days are at an end.  Obviously Wizards, like most other money making entities, has decided money is more important than their fan base.  About $30 will start you with all decks unlocked, then however many booster packs you want to buy @ 1.99 each.  FYI if you buy 10 packs  and add the cost of the game, you just spent as much as a regular video game (about $60)  This does not include any expansions, etc...  You can easily spend over $100 on this game, which will be obsolete in 1 year.  Play and buy with caution.			"

												I personally only play Magic casually, so I am very glad they have added deckbuilding into the newest iteration of the game. While you may have a limited card pool, this does add far more complexity to DotP than it has had before in my opinion. I reccomend this game to any casual or new Magic players. However, if what you want a digital version of the paper game then I suggest you look into Magic: The Gathering Online.			"

												While I do have a few minor discrepancies with this title, it's both largely enjoyable and immersive. The capability behind building your own deck from a complete list of cards was long awaited and well received. The card list that we've received is also quite expansive, as far as I can see, which means we've been presented with a myriad of options: they're thinking about the individual.You do begin the game with a rather poor choice of pre-built decks, but I think that's part of its 'magic'; from the get go, you're tested to use what you've got at your disposal. You start off as, assumingly in the game's context, an inexperienced or at least unknown planeswalker, who then begins to gain the admiration of others, and through a series of challenges, eventually becomes much, much more powerful.While I've only just begun playing, and I will continue to do so, I am definitely pleased with the new layout; the fresh and very slick colour scheme is striking and strongly representative of the outlying story. The menus do still retain some clunky-ness from its predecessors however, but that doesn't remain a constant issue.It's also a great title for someone who would only just be immersing themselves into online Magic. The introductory tutorial is very thorough, which aptly pairs with a title focused on the Core Set release; you could argue it's somewhat designed to condition these potential new players.I've yet to go through some of the features of the game, but I can assure you that it is an improvement. While I'll admit I did enjoy playing around with the preconstructed decks of the various Planeswalkers in M14 DotP, what you receive here in sheer versatile is indomitable.For those who did not order the Complete Edition, you'll be unlocking the cards throughout the campaign. Think of this as your reward system. I loved seeing what new cards could be added after going through things and trying a little hard. I do think there was a strong drawback in making 88% of the card pool available to players who have the Complete Edition after defeating the Innistrad boss, but that's more likely my personal preference.I will agree that unfortunately, like the last instalment, there's a large emphasis on simply purchasing the cards like there was with the sealed slots in M14 DotP. However, there's no real reason to purchase them, as they can be very simply unlocked by going through and duelling. We need to keep in mind that WotC are a profitable company, and that of course they're going to want people to buy things. As consumers, you have the choice whether or not you pay the extra for your quick fix.Whether you're a long-running fan of the game, or just looking to start up, this is a wise decision. However, if you aren't willing to overlook a few flaws, then no, you won't be able to appreciate or enjoy it. Just remember that no game is perfect, some get pretty close, and this one is definitely not subpar.			"

												I really see no call for all of the negative reviews for this game. So what if it does not have Two-Headed Giant Mode? It's the price we pay for the new deck constructor. Anyone who thinks that the computer cheats and that Campaign mode is too hard, obviously lacks skill in gameplay and deck construction. Don't like to grind? Buy the cards or go play something else.IMO, this is one of the best Duels games to date and while there are a couple things I wish this would have (yes, I miss Two-Headed Giant, also), the game is rather polished and not something one should judge by playing it for an hour. The music is unintrusive and quite great.If you don't like the game, do us all a favor and go play something else. Otherwise, enjoy another (different) Duels.			"

												All the complaints; slow menus, land tapping not manual, and slowed down gameplay (especially online) are all validate BUT just because of that doesn't--for me--qualify this as a bad game. These can all be fixed in a patch or two. As it stands for $10 it is good and I feel like I've gotten my money's worth. Comments on grinding and weak starter decks are not as bad as people let on. I've essentially been playing with my starter deck with a few adds and drops as I get boosters. You unlock at least one booster pack after each single player fight, therefore if you do the campaign then you should have a decent amount of cards at the end of it.			"

Buy the cards or go play something else.IMO, this is one of the best Duels games to date and while there are a couple things I wish this would have (yes, I miss Two-Headed Giant, also), the game is rather polished and not something one should judge by playing it for an hour. The music is unintrusive and quite great.If you don't like the game, do us all a favor and go play something else. Otherwise, enjoy another (different) Duels.			"

												All the complaints; slow menus, land tapping not manual, and slowed down gameplay (especially online) are all validate BUT just because of that doesn't--for me--qualify this as a bad game. These can all be fixed in a patch or two. As it stands for $10 it is good and I feel like I've gotten my money's worth. Comments on grinding and weak starter decks are not as bad as people let on. I've essentially been playing with my starter deck with a few adds and drops as I get boosters. You unlock at least one booster pack after each single player fight, therefore if you do the campaign then you should have a decent amount of cards at the end of it.			"

												I feel some of the reviews I've seen are a little unfair, so here's my take on a game that I'm enjoying, despite some teething pains.Keep at It!The early game is certainly very frustrating, you're playing an underpowered deck and it feels like you're never going to get anywhere. After pushing hard through the campaign my little Red/Green deck is actually starting to do quite well. I've read a lot of reviews about how you have to grind for cards (or suffer the dreaded Micro-transactions!!). My two cents on the matter is that part of the fun is winning games and opening packs - had I had the entire library at my disposal from the start, opening packs wouldn't matter. At least this way when I open a Booster pack there's enough anticipation to make it a fun experience. Unfortunately it does seem like this aspect is a detriment to the start of the game.Picking Your First Deck is A Lottery - But Take Comfort That Your Deck WILL Suck!The game seems to do a terrible job of telling you what your starter deck contains. I chose Red/Green which was described in-game as a deck to ramp into big creatures. Imagine my surprise to find there were no such card in the deck itself!\.I bit of research shows that pretty much all the starter decks suck, and this is the major failing of the game. It can take a couple of frustrating losses to get past an encounter and start modifying your deck. Again, it seems the plan is to give you a lame deck so that opening your first few boosters is a good experience. Perhaps a little misguided but not a reason to write the game off.Deck ModificationThis really where the game shines. Sure you get a crappy deck, but opening boosters is fun... and the reason it's fun is that you can take whatever awesome cards you get and try cram them into your deck! Just open up an amazing creatue? Put it in your deck, splash the land colour you need (or let the auto-builder take care of it) and take your new deck out for a spin.At the time of writing I'm halfway through the campaign and loving it. Should anything come up of note I'll provide an update.8/10			"

												This is the first review I've written, but thought I would take the time having seen all of the negative reviews that were on here.Despite the reviews, I took the plunge and picked up the game. I have now logged 24 hours and have completed the single player campaign. That's quite a while, but then I played on the medium (Archmage) difficulty and wasn't looking for an easy time of it. In my experience you learn the most from when you lose and each loss allows you to tweak your deck, or, should tweaking fail, rebuild your deck entirely and ultimately this allows you to learn the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different cards.I thought that my starting deck was decent, I picked a Black and Blue deck and breezed through the first plane updating my deck after pretty much every win. The game did get tougher then and I was stuck for a long time on the ""Storm the Castle"" mission, but after building three new decks (Red and Black, pure-Blue and Black and White), which, by-the-way, in enjoyed doing, I finally put together a Black and Green deck that got my through the encounter. There were other snags along the way, but I eventually went back to my Black and White deck, updated it's focus and won through.There was a bit of grinding to expand the range of cards I could use, but to me, openning the packs and seeing what you've got, is all part of the fun.I'm not saying that the other reviewers are wrong, but I'm glad I decided to make my own choice and I've enjoyed the game so far. Now it's on to multiplayer and seeing what creative decks other players have put together.In summary, the game is challenging and it'll take you a while to get through the single player campaign (perhaps not if you play on Mage, I don't know), but if you've enjoyed the previous Magic games, but were looking for a bit more freedom of choice, then this is the one for you.

												I've come around 180 degrees on this game.Until yesterday, I was firmly in the camp of the ""this kinda sucks"" side. I've played Duels for three years, and when I loaded in the demo, it really felt limiting. I agree with many of the gripes: the lockin to the initial deck you choose is obnoxious, and the menus are a pain (although they're not _that_ bad if you get good at hitting the escape key, and if you think that the load times are long, you should try playing 2014 on a PS3. As an ex-PS3 guy now playing on Steam, I think the game now loads like a grease-dipped ferret).I decided, though, to splurge on the $35 full game, and the experience immediately went from crap to excellent. Basically, you need to reorient your thinking. This isn't your father's ""Duels"". It's more like a regular game. Regular games, I routinely pay $39, $49, $59. Now, I expect a lot of gameplay for that amount. So what's the regular game like? You get a large set of cards to work with, including plenty of rares. (I _think_ the handful of mythics that I have came in part from the basic game, but I can't vouch for that) I understand that many of the best cards are ""premium"" and not in the decks that come with the main game. But I've been playing the main game for hours now with only a few $2 boosters, and it's a ton of fun. Playing through the campaign, you can look at each individual enemy and try and craft a deck that will beat it. Certainly the decks that are craftable with the basic $35 game are not going to stand up to multiplayer. But that's not really any different from regular MTG, right? I'll be happy if I feel that the campaign has given me $35 of value. I've never really been willing to invest in the dollars it takes to play multiplayer anyways. When you get right down to it, that's the real reason I play Duels instead of The Real Thing.So for example, I hit the final battle on Theros, against a red black reincarnation deck. First I tried hitting it with a pure blue deck that I had created to learn all the new blues. But it kept sapping all my life before I could get anything built up. So I decided to fight fire with fire and use a white black deck. The game suggests a white black ""archetype"" deck, but it has been a ton of fun optimizing it with cards from the basic game that aren't in the suggested build. As an example, the ""suggested"" white black deck doesn't use any artifacts (I think this may be true of all or most of the suggested decks). So there are a ton of interesting tradeoffs to consider about which artifacts if any deserve to be swapped in.It took me 5 or 6  iterations to come up with the killer deck for clearing the final Theros battle. Each time, I got a little closer. It was brutally difficult to winnow down from 80 cards to 65 cards (I still haven't generated the self-discipline to get that deck to 60 - another reason why I'm not meant for multiplayer).  I finally nailed it with a deck that focused on using Suffer the Past to drain the foe's graveyard and Reprisal to take down his Underworld Cerebus stormtroopers, while getting him to reincarnate multiples of my Lone Missionaries to stay alive.  A winning deck built around Lone Missionary and Suffer the Past? How unlikely! It was very satisfying.  That's what makes Magic work for me. I think by this point I've laid out for maybe 4 boosters. That's 8 more dollars, but the combined amount is still less than I paid for Xcom, The Last of Us, and all the other games that I wasn't willing to wait a year for for price reductions.So my suggestion is that if you're looking for great single player play, give serious thought to the full game. Someone said that if you make it through the campaign, it ""unlocks all the cards"". I don't get any boosters when I win campaign games now, so it looks like if you buy the full game, you don't get boosters for winning (which is weird). However, the tradeoff is worth it for me. The grind seems a little too painful.If you like single player, and you're generally comfortable paying $40 for a strong video game, I think you'll definitely get your money's worth buying the full game. I'm only bothering to write this because I came _this close_ to writing the game off, but when I look back on how many hours of fun I had just trying to build decks for a single campaign battle, I'm really glad I spent the money. And they'll probably patch the damn menus, anyways. =)			"

												Hey this is a lovely game and most the negative reviews are people who are upset his isn't the magic games that came before it/ that it isnt exactly the same as real magic in every possible way. (the imbalance of community on REAL every card magic would make me vomit.) But guess what! If you take this game as a standalone its god damn fantastic! and sure lets speak of one harsh subject there are a VERY few cards that yo get you HAVE to pay for......#holyshitp2wscamming♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s #yolohipsterswag....sorry about that. But yes this really isn't a big deal or prominent matter at all in any way! Imagine there was a free demo of this game that gave you half the cards. I'm sure people would ♥♥♥♥♥ at the fact that you have to buy the game to get the rest of the cards, and really that is just a disgusting fact!Hold on a second i really want to clear up that in almost ALL cases I've ever seen people spouting that p2w ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is total nonsense. Paying for progress/ advantages is close to paying for dlc which isnt a problem unless in excess (most of EA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t dlc, and neverwinters stupid amount of p2w). Paying for things like more cards special mounts and other silly♥♥♥♥♥♥that puts someone on a slightly quicker path is not a big deal especially considering no games with things like this are TRULY competetive (save hearthstone). I'm  not sure i can say more without more or less repeating myself more than i already have so hopefully you can all catch my point.Overall I'd highly recommend this game to anyone especially if they just want to casually game hop and not get serious into the deep dark trek that is really getting into a cardgame!

												I respect the negative reviews I'm seeing and by no means is the game perfect, but I think it's got potential.  I started playing Magic with the original Duels Planeswalker on PS3 and have played each iteration for an obscene amount of hours.  I also have played quite a bit of open play Magic Online but am not into paying $15 for a single premium card Pros-Wizards is listening and has made custom deck building available and it's cool-You can unlock multiple cards (around 10) each win during the campaign, previous iterations had you unlock only 1 card per -win, so the grind feels faster thus far-I love that I can play cards from recent sets such as Theros-The graphics - already beautiful in each iteration, even more so now-The music - always loved the music, wish we could get soundtracks from iTunesCons-greed - charging for premium boosters? The cards in there aren't even premium - most are commons you can buy for $0.01 on magic online individually.  If you want to charge, at least provide a grind option like your other unlocks to equal the playing field for those who don't mind giving you money for the base game and packs but don't want to pay for unlocks (nor should we have to)-initial deck you get sucks and you may have a tough time winning initial battles.  The ramping here was not well designed IMO-multiplayer shouldn't be locked until you win your first set of matches.  - menu is too slow transitioning and not streamlined- mana tapping (yes you can set it to choose your mana) priority is god awful, you need to make sure you manually choose yourself in settings-computer has some cool premium cards you don't see ability to unlock.  I hope and assume these are going to come out as future expansions for $5 each and you can unlock via play-no 2HG, never played but understand people upset it was removed.  Hopefully they have the sense to bring it back as a mode with the first expansion-The story - I saw a video where they said this year they were spending a lot more time on the story.  Really? I don't think this is a spoiler, but most of the story was how you had to fight planeswalkers who were trying to stop you from killing Garruk who is....trying to destroy the world and kill all planeswalkers.  Does this make any sense?!?- no stats on wins and losses with a ratio?  Just a number of wins?  Been missing since the original - come on how hard is it to include this?A lot of these cons are fixable with either patches or expansions and some effort from and customer focused thinking from WizardsYou don't need to pay to unlock most cards, this is less expensive than Magic online (that application has advantages) - e.g. I don't have to pay $15 for a single Brimaz card I unlocked here at no additional cost.Some people are complaining on first impressions and not giving the game a chance.  Yes the initial decks suck and you will need to slog for a while, but you get a lot more cards in a few hours and can start building a better deck and have fun.			"

												All in all, I like this game.The UI is bad. Its very slow and frustrating. I sincerely hope they fix it. Its bad.The starting decks are bad and the AI is much more difficult than previous DotP versions. I recommend Archmage difficult or lower until you beat the boss of the first area. The beginning of this game had me swearing very loudly at my monitor for quite a few hours until I had defeated the first boss. If you do not get past this point, I fully understand you disliking this game.There are microtransactions but they are not necessary.All that being said, I do like the game. Deck building is fun, even with a limited selection of cards. The matches you verse are theme based and you have to alter your deck to come out victorious. Its fun. I'm enjoying it. UI is painfully slow.			"

												As a casual Magic fan I got plenty of enjoyment out of this game, 30+ hours, and couldn't ask for much more out of a 10 dollar game.  I understand some of the complaints about the game, but I have to say you can build some very good decks without spending extra money.  I was winning more than 60% of my online duels, so don't listen to the people who say this is ""pay to win"", they are just bad at the game.  The main frusteration I had was not being able to play my friends in online.  There is a way to set games private but when you invite people the same glitch happens over and over.  So would you rather buy 2 booster packs at Shinder's or have a game you'll get at least 20 hours of fun out of?			"

												The negativity surrounding this game is largely false. Yes, two-headed giant isn't in the game this year. That blows. But other than that, this year is the best it has ever been in my opinion. We finally have complete deck customization from a pool of currently about 1,000 cards. (All of which you can unlock without paying any money) There are quite a few bugs at the moment, nothing game-breaking though. All-in-all, I think this game is worth the $10 this year more than ever.  If you are a Magic fan and the negative reviews are keeping you away, I would at least try the demo and then decide. Personally I find it to be much better than last year. (2014)			"

												I feel like most the complaints are people who want every single thing paper magic has to offer for a $10 price tag and go all nerd-rage when they realize they are getting a toned down version of the game.There are some bugs, but they are not that common or game-breaking.The UI could be a little easier to navigate but again, it is still very functional.The last patch has dramaticallly improved loading times.  I'm thinking people complaining about loading times are mainly people with crap computers.This is far from ""P2W"".  They have some ""premium boosters"" that you can pay a total of $30 additional for that add variety, but not much more power.  I've logged 200+ hours and played and won a ton of online matches without any premiums.  Oh, and they are actually making the premiums free now with the upcoming Nov. 5th expansion.I actually like the stark contrasts with the visuals in this year's DotP.  I've never been blinded by any glaring white screen.  Of course I don't sit in the middle of a pitch-black room like some vampire-wannabe either.The main reason I enjoy this game is because it gives me one of my favorite games (Magic: The Gathering) in a format that puts everyone on the same playing field regardless of how much money I make.  I can't go out and buy yet another $100 booster box to overwhelm my less fortunate oppoonent.  It is all about skill and deck-building.I for one am just fine with a ""magic-light"" for the MUCH lighter price tag.  If you enjoy Magic, don't have the time/money to put into the real thing, this is perfect for you.  Don't let all the negatives turn you away!			"

												It's hard to dispute most of the negative press that has accompanied this latest iteration of the Duels franchise. It seems, at least in its release form, that the desire to allow players versatility in deck design is mitigated by the lack of diversity in the card pool.There are some frustrating inconsistences in the game (that perhaps harken back to the 'unlock cards with each win' systems of previous versions of the game), though these are mainly limited to the card pool and deck design process. Many of the cards of which you would want play-sets (especially early drops or higher rarities) have only two or three copies making for some maddenly inconsistent mana-curves. Perhaps this is so players can't create oppressively consistent decks, but it does detract from the idea that players have 'total creative control' in deck making. Duel-lands are clearly in the game - the AI utilises them in many of their decks - and yet players only have access to Guildgates for their own use. Each color can unlock singletons of two mythics, two-sets of nine rares, threes of uncommons and fours of commons; it appears Wizards have been keen to keep the power level down, overall, perhaps in an effort to preserve the newcomer friendly background that has been at the core of the Duels franchise in the past (though this version certainly appeals and rewards those with knowledge of the game). And, true, a few fan-favourite game modes are missing from the 2015 release of Duels; Wizards themselves have been quick to admit their error in this in the wake of strong player reaction.Despite all this, the gameplay in Duels 2015 is generally terrific. Building your own deck and piloting it through the traditional challenge-based campaign is great fun, and as you unlock cards after victories the process of refining and evolving your deck/s is rewarding. Gameplay is smooth and generally fast (if you turn off some of the combat animations and hold priorities), and clear enough in its visual cues that experienced players can gauge the passing of priority and phases to weigh in on 'the stack'. The AI is definitely improved, though experienced players will quickly find it no match once the AI-weighted campaign is concluded. As each game progresses and the board-state complicates, you will find the AI turns dragging out as it 'considers' its options, though it will still make those head-scratching plays that traditionally plague CCG AIs. And, of course, the AI never concedes.The optional in-game purchases can add some upgrades to the free-to-play card pool, but the vast majority of game content can be unlocked by completing the campaign. The menu interfaces can be annoying at times, and the need to 'equip' a deck (rather than selecting it at the pre-game screen) is cumbersome, but most players will be spending the vase majority of their time in the card-collection and deck-building screens when not in-game, and these were improved in a recent update. It's all serviceable, at the very least, and not enough to detract from the overall play experience.Duels 2015 is to be recommended to Magic and video game enthusiasts alike. While MTG players may have been wanting a graphically improved version of Wizards' beleaguered 'MTGO', it's still a lot of fun to play and to play around in, despite lacking the total freedom of its online big brother (though, with some semblance of stability). The card collection and menu interface can be frustrating, but this doesn't necessarily detract from the overall gameplay, and at the price point there's a lot of value and fun to be had. It's safe to say that Wizards have learned from this version of Duels, and the game is likely to receive at least one content update featuring new cards, based on their past processes. So, until Duels 2016 (the franchise is becoming as inevitable as Madden), Duels 2015 is still the best looking Magic game going and offers plenty of entertainment.			"

												SOOOOOO many bad reviews on this game and some of them are just complaining about stuff that isnt true ^^1) Starting Decks  ( NOTE: You choose your deck after completing or skipping the tutorial ) I really like the game! It is true that at the start you decide for a deck by choosing a main color and then a second color to get a mix of cards that are not great!But really do you want to start a game with a deck that can beat every opponent in 2 turns ?The fun about magic is collecting cards and then build a deck with what you got in your booster and then try out these decks against friends or against campaign Decks!Your starting deck just means that you will get some cards of the color of your choice!The only way to change your starting deck is between the moment you picked it and the first duell against the tutorial boss!Afterwards you have to live with your cards and you need to unlocke new cards by getting booster!2) CampaignAfter completing a turtorial you can start the  campaign which is seperated in 5 Planes! Each Plane consist of around 5 enemys! You have to beat the first one to get to the second and so on!A in my opinion great change in the campaign compared with Magic 2014 ( the only other part i played ) is the fact that the enemys dont play the same hand everytime! In 2014 they had an order of cards they wanted to play and if you didnt prevented it somehow you could predict what card they would play with a 100% chance!Now it really feels like they play a normal game, so they can have bad starting hands with few mana or no creatures to play in the first 4 turns! So it was fun to play the campain even if I had to repeat a duell because i lost!3) Collecting CardsThis was a very important point for me and i am glad they made it that easy to collect cards, yet you have to work for it!When defeating an enemy in the campaign for the first time you will get a Booster with cards! Most booster constist of the standard cards you will get in a normal Magic booster ( Some commons, uncommons and rare or mystic rare cards )but some booster, for example the first booster you will get in the campaign are are skripped to drop special combinations! So the first campaign enemy will give you a booster with only 3 commons in it, the next with 3 uncommons up to an booster with 3 rare cards!From then on all enemys in the story of the campaign will drop normal booster! Now there is the problem that after defeating an story AI he will not grant you a new booster if you challenge him again!!!!To get more boosters you need to explore the Planes! The button to do this is unlocked after clearing the first Plane!!!The booster you get are always defined by the Plane you are in! So in Theros you will get Theros booster and in Ravnica they will be Ravnica booster!( Tip: Completly exploring a Plane will let you face with a Planeswalker! Defeating these will grant you a special booster with some skripted rare drops )4) Deck BuldingNot much to say here! If you got the cards in a booster you can put them in a deck! To create a deck thats a different color than your starting choice you will need to collect a few cards and it will take some time!There is a special limit to the use of uncommon, rare and mysticrare cards in one deck!The same card is only allowed X times in a deck. ( Uncommon: X=3 ; Rare: X=2 ; Mystic: X=1 )4 )MultiplayerI havent used it yet! Because i wanted to finish the campaign first ^^ ( which took me around 7 -8 Hours so far! )5) ConclusionI really liked playing the game so far! The ability to create a deck freely is in my eyes a great Improvement!You are able to collect almost all cards simply by playing the game and on the highest difficulty the game is challenging and fun to play!Cons: There are around 50 Premium cards which are ( as far as i know ) only accessible by buying Premium Booster!

												Finally has custom decks. Though i dont know why anyone would get the full £30 edition since it removes the fun of unlocking cards in game. Other than that the UI for deck customisation is easy to navigate and easy to understand and the game plays as it says on the tin. Die hard magic fans already have it and its a great start for anyone interested in the card game.			"

												Don't listen to these negative whiners. This game is actually very good. Here's why:It brings back almost everything the game offered from its previous game. So if you're the old Duel of Planewalkers gamer, it will give you exactly what to you expected. If you are new to this game, for 9.99 with this much card contents, 5 decks + extra hundreds of cards worth of at least 59.99 real physical card, it's a bargain! compare to other garbage card game out there like pay2win 1-card-I-win PVP Hearthstone (with barely enough card)In addition:Pro: 1) Your reward of winning the game is in booster pack (yes, unlock multiple card with rare)2) In addition to the tradition 3 challenge decks + 1 specific boss deck, they also introduce ""Explore Mode"" where you fight random deck from that plane, and get booster reward, rather than the old style of unlock 1 specific card.3) Fully customize your deck (this is where this version shine) you can now literally create brand new deck with new strategy from nothing. Of course to the extend of their 300 cards pool. Then you can also pick the deck box picture for your new deck.4) Customize deck also offer additional feature to help you analyze what you put in your deck with statistic of creatures, spells, cost, land, and even feature, analyze the type of strategy that your deck favor such as speed, strength, control, synergy, to help you make the more efficent perfect deck. 5) Customize deck also introduc sorting system by color, cost, rarity, card type to help you browse through your unlocked booster pack card pool.6) Practice game, in addtion to 2, 3, 4 players Free for All. You can now have AI computer use your own custom decks, yes remember that new powerful deck that you just created from scratch, no you can dual against it or pitch it vs. another custom deck. A nice way to ""taste your own medicine"" the fun is limitless.This game focus greatly on your PVE contents.Pro: 1) Too much additional flashy spinning animation in navigation and interface could slow down laggy on weak laptop.2) No ""bonus mode"" like Planewalking or Archnemesis 3v1 1v33) No 2-Heads-Giant aka 2v2Bottomline, for a card game compare to other franchise like Warcraft Hearthstone and Might and Magic Duel of Champions, this game, Magic 2015 Duel of Planewalkers is huge bargain!!! for its cost, so much contents for what it worth.

												Magic 2015 is everything to be expected from the yearly releases of DotP, and better. Going through the tutorial (skipping it, been playing MTG for 10 years now) and picking a deck to play with for the non-scripted match and Innastrad was fun because I didn't know what the deck was going to be like because all it did was let you choose the colors that it was going to be. After you beat Innastrad, you get access to the rest of the pre-made decks (which many reviews have been complaining about) and able to make your own deck, or edit the pre-made ones the game came with. Many people in their reviews also complained about how the decks now work. Instead of getting a card for the deck you just won with, you get a booster with 3 cards for any of your decks that you play with. Or you can buy boosters for a few bucks, which many have been complaining about making it, 'pay-to-win' or you  are grinding for hours to get cards to upgrade your deck. In reality, this is the exact same system that was in the previous games. Either you are stuck grinding a deck to get cards for it, or you can pay a little extra money to unlock the full deck instantly. The starting decks aren't bad either, while many people may complain that they are, and are also getting smashed '9/10 times on the easiest setting because the AI cheats' The AI doesn't cheat, you suck at Magic. I have only lost once in 2015 so far, on planeswalker difficulty, which was my first time against Avacyn, and the second time I faced her, I smashed, loosing little life. During these games, I have also mulled down to 5 twice and still won, making it so that you don't need 'a great starting hand to win.'(Those were also with the starting deck) In the previous games, all cleared on planeswalker difficulty, I rarely lost as well. Anything that can happen in a real game, playing with real people, can happen in this game. I feel like this is going to be the best game in the series. I can play how I want to play with the deck I want. It has answered so many fans by allowing deck building and figured out a way to reward players fairly with the boosters. While some boosters may give you a card you need/want, and others won't. This adds more strategy to a highly stratigic computerized card game, where in the previous ones I was playing more on ""luck"" with the strongest pre-made deck there was in the game. This is an awesome game for the series. For people that have been playing MTG for a while, they will like being able to build a deck with and have more strategy when playing again either an AI or another player. While this game may feel like Magic Online, just remember they are putting more money into that than you are into this, and Magic Online has a way bigger card library than this game.Also, if you are having trouble with the clunky menus, try a better computer, I'm running this game with no issues with gameplay or the menus.

												Magic 2015 is an awesome game for any MTG fan! The Deck Building is a lot better then past version and gives you exactly what you need to build the ultimate deck. With over 900 cards to unlock and use, you will be able to build a pretty devastating deck. This is the MTG video game I have wanted since the first version. Good job Wizards of the Coast!			"

												I was checking up on MTG 2015 to see if there were any improvements and realized I had not reviewd it. Well here you go.....What can I say that hasn't been said already? Long time MTG fan and follower of the Steam games when MTGO took a turn for the worst after the 3.0 patch. Since then I've enjoyed the Steam versions, closed decks and all because they provided a solid MTG experience with formats I enjoy despite each year being horribly buggy games with overtuned DLC designed for sales and not game balance. Now then, 2015 takes the bulls*hit from previous versions and turns it up to 11 by removing my favorite format 2HG, 2015 was a broken as usual, and with the new custom format there's less skill involved. Overall it killed my desire to continue supporting even the Steam versions and I'm closing the book on this one. Thank you for some good times MTG. Avoid this game unless you're the utmost die-hard fan.			"

												The negative reviews are by whiny little kids who were hoping for more more MOAR!!! But that is not the way of MtG...this MtG is one of the best PC versions they have released so far. Yes you start with crappy decks but hey this time you get to build it yourself instead of using only the premade decks. More whiny little children are complaining about the lack of 2HG to which I would say...just wait, it will most likely come and if it doesn't then go back to playing 2014, one feature missing doesn't justify crying like a toddler. SO...why is it that I recommend this title?1. It builds further into the MtG world with a new storyline (every MtG has a pretty lame story but still it is something)2. New cards to choose from3. New opponents4. New ability to build your deck from boosters5. Shiny new menu (not sure why people think it's bulky because it's extremely smooth for me who is running this game on a crappy Acer laptop.)6. Pretty cool animations7. ITS FRIGGIN MTG SO SHUT UP AND PLAYIt's another MtG game so expect more of the same and at $9.99 it is a steal. However I would expec tthat it would be much better on console.			"

												Honestly, I don't know why this game is getting such a bad rep. If you enjoyed the other games than you should like this one. It is a little harder to win but I would hate it if I could get all the cards easily. As for people buying up a bunch of backs and stuff to pump up their deck I don't know if I care for that but what are you going to do about it. I have enjoyed playing this game and at least give it a shot. If you can buy it during a steam sale while being able to buy some packs for cheap than I think that it would be a steal.			"

There is a lot of different things you can do with the decks and I think that it opens a new world to the series. I liked all of the magic games so far, I think they are really fun to play with friends and now they added the new deck building option it adds a completely new and awesome thing to the game! For those of you wondering I do play magic in real life as well. All in al i would recommend this title if you have played and enjoyed the previous games, like being a sneaky mothertrucka and making pimpass decks also if you like a challenge becaus the campaign can be hard in places!

												Magic 2015 is hard to reccomend.  On one hand, if you're a fan of magic, you'll enjoy the single player experience...somewhat.  This incarnation has some pretty bad AI that won't attack you when they clearly have the upperhand and the mana usage on your part is spotty at best when selecting spells.  The  AI will legitamately use all the mana from one color to cast a spell when you still have other cards of that color in your hand.  You need to hit control to change this but it shouldn't be that way, the AI should be smart about it.  There have been countless times when I raged at my screen when I forgot to hold control.  The graphics and all that are fine.  THis time around there are very nice cut scenes and some kind of fog effect on each screen.  Its REALLY annoying and slow to navigate.  If you want to exit the game, you have to go back through 3 seperate screens, all with fog fadeaway's that take forever.  I own every DOTP Magic game except 2014 so I dont know what MP modes if any, are missing from that one.  But in 2015 many people are annoyed that two headed giant was removed.  I personally don't care.  I play this for the SP mode.  It seems like the devs spent more time fleshing out the SP expeirence and didn't have time to add all the mp modes.  These Magic games are coming out like new cars.  1 every year and always 6 months prior to the new year they're listed for.  Lastly I'd like to talk about the microtransactions.  You don't need to buy cards although its available right away.  I wouldn't waste your money to buy all the cards right away.  It doesn't take long to unlock most of them.  Play the game you paid for and grind the cards out yourself.  It's actually not that tedious or boring.  My major complaint is there's no tracking system for each level you complete telling you if you've already unlocked a booster from that level or not.  Normally you have to complete each level in order but when you arrive at a new plane, there is an option to explore it or move on to the first boss.  The explore option unlocks a booster but there's no way of telling if you've already done that level when coming back. I personally cant recall what I ate yesterday, let alone if i unlocked a booster pack from a video game.  But now, you can make whatever deck you want and this was badly needed in every other iteration of MTG.  This is without a doubt the best SP expeirence for Magic besides playing Magic Online and buying digitcal cards with real money.  For 10 bucks this game is worth a buy I""d say if you're a Magic fan.  If you're just a card game fan, play Hearthstone.  It's free to play.  So it's really hard to suggest this as a buy or not.  Alot of reviewers on here are raging that the MP mode was gutted.  But I don't care about it.  So buy it if you just care about the SP experience.			"

												People aren't doing this game justice.It really is a great magic game, better than its predecessors.Idk why people are saying it's difficult i just went through innistrad and theros without a single loss. (10 games)Pick the black and white deck I guess, it has lots of bomb removal. Easy peasy.I saw someone say that you cant choose which color mana is taken for the costs of spells, you can. lolThe game gives you more cards, faster than earlier games also, so idk why people are complaining about not getting cards.I've gotten lots of good ones from my victories.Don't believe the dumbasses that don't know how to play magic. Is good game.			"

												Despite the bad reviews, I find the game to be everything you would expect from a MTG game.  The game play is how it should be, The game was well worth the price and will keep playing it until Magic 2016 when they come out with the next flavor. Can't really go wrong for $9.99.			"

												Magic 2015 - Duel of the Planeswalker is, I think, a 5th installement in the series. It's a great way to get into Magic - the game gives you your first starter deck and after each win you get a random booster pack with new cards. Just like in paper Magic you create a 60 card deck out all the cards you have a and battle opponents on 5 different planes. After you unlock enough cards other deck archetypes become available - this is really only a suggestion as you can modify these decks however you want. As you progress further the opponents get way more powerful. To the point where your regular aggresive deck is not enough and it is better to play control/discard deck. I haven't played all the encounters yet but Liliana was hard for me and Garruk boss fight is actually two fights that you have to win one after another.The deck building is a little diffrent from real Magic. You can have 4 copies of any common card, 3 uncommon, 2 rare and 1 mythic. In paper Magic its 4 copies of any card. I understand this though, a player who grinded the game for hours will have 4 of many rare cards and would get a real advantage over newcomers. It's like in World of Worldcraft high level characters can't slaughter new players freely. Overall deckbuilding is easy and fun to do. There are filters for colors, cost of the cards and the type. There is even an autocomplete button. You can customize land numer if you want (has to be enabled in advanced options)There are no challenges this year, which is ok but the feature doesn't seem that time consuming that they couldn't add it. Challenges where premade play situation in which you had to usually win in one turn against the odds. They were nice but, really, you could only play them once. Also missing is 2headed giant mode in which 2 players compete against another pair. Each pair share a life total of 30. Since multiplayer was always laggy and it was almost impossible to connect, I don't lament this omission. Usually at least one person of the loosing team would disconnect and you would get a win and card unlocks. About card unlocks - new game is superior to 2014 and earlier. You get a random booster of cards that can possibly help your deck. Before you could only unlock single card and most of the ulock were useless. So you had to play, say, 15 games to unlock 2 useful cards and the rest was just a grind. Now each win can be a gain.The Planes themselves are nicely designed. Each deck has a theme corresponding with it. Vampires and Zombies in Innistrad (horror plane), Allies and Kor people on Zendikar and so on. It is just exciting to play against them. Unfortunally not all the cards that opponent has in his deck are playable (can't get them in boosters or anywhere) Some of the cards are only available from premium booster pack which have a real money cost (microtransactions). They are not game breaking and I'm not planing to buy any of them as I didn't buy sealed slots a year ago. Also when you complete the campaign there is really nothing to do. Apart from multiplayer which is quite pointless. On the graphic side they did a complete overhaul this year, consisten with current line of Magic graphic design. The menus are ment for consoles and tablets (they always were) and some spinning wheel movements are not that easy with a mouse. I play with a controlle and it is very comfortable.To sum up, Magic 2015 is a very good game. It captures the Magic spirit of openning boosters and tuning your deck (though experienced players do not buy boosters :) and makes it a challenge to both create a deck and win with it. It might be a bit challenging to beat late game encounters for new players but overall I think they will be fine if they are patient. I reccommend this game to anyone who wants to get into Magic or wants to get back from a long break.			"

												Ok, to start off: Of course the game isn't going to be as good as the physical version, you lose alot of the ability to customize your deck and whatnot. However, the game is solid. I know that alot of people are disliking the menu, but I actually like it. It's a scolling thing, for those of you that don't know, where you click and drag to go to the next option. It isn't a big issue. The next thing I've seen people complaining about is how the game automatically spends mana for you. THIS CAN BE CHANGED. There's a button that lets you choose how you want to spend the mana. Next is the elimination of two headed giant. This is something that I wish was in there, perhaps they'll add it later. The deck building is kinda awkward, but manageable. Overall is a decent game, for those who don't want to go friday night magic, or those who just want to play more often. I'd give it a solid 8/10, (for the elimination of two headed giant, and for only a so-so deck building system). If you have a controller laying around, you may want to play with that, but you definitely can play with KB&M without a ton of difficulty.			"

												I've played a little bit and I think the games getting a bit more flak than it deserves. Sure the game has its problems like trouble unzooming cards and a few awkward default options but it does have a lot going for it. It has quite a bit of card selection compared to the base set of 2014. I personally dont find the game dificult but of the premade decks available to start I got my favorite kind. I figured it was going to be pick a color ok thats your deck to go but its quite more. It provides a chance for you to try even new decks that your not typically going to use. It was pick your color, I chose black, then it was pick from these options: black red, black blue, black green, black white. From there you unlock more cards to customise your deck to get ideas on what you might like allowing you to custom make decks for multiplayer where you learn even more about ideas.EDIT: I am playing on planeswalker difficulty it's not as hard as one might think and I'm using a black & white deck which can bring you to very low life totals for a high risk/ high reward situation.

												I like this game.Now, can I say I really like it?  No.  Is it acceptable?  Unlike every other review I've read for the game by people who are immidiately unpleased by the UI or Gameplay, I say it is acceptable.  Firstly, lets discuss what they did well.  Now, they did nothing exceptionally, but, a lot of what they did do they did on par.  The UI, often credited by even the haters as 'fancy'(although sometimes to a fault), does a good job of reflecting the set the game was built around.  As a matter of fact, I feel the team that put together this game was in much closer contact with the group that made this core set of magic.  However nice it is seeing old cards and gimics in a Duels of a Planeswalkers game, it isn't really reflective of magic at the time, and if some one would use this game as a learning mechanism to get into magic, I believe it is more important for them to know what to expect from the sets of cards they are getting into.  Not some crazy infinite turn combo that they will never be able to pull off without putting in time and money to get old cards that they can't even use in standard which is a common starting ground for new players.  The gameplay is exactly what I'd expect from a Duels of the Planeswalkers game, it plays just like its predecessors.  With their special scenarios and silly at times AI.  The story, unlike past versions of this game, does actually exist.  Is it deep?  No, but, the fact that it exists at all is a step in the right direction.I haven't dabbled in the multiplayer as of yet, but I'm certain that plays just like past versions of the game as well.  The lack of 2-headed giant is a negative factor, but not game breaking.  The ""Pay to Win"" controversy that seems to be surrounding this game is unfounded.  Looking at the cards you can get by buying the premium booster packs the game offers you is simply a way to 'step up' your game.  Not skip the staircase all together and become a god of the multiverse.  If you've played sealed, it's simply exanding your sealed pool with cards of similiar or worse value.  You do not need to buy packs to win, and can be just as succesful with the game if you don't want to open your wallet past the 10$.Tied in to that ""Pay to Win"" mind set people are getting into is the deck building, which is exaclty what they promised.  I for one am more excited for future DLC that expands the card pool in this game then I ever was waiting for new pre-made decks  in previous games.The most important question for many of you though is, is the game worth the 10$ pricetag?  If you've been a purchaser of past magic DOTP games upon release, I'd say yes.  This game offers a unique experience, which seems to be off setting to many people who have played past games, but I've become fairly fond of the game.  Hopping on and playing it as much as I did any of the previous versions.  If you are some one who would otherwise usually wait for a sale, wait for the sale.  Overall, I do recommend this game.			"

												I got this game wanting to start Magic the Gathering, having never played it before.  So far it is quite fun.  This game feels very friendly to new players.  The tutorial is pretty good and there is a lot of features that can help new players along like auto-completing decks.  To be honest with you i don't think the AI is too hard to beat or that my starting deck is that bad.  I've only lost one game so far, in the first area.  But I might have just been lucky or the green and white deck is super op.  It is an important thing to note that this game has some downsides too.  You can buy cards from the store which makes it a little pay2winish.  But, you get cards pretty quickly in the campaign so I would recommend playing that before you play online.  Also, when you chose your starting deck you cannot change it or get a new one, but you can make more with cards you've earned.  Another con is that the gameplay and UI feel a bit slow and clunky.  I would definitely reccomend this game to new Magic players, but I could see how veterans are troubled by it.			"

IF YOUR NEW PLAY 2014 FIRST, WITH THAT IN MIND LET ME BEGIN.Pros -As a console gamer, my heart dropped it's balls at the reveal of 2015 only half way through the year, with 2014 now a dusty title in my 360. What, you can finally customize decks? There's a new steamlined interface? It was madness!After clikcing the buy button, I booted it up come July 16th, and was sastified. This was what I, and so many others, wanted all along.Cons - Yep, NO 2 HG. It's sad when developers actually remove parts from a series, especially since that is what drew me into multiplayer in the first place.Also, who vomitted on the menu selection screen? If your going to optmize for console and tablet users, don't f****** forget the pc crowd. : (Did I also mention that this wasn't for people new to the franchise?Conclusion :All in all, it's incredible to see the new steps being taking forward for this ip, with big Publishers like Ubisoft and EA showing how easy it is for game developers to grow careless. If you love this series, or just mtg in general, I highly reccommend such a large libary and integrated play for 10$!			"

												Took nearly an hour and a half to complete the first campaign because of lack luster starter deck.Some challenges take a long time to complete and require you to create a new deck to do so.Redundant grinding to unlock booster packs.These may sound like complaints, but I rather enjoy all of these little quirks!Instead of paying $40 to have the game nearly completed for me, I put work into it!Instead of looking up how to do something online, I used my brain and figured out a method all on my own!Last ""boss"" used a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t combo on me. Took me over 2 hours to take him down10/10 would play again!SUMMARY:You can read all of the negative cry baby reviews claiming that the starter decks suck (and they do); I would be rather♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off if the game started me off with an unbeatable deck... there's no fun in that / no learning curve at all (if that were the case).I enjoyed the excitement behind taking roughly 2 hours to complete a leg of the campaign, unlocking booster packs, and the excitement when you get an amazing card that you will build a new deck around.My only real complaint is that there is no 2 headed giant :(Solid Duels of the Planeswalkers game overall.

												IF YOU ARE EXPECTING 2 HEADED GIANT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!I knew this before I got the game but there are so many upset people posting in the forum about this I figured we should get this out of the way from the start. There is no 2v2 mode in this year's edition of Magic. If that is your favorite style of play you should probably stick to 2014. Here is what I do not like about the game:The user interface is slow and clunky. It may be only a second delay here or there, but it is noticeable. The menu screen is in a scroll format and not a list. That means only one option is displayed on the screen at a time and you may have to scroll 6 times to find the sub menu you are looking for.During the combat phase the battlefield actually splits open partially, exposing a red glowing divide between the players. It closes after the combat phases, but this animation still takes a small portion of time and happens every time. As someone who plays with card animations off I find this mildly irritating. The game forces you to play the tutorial (on the hardest difficulty you still have to play the tutorial boss) even if you have played Magic a lot. Seriously, the game asks you how much Magic you have played and choosing ""a lot"" then immediately dumps you into the tutorial. You have to play through the first plane to get any extra cards you paid for. People who pre-ordered got a free premium booster pack (these packs are not free unlocks, you usually have to buy them) and people who own Magic 2014 also get a free premium booster pack, at least at the time of writing this review. People who paid for the complete version may be upset to find all those extra card unlocks they paid for are not available until after the first hour or so of gameplay. What I do like about the game:I like being able to customize my own deck. My biggest problem in 2014 was that I played among a small group of friends. After playing my first card or two they knew what deck I was playing and what they needed to do to counter. Now I can keep them guessing.I like that you can buy the regular $10 version and play the game to unlock all of the base cards in the game. I can get the same content as the people that bought the Complete version just by playing the game enough.After getting used to all of the things I don't like about the game they all kind of became background noise and I found myself enjoying just playing the game. If I weigh the pros and cons of the game I would say that the $10 version is worth picking up. I would definitely buy again and do not regret my pre-order.Tl;dr - NO 2hg, some additional cards you have to pay to get. Buy $10 version for better value. UI is bad, but playable.			"

												Great game, the deck building is amazing, the only cons are you cant choose what man to use when casting. Be ready to grind for booster though.			"

												I took the time to play this game, i'v completed a couple of chapters of the campain now (on planeswalker) unlocked some better cards and i have been noticing more card combos or some types of themed decks to be built. Now my background on MTG, i have played it alot in the past and still have my cards but just don't have the time to play it e.g travelling to the closest place to play with others and trade etc, so this is the next best thing for me you can fully customize decks and build your own, for all you guys new to MTG or are used to pre made deck (you can unlock more premade decks) really take the time to look at your cards so you can build a decent deck instead of complaining and writing a bad review because you suck at the game even on easy.......(i saw some write below they struggle to beat an easy a.i without a perfect hand 0_0 ) overall i really enjoy this game, i feel its the best one they have done so far with the multiple fully customisble decks (including deck cover and the name of it), the amount of cards they have put it i'm looking forward to see what the dlcs are, gameplay feels more involving in the constant tought of perfecting a deck, feels more like real life MTG.Bad things i'v picked out about this game, charging for booster packs (you get rares in everyone of the ones you beat a.i on anywayz), charging for card collections (unlocking full chapters of cards) just play the game it will get your deck ready for multiplayer don't fall in to paying for fast track items, also the menu is terrible you can barely see where your going its like they put a bag over my screan and the game is poorly optomized i even had performance issues with the game on: i7-4770k 12gb ram and r9 270xpersonally i think you should buy the game if you enjoy proper MTG, if your new to it (great way to get better at a low cost) or are considering to start playing irl its a great way to see if you will enjoy the game without all the cost of buying more cards, casual players will enjoy this but be warned its not for everyone most people that have never played it will  normally enjoy it more with friends.

												While I recomend this game, I will say it's a vast difference from the last 2 incarnations. This one is more aimed at the die hard deck builders and casual stratagists than the casual players 2013 and 2014 aimed at. That said, it still feels like some things are missing. With the loss of 2HG there is no longer any reason to sit down and play with a friend, this was a huge tactical error in my oppinion, as that mode was the main reason I recomended last years verion to friends. The other big missing piece for me, is all the cards you see used that are not available in the game. I know it's not cost effective and there will never be an MTG game that contains huge set lists, but if you're going to show me something in a game or have me using it in a tutorial mission, allow me to unlock it. Howerver, like all games it has it's pros and cons.Pro's:Battle UI - it just feels better and has a much crisper look and feel than the last two year's version.Deck builder - Finally, you can make your own deck the way you want it within the restrictions of the card listBooster unlocks - there's just something about getting to open a booster pack of random cards after a duel that makes you want to keep going...much better, imo than single card unlocksLonger campaign play - having to unlock lists of cards and trying to get 4 of each ensures you stay in the campaign mode beating down random opponents for much longer than you ever did in 2013 or 2014.Cons:Storyline is still lackluster - you will find yourself skipping most dialog just to get on with it.Weak starting decks - if you showed up with any of these starting decks to a friday night magic, you'd be laughed out of the building. It takes a couple hours of gameplay to get a decent deck going, and your still going to have to get use to restarting a good amount of the duels.Lacks beef - there are good cards, staples and new, but there just aren't enough concept cards to really go full on with a stratagy, you will end up with filler cards to cover things that you just don't have available. This also brings about the existance of pointless cards.So, with that said. I recomend this game to the solo players, deck building enthusiests, and those that frequented the multiplayer. If you are an avid 2HG with friends, stick to 2014. And if anyone from the design team happens to check this(doubtful), get on some dlc or a patch to give me that pacifism that appeared in my tutorial deck but isn't available in the game.			"

Posted: July 18, 2014
												After reading a few of these reviews I couldn't help but write one myself. I feel like the game is vastly underrated and hopefully I can convince you that playing this game can be lots of fun!One Thing that appears over and over again is:- The starting decks are terrible and you need to face enemies several times to beat them. I started with the blue/white deck and that deck has no damage whatsoever. My strongest creatures were 4 mana 3/2 flyers or something similar. With these creatures as my main damage source I had to face Avacyn many times to finally pull off a victory. BUT I played on the highest difficulty. I don't get how people complain how they don't faceroll on the highest difficulty. I was devestated after I lost to the same card over and over, but I finally came out with a victory and it felt GREAT! Take it as a challenge you try to overcome. I got lucky and had a few pretty good cards in my first boosters, but a few enemies still had me tweak my deck specifically for that encounter. Enemy plays honor of the pure in turn 2 and subsequently has too strong a board? Get some enchantment removal! Enemy plays auras? Get bounce! If you want to faceroll just go to lower difficulty. But being too proud to do so and then complaining how you don't win on your first try every time is just plain stupid. (pardon my language)Another point people make is that you can buy boosters for real money. That is true. It defininitely is a minus, but then again. You need to pay just shy of 22 € to unlock all premium cards (I already got two premium boosters for preordering and owning 2014). I payed more than 32€ on other games I played way less than I played magic just in the past two days alone. Even if you don't want to pay money for those cards: You get plenty good cards in the standard set. There are however a few points that annoy me about this game:First and foremost: There is no two headed giant. This, for me, is the worst thing about the game. I have three friends that also play the game and having just a four player game without teams is just too chaotic for my tastes. 2hd is my tournament format of choice, so not being able to play it here is a real bummer. 2: The matchfinder in multiplayer is kinda buggy. Only 20% of the time I find a game with ""quick match"". The other times I load for ten seconds or so and then get a message, that the game is full or not available or something. I really love playing online, but it is annoying.3: The land usage AI took a step down from 2014. In 2014 you at least did not tap mana for spells you have in your hand, but the new AI somehow messes that up completely. ""You have dissolve in your hand? Lets tap down all your blue mana!"". Of course you have to switch to manually assigning lands, but if you are not careful enough it sometimes messes up your turns completely. I do however feel this is a little oversight and will be fixed? maybe? please? Shouldn't be too hard? To end it on a high note: After unlocking all cards I tried out the automated deckbuilder. You have ten pre-build decks you can choose from and all of them seem quite solid. I didn't play all of them, but looked over most of them. I did do a few minor adjustments here and there, but even if you don't want to do that you can have plenty of fun without having to invest time building the decks. By the way: I love how they made the campaign and exploring feel interesting. Some enemies have really interesting decks. One enemy mills himself, another one attacks me with a 418/418 hydra, another deck conists solely of traps, when exploring a cave you start with the blazing torch on your side of the battlefield and so on. I like the overall feel of PvE!To sum it all up: You start small and have to earn your boosters at low levels. After a few encounters your deck becomes stronger and stronger and eventually you have almost complete freedom in your choice of deck. I love this game!Thanks for reading and have fun playing ;)			"

												Here is a link to the starter deck lists.  Before I finished the 3rd plane I could make decks of any color combo just fine and am currently using 2 colors I didn't even start with.http://community.wizards.com/forum/mtg-duels-planeswalkers/threads/4107676I would rate indulgent tormenter the highest value rare avail with the starter choice but the phytotitan and seige dragon are also good picks.  The life and death deck is also ok since it gets a bonus rare (Cruel Sadist) in addition to the unlock.Pros:-Full open deck building from the games card pool-Planeswalker difficulty is appropriate even if about the same as always-Unlocking cards seems way faster this time and more fun due to the booster system-Explore mode avail in each plane to randomize the AI opponent if grinding for cards-Explore mode opponents are unique and not the same as any of the story challengesCons:-that hydra battle in theros.. that fight was the hardest and so early the decks were still too weak-Mana tapping AI is worse-Can't rebind to mouse keys-No 2HG, just 2, 3 and 4 player free for alls (hope they add more modes later)-Can't stop the timer anytime making it harder to react-Required to back out of several menu's to change decks-Premium cards are not possible to be obtained without investing money in premium boosters but you will never get more dupe cards from them than you can add to your collection.  Ths means that 12 (read 14 but mine stopped at 11 and i got 1 for preorder) boosters will be all that it will take to complete the premium set at the moment.  This also means that it will cost a minimum of about $30 for this complete game ($10 for the base and about $20 for the premium boosters) or $50 if you buy the complete edition but I like to open boosters and progress my collection as I play so I prefer the $10 base game over the complete edition.  The card pool is large enough to not need the premium cards but there are some that are tempting.Overall, I think the $10 base game is a great buy for new players or veterans that can no longer afford real MTG (like me).  This one might be somewhat less accessable to new players due to the complexity inherant to the game and that it requires you to learn to build decks but it should be worth it in the long run.  I didn't like the old dotp games becasue of the deck restrictions and only bought those to toy with the new cards till I inevitably got bored. They felt like training tools I was to advanced for but I really like this one.To any new player concerning deck building..  I suggest 1 land for every 2 cards of a color (40 cards / 20 land) unless your just barely splashing a color then you might have to have a few more or some alt mana sorces to ensure you get to use the color when you draw it.  It might be good to overland a tiny bit (38 cards, 22 land) if you are playing larger more expensive decks without suitable mana ramp.  I suggest sticking to 2 color decks till you are more comfortable with deck building.  I also think one should avoid any card that costs 7 or more or be very sparing with them.  Even the 6 cost ones better be very worth and make up a tiny portion of the deck unless one is playing enough ramp to make it reliable or have a strong enough early game to carry it there.  My last piece of advise is to approach blue with caution because its easily the hardest color to play well.  It is my favorite but its subtle control that will likely feel straight up weaker than the other 4 to new players.In closing, I feel this version is multiple times more enjoyable than the other dotp games and can't understand all the negative reviews at all except for the lack of 2HG and the controversy around the premium boosters.  I think the premium boosters were a bad idea concerning PR and fear they might exploit players with them in the future but don't really think its too big of a deal.  The $10 version offers plenty enough and they designed the boosters in a way so that players know that if they buy one that none of the cards are going to be excess.  Maybe its becasue I've played MTG for basically ever and I never have every card the people I play with have so it doesn't matter much to my enjoyment if they chose to spend extra for a few more cards or not.  Was it a lame move with the sole intention of money grabbing?  sure, most likely.  Does it hurt my enjoyment of the game that it exists?  no.			"

												If I could give this a sideways thumb, I would. It's meh at best. Read to conclusion/TL;DR if you don't want to read the review. My thumbs-up is only because I like MTG. Overall rating? 6.25/10If you are a hardcore MTG player, this isn't the game for you at all. I got this game because I wanted to reminisce on my days in middle school when I played this game to the extreme. Given that, I recommend this game for the casual player/those that don't want to collect cards and take up space/newbie players just learning. Having said that, there's some serious kinks in this game. The menu icons, SLOW AS ALL GET OUT. Painfully almost. The graphics look great, but that comes at a price; speed. The instant menu features were way better. Also, just skip the tutorial if you've played before, you don't really need it. The 2-headed giant was a fun mode they got rid of, which major sucks too. Sometimes, I scratch my head at it. This is a cool game if you want to just get into basic deck mechanics, see all the new cards, and just have fun with it. But this game SERIOUSLY lacks from an enthusiast point of view (I used to be an enthusiast). You have to win almost everything to unlock cards...which is okay I guess, but there are some points where you have to redo your colors just to get past certain enemies. Also, you don't get access to any other sets with this. That's my worst complaint about this game. I liked some of the older stuff; 7th edition. I got beat in a tournament because some guy used cards from '93 and had a card called Timewalk, where you could take another turn. Granted, that card back then was wroth like hundreds of dollars, but still...it would be nice to incorporate some of the older serieses into this so we can get a TRUE experience. Also, be ready to restart a LOT. If you don't draw the best hand, you WILL lose. You will need to grind for a long time to build up your library, so be prepared to put some work in if you want to succeed at trouncing people and AI. At least they gave us deck customization (finally?) I've been playing on Archmage difficulty, and it's really stacked against you starting out, but it gets better as you go on. You will probably also need (at some point) to buy the card collections, which is a business tactic to help Wizards out since you aren't buying actual booster packs. HAVING SAID ALL THAT, it seems like the cons outweigh the pros. But if you're just casually looking for some once-in-awhile fun chillin' with a Magic deck, this saves a LOT of heartache with regards to buying cards, deck protectors, travelling to tournaments, dealing with the weird♥♥♥♥♥zealots who take it too seriously. Nothing wrong with that per se, I'm just not that kind of player.Conclusion/TL;DR: Buy this if you're a casual gamer, don't mind spending $5 every once in a rare while (people need to chill on ""pay to win"", it's more like ""pay to make your chances only slightly better"", which sucks but they're a company and that's what they do), and you don't want to deal with the hassle of the real game...BUT wait until it's on sale. I didn't mind spending $10 on this game, but I'd advise until it hits 50% off, then you can buy the game and a few card collections for the same price and have a much better experience starting out AND grinding out.

												For 10 dollas u get some of the lore you crave for MTG alltho its lacking in the storytelling (scenary/sound). This game is not campairable with other version of MTGO, Heartstone or table MTG. This game has a soulpurpose to introduce you to the game, mechanics and lore. They have sprinkled some shinny effects on the game and mechanics to make the duels more intresting for the younger audience.Anyhow, if you are a deep lore diver or a MTG nerd, this game is just for entertainment in another envoirment. Its purely casual and the best way to learn MTG, but be aware that MTGO and DotP are 2 complete diffrent clients, so once you have learned how Magic works, you should switch clients if you really wanna go for it, DotP is a casual inctroduction version of MTGO.This is a stepping stone to MTGO.

												The Steam community is the worst part of the Steam community.This game is enjoyable. People have certain expectations and are overreacting about things being different this year. If you're new to Magic, this is a good way to learn. If you've been playing Magic for a while, why get upset about how one digital version of the game is played? Seriously, go play MTGO or on your kitchen table where you can make up your own rules and modes.For what this game is, it's good. Is it perfect? No. Is it enjoyable and worth $10? Yeah. (Side-note: Anyone talking negative about paying $35 for all the cards is stupid. You can unlock everything by playing the game. If you want to spend extra money to get things faster, that's your choice. You aren't obligated to spend more than $10.)			"

												So far, the only bad thing about this game is the hands reaching for your money inside. I've played my way through most of the Innistrad block of the campaign using the Life & Death deck, and I will say this: it's different.DotP15 is more difficult than its predecessors, but it also allows for more freedom. The cards you unlock do not seem to be predetermined and automatically added to your stable of cards. Instead, each win nets you three cards from the zone you are playing in (Innistrad, Theros, Ravnica, Zendikar) which, if they fit with your deck's colors, you can add to your deck.The tutorial caters to uber noobs and forces you to make potentially bad decisions in deckbuilding. For instance, trading out a 7 mana Resolute Archangel for the 2 mana Raise the Alarm is a superbly horrible decision. The Life & Death deck has so much other fat to trim it isn't even funny.But in this game, you are a noob again and it will take time to build up your collection.... unless you want to drop some more cash. Perhaps the reason people don't like this game is that it recreates the experience of being a new magic player a little TOO well?PRO TIPS!!! -- based on a lot of the negative reviews I have seen so far. You CAN change the mana that is tapped when casting a spell with colorless mana. Hover over the spell and wait a second and the mana that will be tapped by default will be highlighted. Tap the left stick to cycle the possible mana combinations.Also, those people who complained of the menus going slow, use a controller. DotP was made to be played with a controller, and tapping A will cycle past most of the menu transitions.			"

												Most of these reviews have rated Magic 2015 negativley. These players have complained about having to choose a first deck basically at random and then being unable to alter their decision, a cheating AI, a nearly impossible first match outside the tutorial, a clunky menu and having to purchase additonal cards with real money. I sympathize with all this but I think these reactions are hasty, most of these are early game problems. I think people are reacting to how new the experience is, they were expecting one thing from their time playing 2014 and now when 2015 is different we get negative reactions. It's true that the first encounter is tough, took me a lot of tries to get through it with my black/green deck and I wanted to swtich decks as well. When I couldn't I buckled down, learned my new deck and beat the computer. The next matches were a breeze after the first and every won match awarded me with more cards to customize my deck with. Additionally I can build my own custom decks even with cards that are being used in others. The menu is clearly designed with a controller in mind over a keyboard and mouse. The fact that there's even an option to buy cards with real money is disheartening. I won't be buying any, I suppose in multiplayer that will put me at a disadvantage. And there's no 2HG. Some of these problems are real but a lot of the bad reviews I see stem from impatience.			"

												After seeing all the negative reviews I decided to put in my 2 cents.I just beat the game without having to pay an extra cent. Once the deckbuilding menu opens up the game becomes massively easier and overall a lot more fun. There is a huge riot over the lack of 2 headed giant, I don't like this mode however I feel programming wise it would not have taken a huge effort to put in. The menus are horrid. You have to scroll through these awful diamonds that look pretty at first but then swells your anger as you attempt to navigate to your destination. In 2013 the menu was less visually impressive but much easier to deal with. Yes the starting decks are crap but I have often found playing and winning with crap cards at first to be the most fun thing in duels. Perhaps as a modern/legacy player I have grown tired of the uber combos and turn 3-4 wins in the format. There is a certain elegance to using a card that is massively overcosted to achieve victory, pulling off combos you didn't even know existed with cards you most likely have never used. Overall the game is fully functioning with very quick load times. (I am playing on a freaking intel integrated laptop the trick is to use windowed mode and turn down the resolution) Due to some of the problems I kind of wish steam had a ""meh"" option but I would recommend this game due to the fun I experienced playing it.

												I really enjoy this game.  I think it plays nicely, it looks cool, and It is pretty close to playing it in person.  The only issue I had was that the tutorial was sooo annoying.  Luckily, after doing one of the parts to the tutorial, I noticed you could skip to the end, which was a relief.  There are alot of negative reviews on this game.  Alot of complaints about the micro transactions in particular.  I understand that having microtansactions annoys alot of gamers, but I let it slide seeing as how this game, in the rel world, is built on micro transactions.  I reccomend this game and give it an 8.5/10			"

												 if you havn't played any of the Duels of the Planeswalkers games (and even if you have) I cannot more highly suggest instalment of the series.... all the negative reviews seem to be bunk or out of umbrage that their payed bonus content is not imediatly avaliable (heck I had to complete the first part of the story for my 2 bonus packs for preordering but I ain't complaining, I can see the designers choice here too. They want you to get a feel for the game before overloading the player or unbalancing the game)Biggest Pro- Complete Custumization of your deck!Pros-Control of how you spend your mana (this was in 2014 as well but still a pro)-interface fluid and responsive (those who say it feels like it should be on a tablet have a point but I don't see this as a bad thing especialy when your mouse and arrow keys can move you through the menu)Con (yes not plural and only here because I have to have something negative to say or it is not a review)-16:9 resolution not supported out of the box (there have been a few games that have done this recently and it is a nussiance but one that is easily resolved with minimal effort on the users part)			"

												I have enjoyed the game very much so far and would like to address some of the things I have read in peoples reviews, after having beaten the campaign on planswalker:1. It is possible to skip the tutorial (expect the tutorial boss).2. You can reselect you starter deck untill you beat the tutorial boss.3. If you are having a hard time beating the campaign try making an aggro deck as most of the deck you go up against can't seem to deal with them. (ofcourse you can turn down the difficulty aswell)4. There is a mana tapping button.5. Sadly there is no 2HG6, There is card grinding, but I think people are making it worse than it is, atleast if you compare it to other TCG as you will get a booster after each win when you choose to explore.7. I haven't gotten the slow load times, but I am running it on a SSD (hopelly they patch it so it runs well on everybodies PC).8. I think the custom deck building is great, as you can literally take any of the cards you have and make a deck with them (haven't found a limit it so far other than it has to 60 cards).9. I think it will make the online meta game alot more fun and varied, due to the custom deck buiding.			"

												Ok Ima give my honest review of this game as you can see when i whote this review i put 5 hours into it Review lets get started in my opinion this game is fun and im wondering why theirs alot of bad reviews for it as I have read the reviews and saw the main reason people put a bad review its because they removed 2HG (two headed giant) mode and in my case dont let one small thing ruin a whole game who knows maybe if the word gets to the creators ears they will maybe add it by popular demand just saying I still havent beat the innistrad chapter because the final stage is really hard I mean it keeps healing for god sakes I brought it down to 7 and what does it do heals to 24 yes i got mad but im not going to let one small thing ruin a game I paid for ok heres one BIG reason why I really love this game when i first started it gave me a PROMO CODE to redeam on the wizard website and I did and it said go to a pertisipating store to get my free 6-card booster pack with one promo card and guess what IT WORKED i was really happy when i got the pack once i got home I opened the pack and their was the promo card it was a mythic (foil) Soul Of Zendikar I was like WOAH THIS IS AWESOME because it was my first mythic and my first mythic happen to be a foil also that made my day :) ok now about the game I never really played magic and boy this game taught me how to play now I can stradigise plan my attacks think ahead it tought me well and I still need to compleat innistrad chapter so ima wrap this review up id say this game was worth my money I pre-ordered it still waiting to open my free digital premium booster pack in game and yes it may be hard at firs but that only makes you a better player so yes i recomend you guys to buy it hope this review helps you guys if you read all the way till the end thats for listening :)			"

												Pros:+ Decks ARE customizable.+ Booster packs are fun to obtain and open.+ LOTS of cards to choose from.+ Decent production quality on aesthetics.+ Still a good tutorial for new players.Cons:- Focus on single-player storyline is pointless, in my opinion.  Who honestly plays this game for the plot?- No Two-Headed Giant.- UI functions poorly.  I don't care how pretty it looks.- I have a computer that runs Crysis 2 and Shogun 2: Total War on highest settings flawlessly.  This game still managed to bog it down with its... booster-opening animations?Verdict:If you are like me and stuck without many options to play Magic with trusted friends (I live too far away from everyone that I enjoy playing MTG with), 10 bucks is adequate to drop into the game and provides a solid fix.  If you are new to the game, this will suffice as a learning tool.If you are already heavily into the paper game, have a shop close by, and/or friends around to duel with, you'd spend your $10 better on a real-life dual-land, lol.Note to Wizards: don't take yourselves too seriously.  I understand this is no substitute to paper Magic; this is fine where you've placed it.  But ensure it runs better, and sacrifice the cutscenes and incessant fog and needless menu animations to make it happens, please.  All the aesthetic extras scream, ""TRY-HARD.""			"

												I heard that planeswalker difficulty was very hard and reviews I read agree but I just beat Innistrad without losing a match. Also reading reviews that starting deck is weak but with black primary color and a blue black started with a decent deck for starting. I still think the deck building engine could use some improvements letting you sort easier, add cards without it zooming to that card.Agree with some of the complaints about multiplayer because players that purchase cards have definite advantage and there are on 2, 3, or 4 player games. They should have included at least 1 more mode or really added 2HG and a specialty mode like previous versions. They could bring back archenemy, planeschase, or sealed deck or added a new option like commander or draft.I recommend this as good single player fun but multiplayer is not a recommendation as it stands. Maybe they will add an expansion to improve multiplayer.			"

												I honestly don't know why everyone thinks this game is so bad. Personally, I love it. I mean sure there are some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flaws to it, but the devs tried. In 2014 I destroyed the AI, and now the AI is super difficult. It's a $10 game, and I found it really fun. Basically it's like a new Madden. Some people will like it, others won't. The campaign is a good 10-12 long and you have to grind for the cards. So all the people complaining about grinding for cards...why did you even buy the game? Just get some friends and play for real. It really isn't too different from 2014. Good, solid card game. 8/10 Should add card trading and actual planeswalker cards.			"

												First off it seems that most of the reviewers havent even started into the campiagn without forming an opinion. Yes the decks it alows you in the beginning are set so you cant see them. The game is easy to UNLOCK new boosters (YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY BOOSTERS TO GET NEW CARDS). I am more than confident that I will be able to have more than one deck. If your going to review and talk♥♥♥♥♥♥ at least finish the game before you start doggin. Most of the complaints are void due to them being untrue. Play the ♥♥♥♥ing game and stop being a panzy. I started with green/white of course, and the deck is not bad. It actually reminds me of the new journey into nyx decks. The green/white is heavy buffing with alot of synergy. As you would expect. Great game, If your a true magic fan you will be satisifed with your purchase.			"

												Honestly, I am really irritated after having read all of the negative reviews. If you enjoy computer card games, as I do, I believe you will probably enjoy this one as well.  This is not a Pay to win game, as you can unlock cards simply by playing through the campaign. Being able to unlock cards and change your deck gives a definate feel of progression, as opposed to simply starting out with all of the cards from the begining. Granted, you do have the option of buying additional booster packs, but I do not mind that, as this mimicks being able to buy boosters in real life card games. I thought the menu was asthetically pleasing, and have found the game to be very enjoyable overall. As far as complaints about begining with only one deck, you can actually play with different decks in the tutorial and reset each time to try another. That is what I did until I found a deck I was more comfortable with. I also did not have too many problems with the campaign; employ the proper strategy and you will have a better chance of success, with that said-- the game does a brilliant job showing how varied decks can be, and the campaign will expose it's (that is, your deck's) weaknesses. As far as price, a starting price of $9 is not exorbitant by any means, especially, as stated earlier, if the game allows you to unlock cards for free.			"

												Okay, breathe. Let me start by saying I started and stopped playing Magic: The Gathering when I was 10 or 11 years old, I'm 31 now, so let that sink in. I took a fresh step with purchasing Magic 2015 because, hey, why the heck not.It's fun. DO NOT let the die-hard, hard-on-for-a-stupid-2-headed-giant complainers cloud your judgement. Seriously, what the heck is a 2 Headed Giant and why would I care?The gameplay is exactly the speed it needs to be for new players. The game even asks you how much you've played Magic! Now I don't know if that means you get to skip a scenario or not but maybe it ratchets up gameplay speed or the difficulty of the opposing decks in Campaign Mode. Whatever it is, I am LOVING this game.A decent tutorial that introduces each concept awaits any newb. A variety of different starter decks to choose from really helps said newb out as well. While I don't quite know all the concepts this game has me hooked. You get out what you put in, isn't that the motto of life anyways?So, in general, don't listen to to the l33t trolls posting that this game is not everything they experience with other socially-repressed individuals at their local comic store on Friday nights.If you like Magic, only an inkling, feel free to purchase and have fun. FUN. It's a game people. 7 out of 10.			"

												First off, don’t listen to all of the nay sayers. There is a lot of false information floating around and a lot of people who can’t handle the new deck building process. There seems to be a flood of negative reviews and some of the information provided is false or misguided. I am going to address the negative issues before I go into my review:1.	This game is pay to win! This right here is 100% completely incorrect. When you pay your $10 you can play through the entire game and unlock 88% of the entire card collection without ever paying a dime. The other 12% you do have to pay for in booster packs ($28 worth of packs). These “Premium” cards are not game changers either. No one is going to have an upper hand with these cards, there are only a few that matter anyways.2.	The game is Impossible / Too Hard!  Again, this is incorrect. While this game is a bit harder, it is not nearly as hard or impossible as everyone is making it out to be. The big change up from previous versions is the capability to build your own deck. You are no longer getting your hand held with premade decks.     When you start the game you get a single premade deck and that is it. From there the choice is yours. I beat the entire game in 8 hours with nothing but a slightly modified starting deck. I slowly changed it as I unlocked more cards. I then proceeded to beat all of the explore nodes in another 8 hours.      What people need to do is stop complaining about it being so hard and actually seek advice on deck building and tactics. People complaining about not having all the cards unlocked right away is just like people complaining about not having the best gun unlocked in Call of Duty right away.3.	There is no Co-op! Correct! This is true as of right now. Currently there is no Two Headed Giant. While this is one of downsides of this new iteration, it is not a major game changer. With the amount of negative feedback, I feel that it will be making a return in an update possibly. Here is to hoping.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   So after addressing those 3 major issues, let’s head into my actual review. If you don’t want to read my detailed review you can scroll to the bottom for a list of Pros and Cons…    Magic 2015 starts off with an in depth tutorial for anyone who has never played magic before. It is painstakingly slow but it addresses every major point of the game and some decent tactics too (such as waiting until main phase 2 to play permanents). For any players that already know the basics, you can skip the tutorial entirely and go straight to the tutorial boss fight.    Before you start the boss fight you get to choose your first and only premade deck. You get a selection of any 2 Color combination deck you want and then you jump right into the boss fight. This selection determines your starting pool of cards. After you beat the tutorial boss you start the long process of unlocking the entire 88% of the card collection that is attainable without spending money.    You now have 5 Planes to go through beating bosses and collecting cards until you finally meet up with Garruk in the ultimate showdown. For anyone who bought the Complete Pack, You must beat the final boss in Innistrad to unlock your cards and that is also where your card collecting ends. Each Plane has an explore node that you will want to visit multiple times as well (Until you face the Planeswalker from each Node) for more card unlocks.    After you’ve collected your cards (Or bought for some of you), it’s time to head on over to multiplayer. Currently multiplayer consists of 2 Player, 3 Player, and 4 Player free for all’s. Sadly there is no 2 Headed Giant (2v2) for good old co-op fun. I’m hoping they add that later. You can choose to create your own match or join someone else’s via quick match or searching player lobbies. Multiplayer is the place to showcase your deck building skills. This is where you get to see how good you really are at this game.    This brings me to my favorite new addition to the series, deck building. You can finally make your deck however you want to. The deck building options are real easy to use and it’s easy to find the cards you want using the multitude of filters available. As you unlock new cards, you will find them here ready to be placed into your decks. If you have no idea how to build a deck you can rely on the computer to auto complete your deck for you with whatever cards you currently have selected. I recommend getting help from the community or paying attention to card tactics you see in game for deck building though.    You also have the option of browsing your entire card collection from the card collection menu. You can see all the cards you currently own, how many copies, and more importantly, which cards you still need. If you want 100% of the collection you are going to have to fork out another $28 after collecting all the current cards.    Navigating the menus in this game can be tedious. At first everything looks nice and clean and ordered. After you spend some time in the menus though, you start to get annoyed. There is a slight lag when you transition from menu set to menu set. You have to go through multiple menus just to get where you want to. It’s like trying to get to a picture on your computer and going through 3-4 folders to get to it but each time you click a folder there’s a fancy transition you have to wait for. It would be nice of the developers to also change the menu navigation in the future possibly.    Overall this game is well worth the $10 you pay for it. You can spend some extra cash to skip the card collecting if you want as well. I got a good 16 hours out of the single player campaign alone and will spend many more hours in multiplayer and practicing with new decks against the AI. If you are looking for another magic game then this is the game for you. If you are new to magic, then this is the perfect learning device to get into the game. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros-	Real deck building-	In depth tutorial for newcomers -	Single player encounters that require creative thinking-	Options for aesthetic customization-	Multiplayer that truly tests your ability as a player-	Chance to play with 2015 CardsCons-	No coop currently (no two headed giant)-	Annoying menu navigation-	Amount of misguided complaints-       Need to pay extra for complete card collection			"

												This year Duels of the Planeswalkers adds a new major feature: Deck building. You can now build your own decks and customize them at your heart’s content. There are about 1000 unlockable cards in the game and every victory, bee it in single player or in multiplayer, awards you a booster, containing anywhere between 10 to 16 cards. If Pokémon has taught us one thing it’s that you got to catch’em all.Full Review here: http://in2gpu.com/2014/07/19/magic-2015-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-review/ "

												Never played the older games (mostly because of the prebuilt decks), but as an old TCG vet, this version is pretty damn good. I feel like I easily got my 10 bones out of the single player campaign, and this honestly rekindled my love for the card game. I can understand some of these people are ticked off about 2hg being gone, but who really plays that irl outside those without a proper deck?If you look at this game for what it is (a MTG lite intended to hook you into the real money makers....TCG and Magic Online) it does a fantastic job at giving you a basic MTG experience for little effect on the wallet. Seems some of these reviewers thought they were going to get the entire card library with infinite custimization, lol. You'll learn about Wizards of the Coast and their definition of ""value"" eventually padawan. The only complaint I really have is that you are stuck with the deck you choose, so it may be worth it to go ahead and find a listing of contents before you pick one. It will be all you have until you grind enough cards to make a new deck/adjust it, so you have been warned :)			"

												Avacyn... what can I say???  The omnipotent gatekeeper to the Innistrad Chapter and I cannot for the life of me get past her..... Right now I have a wimpy blue-black control deck with one decent rare that I can bring out in the fifth turn.Avacyn can bring out her emancipation angel turn three and return cathedral sanctifier to her hand and bring it out for another three life.I have been playing against Avacyn for over two hours and finally lowered the difficulty to no avail.One game I had her.  Turn 7. I was going to win.  She has no creatures out and no cards in hand.  I had two 2/3's and a 1/1 poking her every round.  She draws and miracles the Mythic Rare angel card and summons four 4/4 angels with flying onto the battlefield.I cant change decks.  I cant get my boosters that came with the game until i finish the Innistrad Chapter.  I cannot earn new boosters.  This is all kinds of frustrating and annoying.7/17/14 -- One day later.After two more games with Avacyn I finally got past her.  I was rewarded with many useable cards from the promised booster packs.  I am in Shandalar now... second to the last single player  realm.  I have not earned an additional booster pack since.  Is there any way to earn more cards?  Or is this a pay-as-you-go kind of game?  I will post when I find out.7/17/14 --- Continued... Changed from thumbs down to thumbs up.  Picked up some useable cards and it suddenly became fun.   The game still needs work... the AI makes dumb moves even at highest level.  I cannot adjust graphics to high resolution due to software problems.  This almost seems like its still in beta?			"

												Seems to be a lot of bad reviews for this game and I will attempt to address most of them.First and formost only free for alls in multi-player mode. Yeah thats a hard hit for fans of 2 headed giant, hopefully the negative feedback about its absence will force an update (Keep your fingers crossed)Second, terrible starting decks and no way to change them. This is like schrodingers cat, both true and false at the same time. The starting decks are under powered but they are not unplayable. I believe the starters are designed to force people to consider new strategies instead of the typical rush, control, or burn play style that they may be used to. And you are allowed to change the starting deck after completing the Innistrad plane (A person just has to take the time to beat the first ""Boss""). After Avacyn is defeat return to the Main Menu>Deck>Create Deck, all of the starter decks should be unlocked.Third, ""Stupid AI tapped the wrong lands for my spell! / Targeted the wrong thing!!!"" Any time you can use different combinations of mana to pay for a spell you can press the left Ctrl key to cycle through the lands to be tapped (says so right in the controls tab). Like wise if the target of your spell is in a stack, like equipment on a creature, you can use the scroll wheel on the mouse to zoom in on the stack and select the proper card you wish to target.The Game is so slow. Yes but there are things that can be done to speed things up, turning off combat animations, turning off zoom played cards, and spamming the continue button. Myself I am kind of thankfull that things move a little slow and we are allowed time to respond to everything, in a ""Real World"" duel you can always ask your opponent to wait or hold on a second. I think a lot more people would be upset if they lost duels because the AI played too fast for them to counter.Its such a pain grinding for cards. Yes it is but if a person does not want to pay a little more then the price of a booster pack in the ""Real World"" to unlock an entire set of cards then it is good that they have the option to grind for the complete set. Unlike the previous versions where we were pretty much stuck with what we got. Which brings me to the next complaint.The game has just turned into another pay to win money sink because ""Richies"" will just buy up all the premium boosters. That statement just isnt true, most of the cards in the premium set have counter parts in the other sets that do the same thing or better stuff. A person just needs to know how to maximize each cards potential.The interface is so clunky. I have to agree with that, it seems to be designed for touch screens, which in theory makes it sleek. However theory and practical application are two very different thing. There is good news for those of us without touch screens, the arrow keys can still be used to navigate most of the menues, instead of using the mouse to click and drag.Now that most if not all of the ""bad"" stuff has been addressed I'll move on to the great things.We can now BUILD decks with our ENTIRE collection of cards!!!! Our collection is actually OURS to play with and do as we wish. Finally we are masters of our own destinies.For less then the price of a fat pack we can now own 5, yes 5 complete digital sets!!!!Yes we will miss 2HG but just because that format isnt CURRENTLY supported by the game doesnt mean that we as players cannot unite and talk to each other and make our own player created formats, like maybe ""common chaos"" where each player can only use common cards in their deck, or some form of 4 player assassin and stuff. As long as everybody playing has agreed to the rules, arranging private games with player created formats shouldnt be a problem at all.I have been playing MtG since Fallen Empires was released and what drew me to the game was the fact that it pushed me to test my creativity and ingenuity. This game is a huge step in getting back to the roots of MtG. So what if a deck we make doesnt win every time. Whats the point of playing if you just snag a deck template some one else created, and every duel plays out the exact same way? Personally that sounds much more boring then grinding cards for a couple hours.In closing I would give this game 9 stars out of 10. IMO it is a huge step in the right direction. While there is room for improvement, the same can be said for any game in existence.			"

												I would recommend this game only to former Magic afficionados. -This game changed a lot of UI interaction, for the worst.-They took away favorited features like two-headed giant.-The game is seemingly pay to play with the amount of ""shiny things"" they offer that let you win easier.Wizards of the Coast needs to address the UI, first and foremost. I doubt they will remove the money grab feel for financial reasons. And also, they need to add an option to change some of the graphics settings besides changing resolution.Other than that, this game still is a magic game, so if you like MTG, its still fun.			"

												Pros: *Nearly full deck customizability with some limitations.*Large campaign to complete to unlock cards before entering multiplayer.*People with good luck get to steam roll people with bad luck due to RNG Deck Shuffles.Cons:*Deck customization has some weird and non explained limitions on ""how to"" manually create a deck.*AI can be EXTREMELY hard at times, and most of the times has best possible RNG Deck Shuffles.*If a player leaves during a multiplayer match before game is over, an AI will replace them and can possible destroy you. (leaving should forefit the match completely, not spawn an AI, leave that for Single Player.)*The ""loading screen"" between menus is extremely annoying and wasteful. Too slow.*Harder difficulties seem nearly impossible and don't seem to reward anything different then playing lower or lowest difficulties.*[Glitch] When starting the game, after closeing after editing your sound settings, everything before the Start button is super loud (back to default) until you click the Start button*[Glitch] Sometimes when selecting menu options your click isn't recognized and you need to click several times to activate the menu.*[Glitch] You can click menu options spamming the sound continuously until the menu starts changing.*[Glitch] When using Travelers Amulet, if you close the screen to select a land card without confirming by Escaping or other means it freezes your turn and you can not do anything else nor bring the land select screen back up. This is a huge bug and has cause me to lose some matches.*People with bad luck get wrecked by people with good luck due to RNG Deck Shuffles.My notes:*$10 sure, $35 just to get cards you would have gotten for playing the campaign, no.*Not having all the cards from all the starter decks after tutorial is kind of lame. I would have liked to have been able to switch my decks for certain battles without farming all the Explore missions for cards I should have started with.*The game has its flaws, but for a $10 card game, its well worth it, even if I have the worst luck in the world. Better then spending 100's of dollars on real world card packs to build decks and play physically.			"

												Game Score: 7/10Magic 2015 is one of the games that I've been looking forward to. I've noticed that many people would not recommend this game on steam due to the ""pay 2 win"" accusations. The truth of the matter is that, if you like to play Magic and don't want to pay a lot for the cards, then this is the game for you. At first the game is really hard and it does feel like a pay 2 win game. But, after playing more and more, I've made my very own deck, because that's a new feature in 2015, and I feel like I'm having a lot of fun. Pros:*Customizable decks (build your own)*Feels and plays like the card game*Makes you ""grind"" like an RPG to get better cards*Good viusals and is great for new players to learn the gameCons:*Resolution issues*Buggy in places here and there*Rather hard even in the tutorial*You start with one pre-built deck that you can't reviewSo I'd say that this game is made for new to veteran players. It's fun and doesn't cost a lot to play. People are complaining that the game is ""too hard"" or ""pay 2 win"" but, in reality, you just need to play the game and you can change the difficulty of the game in the options menu. Another issue people are complaining about is that the Lands get tapped for you when you are playing a Spell. Let's say a card costs one green and then any other and you have two green Lands and a red. In your hand you also have an Enchantment that costs one green as well. The computer, most of the time, will use the two green Lands to play the first card leaving you with the red Land left over causing you to not be able to use the Equipment Spell that turn. To fix this problem, just hit the CTRL key on the keyboard. It will go through a cycle of combos of Lands that you see fit to the situation.Overall, I believe that Magic 2015 is NOT a bad game at all. They may have removed and changed things here and there, but it's still a good game. I'd give Magic 2015 a 7/10 score. This is because of the lack of the first deck's information given to you and how hard the tutorial is.			"

												Good game. Still a stripped down version of the paper version but fun none the less. While the menus are a bit much (probably one maybe two to many clicks to get where your going and the animations and rollovers probably need some fine tuning on the buttons) but once you get into the spellslinging action nothing seems amiss.The deck building is Solid and having a fully customisable deck for the first time is great!The difficulty level can be quite sharp on the highest level due to your opponent having much stronger cards then you in the early game may make it feel cheap. Ive been playing on the regular difficulty level and have yet to play a game that seems unwinnable.7/10 lots of room for improvement but totally playable none the less.			"

												Many negative reviews..JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE ONE POSITIVE REVIEW, DON'T BE A♥♥♥♥♥♥... =__= I'm a first time Magic Player and did some research on the previous iterations of MTG Duels. This game IS NOT pay to win. After you complete Innistrad (?) you can go and do their ""explore"" option and gain booster packs quickly and efficiently. Beginner Decks aren't weak in my opinion (then again, I'm new so what would I know, right? hah.... Scrub) I beat the Innistrad boss and all it's content in one try with the beginner deck and I have had no problems getting through the challenges. *edit* I found out there's different difficulties. WELP. Will update on multiplayer once I grasp all the concepts.All in all, really solid for newcomers like myself, and I believe it brings alot to the table.Hell, this time around you can build your own deck~ Don't cry about it, rejoice fools!

												Why everyone is whinning about weak cards? It's really weak, it's hard, but only until u can farm some boosters and finish the campaing (I didn't yet, but I'm almost finishing). It's not that hard to unlock cards, of course it's unfair to play online if u didn't buy the complete edition, but it's fun to play against AI since it's harder than the previous and it's not predictable like b4.Ppl are complaining about mana tapping, I think they're kinda of n00b, since u can choose the manas with CTRL JUST LIKE 2014 version. The problem is, the auto tapping isn't smart like b4 (if u have a instant that costs a forest and u have a forest and a swamp and u play a card that is 1 colorless cost, then it may tap the forest if u don't change it with CTRL).I recomend if u really like magic, 'cause the start really sux if ur not patient and if start crying if u loose some matches because of the weak starting deck, but unless u play alot against AI, like for a week or 2, like 30-50 hours of game play u can get alot of good cards, it's even shorter than mopst of games nowadays that u need to spend 500-thousands of hours to achieve something. If u don't realize why ur loosing and don't change ur deck from enemy to enemy, than I wouldn't recomend this.And yes, the menu is slow like sh it, feels like ur using a bad tablet touchscreen, but got used to it.

												Pretty controversial release - Wizards managed to take a few steps back in the attempt to bring MTG deck building to the average video gamer. Premium packs to the removal of 2HG have been big concerns. That said, the campaign is much improved and you get deck building now. The decks you face are unique and sometimes really brutal.  There's a lot of background and flavor while exploring the different planes. The narrative gives just enough as you're battling your way to Garruk. You're not just beating AI precon decks in a row just to get to the last Boss deck anymore.For people who wanted MTG to have a good singleplayer experience with free form deck upgrading, this is the game to get. People who wanted a more iterative sequel might be disappointed. "

												By looking at the other reviews, it seems like no one has done their research. I understand disliking a game because a feature has been left out, ie 2HG, but to rate it just because of that is terrible.Anyway, I really like the new menus. They load up quickly and they are ""3d"" looking. The tutorial is a little boring for players that have already played, but it is very thorough. The starter deck is not that bad, and I won the first time I used it (mainly because I knew the deck dynamics which is a must to succeed in any digital tcg). The premium boosters, in my humble opinion, are nice to have. I do not have to have them to win, but I can purchase them if I want. -Review Update-I have read some more reviews saying that the game is ""so hard"" and that you have to buy the premium boosters to win. Well, I have beat the first plane, and almost the second plane with just using the starter deck (minus one card from the booster/deck builder tutorial). I have not had any difficulty. In fact, I am thinking about changing the difficulty level to offer more of a challenge. I gues those people that have issues do not know how to play Magic.-Pros--Simplistic UI-Mostly newer cards (most of the other games recycled the same cards)-Runs smoothly without any glitches/crashes (compared to Magic 2014 this is so much better)-More in-depth strategy compared to other popular tcgs (specifically Hearthstone)-Works great with a 360 controller/big picture mode. It even changes ui to match the controller buttons, which in the older iterations it did not.-Cons--The way it handles lands/mana sometimes is counterintuitive. This can be over come by adjusting your strategy a little bit-Resolution in the game settings is broken. This can be adjusted though by going to the steamapps folder, then the game folder, and then adusting the config file, or you can have your monitor/tv adjust to the resolution automatically.-Other thoughts- I have not played multiplayer yet. I wish they would make it more competetive/rewarding. The deckbuilding seems really nice. I wish they would bring back the ""sealed"" mode, and 2HG so people can stop complaining. I am curious to see how they will add additonal content to this game. So far, it is everything I expect to see from another Magic iteration, which is good. It satisfies my Magic itch.			"

												The review is based on 3 hours of gameplay only.-1) I liked 2014 music more. However, when 2014 was released, I liked 2013 music more and now I don't know.2) Main menu is really slow. Press ""start"" and nothing happens for a few seconds. Really need an option to kill all the animations.3) Only one deck at start. If you choose some weird one, you are stuck for a while. I got the red+green one, so far so good.4) Around 50 cards out of 300 are behind paywall. However, you can buy 14 boosters to unlock them all guaranteed, and it doesn't seem necessary at all. I got 1 booster for pre-ordering and another for owning 2014.5) Fewer game modes. Wait for add-ons.+1) Combat interface seems slightly faster.2) Deck building.3) You get a booster each time you win a duel. In 2014, you got only 1 card, which was ridiculuous.Well, I don't regret spending $10. However, there is a lot of potential for add-ons, and there is an option to wait until 1st addon and discounted game.			"

Which brings the question why is that mechanic even there if I can pause the timer anyways?I also have a question:OK, so I have purchased the Magic 2015 - Complete Bundle about two weeks ago...Does anyone have any idea as to how do I unlock the contetns?It said wallpapers, and an ebook, and more stuff like the card collection.Are the card collections just unlocking more cards and not actually the cards themselves? I am a tad confused... where is all the other stuff? Only thing I can see are the 300 foils in the deck area. "

												FULL REVIEW HERE: http://noisecannon.com/2014/07/17/magic-2015-pc/Wizards of The Coast are back for this year’s Magic: The Gathering digital trading card game, which is available on PC via Steam, Xbox 360, Amazon Kindle and Android on Google Play with an Xbox One version planned for release later this summer. Magic 2015 focusses on the Planeswalkers Garruk Wildspeaker, controller of forests and the powerful creatures that dwell there, and Liliana Vess, the black magic wielding necromancer who has cursed Garruk, now using him to take down other planeswalkers, and you. The campaign takes you on a journey to stop Garruk’s rampage, first witnessing the carnage he has created, then dueling on until you face the cursed warrior himself.Whilst not much has changed visually compared to last year’s Magic offering, Wizards of The Coast has heard the community’s wishes for the practical aspects of Magic 2015 and now allows you to create your own trading card decks from scratch, rather than having to manipulate the pre-built decks and ultimately play how the game wants you to play. For the less experienced players who want to try their hand at deck building, the in game deck builder is surprisingly intelligent. By adding just a few cards that you want to build your deck around the game does the rest for you. This pushes the digital Magic games away from simply teaching you how to play to a more competitive direction, encouraging players to go out into the community and have fun playing against friends and strangers alike.Microtransactions were made for impatient Farmville players, and their increased inclusion in serious games for content that should be and in previous versions has been free ruins the idea of skill rather than money leading players to victory. Their inclusion in Magic 2015 not only makes the game less fun, but the microtransactions are implemented in competitive online play, meaning that a pay-to-win trend is sure to emerge. Despite Wizards of The Coast limiting the number of these special paid for cards that can be had in a collection, the fact that these exclusive cards exist is a sad day for people who play Magic The Gathering to hone their skills, not empty their wallets.Magic 2015As far as the cards available at the time of release, there is very little to be excited about. The previous block of cards Theros and this year’s core set are available, but the core set has more reprints than a poster factory, and for dedicated players of Magic: The Gathering, Theros feels ancient. Despite this, when you choose your preferred colour of deck to play you are given an inclusive choice of colour combinations, allowing for a variety of play styles and ways to approach the computer challengers.Overall, Magic 2015 is another welcome instalment to the longstanding series. Its advances in deck building and story have made Magic 2015 the glue that holds the multiverse together, and for players interested in lore the digital games are a must play. The misty aesthetics and more dynamic challengers make Magic 2015 a progressive albeit expected improvement on last year’s offering, and provide an interesting and tactical challenge for new and seasoned Magic: The Gathering players alike.

												I will try and write this in a more positive light as every man and his dog are aware of the complaints with this game; Any internet forum is chock full of people complaining about no 2HG and no PSN support. Granted, the absence of 2HG is a brain explosion from the developers, but it has led people to unfairly judge the game, I suspect, without actually having a good look at it. With regards to the 2HG, I loved it as much as the next fan, but I could live without it because the magic community was becoming swarmed with scum bag trolls who bag out their partner because they dont pull enough mana, cast the wrong card, dont cast the card they wanted etc. I actually drifted towards 1v1 games because I got tired of seeing opponents turning on each other and trying to score brownie points by ignoring the team chat and bagging their mate in the public forum.The other big complaint is the percieved p2w problem. If anything, this takes us closer to paper magic, where this is a massive problem. I do think its a silly move Wizards have made, but they do also provide a ton of good cards that you can unlock for free, and early deck building, I think people have made a mountain out of a molehill with this. I tested the waters and brought one booster to see what it was like. It was a total waste of money, most of the cards I had already and the one rare I got was not any better than other cards I have.The only thing that confuses me is a number next to your avatar in the menus. It starts at 0 and then changes. After finishing the campaign mine was 18, but then after exploring through some menus it dropped to 14 for some reason, Would be interested in an explanation of this. edit: I purchased a booster and this number went to 15, then when I opened the booster it dropped back down to 14.As for 2015, the game is very much same old same old in terms of game play. Some of the positives I have found:PROS- the trimmed down game screen feels far less cluttered and more like a real game of magic. - The deck building feature is very good, and there are a ton of cards (900+ to choose from). Its very easy to make your own deck, name it, and edit it.- The interface clearly designates what step in each turn it is, which makes casting instants and timed spells far easier.- Some have complained that there is only campaign, this is not true. Once you finish the campaign you then explore each plane to further unlock cards and face new opponents.CONS (ignoring the above)- the menus are still far too clunky and you cant navigate smoothly through.- in 2014 you could esc/esc/esc to get back to the start, you cannot do this as easily in this one and its quite annoying to navigate back through menus.- I had to defeat Garrick 4 times to finish the campaign. Each time it just repeated the same video without explanation and made me think it was bugged. - It is kinda disappointing that there is not a different game mode, such as planeschase or puzzles etc.- it is not clearly stated how you unlock more cards once you do the campaign. Its very hit and miss, click, win, and hope you get something (ironically i got no booster for beating Garrick).- when I click the leaderboards it crashes the gameAll in all, the lack of 2HG is a killer, but for $10 I am not complaining, I am sure to pour plenty of hours into this one.

												I read many negative reviews criticizing many things that are not negatives.  The deck building is why you buy the game,  There is no 'grind' to unlock cards, because the 'grind' is fighting matches.  Thats why you buy the game, isn't it?  So far ive had a massive problem fighting the first fight after the tutorial, which is just insanely hard and took about a dozen attempts, but after that the fights can go your way or not.  Its exciting to beat a random match against a deck that you cant predict, and then open your cards.  I even get excited to get some of the cards i like, but want more of, and playing against the variety of decks shows you that you can make some incredibly fun decks.  Its a great source for ideas.The game maybe doesnt play like the others, holding your hand and guiding you step by step into having a synergised deck, but screwing up might just teach you more about whats wrong with your deck than beating a match.  Just because you beat the Spider deck doesn't mean you have a proper strategy for completing against a Centaur or artifact deck?I am really enjoying the game and to be honest, my attention is a fleeting wind.  But i like that i can open this up, play a match, and open up some cards.  I would also like to conclude by saying that i play a B/G deck, and i am so excited about collecting the cards i need to build a R/B or G/W deck.Don't listen to all the hate, just do your research and you will know whether the game is for you.

												the building your own deck thing is cool. my favorite part. full control. i prefer to grind out my booster packs and am almost done with ravnica. i pre-ordered so i got one ""premium"" and it was fine i guess. i looked over the cards in the pay to win section, and they aren't that big of a deal.when i played 2014 it didn't lag like 2015 does. maybe its my computer? idk. the menu bar on 2015 is TERRIBLE. read this wizards of the coast. do a patch put the menu how it used to be, this scrolling thing is terrible and SLOW. give me an option to not have to animations. its really a pain in the butt. also the ""combat"" mode animation is annoying. its not smooth. AI takes forever to make decisions,gameplay- i started on hardest setting. ran through the campaign. its ok i guess i don't think anyone cares about the story. i started with black/white lifesteal. then i moved on to mono red after i unlocked enough cards. then i made another white/black, just did a black/red.its fun. i love it. am i going to miss 2hg? not really. i haven't played against other people but im sure its the same everyone will be grinding out games to unlock all the cards first.i was annoyed that tablets got this game for free but i say its worth the 10 bucks, but not really worth spending past that except if you really want the pay to win ""premium"" cards. I really don't think they are that great so even i played someone who had them it wouldn't matter. if you look at the cards, every card there has an alternative available. im sure this was intentional			"

												Everyones giving this game bad reviews but honestly? I ♥♥♥♥ing love it. I love the MTG series and this game is just epic. You can build your own deck, the cards are awesome, boosters are epic so far its all alot of fun. Honestly its a great game, i haven't tried online yet but its awesome and way better than any other magic game i've played. I don't see why other people are giving such bad reivews. I've bought this for a few friends and i and we all ♥♥♥♥ing love it. End statement: pretty much the bad reviews are just butthurt people or their just too uptight to chill and enjoy a good old MTG.

												Wow. I am seriously amazed by the negative reviews, most of which are from people who look at the features and assume the worst, having never PLAYED the game.The truth is, this is EASILY the best Magic digital game to date. Very clean UI makes decisions and board state very easy to read at a glance. The ability to 100% customize your deck from your collection (with one slight limitation, addressed below) is something DotP players have been begging for.Where I see most people's concerns is in the existence of ""premium packs"", in game purchases that give a player access to cards otherwise unobtainable. The assumption is that the existence of these cards, obtainable only with real money, has created a ""pay to win"" environment. THIS ASSUMPTION IS WRONG. While these cards are unique, and certain decks can't be built without them, the decks that can be built with them are NO STRONGER than the decks that can be built with Free Play cards. There are only two mythics (one practically unplayable) in the Premium Collection, and several rares. Besides this, DotP 15 has disabled the ability to collect or add to your deck more than 1 copy of any mythic, 2 copies of any rare, and so on. This means even if a player spends a lot of money to obtain cards they haven't earned, there is a very hard limit to how strong this can make them.While 250+ cards is a meager number of cards to collect, it is about the number of a standard large magic set, and as with previous DotP's, we can assume throughout the year that cards will be added through expansions.Pros:- Cleanest UI and clearest hints/tips/tutorials to date. Great product for learning/teaching the game.- Ability to build decks from 250+ unlockable cards (NOT including the premium cards)- Global leaderboards for singleplayer and multiplayer game modes and a healthy competitive environment.Cons:- Currently a meager number of cards to collect.- No easy way to add players as friends in-game.- Deck-building and collection limited to 1 of each mythic, 2 of each rare, 3 of each uncommon, 4 of each common.All in all, the game is great. It provides for MANY different deck themes and strategies, plenty of players to compete against, a healthy competitive environment, and hopefully much much much more to come!			"

												I disagree with the barrage of negative reviews for Magic 2015. In the end, Magic 2015 is a relatively cheap way to get introduced to Magic: The Gathering for new players. The biggest addition to the virtual series is the deck building element that adds the feeling of persistence. I see this title being optimal for people who ,again, would like to get into MTG or play the game in an simpler and maybe more populated enviroment than their locale. The campaign of the game follows the player through a section of regions. In these areas the player battles through aright around 3-5 encounters. All of these encounters grant the player additional cards that feed into the deck building area. Some of these encounters are repeatable in the sense that they can be replayed for multiple packs of cards. Following in suit, I think that this campaign is more so for newer players as it features a wide array of AI decks and playstyles meant to teach about those characteristics accordingly. I've yet to play the multiplayer however I can confirm that certain gamemodes coming from previous games are not there. I think a big factor in the multiplayer is how the game handles singleplayer and multiplayer decks as one thing. Firstly depending on which deck you choose coming out of the tutorial, you are effectively locked into an inital set of 30-40 cards out of the 300 sum availble. There is however, the option to buy booster packs of 10 random cards for 1.99 USD or sets for 5.00 USD. These cards can be aquired through the campaign though do offer a player willing to pay more money more options.  Check out my Let's Play for more info.

												It's another DotPW game. This time you don't have fixed decks you have to get boosters to gain cards to make your own deck. This was a very highly requested feature, the ability to make your deck however you wanted, but in practice it's pretty bad. DotPW was sort of an original Magic game because of the pre-made decks. Now it's basically just a worse MTGO. I still enjoy the game as it's the only magic I can play. But those who enjoyed the old pre-made decks like I did, you might want to think before you purchase.

												This is not the best card game ever, sure, but it's not pay to win. You get one deck first, which is a problem, but it's easy to unlock other booster packs in the campaign mode. Just simply choose ""Explore Innistrad""  ""Explore Theros"" etc. and those mini campaigns will get you one of those 10 card booster decks per win. It's even faster than the old way of unlocking cards one by one. Sure, it's random, but like the real life MTG booster pack, it has at least one rare/mythic rare card in it.On the other side, there's no Two Headed Giant mode, which is bad. Only 2-3 or 4 player free for all, so if that's what you looking for, you have to buy one of the previous Duels of the Planeswalker games for that.But if you're looking for a way to create a your own deck from scratch, this is the game for you.Pros:-new deck building, completely from scratch (that's what the gamers wanted since all these years, right? :) )- can unlock 10 cards at a time instead of 1- slightly better graphics than the MTG Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014 game- Auto Complete mode for beginners to quickly create decksCons:- no pre-built decks (for some who just want to get in the game right away)- random card unlocking, which means you have to spend money if you really want one specific card- console-like menus for PC... :( MTG 2014 had so much more user-frendly design- some bugs, crashes			"

												I was really excited for this game since I really enjoyed the last iterations of DotP, but I was heavily disapointed. Not only do you only have one deck to start with, which you can't view before choosing, but it is also very hard to win anything, especially on highest difficulty. The business model is almost on MTGO levels and therefore makes this games existence nearly obsolete. I just finished the campaign, havent looked into multiplayer yet, but there seems to be no Revenge campaign, which is a step back. Also there seem to be no challenges, which I always enjoyed the most. If you're new to magic and wanna get into the game, buy the 2014 version, you'll be better off that way.			"

												The reviews are not entirely accurate. You do get to change your ""starter deck"" during final stage of tutorial and when you do, that is your opportunity to check whats inside of the deck AND later (i think when you beat innistrad) you can create custom decks from which you can either select one of the presets offered earlier  and expand upon them OR create a fully custom one with any cards available. That being said, not terrible, but the slowness of the menues is true. Also I purchased the  complete bundle so I spent no time unlocking all the cards, that helped.			"

												I haven't played it very long so I don't want to give any advise but I bought the complete bundle and I don't have access to all the cards when I have started. An explination would be nice for people like me that don't know why.			"
