Early Access Review
								I remember when I first got this game, back in summer of '13. I had started out with nothing but the clothes on my back, some cash, and a rusty sword. First thing to do was to find some buddies to help, and so I went to the nearest town. In a tavern I met a short bald man (though we were all bald back then). His name was Dirt, and this was my new best friend. Dirt and I did some pretty bad things then, luring guards to get killed by starving bandits, and then stealing all of the gear. This changed when we both got a little close one fight, and got chased by bandits all the way into the entrance of town. There weren't enough men to hold them all back, so I went into a tavern to see if anyone could help. I found a huge man, named Vedi. Vedi was willing to help for a price, and after paying him he went out there with a rusty sword and killed 3 of the bandits before he passed out from blood loss, effectively saving the town.It was the three of us for a good, long time. We killed many a cannibal and a bandit, and soon enough came upon the idea to make our own outpost, a safe haven to keep us secure and resupply when the going got tough. There was a town nearby, so all we had to do was get a few materials here and there and after a week maybe it would be set. By this time all three of us were pretty decked out, myself having a good long coat, Vedi with a huge cleaver, and Dirt with a tricorn hat. Most cannibals were either afraid of us by this point, or dead, there wasn't much worry of our safety by now. We had almost finished the small base, with Vedi and I working on some some construction, so it was Dirt's turn to go get the materials. We had both finished our construction, and so had waited for Dirt to come back. A day had gone by, we were starting to get worried. By noon the next day, Vedi and I had decided to risk it and leave the base, to go see where Dirt had gone. The next town over must surely know where he went?We didn't even make it halfway across when we found him, laying on the ground. His hat and sword weren't far from him, and there were two dead bandits next to him. Incisions and cuts were all across his body, bones broken and blood everywhere. Vedi cried, I stared for a good long time, before getting his hat and sword. I walked to the nearest bandit encampment, which some members looked wounded, and slaughtered them all with Vedi, after he finally caught up.Time has passed since that day, and the small base we had thought of originally is now a bustling town, with nearly eight residents there, all dressed and ready to defend their home. These people are the best I could have asked for, and I still keep the tricorn hat as a symbol of office, with Vedi forgoeing his cleaver for that sword, as his symbol of guard captain. But as much as I love these people, and would die for them, they will never be that man whom Vedi and I came to know as our best friend.R.I.P. Dirt.10/10			"

								Hour 1: Ugh.. man... this one might be a refundHour 2: Yah... this is silly, running around in a low res desert, wierd glitches, just ain't a good game....Hour 3: I mean.. this is silly, running from more bandits, scrapping stuff...Hour 5: I've got to keep this unit together while they mine, I'll have my auxillaries patrolling,Hour 10: Jeez? It's been a whole RL day of this? This.. wierdly horrible game... wierdly.. amazing...Hour 20: My outpost lives on the edge of the sands and death, traders come now and then, but overall we maintain neutral relationsHour 25: I hope nobody visits me RL today, so that I don't get interrupted as my settlement flourishes in the wastlands.There you go. It's a tough start. It's an ugly start. It's a painful start. But every inch after that is pure glory.  If you ever loved squad based rpg, tactical fighting, (think semi-baldergate-esque) well this takes it and throws in crafting, slavery, factions, squads, crafting, and it looks like a whole lot more in the future. I understand that development has been slow on this game, so if you are not okay with Bugs / Early Access, then hold on for now. There are definitely bugs. Some of them F stuff up. None of them have stopped my constantly growing love/enjoyment of this game.AFAIK there is no story of any sort yet, it's left completely open world, open ended, create your own story.6/10 - Graphics6/10 - Sounds6/10 - UI9/10 - Gameplay10/10 - Replayability			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi is a game where you start off feeling small, incapable, and alone. From the get go, you are basically a nobody; just another face in the crowd, another cog in the machine, another meatbag for the grinder - but it's not what you are, but what you would rather be, and how you get there that makes this game enjoyable. The journey to the ultimate destination of your own choosing is where the fun lies. Will you be a lone trader, looking to accrue the greatest mountain of wealth the post apocalyptic world has ever seen? Or a wandering swordsman who hides their true strength to dispatch armies with relative ease? Perhaps a general at the head of your own personal body guard? Or the mayor of a little tiny village just beyond the next dune? Regardless of what your goal is, it is exactly that - yours.When I started playing Kenshi, the one thing that first struck me was the graphics. Relatively blocky, and a bit funny to look at in some cases, i.e.: buildings clipping in a sand dune, or walls built at unreasonable angles. But, I don't play a game for graphics; to me that's just a secondary benefit. What I'm after is the gameplay, and what I was in store for really put a smile on my face.My character started out in a small town on top of a mountain range. I could see another down off in the distance, and figured that I'd walk there after exploring this little fortress in the sky. Did I mention that the towns are more like fortresses? I didn't? Well, imagine a town surrounded by walls taller that the highest in-game building, with a group of 20 or so very heavily armed and skilled guards for it's protection. That's what constitutes a town in Kenshi. 'Relative' safety, but I'll get to that in a minute.Heading towards the other town, I noticed that a group of bandits had started charging up the hill at me. I thought, ""A group of bandits? Looks like fun, let's try out the combat!"" and to my astonishment, I was obliterated. Beaten to within an inch of death, bleeding out in the beating sun, unconscious. My stomach had taken massive damage, and one of my arms was pretty much useless. I had been surrounded, beaten up, and left for dead. And my assailants? Took off to raid the town. Luckily, the city guard switfly dispatched them, but I was left on the hill. So, fast forward about half an in-game day, and I limp back to town (of course, I looted those bandits that attacked me and left them for dead; take that!). After patching myself up sufficiently, I take to luring bandits to town to enjoy the fighting with the guards and levelling myself up.Now, speaking of levelling up, skills are sorted into multiple sections: dexterity, strength, the various weapon skills, just to name a few. You gain proficiency by performing the tasks. You get stronger by carrying heavy objects around, not by killing a few rats like some other games, but not like there's anything wrong with them. You develop your character through hard work and dedication. Want to become better at running? Take off your heavy equipment and do a few laps. Don't know how to swing your weapon? Engage a training dummy or another person for all that matters. Even your ability to widthstand pain can be increased. How? By losing. That's right, you are rewarded for losing. Those bandits didn't kill you when they had the chance? Sucks to be them, because now not only are you angry, but you're also more accustomed to the pain. The next time you see them, they may well be on the losing side of the fighting. Kenshi rewards you for survival and practice, much like the saying: whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.So back to my little tale to attempt to capture the game a bit more - After fighting a couple of fights with the city guard as backup, I tried luring a group of bandits back to the town only to my surprise - the guards at the gate weren't there. Either they left on a patrol, or were fighting another battle elsewhere, I had no time to check. The bandits were hot on my tail, and the only chance I had of survival was to either lead them away from town, or take refuge and hope to escape while they killed all the civilians. And in that moment, I saw a few brave men - shop guards - rush from the protection of their walls, and stop the bandits in their tracks. A bandit or two slipped by, and I gave chase. Unfortunately while I spent a good while fighting one, the other slayed an innocent civilian, and I was happy to see that the population count in the town had actually dropped. Protecting the towns actually has an incentive - no population = no trading. The bandits dispatched, the guards returned, and I resigned to head off towards that other town in the distance.Now, as I could see the town, it didn't seem far. Plus, I had enough gold to recruit a new person to my little gang of righteous corpse theives. With some new equipment, a little bit of extra knowledge of how the world works and a new companion, I set out for the town. I travelled for at least two in game days. Two. I saw the sun rise, and set, then rise and set again. Such is the scale of Kenshi - the world is an open sandbox (quite literally at this point - no grass, just sand and rocks), and things that look far off in the distance are far off. And as I mentioned before, zooming out - I became a speck in the desert. The only that that kept my position known was the damn name tag floating above my head.Kenshi may not be a game for everybody, but if you enjoy a bit of realism, and quite a bit of freedom, it may be worth it. It's still early access, which means that there are quite a lot of glitches, issues, bugs and crashes (I haven't encountered anything severe however), you may want to pass the game until it's more stable and developed decendant comes about. What appeals to me the most is actually two things: one, you are rewarded for winning, and are rewarded for trying. So long as you aren't dead, the game isn't over. It makes for one heck of a story if you keep little notes about what happens to your character when you play. The second thing is the scale and immersion of the game. Beyond the glitches sometimes breaking the immersion, I actually felt like a lone survivor in a desolate world, where people preyed upon the weak, and civilization may take days to reach on foot. Since I just recently bought the game, I can't say much about the developer, except that from reading what their vision is, it really is a grand one and has a lot of potential. Kenshi has lots of potential, but it also has lots of work left to be done. So pass it if you're looking for a more fleshed out game, but definitely get it if anything in this review has a major appeal to you. As for me, I'll be wandering the desert with my small group of companions trying to make a living in a world where death can come from even a small group of ill-trained, ill-equipped people. Afterall, you may know how to fight, but if a knife cuts you, you'll still bleed.			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi. Where do I start. It's about how the game feels when you start it for the first time. This is a game in development and somehow I just love it. When it's done, how I interpret it and see it, it is the ultimate RPG game. In a rich and huge (can't underline, but I would) world, filled with cities in biodomes and people, trees, water, dirt... In this world you can become a trader, a looter, a scavanger, but you can also found your own town, find new people for the party (very large parties) and become a power of your own. This sandbox RPG does sound a little too good to be true, but I don't know, it already delivers a lot and I recommend you come and see for yourself. Me and a lot of others are already enjoying Kenshi. I can recommend this game to people who also like traditional RPG's, but also RPG's like Fable for instance (there are characters, they grow, and there are factions, you are one), people who liked building the village in Assassins Creed 3, people who like minecraft (the playthrough is what you make of it), even people who like Settlers or even Age of Empires! I recommend this game basicly to everyone who plays other games then Call of Duty, as long as you can live with early-access situations in which you play a bêta or even alpha of the end result though. But getting it now if you're interested does save you money in the (very) long run.There are factions that all have their own diplomatic stances towards you and eachother, there are bandits raiding unprotected people. You can do whatever you want. So if you want your faction (you are your own faction) to become powerfull, train your party and have an army. If you want to become a trader, train them strong so they can pack a lot of stuff, if you want your own city... start building! The characters do not level up as is tradition, you train each skill by training that skill specifically by doing things that require the skill. Which according to me works. The game is really hard, especially at the start. You start with almost nothing and you have to struggle for survival. I usually start with luring bandits to patrols and towns to get them to fight (and die) to then pick their bodies clean like a damned vulture. Sell their stuff at a merchant, buy new equipment, repeat, get a teammate or two and start to choose a place to settle down.I played the game for the last time at version 0.62 and I have to say: it was an improvement over 0.50. It still feels the same (unpolished, cheap), but with the added notifications of approaching bandits, audio signals when under attack, female characters and at least some means of negociating with bandits I can only say: good work the last few months! Hair looks great, bodies look good, the rack on one of my partymembers is really too big, but looks good (not trying to be a sexist here, pointing out a detail) even beneath armor. I just wish someone would come to my stores to buy my goods, I don't want to walk to towns to sell them anymore ;)I again had a good time, so I'm sticking with the good review.The thing is though that you do have to create your own adventures and the world isn't alive enough yet to fully appreciate this. However, after playing with the same guys for over 30hrs, having built a town, having been in quite some sticky situations... my party did kind of grow on me. With the latest patches I did miss some of the buildings to build, but it was a step forward and I enjoyed myself.Kenshi began for me when I read about it in March 2013 (who knows how long development will take), and read about a game about a man with a sword (the title translates into the swordsman, I believe) in a world. And he can do whatever he wants. The world is still empty, but it's more of a playable techdemo. In the end it will be a beautifull world, the graphics already are worth showing. So I tried it, lost a few hours immediatly. Later I found it again on Steam and decided to buy it.A part of the experience now is that you are able to see a game being developed by a very small team. As I learned through the fora it was being made by one man. Just one man, this sounded like the late 80's and early 90's and I loved it. And by being able to sell this on Steam he made enough money to hire people and it is becoming very nice. The money is really being put to good use!!! I have checked out the roadmap and the website and trust me, this game is good and will be better sooner then I might have expected.Besides this curious development by first one man, I have never seen this much fan-made artwork for any game of this magnitude, and the game hasn't even been finished yet! There already is a lot of content available ingame, some maybe replaced and a lot more will come, but I wouldn't worry about the amount of game you're buying. Especially if you find this game on a sale and you're into sandbox games, I would go for it! I'm not even an RPG fan, but I did go for it and I'm happy I did.Usually with playtesting a game, there is room for feedback. There is no room for that here, the developer is too small to answer. The fora are spread over several locations and the information freely available may be confusing. But the price goes up as it's being patched towards a release candidate so spend the little the game costs now and join the ride. It's going to pick up speed very soon, everything looks promissing. With every patch the game is one step further, and you can actually feel it. There is a demo available on the website of the game, or you can download the torrent (you'll get the demo, nothing illegal herI've seen the development go slowly at first, many patches but all small ones. Then after the steam-release the hiring of people and the patching slowed down a bit. Now there are 6 people working on this game and I'm all psyched again!!! I can't wait to start another playthrough! But I'm waiting for the next patch, it has been due for a while now and they promissed a big one. I will amend this review when I've picked it up again. My last play was in februari and a lot has improved. Also a new gameworld is announced, ingame animals and more. Even though they may still take a while to implement, these implementations would require a amendment to the review as well.			"

Early Access Review
								I just would like to make a few changes to my old review: -So this is my review for Kenshi. I have played 74 hours(57 hours before) and I can say that right now, there is a lot of new content (and old content improved) that really cheered me up to keep playing, such as new races, new mechanics & skils (assassination, martial arts, dodge, swimming), new interactions with factions and creatures, new weapons and some VERY OP BEAKY CREATURES OMG SO BROKEN DKLGIAHOJKRHIDWGCHF. The point of this update in my review is to reinstate that Kenshi is a really good game worth buying, as it moves away from the boring and plain view and tries to be something unique. These updates also prove that Kenshi is alive and going just fine.-Slow development CAN'T be used as a negative trait, because Kenshi producers are not a big company like Ubisoft or EA, in fact they're only 6 ! (here's proof http://lofigames.com/about/about-us/ )Also, if you think that a game this creative and complex can be easily made, programming is not as easy as you think.TL;DR-If you want to buy Kenshi now: You'll have a lot of well spent hours after you get the hang of it, for that you could look on the game's wiki or/and watch some videos on youtube.-If you want to buy a full game: Wait patiently. They are working really hard and I'm sure that it will have enough content for you in the next updatesOh, I almost forgot, you can download a demo on kenshi's website. I don't know how much content is there, but it's probably enough to convince you into buying (or not).			"

Early Access Review
								So after playing Kenshi for about 50 hours with a few playthroughs I thought it would be time to write a review.  Kenshi is mainly a openworld RPG with a bit of base building and strategy, as listed in the tags for the game.  The character customizations go way in depth.  Everything from eyes to hair, to the length of you arms and legs.  I've seen some messed up people on the screenshots and just about laughed myself off my chair.  The fighting is amazing.  It's realistic.  You try taking on a group of raiders 1v7 and you WILL lose if you haven't trained your person to be a great fighter.  You can hire others, or go at it alone.  The amount of things you can do now, is awesome.  Anything from wandering around from city to city or building a home for you and your allies.  Keep in mind, the game is in Early Access so there are plenty of bugs and random glitches.  Things like out of this world rag-doll, people being stuck inside of each other (kinda funny at first, but can be a pain) and raiders spawning inside of your base.  I have a little list I made that I write down everything and with this last update, a few of the things were fixed.  I'm glad to see this game still being worked on and I can't wait to see this game fully built.  I will keep playing this for a long time to come and I'll keep updating the review.As always,  keep on gaming!EDIT:  I forgot to say anything about crashes.  This game does crash with me.  I do also get the ""Super Crash"" every 5 hours or so.  Playing the game for long amounts does trigger this and I hear that a number of things can also cause it to crash.  Save everytime you do something that is major like buliding a town, buying a bit of really good armor, or even when you're on the move.   I also have read a few reviews and I have noticed something.  The game starts you out as a normal person.  You are not all powerful, Dragonborn, The Arison, or somone else who matters.  You start out with almost nothing.  You pick a fight early on, and will be killed.NEWEST EDIT:  I wrote that review at about 50 hours into the game, several months ago.  I figure its time to update it after no having 200+.  The dev have been pushing updates and fixes out at a nice rate. So in other words, this game isn't dead.  A lot has changed since I first played this game.  There's a new race to play as, more starting stories, animals.   The list goes on.  That's the plus side of this new edit.  Downside includes coming across new glitches and crashing games.  Kenshi isn't as stable as it was a few months ago.  In fact, I've had the game crash about 3 times in a little over an hour.  The Devs are working on this, and I'm hopeful for this game and it's future.  OVERALL RATING AS OF 1/2/2016Still a good game, with it's problems.  Research the game before you buy, But keep an eye on this one if you don't get it now.   7.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								I'm going to state my opinion straight out so you understand where my reviews coming from before reading it... I already love this game. I find it challenging, immersive and immensely satisfying. I can't wait for more content even though I think what's currently there makes it a worthwhile experience for the price tag, any game that can have me put 45 hours in without even realizing it is going to be worth twenty-ish dollars in my book. Also, this game is absolutely not for everyone. That can not be stressed enough, if you don't like struggling in the beginning of a game you probably won't make it very far, it can be tough as nails if you aren't careful and even if you are you'll probably end up suffering through a few coma's in the early section while you're trying to make your character not useless. There, now that that's out of the way let's talk about the actual game.The gameplay is kind of a mix between a diablo-style dungeon crawler and an RTS. Every character has their own stats that can be levelled up through using them, every character can be as strong if not stronger than your starting character. In fact the only real difference between them and your starting character is that you didn't start with them. The movement and combat are fairly basic, there's not much in the form of tactics yet. Other than ganging up on specific units and some limited flanking ability you can't control much more than who attacks who. The path finding can sometimes trip up in the more hectic battles (more on that later) but it is early access and that stuff is being ironed out.The RTS elements shine through a bit more in the base building aspects, you build preset layouts for houses and fill them with various different things like work benches, beds or storage for materials. So far there's farming and resource mining as well as some crafting for weapons, armour and clothing. This will be a lot more balanced when things like hunger get implemented, right now there's not much to point to a farm other than making money and there isn't much to spend the money on other than materials and blueprints for items. You can also build defensive walls with gates and mounted crossbows for defense (and you'll need them, believe me) but these things can trip up the pathfinding again (still more on that later). Considering how unbalanced the economy currently is it still took me a while to get a base I was satisfied with and I enjoyed building it. It's only getting better as well.The world is both great and not so great all at once. I found myself heavily immersed in the world, I love the style and the sense that you're picking through the bones of an advanced civilization that's been long ruined, the atmosphere is just fantastic. The aesthetic is my kind of thing with obvious asian influences and you can really feel isolated and threatened in the early goings until you have a decent squad, then you feel like you're a match for the world and that's a really satisfying moment. However... as much as I love the feeling of the world, sometimes it can feel really empty. Yes, it's a wasteland and it's meant to feel that way, but if that's not your kind of thing it will really turn you off. I feel like the addition of small bandit camps to go along with the roaving bands and some oasis-like areas where more plants grow would really do a lot to help that. There's also some work happening on adding creatures to the world and I think that will do wonders for this particular problem. My bar for a well done isolated setting is set really high to be fair, once you play S.T.A.L.K.E.R: shadows of chernobyl it's hard to settle for anything less. The fact I'm even willing to compare the two is very telling about just how great the atmosphere is here.Now, on to the bugs (disclaimer: I haven't played for a while so some of these may have been fixed since my last session, I'll explain in a bit). You get to hear about the pathfinding which is my main issue. It's kind of broken. It's serviceable for the most part, they can manage to traverse long distances and only rarely do they get stuck, however they still get stuck and that's pretty annoying. I use the ""bodyguard"" command to make sure my squad moves at the same speed (an option to just make them do that would be nice) but the pathfinding for that is far worse than the regular stuff, they match speed and stay at the same relative position to the character they're guarding and don't realize if they're about to walk into a wall, this is where they most often get stuck because for some strange reason edges like to grab hold of characters and they get stuck in the ground. Also, I've never had them defend anything while under the bodyguard command. Frequent quick-saves make this a mild irritation at worst and if you ever get really stuck and haven't saved for a while there's an option in the menu to pick up and drop all your characters on the center of your camera to unstick them, but it's still a bug and it needs to be mentioned. The other issues with it are also minor, in a big fight sometimes units can get confused about what they should do and end up standing around with their finger in their nose while their buddy is fighting three bad guys at once but they eventually get it together. The last issue I have is that closing the gates breaks the pathfinding when your units are outside, if you close the gate no matter how far away they are or where you tell them to move they will turn around about half the time and walk back to the gate to maually open it. It can be really frustrating but the only time you need the gate closed is when bandits are attacking and they give you advance warning so it can be pretty easily circumvented.Aside from the pathfinding there's an odd (yet hilarious) bug with picking up and putting down characters, if you do it on the ground they pop up into the sky and get sent flying. They only stop if they hit a mountain or you use taht un-sticking method I previously mentioned. Again, it's just a minor annoyance and it doesn't happen if you put them in a bed or jail cell which is where you should be taking them anyway, but if you get attacked you can't put down whoever you're carrying and you run the risk of getting knocked out yourself.This is less a bug and more of a flaw with the system itself, and it's also the main reason I haven't played in a while. There's a serious memory issue, the game runs on a 32-bit engine and it doesn't have a high enough memory limit for extended play. I'm not sure if everyone has this problem but I can only play for about ten minutes at a time now, it's progressively gotten worse the bigger my base got and the more people I had control of. It used to take a number of hours to crash on me. This could be my fault, I haven't exhausted every troubleshooting option yet, but all the same it's an issue that needs to be addressed. There's also talk of transferring to a 64-bit system which would probably eliminate the issue, but as of my last play session it wasn't implemented and I can only talk about my experience.TL;DR, this game is an extremely rewarding and challenging experience if you're willing to stick through it and are a fan of post-apocalyptic worlds or deserts in general. If not, there's very little in it for you. The early game is pretty slow and it relies on you enjoying the world around you more than the gameplay, afterwards they both work together and that's when the game shines. If you can't handle crashes or potenitally broken AI then hold off on your purchase but definitely keep an eye on this, when all the issues are ironed out this game will be phenomenal. If you don't mind crashes or other early access problems then this game is worth the money as-is and will only get better with time.			"

Early Access Review
								Not many games get this type of attention from me. even in Alpha ( when i wrote this review ) this game is awesome. it has quickly taken over as my favorite game right now besides Civ V, KSP and Planet Explorers.Kenshi will be awesome once its done. wait even not finished its still awesome.two paws up for this game.Edit 2/13/2014Females are in the game at last! New factions, Gameplay, diplomacy, bandit raids, Cannibals or as also known ""Bacon Cultists"" With more coming soon. and a new AI being worked on for those pesky super crashes and pathing issues.The game music is moving an wonderful, first game ever where i did not mute the music while playing the game. or kill sound effects along with it. It adds just the right amount of mood to the game.Why buy the game? Well for one its not like any other game you have played before. its a original and still developing and after each core update it gets better with more items added to expand your gaming experience. A original RTS, sandbox game. If your tired of starting a game where you can go out and kill people in one hit from the start! Then this is your game. It will challenge you, you have to fight to survive, living long enough to train yourself from a nobody whom everyone could beat up, to a legendary Hero or Heroine depending on your Gender. It is not a quick game, there is no ending, It is moddable even in its current state.Why not to buy this game?It is Alpha Stage Development game. If you don't like dealing with bugs, core game play content thats not added yet, then this game is not for you. The game is not complete, so do not buy the game thinking it is. Some bugs (depending on the computer) can render the game unplayable for a short while. If you're still interested in the game, then wait and watch. Come back in a year ( From this rewrite posting  2-13-2014 ) then give it a try. Until then pass it up and leave it on your wish listEdit 6/11/2014Would like to add a useful page to visit for those reading reviews.Useful Information and links For KenshiIncluded is a link to the Demo.A report on the super crash thats in the game. it is being worked on to be corrected, that update should be out in 2 weeks or less ( from when i edited this post ) barring any problems. The prospecting thats now in the game is  very good, with a high science skill you can easily find hotspots to build your bases. no more turtling up in one spot. The NPC squad slider was adjusted down, ( From 4x to 2x ) for everyone put it at max then complained their FPS went to He** double hockey stick.Total time the Dev has said it would take to complete the game. he is shooting for the end of 2014, but its possible it will actually be some time late in 2015. personally i think it will be late 2015 mostly because there is still a lot more to be added. but we will see once the 64bit Conversion and new pathing Engine are added.Edit 12/25/2014Version 0.70.x is now in the beta testing stage before public release. it was released early and full of game killing bugs, which have been ironed out to a point. so should be ready for public release soon.We now have animals, Leviathans, Pack Gar's, Dog things, and beak things. new factions though the actual people in them are not in yet.Prisoner Cages are back in police stations, though been having issues with those.The Memory Leak is gone. though the game is running rather rough at the moment due to it being released too early. but things should smooth out soon and look much better once Directx 11 is added.We still have the 1 biom but that won't change anytime soon.Bandits no longer attack you on sight but now chase after you tossing insults and if you just keep running they eventually stop, leaving you to your own shenanigans.Multi levels to buildings has been added, and looks like the GUI will be redone soon. no more badly fitting text or buttons will be coming with that, plus the squad sizes are supposed to be increased in a couple updates from now.At the time of this edit, v0.70.x is only open to beta testing opt in. so things will change once its released to the general public.General Info.I am one of the Admin for the Kenshi Forums, the other is Gmat.I write this review based on me being a regular gamer like everyone else. I personally think this is a great game and just getting better, but i also know its not for everyone.There is a lot of links and information in the forums, including a link to a Demo ( link added on 6/11/2014 )I can not stress enough to try the demo first before buying.

								If you wanted to be a samurai or something else, kenshi is your thing. You can create your own story, manage your squad, build your city and so fort. Kenshi is an open world sandbox game the map/world will grow with next updates but even now, it's still ""big"". It's of course currently in alpha stage so you have to wait for updates but, you can still enjoy the whole game until it's grow up. There are people with over 700+ hours gameplay currently so you can spend many times in it.I highly recommend this game those who also enjoyed games like Mount&Blade. But you should consider it's still alpha and there are bugs in this game. And please watch some gameplay videos before so you can see how is it.			"

								edit: this review is very out of dateBought this during the summer sale not really knowing what to expect and was totally taken by surprise. Even though the game is in an Alpha state, it feels very well put together with features such as mining, farming, and research. It took me a couple hours to get the basics down, and a couple more to get over the fact that my puny characters could be bested by even the lowliest bandit, but one I got a feel for the gameplay I haven't looked back. Definitely one of the more interesting games I have played in a while. It was developed by ONE dude. That is damn impressive.Some tips for starters:- Research mining before farming (trust me, mining pays for itself)- Make sure you have a guy or two living in town in case your group gets ambushed and overwhelmed.- Lead bandits to a city, let guards kill bandits, loot corpses, profit			"

								I wish I hadn't spent $20 on this. Months ago, before I uninstalled this game, the developer was only putting out new content patches instead of fixing bugs which have been present since I purchased the game in Jan. 2013 (according to the forums there's still pathing problems with buildings, it's not getting fixed any time soon). Dare to bring this up in the forums, or any other criticizm for that matter, and a legion of fanboys will troll and drown your complaints out regardless of how you present them. The excuse that the game is in the alpha stage is used quite liberally, as these bugs go unaddressed most updates. And even when bugs are addressed the game developer takes a tone announcing it as though it's a waste of his time and he doesn't really want to do it. In fact, the new content and features updates seem to compound bugs which go unaddressed. I could maybe forgive this, if  the game were entertaining. But it's not, it's just miserably tedious and boring. The combat is slow and pointless, as you watch twenty men surround one for each to take turns swinging one weapon at a time at the target. Once you tire of that, spend hours on end standing around, researching new technologies to craft buildings and weapons and armor and other stuff all to... go out and watch twenty men surround one for each to take turns swining one weapon at a time. I highly recommend this game - to be removed and for everyone who purchased it to get a refund. Side Note:Oh, and the forum moderator is either a paid troll for the game developer or a rabid dweeb trying to get in on the ground floor of what he percieves to be another game sensation like WoW. Either way, eventually anyone who speaks ill of the game gets their thread locked and buried. To me, that's the most frustrating part of the game; you can't even bring up a reasonable grievance against it, let alone warn others away. I hope this review gets around that hurdle.			"

 This game is in Early Access.  It is NOT finished.  Anything I say may, and most likely will, be changed as development continues. MANY OF THE BUGS I LISTED WITHIN THE CONS HAVE BEEN PATCHED.  DO NOT LET THE ONES I LISTED RUIN THIS GAME FOR YOU, THEY TEND TO BE QUITE RARE.  EVEN WITH THEM THIS GAME IS STILL AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE AND WAS VERY ENJOYABLE.*TL;DR at the bottom of this review* Kenshi.  This game is brutal.  I seriously had more moments in this game where I wanted to yell at it for being so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard, yet if you look on my profile it's currently marked as my favorite game.  The reasoning behind that is simple, this game offers 0 in the way of hand holding.  If you want a good, long, tutorial that explains every single detail to you in a nice format then Kenshi is not your game.  Wiki?  Don't bother, honestly it kinda ruins the fun of this game.  Kenshi is one of the few games where I can say that I never watched a single tutorial, and yet I felt like by 40 hours I knew some pretty advance things in the way of base building and combat tatics.  This game will suck you in, it'll FORCE you to learn the game.  You'll change your tatics, your starting locations, your ordering in what you need, the way you simply play the game will evolve as you learn, as the game makes you learn.  I loved it.  Every second of it.  Even when I wanted to scream at my computer, I still couldn't help but love this game for what it is.  With that said, pro's and con's time.Pros- The devs care.  If you EVER run into an issue within the game, you can post in the discussions and I bet you $100 that atleast one of the admins or mods will respond.- Many different playstyles.  This game can be an RTS, a squad based rp, a city builder, it can be so, so much.- Landscape is amazing, and the next update will overhaul this.  The biomes, textures, and pretty much everything about the look of this game is pretty amazing.- Combat system is nice, isn't perfect, but it's very nice none the less.- Medical system is also really cool.  Got hit in the leg?  You're limping your way back to town now, bud.- Base building is some of the best i've seen.  The job system and resouce refining is overall very good for its current state.  It has some issues, but that'll be seen in the cons.- Trading system is simple and works, though I found a few exploits- Farming system is simple but very effective, some bugs will be disscussed in cons- Factions are pretty diverse in armor, items, etc.  Cannibals are really fun, some issues with factions in the cons.- Smithing and crafting are really simple but work pretty well.  Could be more complex or diffucult, but it's still fun.- Training system, once again, very simple.  Not much could be improved here, it works very well and theres not a whole bunch you can do to change it.Cons- Medical system is lacking.  It's way more simple than I think it should be.- Combat can get boring very quickly as it's more stat based than anything else.- There are items within the game that are simply better than any other item.  I remember at one point samuri armor or whatever it was called was simply the best you could get.  For me this kinda ruined the feel of being able to have so many different build paths, each to their own.  Be super slow but super tanky, be super fast with TONS of damage, but super squishy, etc.- Floating trees, enemies not spawning, falling through world.  These are somewhat rare bugs, but they do happen.  Remember, it's an early access game.- Combat system is buggy in some cases.  Weapons can hit or miss when they don't appear they did, sometimes your character appears to have his/her weapon equiped but...doesn't use it?... It's like the models there but the hitboxes arn't?  Wierd.- Base building.  99% of my bugs are here. I'll be making a list for this one. 1.- Sometimes you can place a wall down, and even though it allowed you to place it your units simply cannot reach it to build.  2.- There was an old bug where building the tier 3 walls would crash you game if you placed many of them at once. 3.- Some gates, when placed, would never lock/unlock.  You could never open them or close them. 4.- Some buildings can be built on slight hills, and yet it'll let you build it while your units cannot get into them 5.- Some buildings, once built, would be unable to open or go up the stairs.THERE ARE MANY BUGS, I AM SIMPLY LISTING THE MAJOR ONES THAT KINDA RUINED THE GAME FOR ME DURING BASE BUILDING.  REMEMBER, MOST OF THE GAMEBREAKING BUGS ARE RARE AND WILL MOST LIKELY ONLY HAPPEN TO YOU ONCE OR TWICE, NOTHING A QUICK LOAD BACK TO A CHECKPOINT FROM 5 MINUTES AGO WON'T FIX.TL;DRThis game is great.  It's hard as steel to learn, but amazingly fun once you do.  You will not suceed on your first try, nor your second or third.  It'll take time, but once you do it is AMAZING.  I reccommend this game to anyone who is willing to put up with a few bugs for an RTS, Squad-based RP, City Builder game, all meshed into one.For an Early Access game, I would recommend you pick it up.  You will not be dissappointed. "

								This is the game I’ve been looking for!The following is coming from a total noob, that hasn’t researched the game whatsoever. This is 5 hours of gameplay.Day 1. I create a female wanderer, and I run around town, in and out of buildings looking for something to do. (20 minutes later I’m thinking, what’s the point in this?) Day 2. It’s time to leave this town, and venture out across the wasteland, this town sucks. I travel at night, with 900 credits (cats) and a loaf of dry bread, and bare feet. I decide to erect a small shack in the desert, and after doing so, I realise I’ve build a useless unfinished concrete structure, with steel reinforcing jutting out all over the place. I move on towards the next town, leaving the unfinished building to ruin.Day 3. I arrive early morning to a group of people killing dogs, just outside the town’s entrance. I avoid the people, and try looting a dog’s corpse. I get nothing. Once again, I move from building to building, finding nothing other than a few people offering their services for 700 cats. I decide to hang onto my 900 for now. I find a dummy in one building and decide to hit it, soon realising this is the way to raise my attack points. I do this until I’m at level 5.Day 4. I’m a hard♥♥♥♥♥ now I’m level 5. It’s time to venture out into the wilderness again to kick a group of dude’s brains in! I run out into the desert and soon see a gang in the distance. They spot me and shout “get the prick”. I decide to run instead. They’re faster than me, and soon catch up. They kick my♥♥♥♥♥bad. Breaking my left leg, stabbing me in the stomach and putting me in a coma, they leave me for dead face down in the sand, in my underwear. Day 5. Is spent in a comaDay 6. I drag my broken leg, limping back to the town.Day 7. I can’t do this alone, and decided to spend 700 cats on hiring a girl in the local bar, to join me. She heals me, but I’m still limping bad, so I find a bed nearby and pay 100 cats to bed down for a while and heal.Day 8. An outside gang try entering the town, and the fighting kicks off! I’m recovering in bed, but the girl runs outside, looting as many corpses as possible. She puts some of the armour on, gets instantly attacked and hobbles to the bed next to me, to recover.Day 8. The fighting is still going on outside, and it’s escalated into gang warfare. Both fully recovered, we ditch the gangs’ outfits (so we don’t get our heads kicked in again!) and begin looting and selling. We decide to hire another member to our gang, and turn him into a tank of a man, (with a hunchback). Together we loot every corpse and finally raise around 15k cats. Day 9. After some serious dummy training and some more members, it’ll be time to head out of this town again, and back to the shack I began on day 1. We’ll try and get the building completed with a working generator, build a few mines and see what happens next. To summarise:Yeah it’s in development still, and it’s got bugs, but it’s totally playable and worth every penny.The developers seem to working hard on updates and deserve  support & money on this great little gem.

								UPDATE:I did not realize this review would get so many votes. This review as of now is quite outdated, but I have not redownloaded this game to test the new contents. The devs seem to be updating the game quite frequently, so take it as you will.HOWEVER, DO KEEP IN MIND THIS GAME WAS INITIALLY RELEASED ON EARLY ACCESS OUTSIDE OF STEAM ON SEPTEMBER 2009. This game does not play like an old school RPG game that was made in 2015. It feels like a 2009 game with some graphical updates. You will probably never see this game released in your lifetime. At least, not with the complete functionalities that were promised.-----------------I can't believe how many positive reviews there are for this game. Yes, the game has potential. Yes, the game is in alpha, and therefore can be judged based on the potential, but this is a game that has been in development for an incredibly long amount of time without significant updates. I even retried the game today to see if there were updates added. Sure, the game is an open world, but there is still not much to do in the game. Dialogues are sparse and uselss at best, Combat is clunky, the UI is horrendous, pathing is bizarre and unexpected. Even building a city and grabbing a squad of your own feels tedious rather than fun. Character models are ugly, and though the devs are going to be coming out with a new GUI soon according to their announcements, it does not appear to be a significant upgrade from the current system. Landscapes and cities look great at times, but not enough to actually immerse you into the game.The game itself is challenging, but not in a particularly fun way. Yes, everyone is stronger than you, yes, the game makes you work your way up in the game, but by the time you do, you've inevitably lost interest in the game, or it has crashed on you about a dozen times. It's a game that I really want to like as I enjoy open-world, sandbox RPGs, but there is simply nothing to do other than wander around, get pummeled, wait to be rescued or recover, and repeat process. Avoid this game until it leaves Early Access, if it ever leaves early access. The game does have a strong (almost fanatic) fan-base, and the devs do listen to their fans, but the development is so slow, it makes almost no difference whether they do or not. And most negative reviews, whether warranted or not, will get torn apart by this crazed fan base.			"

								Kenshi is a game of overcoming failure. Mainly, failure that you seek out; in the game I am presently playing, my group has been destroyed and left for dead bar one lone survivor. Not bad for fighting over one hundred battles. Unlike most grinders, losing makes the character better. Each blow suffered, each failed defense helps each character grow stronger. On the same hand, each use of an attack does the same for one’s melee attack. Strength requires either using a heavier weapon in combat, or dragging heavy gear and materials across the sandy wastelands to become stronger.My character started out with a group, fed up with stifled city life and taxes. We gathered together to head out and found our own homes and lives. After days of preparing our small mining camp, the group is capable of carrying out a full scale mining company, selling goods and creating a faction to be reckoned with. The grind is rewarding, since the humble beginning of this rag tag group.All of this is earned through hours, upon hours of grinding. Kenshi is not a game for the light of heart; the grinding will try your patience, and the music, while atmospheric, is ambient and tends to get grating after a while. Blood will spill. Arms will be broken. The crafting system, powered by choice of end product and the speed of production depends on the skill of the creator. Quality has no bearing on the skill, thankfully, considering the hours necessary to craft simple weapons and armor.There are presently only five styles of attack available to train in as well as craft. Hackers, Cleavers, heavy weapons, and a variety of katana, and wakizashi. Thankfully, this is all mitigated, in part, by a speed up function that speeds up the world to further reduce real crafting time.Enemies in the current version are made up of Starving Bandits, Dust Bandits, Sand Ninja, and Cannibals. You will end up fighting these enemies over and over, until your skills are good enough to defend yourself and your allies. Depending on start, the other notable factions (United Cities Samurai, Mercenaries, and Holy Nation) will be your enemies as well, presenting a higher difficulty for your characters as they are highly armed and dangerous.The wound system is one of survival, with the game tracking wounds to different parts of the body. Head, stomach or chest area, are required to stay conscious . The other limbs if injured come in the form of inability to use the limb or slowed movement, which may make fleeing difficult. Kenshi is unforgiving in this respect.Base creation is RTS style, requiring building materials, time, and a builder. The overall process is the same as weapon and item crafting, with a number of buildings available for crafting or research.The game’s research and science is also time based; Purchasing blueprints is a matter of heading to stores that sell similar products. Researching requires leaving a team member behind a workshop table to learn new construction.Now, considering the game is in alpha, it’s unsurprising that the models start off simple. With recent updates you are given the ability to manipulate and change the character’s features, with the ability to manipulate even height and weight. This all comes with a warning; at present, many of the combat animations do not work with some of the more extreme body shapes, with super small or super tall, or super wide characters having difficulty meshing with the animations. This presents mostly when using female models, which were recently added.Graphics are the other issue; the game’s atmosphere is post apocalyptic, this makes the the surrounding environments tame continuous desert. The occasional greenery pops up now and then helping to bring some colour.There have been many updates since Kenshi was released an Early Access Game, with changes and updates coming roughly every month or so. With new updates come new clothing, changes to models, landscape changes and many more. Game saves are not compatible between versions; however, there is an option to Import characters from earlier saves.There are also quite a number of bugs, mostly to do with path-finding and other commands. As this is an alpha, expect to see them.SO WE COME TO THE ENDAfter unfathomable hours of game play, Kenshi drawn me back again and again to it’s blood soaked desert. The game offers an huge amount of freedom. It’s a game of growing numbers and seeing their impact in a world that is filled with danger. It is a game that is hard to get into but once you have the basics say goodbye to real life. It thrives off of swift and brutal combat with only the best surviving to the end, and the weak being cut down dead; the lucky laying unconscious. It is unforgiving, and at the same time, for those who are willing to put in the time, rewarding.It is a vicious and simple game, that has a full save/loading system. The grind is punishing; enemies constantly challenge you to grow and adapt, to survive, and eventually conquer those around you. Yet it is just lenient enough for your characters to survive.The game is still in development and is missing many features. Expect crashes and bugs at this stage. But remember in development games receive regular ongoing updates and improvements, by purchasing at an early stage you get the game for a reduced price and can watch it gradually grow and improve!

And maybe a little bit creative... you'll not only survive, you'll thrive.Kudos to the designers, they could have upped sticks a long time ago through all the difficulty and bugs but nope.

								To counter the negetive reviews. Most large companies don't even attempt to make a game such as this because it takes a lot of money and time to develop. Now remember this isn't a large company with 1000 people that own 10 studios around the world. Time is essential to fix bugs and add new content to an open world sandbox so many things can break.  Just sit back and wait for the updates to get released, The wait for this amazing game to be completed is well worth it!I give Lo-Fi Games massive credit for this game,Keep going.			"

								great game! followed it for over 2 years i think now way before sound and construction was ever implemented! the only way i can describe it is think fallout 1/2 but in a map size of elder scrolls: daggerfall along with construction from c & c except a little more controled and less ""1 click to build then wait"" the combat is fun the controls are fluid the a.i can be very derpy somtimes which is freaking funny but this game is still only in alpha. if i had to rate it out of 10 easily an 7.5 but only because it has still some stuff to add but i give it a 10 for what it is trying to do in terms of bringing back sandbox squad based tactical rpg's except squad can range from 2 to 300! (or 22 is the current maximum as of 25/11/2013) keep an eye on this one it will go very far! give it love and support it deserves!			"

								So, this is probably going to be one of my favourite games of all time. Despite the game being not having half the features that are planned for it, I'm hooked, because what it does contain is fantastic, and the potential of it excites me beyond belief. Quality:As it is currently, there are some minor annoyances bug/glitch wise (I.e wall/gate placement in base building, items dissapearing when dropped, and people being launched into the sky when put down) but with a pinch of salt and frequent quick-saving, it's nothing that will spoil your experience and the game is very playable as it is. Value: (I paid £12.99)For your money, you get to support the development of a game that will hopefully set the standard for future RPG's, as well as many, many, hours of what is currently very enjoyable Alpha gameplay. And if you're like me, and are really excited about where this game is going, you get to feverishly await the addition of future content!I've clocked just over 60 hours on this playthrough and feel like I've more-or-less plumbed the depths of it by exploring most of the map, filling up my sqaud with people, doing 99% of the research and getting my main guys to be pretty good at what they do. However I could probably wring another 10-15 hours out of this playthrough easily, and the game has the potential to be infinitely replayable. I'd happily start over right now.Brief Overview:Until you can build your first outpost, you'll spend most of your time roaming around a vast and empty desert. I s**t you not. But trust me, you'll love it, because it's so atmospheric. Also, you will be very, very, very, cautious, hopping between the safety of city walls until you can toughen your guy(s) up. or you WILL get destroyed by ne'er-do-wells in the desert.The thing I love most about Kenshi, is that it doesn't need quests or missions (although these may be implemented later), because it's an epic story that tells itself, and you make it up as you go along and become immersed in the story that you create. Conclusion:If you love RPG's, katanas, epic journeys, and immersive, open-ended, gameplay, then Kenshi is a no-brainer. The vast amount of potential this game has is a bonus. I wish all Early Access titles were this promising.For a forcast of Kenshi's future development, check out this handy-dandy Roadmap: http://www.lofigames.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:roadmap&Itemid=71 "

Early Access Review
								Whatever ""it"" is...this game has it: the ""it"" that I've all but given up looking for the past 15+ years. I originally bought this game purely on the basis of a vaguely promised potential stemmed from the fact that a single person had so fully and passionately invested in her/his singular dream. I admired that and felt it was worth my acknowledgement as a born-and-raised gamer-at-heart. Admittedly, I was not impressed at first.  It was bare on all levels. Yet, I felt something; something trying to be realized; a seed trying to find ground. So, I let it be without judgement. For whatever reason the cosmos deem fit to define, I recently felt it was time to test the presumably deeper waters that have been forged since I first endulged to witness the extent of that ""something"" that had or had not been realized. Much to my not-so-dubious pleasure, my hope was revived to spark another true flame of that ""it"" I've so patiently searched for. Granted, I found it beneath hours upon hours of fumbling and keyboard-shattering crashes; but, honestly, at this point, the game's faults have become part of its charm. Which is really what adds that extra spice to give it that ""it"" flavor. Despite all of its admittedly glaring short-falls, it prevails with the potential for which it strives. Like every truly meaningful vision, its success is in its unrelenting ambition. And it only reveals this to you if you are willing to see it; willing to want it; willing to give it more than a glance of your attention. If you are, and if you do, this game will abide. It defies the shallow, heartless, financially-infused delusion that is the instant-gratification platform of gaming today. It is an uncut, unpollished, diamond-in-the-rough, poised to rise beyond one's incredulity into the veritable heart of imagination that so desperately seeks that ellusive sense of perpetual satisfaction afforded only by the so-called immersive gaming. No doubt, it is not for everyone. It is only for those willing to see what it wants to be; willing to see where it is headed and how far it has come at the hands of someone who seems to truly understand, if only on some unintelligible level of consciousness, what is starving the hearts of the angst-filled cynics that are today's gaming community. TL;DR : This game is for those who appreciate gaming as a form of art. It is indeed a work in progress; but a glorious one. In my opinion, it is worth the purchase on merit alone. The more people willing to see the potential, the greater the potential that will ultimately be realized. I am a believer. Are you?Either way, happy gaming.			"

								Although it's not finished Kenshi is a unique and interesting game which offers quite a challenge and requires players to really think about what they do and don't purchase, where to start your own outpost, what to build, and whether to run from a group of bandits (9 times out of 10) or stay and fight with a chance of walking away with some valuable loot.Kenshi does have its fair share of bugs, multiple times i have found my soldiers merging and teleporting from one point in my outpost to another, and having men on both sides freeze during combat, these usually sort themselves out in the end.Overall i believe Kenshi is a great game for all people to pick up and waste time with, just don't be surprised when a massive bandit group just waltzes into your shack and slaughters everyone.

								This game... I don't know if it will ever be finished but it is soooo addictive. It's my dream game for so many things. I always wanted a game where your character would evolve and xp according to his actions. Fable had that promise but it was fake. Morrowind and the elder scrolls saga pretended to be that but it was fake as well (still these level and point attribution thingy)Here, getting hurt makes you stronger. Literally.Being overburdened will develop your muscle, but will you make you run slower, and running faster can mean survival.Don't know how to describe this game properly, but there is so much potential here... I play several hours every 6 month, to see what is new and everything, and always get sucked back in.			"

A little way's away from the village I spotted a goat, and thought it was the perfect target to test out just how good this sword I spawned with was.Turns out the stuff I thought was grass around it was actually ten other goats.

								As many people have stated there are plenty of bugs and the development is incredibly slow.  I still love this game.  I have, I think, 110 hours of playtime and a majority of that is on one playthrough.  The combination of survival, builiding, combat, squad play, and an intricate stat system keeps me coming back (even if a lot of that list doesn't work properly).  If this game is ever completed, it will be one of those games that sticks around my library forever.			"

								This game is a beauty.GAMEPLAY :The default start is a RPG with the classic inventory and stats (old-fashioned stats).But with some time, you end up getting ingame currency and you can recruit a new character, which also has its own inventory and stats.By the time you get to understand the game, you can end up with 50+ characters (form up diferent squads), and then it can become an RTS kinda game. Yes, you can build stuff, and all the cities you will see in the game, you are able to create by yourself. You can prospect the land to see if it is good to grow stuff, make bread, and open a baker shop; or if it's better to mine, make a weaponsmith and open an armory.  Each character can be an Engineer, Merchant, Medic, Swordsman, Gunman (turrets and Xbows) etc.....There are mutiple factions which have unique laws and goals in the world. Of course, it is a dynamic world, and if you place your city well enough, you will get more and more travelers stopping by, renting beds or buying stuff; or you can get known by the closest bandits faction and they will start bullying you to pay taxes.To wrap it up, this game is absolutely incredible for the possibilities you get. BUT, it is not for everyone. Actually, the guy (GENIUS) behind this game wanted to create a game where you are not special. You ain't the last dragonborn, nor a mighty knight that will demolish every ennemies. You are a simple wanderer, so at the beginning of the game, literally ANYONE can kill you. + the health system is very complex. Each part of your body has a healthbar, which affects your total blood bar.Obviously, if you suffer heavy injuries, your character will go to Coma state, and eventually die.. forever (permadeath).So again, it is for gamers that are looking for challenge. I myself was quite horrified by this game at the beginning, but now I understand most of its content, I can make really decent games where I am able to create an outpost with a production and shops, and a little army to defend myself. Finally, this game is in alpha state. It is a project that is made by one person to begin with, but now it is a team.It has a slow progress, but has never been abandonned. Plus the price is really fair.Recently they worked with amazing musicians that play crazy instruments to make a unique and amazing OST,And the game is getting a major update soon enough since the map will  change for a randomly generated map with diferent biomes and wildlife. Sorry if this comment is too long, but I almost never comment games, and this one really deserved my thumbs up.18/10.  "

 Actual Review Down Below! Update 5/25/2015I got sidetracked with lots of review, the preview is gonna wait till i get that performance patch they were saying.Update 5/17/2015 Experimental UpdateHo boy this is.... this is awesome! The old GUI is gone and for the first time ever it looks neat! holy crap. holy holy crap. You should have seen the character creation menu. It looks so clean! And gosh from the last time i played this the game looks a bit better now. I did freeze up here and there but it is the experimental build after all. Will update once i actually starts killing sand ninja. Game Detail Name: KenshiDeveloper: Lo- Fi GamesGenre: RPG, Simulation, Trading, Strategy, Squad Management KENSHI *Sigh*. I'll be straight with you, this game once consume me for a while. Therefor when I was chosen to do a review on KENSHI, i was rather taken aback and did everything i could to avoid doing it. But the time has come. And now i ask you the question, do you know what is KENSHI? Most likely not, it's not a mainstream game nor a very well known indie for that one but those people who had the chance to try it will usually exclaim that it is better than most of the RPG on the maker and yet here i must make my statement regarding this game: It's not for everyone. Certainly not for me after i tried it. Ok so what is KENSHI? RPG game, with a dash of realism. That is to say it is still in early access and i had tried years ago the alpha build before it went on steam and i have to say improvements have been made after all this years. It's an eastern style RPG set in a apocalyptic world where sands rule the land and law and order are determined by might with roaming bands of brigands out for your blood everywhere you go.It's a very atmospheric world. You can be beset by cannibals, saved by the Holy Empire Patrol, loot dead bodies and equip yourself and after months of training and war you started killing settlements. The tables have turn. And that my dear reader is what KENSHI embodies, symbolizes and make you experience. You are a human being, in a world where other people are often times better than you. You will bleed in the middle of the desert before using your last medkit to bandage your arm and hobble slowly back to the city. At the end of the day, life goes on. Why the bravado? Simply because reviewing this game is subjectively hard. That and because i liked it. On with the review i suppose. Many parts of KENSHI will be miss however simply due to the scope. Gameplay You can choose to start with several preset such as having a good weapon, having trade goods [the goods are cheap, the bag however is not.] having a good weapon, having good combat skill [recommended for beginner.] or having several dudes in your party at start. Which i do not recommend. Anyways customize your appearances, choose a name, gender [Race is coming. Not very soon however since the updates are slow but big.] and then *BOOM* You are drop into the magnificent world of KENSHI. With only a very brief tooltip to get you started on your journey.The game is an open ended RPG meaning you can do pretty much what you want without any objective save for those you set yourself. Therefor people who enjoy reading story instead of making it should probably not find it very enjoyable. Anyways you can do a lot of things in the game but lemme just use the very rarely used bullet point instead of typing it out. Start your own town. Become a master of arms. Become a bounty hunter. Become an anarchist. A blacksmith even! with upgrades and blueprints! Or my personal favourite: Wandering the waste, getting into fights randomly healing people or breaking their bones. Then you become a warlord and do all of the above. Nothing really stopping you to be honest.And here is where the gameplay gets fun. You see KENSHI utilizes a unique RPG system where instead of skill points you actually perform the action to upgrade your corresponding skill. System like Carrying extra weight to train your strength, running without any loads to increase your running speed. And actually fighting to increase your fighting skills because you truly suck at the beginning where even a small bandit can make you into coma.Speaking of coma this game HP system should be utilize into more game. For example your limbs have individual health bar and each of them can bleed out individually reducing their effectiveness and preventing you from using two handed weapons and sword for examples. But that is not all! Wound your opponent enough on the head and they will faint, on the leg and they will hobble, on the arm and well.... have fun. Meanwhile you also have a blood meter! Lost too much and get coma and die. Subject to everyone. So everyone has an equal chances of dying with only their martial art skill being the tie breaker.There is also the element of trading, by buying trading bag which reduces your speed and make you more susceptible to bandits you can buy trading goods and trade stuff from town to town. Then all those training carrying sacks of metal made you stronger so you can then beat up bandits!The game is hilariously open is what i am saying. That is not even accounting for squad formation, squad order. create-a-town mechanic function and all the other things in this world. It's the tip of the iceberg. Graphics Compare to years ago the graphics have improve substantially although in 2015 its not really something to write home about. You can even sometimes see graphical glitches from time to time although seeing as this is a rather massively scope game such a thing are understandable. Sound While atmospheric the ambient sound is best turned off, the game set to windowed mode and you play supplied with your own music. Trust me the lonely landscape takes time to transverse even at top speed so having your tune would supplement it quite well. Conclusion My review will never do KENSHI justice, it is a game of such openness and it provides you with the mean to experience that everybody will play it differently. For me it is the ever path of the wanderer [And the warlord once I figure out how to actually kill someone with this metal rod i call a sword.] Scoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:-	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorVerdict: S-Rank [So long as the update is stable otherwise it's an A-Rank.]Protip: Try the demo floating around the internet before you commit. The demo is rather old though with many new features have been implemented into the game. Still a long way before release though.  Early Access Hiccups? Plenty. Many features are experimented on all the time on this game. And as such it breaks easily during update. Does not stop you from enjoying it though.EDIT 4/20/2015: I should really clarify something, i wont ssay this game has potential but it does [hypocrite] but the thing is about this game is that i got my enjoyment out of whatever update it already has so further progress is merely bonus at this point. So dont wait for the potential, just enjoy the now. Check out the Original Network Groups. Win free games, make new friends on Steam, & more!

								A warning to a potential buyer: the game is still very much early access, crashes are frequent (thankfully an autosave is already implemented) and many of the features are incomplete. If you don't enjoy seeing a game through development, this is not the game to buy.Preamble warning aside, Kenshi has a lot of interesting features, not the least of which for me is the crafting system, especially being able to gear your party with hand made items. That said, while some aspects of the game aren't as intuitive as you could hope, the scope of the game and shear number of features is exciting, and reminds me of of a scaleably third person team based Morrowind.If the developers continue to work on this game steadily, I could very easily see myself going back and continuing to play. With as much potential as this game has, I really hope they complete it, because they will have produced a very unique and enjoyable game.			"

								I give this game an 8.5/10.Be warned, this game will not be for everyone. It is still in Early Access, so a there are missing features, bugs and glitches (but that's to be expected). If these things strike a nerve, wait until the full game is released. Most of the glitches and bugs are easily avoided though; just use the F5 (quicksave key) often. Then when something does go wrong, you can automagically timewarp back and do it all again :)How I would sum up the world: Think Tatooine landscape filled with sword-wielding samurai and ninjas. No magic, no fantasy. It feels like it could be real (assuming it's on another planet :P).I love this game because of the grind. Sure, you have to sink in a lot of hours to get anywhere, but nothing matches the feeling of sheer satisfaction when you've built up a strong party, a well defended base and little stands in your way as a threat. The game was tough to learn, so you'll need to lean on the wiki for support for the first few hours at least. But once you've found your way it's all smooth sailing.My only real dislikes about the game are the bugs. The one that annoyed me the most was the teleporting 'dead' bandits. Watch out for these bad boys because despite being 'dead', they will teleport closer and closer to your storage buildings then loot your stuff. And no matter how many times you go to loot the stuff back off them, they will always win. F5 is the only way to save the day.Yet some of the bugs are more amusing than annoying... Like men sleeping like bats, hanging upside down off the sides of beds. Or shopkeepers within shopkeepers so they look like they have two faces, four eyes, two noses and four ears :PAll in all, if you like games that require a grind and can put up with weird stuff happening, dive right on in. It's worth more than you pay for it. If you like a grind but don't like glitches or blank buttons, wait for the full release. And if you don't like a grind, then this game is definitely not for you.			"

								ALPHA PREVIEW REVIEWAside from some crashes I had playing this title, This is a great concept in the work mainly done by one person so the updates can be a little slow but the game is awsome.Its basically a free roam survival rts with samurais and desert. I started off as a lone wonderer in this world before I was able to construct an entire squad each character named after the people who watched my stream, I had to be careful not to kill off my members as I work on them to become stronger so we can take on the cannibal village. In order to keep myself going the first thing I had to do was lure people to thier death and use town guards as my shield, eventually i built a mine, did some recruitment, and assigned people jobs, soon I had a full functioning village selling items from and creating weapons with close to 20 people. Training for our attack on the cannibals.With more work this game will be more and more amazing but it will not be done anytime soon. Its slowly getting better and better as time progress and is worth the value, I hope with support the author can focus on this game 100% full time and get things going because this is a real gem of an idea he has here+Samurai Squad base survival+recruit players, customize em and name them+awsome music+This game is plain fun watching your squad roll out in army+create your own town, start selling from your town, start a business from your town (still in the works but works really well)+the world is quite big and it all takes place in the desert+The animations during the combat is pretty sweet-Theres no real story to the game yet-Could use alot more buildings and thing sto do-Cant wait for more factions. need moar!-Bugs and crashes atm which causes me not to be able to progress too far when I have huge samurai battles-The graphics isnt the best thing in the world but he fun makes up for it.-Sometimes graphic and ai glitches out, like buildings halfway in sand etc+- This is a working title, my review and opinion will change as the game progresses but this is basically my ALPHA PREVIEW REVIEW "

								As a child, I improved rudementery reading skills with classic RPGs like Dragon Warrior 3, Shining Force, and Fire Emblem. These games were amazing, because in adition to cementing a sense of justice in a 5 year old, they presented a memorable plot, different forms of character development (DW3 with the personalities, where the personality determined stat increases, and was determined by initial stats. Shining Force with the stories told by your squadmates in the various bases found over the 8 chapters, as well as themes of amnesia. Fire Emblem for being, well, Fire Emblem.) None of that is in this game. Which makes it perfect.""Why would you tell that story to point out what it doesn't have?"" Simple: Kenshi has everything else that made those games personally iconic. From Dragon Warrior 3, you have each squad member being completely unique from creation, with nearly endless possibilities for customization, with an open world. From Fire Emblem, you have that strategic element, same with Shining Force. But with no 'level' or 'class' system, there are no restraints. I'll admit, I plan after writing this to re-create Shining Force in game, by creating each of the characters in order of appearance. That'll be fun!But it doesn't stop there. The combat is fluid, and the AI is great. Giving each limb, and core parts it's own hit points, and changing gameplay according to damage (and changing DAMAGE based on how you choose to heal it) is something more in-depth than most heavy LARP systems I've seen. You can build a base and be a group of peaceful farmers/traders (not that you need to eat). You can start a war with one faction (though I wouldn't reccomend it... ever), or become a group of mercenaries. The sandbox element is strong in this game.While the game is still in alpha, the groundwork has been set for so much more than is already released (as a player, I'd be fine if I had to deal with what i've got.) The few bugs that are in the game are minute and are easily bypassed with frequent quicksaves and game imports. The dev, while a little slow in getting the game out, is very careful to minimize bugs. A perfectionist, if you will.And this brings me back to that 5 year old playing those games for the first time, because while I can't play through those stories again, every click is another element that goes into a script playing in my head. While the characters may not interract on screen, they can be in the player's mind. As an adult, I've been a DM for a few years now, but Kenshi gives even more creative freedom to the player, which is the ultimate goal of an RPG. The only thing you can't do multiplayer, and i'm sure that by the time it gets to full release, it will have addressed that.This game can only be catagorised as a Sandbox/RPG/RTS/Simulation/Open World/Base Building Awesomeness. This is better than most games released today, and for the price, you'd be a fool NOT to pick it up. The true brilliance of this game is that there is a start point, but it is infinite. The end is wherever you choose to stop.			"

								""Toughness Stat - How to train:-Not wearing armor; armor is for wimps.-Getting hit for high amounts of damage, like a man.-Get up and fight when you should be playing dead.""Sold.You probably shouldn't play Kenshi. It is going to suck you in. Just walk away.JK... but not reallly.The thing crashes semi-frequently, and there are bugs such as the path-finding and character edge-sticking which reviews have mentioned, but these don't ruin it by far and are still in development (if your character is stuck in a wall, just tell another character to pick them up). Gameplay took some getting used to, as did the interface. Kenshi has a very balanced mechanic between RPG and RTS without feeling like either. More specifically, it somehow manages to combine the feel of Mount & Blade and Dwarf Fortress, with a little influence from Bioware-style party-management, into one intelligent video-game-gasm with some serious yet subtle attitude and atmosphere.The new content being talked about is going to expand upon what is already hours of playability. Apparently there are going to be new maps, beasts, quests, and I could even see more Mount & Blade-like politics with faction leaders (you listening, devs?), and mounts, or vehicles, and other characters, and maybe even a storyline, and then there's the modding community, and... and... let me stop.Enter the desert.

								This game has serious potential..  I've been playing it for a while now, and it's just gotten better.. great soundtrack and sounds have been introduced, more creatures and factions, excellent armor and clothing additions..  The creator seems genuinely passionate about his game..  I think this could be the real deal as far as early access goes.. (unlike MANY games out there just to make a buck and bail.)The game updates tend to take a while, but they're pretty keen on the news updates and where they are in development.The ""new"" map is HUGE(and it's less than half finished!).  Much larger than the original they came out with which was a bit overwhelming in itself, but they've included tons of stuff to keep your exploration bug at bay.If you're patient enough and up to the challenge and don't mind antiquated graphics, The real fun of this game is working yourself up from a nothing weakling loser getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked at every turn into a decked out, rich badass with one or several towns or cities to your name and an army to back you up.It still needs work of course.  I have a mental laundry list of stuff that could improve it, but if you're into this sort of thing, it's well worth checking out.			"

You walk 5 feet, hellhound, you die. You walk the other direction, bandits, you die. 7/10 Harder then Darksouls.//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////1/14/2016 The game is creeping along in development but still (in my mind) it has at least 3 more years before it can be relesased as a compelte game. Only Buy it if you wanna help the developers. As it stands you might get 4-6 hours of gameplay out of it before getting bored. I wait with my fingers crossed for more updates and nice tidbits of info.			"

								TL:DR, 10/10 well worth playing.. and playing again... and again.If Mount and Blade and Shogun: Total War had a baby, and that baby grew up to have a baby with Age of Empires 2... it would be close to this. Kenshi is gripping, it feels slow at the start but it's an amazing game once you crack the egg. Updates are coming thick and fast (at the time of writing) and it is a promising framework.			"

								This game is for RPG-Players. This game is for those who love Strategy games and building their own town. This game is for people who like freedom and a sandbox to live in. It's special, but if you really are a fan of all the above, you should get this game! First of all, in my opinion the graphics are pretty decent, especially for this type of a game. I know it's far beyond those knock off titles upcoming like Witcher 3 and Inquisition, but keep in mind it's not a pure RPG, you build your own cities and there can be way more NPC onscreen at the same time than you would imagine( I had a realy big battle with like 50+ NPC's, all fighting at the same time). The Audio is well...improvable to say the least, but hey it's still early access. Story: there is none! Or to explain it better: think of your own story, why are your characters here? What do they want to accomplish? And the most important question: why are they doing, what they are doing? Right now there are no quests, but they will be implemented, just like several guilds/parties/groups you will most likely be able to join(if I am not mistaken). The landscape of Kenshi is...monotous right now. You're traveling a pure desert, with many high mountains, but also some dunes. There are many cities controlled by NPC factions, most of them small, some are bigger.But for me the most interesting part is the sandbox part. You can litteraly build everywhere! I am not kidding. Only restrictions are terrain such as really high mountains and you're not allowed to build too close to an NPC city. So ever wanted to write your own story? Build your own little kingdom? Craft your own gear to quip your fighters? To send them on a conquest to foreign lands or people you do not like? Or do you just desire to trade peacefully? Or maybe, maybe you're the type of guy who wants to stay alone and take on a huge challenge by fighting all on your lonesome against hordes of bandits? Get it!			"

								This game is one of the most addicting games ive ever played. I got home from work and played for 7 hours straight without even realizing it. At first its weird and confusing with the whole ""No man character"" thing. But it grows on you an eventually it becomes normal. This game plays like no other game ive ever had. It mixes real time strategy with building, advancing characters, free roaming, trading, pretty much anything you imagine. Capture slaves and force them to work or sell them off, Create a legendary samarui squad, create a steel fortress, get eaten by cannable, anything you want to do is probably going to be in this game. Absolutely get it.			"

								This game has a LOT of people either in love with it, or not understanding how anyone could enjoy it.  Both ends of the scale have pretty good reasons for their decision.  The word potential gets thrown around quite a bit with this game, that's because it does have absurd potential for being massively awesome, but let's just focus on fixing the crashes first (they are much less frequent than they used to be, but still).  Crashing out of the game isnt that bad, the game autosaves already fairly frequently, and you can even increase how often it autosaves.  The combat is quite unique in that you dont directly control your squad while they fight, but their skills dictate how well they do.  Once you see a couple of well trained soldiers quickly work through an army of low skill bandits, you understand how awesome fighting can get.  But I do mean ""can get"", as you have to work your♥♥♥♥♥off trying to not get the crap kicked out of your guys until they can hold your own even against a few other enemies.  The game also has a basebuilding mechanic, with research and crafting, but in all honesty I haven't attempted it beyond ""I'm gonna build a house on this lovely mouintain"", so I don't really know how it all plays out or if it's even working.  The game has a cool trading method, go from town to town buying things for cheap and reselling them at the next town over where they don't have those items so you can sell 'em for a higher markup.  There are multiple starts in Kenshi, from being a naked man with a roughed up arm in the middle of the desert to 5 guys wanting to start a town, there are multiple fun ways to start the game off.  Character creation in Kenshi is interesting to say the least, it's not awful, but a lot of the sliders you just don't want to touch for risk of making your character very disproportionate so the armours and weapons dont look quite right.  I once made a midget named Hugo who wielded the biggest blade I could find, it always hovered near his hands and not in them.  Out of 352 games I can honestly say this game is one of my favourites, Kenshi is quite the experience and I feel like I didn't do the game justice with this review, because its either a game that you will love, or you'll disregard it forever.

								This is THE game for a gamer who is seriously into strategy/simulation.  I bought Kenshi on the steam sale, and instantly became hooked.  There is no friendly, happy, bunny mode.  You begin in one of the scenarios you choose. i.e. your starting squad and loadout, and instantly begin in an unforgiving world of sand ninjas, samurai, and desert drifters.  How you choose to proceed is up to you, and if you choose unwisely, you will die/fail.  No one to blame but your past.  If you don't rush into the desert wastes, put some thought into you development, and plan, there is a great chance you will succeed ... or at least not be bludgeoned too bad by hungry bandits.  Wait and admass a squad and income before trying to form your own town and you will be okay; if not you will have to fight like clint eastwood in an old western, but without the guys.  Great game for those with the patience to play it and overlook the occasional bug.  On this issue, updates are constantly coming out, and fixes come out even faster.  The Dev is doing a great job for it's small operation, and if you can handle the occasional stress of dealing with a bug and at the worst having to revert to the newest save or auto save, there is nothing too flawed about the game.I highly recommend it for any serious gamer.  If you can handle anything but immediate gratification, don't buy it; plain and simple. Just call downstairs to your mom for some more soda and pizza bites ... everything will be okay snookums’.			"

								Ok this is my first ever review. Normally i just let others do this for me but i like this game to much not to voice my opinion.I'm totally hooked on this game, it is very addicting. I like the whole explore and survive aspect of the first few hours as your building your squad. Than picking a spot to build your town and building and crafting it up is also very fun. There is a definate progression to all your skills that is satisfiying. I find the game in its current state to be completely playable for hours and am very excited for all the future game features to be added.  I've had minor problems with crashes and bugs and have found the import function on the load screen to be a very useful tool for resetting and eliminating most bugs.  All in all cant recommend this game highly enough.			"

								I discovered Kenshi five days ago. I have only been playing Kenshi for five days now.First and foremost: the game has many flaws. It's in beta and the bugs are numerous. You'll need to restart the game to alleviate some of these bugs, while others will need to be remedied by verifying the game cache.But it's all worth it.Kenshi draws me in and tickles a nostalgic part of my brain that is still in love with Star Wars Galaxies (pre combat revamp of course). The combat seems clunky at first but really just takes time to appreciate. You are not spoon fed. Your characters will be wounded, ensalved, imprisoned and killed. And you'll continually become stronger and smarter because of it.Building your own camp is fun. Turning that into a village is great. Becoming the architect of your own city that can be seen from the alien horizon is what it's all about.Buy this game at full price. Have some patience and allow Kenshi to grow on you. This is a special title. Don't miss out on it.			"

								Wow, that guy has a 5000 cat bounty? Alright, I just recruited 2 people from a nearby bar and outfitted them with armor from that group of desperate, starving bandits. Its time to make some money!It's just one dude, we can take him.""Retreat! Retreat!"" as I fall with a katana buried in my back, blood staining the sand.Hours later, I awake. It's dusk. One of my companions lies merely a dozen yards from me, barely breathing. The other is no where to be found. I grit my teeth as I throw Brigand over my back and silently pace towards the city with as many samurai as citizens. The city lights are guiding me. I'm nearly there. I can see the light glint off of the helmets of the samurai warriors. Behind me, I hear footsteps. Many footsteps. As I turn, fifteen screaming bandits are taking positions around me. I drop Brigand to the sand and unsheath my rusty sword. In a moment, I feel a myriad of blades tear into my flesh. My vision started to swim and I could feel death creeping upon me, slowly yet surely. Another moment later, the bandits are routing as the Samurai crash into their ranks. With my last breaths, I carried my companion to the inn, and placed him on a bed. I didn't make it more than five feet before I feel to the ground. There just wasn't enough blood to keep me standing. May Brigand find better fortune than I in this world.			"

								Why should you get this game? 84 hours in six days is not enough reason?Then let me tell you my Kenshi story:I never buy games which are not as special somewhere.So when I wanted to try Kenshi - again like some months or years ago - I got the demo from the website of the developer.When a demo exists it normally means that the developer thinks peoplewill like his product even after trying it. Self confidence.I tried the demo and played it for - I don't know - two or three days.Then I realized, I want the whole game, the actual update, I got the game,even if there was no special. I don't do that. Never. Normally.Demo play:I already know that I am not the hero in this game. So I know I have to take it slowly.I start in rags in a large desert. I run around until I get to a small village in the mountains.With all my money I hire a guy to follow me.Now we hang around town and whenever the town gets attacked we loot the bodies and sell the stuff.With the money I get more guys and some backpacks.During one of attacks one of the police officers dies.I take one look at his armor and weapon and decide: MINE!When I bring back the loot, walking proud in my new shiny armor a police officer yells at me:""Where did you get that armor?""Then he attacks me.My friends of course try to help me, but we are no match for the police officers of the village who regularly defend the village against large groups of villains.We lie there unconscious and bleeding with many wound to different parts of our bodies.After a while one of us becomes conscious again and treates himself and all of us until we are not bleeding anymore.Then he takes one of us on his shoulders, carries him to the next inn and puts him into a bed.Then he does it for the rest of us and at last puts himself to sleep too.The beds are kind of costly for me at this point so I decide I want my own house with some beds.The next days we just loot and save the money until we can buy a small house and put there some sleeping bags.Now we can use the accelerated healing rate of sleeping in a bag without having to pay for it.It is time to expand. We are so arrogant, we have no idea what we are going to get into.We take the best loot of some days as armor and weapons and some med kits and venture towards another city.Some time into the desert a horde of bandits comes running towards us.Ha, small game, we think. We saw them slaughtered on a daily basis at the village gates.They slaughter us. We lie there unconscious and bleeding with many wound to different parts of our bodies.Again.So, again the first of us who can move again starts healing the others.Then the bandits come back.They hit all walking guys again until they walk no more and start looting us.They take nearly everything.Then they march away.One comes running back and takes some more stuff from us before he follows his friends.We nearly don't make it back to the village. Some have to be carried, some can only hobble because they have serious wounds at their legs, some can not carry others because they have wounds at their arms.We were defeated but we are better in some areas like fighting and toughness.When we are able to move again I decide to go back to looting but I will send one guy without armor or weapons to run as fast as possible to the next city to start a second base there.While he is running down the next mountain some dogs start to chase him for a while and I am thinking I'll lose him.But he gets to the next city.I decide, I need the full game....The real game.Grass! Trees! Animals!Man, the difference is stunning.I start in a very small settlement of the Holy Nation, just two houses, some fields and a well.I have nothing and can't do a lot here but steal or attack and I want to be nice.So I decide to go to the next village.I wander the street when I encounter a patrol of the Holy Nation. Looks nice and powerfull that patrol.They approach me: ""What god do you worship?""Me: ""none"".Wrong answer. They beat me senseless and continue their patrol. At least they did not try to loot me.Even if I have nothing, I don't like to get looted.Now I am angry. I limp parallel to the path back to the settlement.When I get near the settlement, I start to sneak and check for guys with weapons.I get back into the settlement, always ready to run, aehm limp, away.Everything is allowed now. I steal everything I can. I see one guy with a backpack. I want it. So I can steal more!Hitting people when I am sneaking gives me a chance to knock them out.That is the skill assassination. I am very bad at it.But the peasants of this evil religion will be the first receivers of my wrath.I train knocking people out until I am very good at it.Then I get my backpack. My first backpack. All mine.I gather (steal) some more things and again decide it is time to move to another location.This time I stay away from the street and move carefully through the wilderness.When I get to a village it is not a village but a city. Large walls around lots of large buildings and many heavily armed and armored guards at the entry.I approach them, fearing the worst. This time no questioning and no attacks.I move into the city and sell my stuff at the first vendor I find.Big mistake.He recognizes the stuff as stolen from his own empire and calls the guards.They beat me senseless AGAIN and put me into prison.A cage inside one of their military buildings.I pick the lock and run away.I hide from the guards until I am no longer ""escaped"" but just someone with a bounty.Not everyone reacts to bounties every time.For some money a guy will join me.Silly me. The first guy I hire is not a human so the whole ""Holy Nation"" hates him.Very often we get insulted, traders don't trade with him and sometimes he will just get attacked and imprisoned for not wanting to be rebirthed. No idea what it is, but it does not sound good.I started to live in this city but the racist religion here got on my nerves, I decided to get to another race which was supposed to live in the south.So I ran south, swam in the river, outrun bandits and animals.When I was out of food and my swimming skill had reached level 30 I reached the border of the currently reachable area. No other race. Via forum I found I had to go west. So to the west I went.Hills, deserts, bandits. The bandits got me. I survived and hobbled towards the area where I thought the other race to be.On the map I got a marker for a village of the other race. I was nearly there. Then I got attacked by a group of animals which ate me....New life.I am this time near a even smaller settlement.Nearby is some iron, so I decide to start a small settlement here.First I will need building materials.So I create a stone mine and start to build a machine which creates construction material from stone.Not enough construction material for the machine.I need money. I mine the ore mine and sell the ore to elder of the nearby settlement.The settlement is attacked very often by dogs and bandits, I just loot the bandits and dogs and cook the dog meat so I don't get hungry and everything is kind of right.While mining some ore I get attacked by two dogs, they make me bleed so bad, my status changes from ""bleeding"" to ""dying"", all the while being unconscious.A patrol of the Holy Nation marches on the nearby street, but I am out of sight for them. They march on.I die....New life.Because of the size of the story I have to link to a post, so if you wish to continue reading, go there:http://steamcommunity.com/app/233860/discussions/4/343788552533488306/ "

								Disclaimer: as soon as the devs have finished this product, I will most likely change this recommendation to a whole-hearted ""Yes.""Kenshi is a game that contains much of what I've been wanting to see combined in open world rpgs for years: a totally open world, completely freeform squads, strategic gameplay with limb-damage, character progression, and the ability to easily break up or become seperated from your units. Actually, that last one was something I didn't even know I wanted until I played this game. In a game like Mount & Blade, failure means capture and the loss of most of your equipment and probably all of your units, and you are tied to the unit that captured you without options or variation. When my characters were knocked out by cannibals in Kenshi, my main character was left behind while the two units I had aquired by that point were taken to the cannibal's camp. Eventually, my character recovered enough to limp towards the nearest town, while my units were forced to despirately try to pick the locks of thier cages. One unit escaped, one didn't. The world of Kenshi allows for variation in losing, including the possibility of death for your main character if too much damage is taken. The result is strangly thrilling, and as I watched my unit desperately flee the cannibal camp with enemies running after her, I knew I had stumbled upon a game of great possibility.Unfortunitly, Kenshi remains too unfinished a possibility. The event I just described was the highlight of my several hours of playtime. At the moment there are no quests in Kenshi. You can build buildings, but there is no guarentee that the buildings will carry over to new versions of the game. My only goal is to build up the strength to get revenge for the unit that was killed by the cannibals. After that's done, I'll simply have no reason to keep playing.Buy only if you want to support the developers.Gameplay:

								My first adventure in this game was one with lots of questions and involved a lot of reading on my part. Though the mechanics of  this game seem cruel I feel greatly rewarded when I survive an attack against bandits or get my characters' skills up.I had started as a survivor, looking at my war buddy as I woke from a losing battle. Though he looked to be healing alright he was still unconcious and we where a long ways from any city. It took some time for me to manag(figure out) how to carry the larger man but I had managed and began walking my way towards a city. I had noticed two bandit groups skirmishing just a little distance away from me.After getting to the city I was able to buy a mercenary to help me go and pick up some salvagable equipment from the battle that I had seen on the way over. WIth the money from that equipment I hired a medic and we waited for my friend to wake up. Two days later he wakes up and we set out for another town. Two more people joined up and we moved on to another town. After fending off some badits and sand ninjas he limped out way into the Holy City of Sharks where four more people joined up. We had a large group now so we thought it would be  smart idea to build our own city. Two days later in the middle of the desert we where lost to the sands.Though my group met a tragic end at the hands of cannibals I was still able to enjoy the hours long playthrough. I learned alot abou thta tfirst one and am going to put that to good use in my next playthrough. I would deffinately recommend this game to hardcore RPG and stategy game fans.Edit:PLaying this game on and off and loving every minute of it. The game gets better and better each time it's updated. Though I will say that I wish they would bring back certain scenarios such as the survivor one where you and an ally survive a fight. I found that one to be the most fun but I still enjoy the new content to a great deal. Keep up the good work and listening to the players!			"

								They just did a fairly decent update, but after many months i'm not impressed.  Now if they ever fix it so npcs spawn in towns so you can hire more squad members instead of having to import to a new game everytime and then bugging your town such as the walls allowing npcs to walk through them after you import for example, would be a great first start. Until then, however....NO.  They said they plan to polish it and work on stabilizing soon someday, so maybe when they start doing that i can change my review back to yes as I had it when i first got the game and ignorant of how long this game has been in development, thinking it was just a couple weeks old and not 2 or 3 years at the time. So now we are heading into year 5?  I do like the game concept,gameplay and the genre of this kind. I believe this game is more likely to become abandoneware than a finished game as slow as its getting developed.  That is why I say NO.6/3/16. The last month included a lot of fixes and such, you still have to import your game to new game if you want to hire more squad members.  Prisoner cages are still bugged, you can pick lock them with prisoners, and they still ask to be set free even though its unlocked. Most of them don't even talk to you.  I just crashed the game by dismantling a small shack.  So although they keep adding new content, which is a plus for any game, except when they ignore fixing what they already have. So I must keep a no recommendation, until they show development that counts.6/15/16 New map, hurray! Now if you only play the game without it crashing. I can't say much for this update, since the game crashes soon after you start playing it. Maybe in a month or two or this fall they will have a fix for it.			"

								From what I've consistently seen from early access games, as soon as they go on special, the creators lose any financial motivation to continue development. I rarely give bad reviews, but there's no way in hell I'm letting them get away with this.Conceptually, this game is amazing and full of potential. It's the closest thing we have to a Mount and Blade clone. However, with so many years in development and such trivial updates, I've come to realize this will never be a finished, quality product, ESPECIALLY now that it's on special, and it's nothing more than a buggy sandbox with few ways to interact with the world around you. I haven't seen such terrible development constipation since Cortex Command.Please do NOT encourage such dishonest business practices.			"

								Built new city in the 0.90.x beta. Got attacked by bandits. A lot. Slavers found my recovering squad members. Forced to watch as the characters I affectionately named after family members were taken away in chains. Goodbye, Ryan. Enjoy your time in the minesMade new game as a wanderer. Turned him into a Master Thief. Robbed every store in town. Stole Arms and Armor off guards and racist Paladins. Hoarded supplies and money in a Thieves Den (S****y little shack I bought for *almost* as much as a loaf of bread). Hired Mercs with thieving profits. Built new town with stolen supplies. Recruited army and Hired more Mercs.Battled first slaver patrol I found. Stole all their s**t and dragged their bodies into the river to drown.11/10 would thieve and murder again.			"

The best part is where you can build up a settlement and hopefully they will add onto that aspect, which im sure they will. For me Kenshi is a all-around fun game to dive into adventures, base building, trading, and anything you can think of doing!			"

								As of the writing of this review, I have about 49 hours in the game, and it's not finished. Forty-nine hours and it's not finished! They started with the sandbox (which is where they could have stopped as far as I'm concerned) and then started adding stuff! Grow a farm, mine for ore, learn how to make stuff, wander around and kill bandits, do whatever you want! Lo-Fi games is very good about updating fans, and they listen to comments. So check it out! Get in on the ground floor! Enjoy!			"

								When I first saw this game, thought it was gonna be a M&B: Warband clone, only in a Asian setting, and that sounded great. But what this game is, is so much more, or at least potentially.You create a character in a post apocalyptic feudal Japan-ish world, and from there your on your own. You can be a merchant, thief, shop owner, start your own town/outpost, craft your own weapons and armor, build different kind of functional buildings, research technology to build/craft even better stuff. You can train in fighting, stealth, repairing etc. by doing what ever you want to train in. Recruit squad members as bodyguards or as part of your personal mercenary group/army and control and train each person individually.At first the game had sub-par GFX (It still not great, but aesthetically pleasing) and no sound, but bear in mind it was still in pre-alpha (currently in alpha), the graphics have improved since, and there is sound now. On top of that new major features keep being added every few months.I bought the game when it was still $10, and it feels like an investment. I play it for a couple of months, when I come back after, say six months, more features are in and feels more polished every time. A few new major features (64bit engine, dialogue, overhauled pathfinding, animals/beasts and a new larger map with biomes) are planned for the near future. They already mentioned the beta in their latest progress update, price will probably go up again. In its current state (28/09/2014) the game is already very enjoyable, so buy it now while it's still in it's alpha pricing $20.PSI only started to play the game on Steam recently, my actual playtime should be more than 100 hours, maybe way more, I don't keep track realy :)			"

								Kenshi is pretty fun, once you get into it. There is plenty of RPG-like qualities to Kenshi. A number of startup scenarios/ character equipment loadout, can push you towards certain playstyles:   Wanderer is the basic default character.   Settlers begin with a group of different characters together, along with building materials to start your own town.  My personal favorite has to be the Ninja/Thief: the game starts you off as a ""Hungover"", pantless Thief, who has been sold into slavery while you were passed out from a night of binge drinking. In essence you need to breakout of the labor camp and steal stuff to pay off the slavers to become a free man/woman.			"

								I'm writing this for the beta version 0.91.4Now that a small part of the new world map is out I can say that this game is starting to be very fleshed out and there is more land and features to be added (diplomacy being a big one) that will make this even greater game.In the beginning you are weak, unskilled and most often alone. You will be caught stealing or end up pummeled by even lowliest of bandits or beasts. You can even starve to death or be kidnapped by slave traders if you get unlucky. In the worst case you may even end up being eaten alive.If you or whats left of your squad survive you may eventually develop to become strong adventurers, skilled thieves or rich enought traders to hire mercenary squad to protect youself. Eventually you may be able to set up a base of your own where you can farm your own food (if animals don't eat it and you're able to kill them), build walls around it and craft your weapons and armor.I recommend this for anyone interested in a survival game in a fantasy world with added RPG elements.

Early Access Review
								Within the cesspool of Early access rubbish we get over the recent years, the ugly cash-ins and depressing situations whereby a game is never fully released ever.. Comes this little gem in a desert of emptiness that is Kenshi.Honestly I don't even know where to start. So I shall just wing this. Been playing it for awhile now, a long while and I honestly feel this deserves my personal recommendations to anyone who loves this genre. Let us get down to it, firstly with the cons of the game.1. There's barely any story.Over time, more and more things are added, dialogue bits and now little things here and there, but in a story perspective, it's still very little. Things are getting more fleshed out overtime so we will see things get better in that regard.2. Can still be a bit buggy.It's still early access, things are being added, things get glitchy after being added, balancing still needs some tuning but all is to be expected. Stable version is as expected more stable. (The trespassing of property still needs some work!)2. No multiplayer.This is a single player game, I'm only putting this here for two reasons. One, multiplayer would be quite awesome. Two, I'm lacking of cons to write!Now for the pros of this game.1. Very well done sandbox.It is a sandbox through and through.. You can do almost anything within the game mechanics limitations. You can kill anyone, you can steal from anyone, you can just be a trader, you can essentially be many things or nothing at all! Hell you can even build your own city!2. Combat is straight forward and fun too.Straight forward in the sense you click, and you attack, kind of like diablo without any skills. But your attacks are all sweeps and it's range is dependant on weapon of choice. big♥♥♥♥♥weapon slows you down, slows down your attacks but you hit more people with each swing! Your defense/offense/dodge all grow as you fight more! Your strength grows if you keep carrying heavy stuff! 3. Skills!All your skills grow with more usage! The more you do the same thing the better you are at it in most cases. Though contribuiting factors come into play. Your speed is slowed down by weight, your strength grows by carrying heavy things.. Your offense gets better the more you attack, the defense gets better the more you defend, ectera!4. Choices.A plethora of choices for you to pick, all of which comes around. Do you want to be purely a trader and rely on hired guards? By all means! Do you wanna be a warrior of the lands, heroically killing bandits!? Or become a bandit yourself! All of which requires some kind of sacrifice. A trader sacrifices the money to hire in trade for their safety through the lands. A warrior needs to go through a lot of training to get anywhere decent! And an army of bandits = bad news anyway. In the end you can sort out your group of folks for some to be good at something and others to be good at other things!5. Survival.It is hard, the world is harsh. Wild animals will kill you, bandits will kill you, all of that adds up. But you may not die when you get defeated! You have a blood pool, and every limb has an amount of damage you can take. If you were completely healthy, 90% of the time you don't die, you just pass out. To which you can play dead, or wake up and make a run for it! Just becareful of animals, slavers or cannibals. Animals will nom on you like cannibals. Slavers will enslave you! Training is crucial, so is running! But you can check out the guides for more details! 6. Mods and modding kit!I'm always supportive of mods and modding communities, they make the game different with mods and you can pick whatever mods to suit your game! :DAll in all it's an amazing game that proves there's hope in the industry for something cool to come out! :D "

								One of the best sandbox Squad Based RPG's ever made. I've put over 200+ hours into this game so far and I feel like I'm just getting started!In Kenshi, you start out by yourself or with a few others (depending on your game start), hungry, and alone in one of the largest hand crafted game worlds I've ever seen. Your first priority is to find food. Steal it, hunt for it, or trade for it. Encounter a vast population of creatures some of which are docile, and others who are aggressive and will eat you! With currently over 30 factions some larger than others, all who have their own personalities and goals. The Holy Nation hates any non-human race. Be prepared to fight their enslavement if you are of another race in their territory. Travel to the swamplands, and find yourself battling Swamp Ninjas, and other factions fighting to control the area. Travel to the far south, and encounter mercenaries that will rough you up if you don't pay them.Hire new companions, equip them with weapons and armor, and train their fighting skills to survive in this world.Become a slaver. Capture enemies, and sell them as slaves. Slavers will slave you if they find you knocked out, and you are forced into slavery until you escape.Become a warrior/ninja, conquer all who oppose you or die in the attempt.Become a bounty hunter, and find bounties worth a lot of money and bring them to justice.Become a thief, and steal from everyone. Get caught stealing, and get thrown in prison. Escape prison, and become wanted. Fight off bounty hunters that will eventually hunt for you.Become a farmer, and sell produce, or illegal goods to other factions. Get caught smuggling into a city and you'll go to jail.Build multiple bases anywhere! Choose from a large amount of buildings, do research to build new buildings and items. Craft your own weapons and armor. Create high walls with turrets to protect your base from attacks from rival factions.Or:You can do all of the things I listed in the same game. You can do whatever you want, but be prepared for the consequences!Kenshi is truely a unique, and remarkable game that deserves your money.			"

								Man I hate this game, It's soo good I can't stop playing... there is so much depth to Kenshi that no video or review will ever do this game justice.If you are on the fence about buying Kenshi and consider yourself to have a medium level of patience, just go ahead and do it.. you won't be sorry.Make no mistake... Kenshi is a hard mistress, she will beat and enslave you... a lot, She will starve you and steel all your♥♥♥♥♥♥when you're laying there dying... a lot, She will surround your small outpost with religeous fanatics who will call all your females harlots and require them to perform ""special"" services in their temples... a lot.But hey, what doesn't kill you can only make you stronger right? - and that's where this game shines for me, knowing that while all this crap is raining down on you that your revenge is going to be ah so glorious... if you survive.Lastly, I have to mention the Devs at Lo-Fi are amazing and the support they offer the (also amazing) Moding community here is exceptional "

								Kenshi is a massivly open world RTS/RPG hybrid that brings to the RTS genre what I've always wanted to have.  I have been following the progress of this game for a long time now and I can tell you the developer is not giving up on this game.  In fact, the game has grown from beiing produced by a one man team for the first 6 or more years (Chris The Great A.K.A. Captian Deathbeard) to a full fledged indie studio.  Progress has picked up a lot recently with the new AI, Creatures, and a new World Map 4X bigger than the current one (which is massive already) with much much  more than just the desert and mountains biomes we have now.  Each character in your crew levels up differently, has their own inventory and skill levels and can be fully controlled seprately.  You can fight stuff, start a village, mine things, research new buildings and things to put in buildings, keep training your men (or an awesome team of Charlie's Angle style girls with a mysterious leader who they've never seen like I did).  Your village can grow into a massive city through tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of work, but it's all worth it in the end.  Have a lone solider or command an army of unstoppable awesomeness (or sexiness).  Don't let the low number of hours fool you, I must have had over 100 hours on the pre-steam alpha release.  I haven't been playing it too much lately mostly because I'm going to do a brand new start when the new massivly updated map comes into beta in the summer, and the fact that there is currently an annoying random crash bug that happens when wandering far distances, so keep hitting F5 to autosave every few minutes.  Those things aside, this game is definately worth $20 and I suggest you get it now because I have a feeling when the new map comes out this summer, the price might raise to $25-$30.  I got it when it was $10 and it was the best 10 bucks I've ever spent online.   Just remember to have patience, and death is permanent.			"

								Great for those that enjoy a true sandbox RPG with plenty of swordfighting and a large amount of city-building available.Updating this review now that I have more time dedicated to write it.This is going to be a very patchwork comparison of Kenshi to other games that a potential buyer may, or may not, already own, and I will detail my personal experiences for you all to read, or not. :DSo, Kenshi is a squad-based RPG (think of Dawn of War 2, but each individual character in the squad has their own D&D-style character sheet) with some RTS elements (specifically the capability of building structures and researching technologies to unlock new structures, items, and upgrades) that puts a strong emphasis on open-ended gameplay (many puns to be had playing a sandbox game set in the desert).The Kenshi-verse (name of the world chosen by several members of the community, including myself) is an original creation with influences from the Edo Period in Japan (weapons and armor models are influenced by the samurai of that time, and it has been confirmed there will be no weapons relying on gunpowder or later technologies, just pure swordplay with some ranged combat and unarmed combat to come in the future).You, as a new player, get to choose from one of multiple starting points (i.e. a trader, retired soldier, etc.), and each starting point essentially grants the player a specific character(s) that have certain advantages and disadvantages.Keep in mind that there is a very strong emphasis on open-ended gameplay, so any of these starting points can be molded and shaped to create the character(s) that you will enjoy most.Regardless of the starting point chosen, your character will start at, or close to, rock bottom with little more than a rusty blade and the clothes on your back.The point of this is that your character(s) will grow and gain experience in the numerous skills and attributes (the # of skills and attributes currently available (17) appear to be about half of what is planned for the final release) by performing activities that are related to that skill.Things such as carrying a heavy load or swinging a heavy weapon in combat will improve your Strength, whereas wielding a lighter weapon will increase Dexterity.Even at the farm, crafting weapons/armor, picking locks, or simply running laps around town will increase their corresponding skills (btw, each of these actions I listed apply to unique skills).Once your starting point is chosen, you are then introduced to a rather in-depth character creation screen.This character creation screen allows you to choose either gender as well as modify hair, eyes, skin, muscle tone, height, weight, girth, bust, and most importantly, facial hair.After creating your character, it is possible to find an NPC called the Plastic Sugeon (should be at least 1 in every NPC town) that will allow you to modify any character in your squad using this character creation screen (it goes without saying this emphasizes the sandbox part even more).After you're satisfied with your character, then explore the Kenshi-verse to your heart's content!I say this because the current world (which is nothing but desert) has been confirmed to be less than 1/4 of the actual Kenshi-verse, AND this new world map is currently in the works as I am typing this.Some basic control shortcuts to help new players get started:Shift+LMB stack of multiple items = Allows player to pick up whole stacks of itemsHold RMB over any character = Brings up a list of all the actions that can be performed on this character (NPC or PC)The rest of the basic controls are either given to you at the start of gameplay or can be found, and rebound, in the Options -> Controls menu.Another HUGE part of Kenshi that I haven't even touched yet is modding.Kenshi has been developed from its core to allow extensive modding so that each player can have an even more unique experience.To my knowledge, there are mods available that:Add new weapons/armor to the Kenshi-verseAdd dialogue, and dialogue trees, to NPCs (which bring a large variety of things from quests to mercenaries, and I think its also possible to edit existing dialogue to read in other languages)Add structures to Kenshi and modify their functional components (things such as a structure's capability to receive an item to Input and produce an Output from it or to allow the mass Storage of a certain item)Modify components of NPCs in various ways (things such as # of bandits in each squad, add entire NPC towns, change ownership of an existing town from one faction to another)Among many, many other mods that have already been produced by the Kenshi community.There are also numerous, well-detailed tutorials available for any user to learn how to mod Kenshi in less than a day's worth of time.Anyone that has read this far should go to:www.lofigames.comand check out all of the information available there.Be sure to click on the Roadmap tab at the top to see everything that is planned and when it will be implemented.Oh, and you should totally join in the conversations on the Forums (I'm on there a lot ;D).Chris, THE dev and programmer of Kenshi, also posts regular updates to his twitter page as well as screenshots at:www.twitter.com/lofigames "

								As much as I want to like this game, after so many years in development and the current state it's in I'm done hoping. The idea is great and the style is there, but that's where it's ended and stayed practically from the get-go.Let's face it - Kenshi has been in development for about 10 years now and it's still riddled with issues. Crashes, poor UI, lack of versatility (can't even change font size), and instead of working on these basic issues the devs re-design the entire map, which is arguably no better than the original. I know the dev team is tiny, if not just one person, and they are consistently working on the game, but after such a long time in development I was hoping to see some polish. Instead it feels just like when I first bought it.Suggestion to the dev(s) - I'm sure the money must be drying up now and this suggestion is probably very late, but money makes money and you have to invest to do business. Hire someone else that's good at what you're not, or you are never going to finish this game.			"

								Look, you either like open-ended, experimental sandbox games or you don't. If you do, you'll be able to look past this game's bugs and its current lack of content. If you don't, stop reading and go back to COD. Contrary to what some other reviewers are saying, this game is updated regularly, but you might have to opt in to the unstable build to see it. They've also been working on an entirely new world map which is due out soon. Over the past year they've added animals, slavery, formations, a new race, and many other systems and features, not to mention improving the pathfinding dramatically. The game is very different from when I purchased it a couple years ago and I think it shows a ton of promise.			"

								I've been following this game since before it was even on Desura, and I was excited for the longest time. I waited and waited and waited for significant changes to the playability of the game and have had a lot of fun in Kenshi. Sadly, after so many years I have to say that I do NOT recommend this game. Until the creator decides that fixing longlasting bugs and upgrading the animations, graphics, and UI are more important than adding broken features like slavery and thievery, I will continue to not recommend this game. The fact that he has made so much less progress on this game than others I have followed for the longest time is honestly depressing.I don't know if this game will ever reach the potential I hoped it would. Stay away.			"

								So.. Kenshi.I've been following this game for a while now that I completely forgot that it existed and also forgot how long I've been waiting on this game.I remember a time when the game was bugged when your desert turned into grass for some odd reason, weirdly deformed bodies using the character editor, green American football-looking gear as armor and even using building blueprints as walls because walls didn't exist.So how is it now? Amazing. This game now looks bloody amazing when I had a look, the desert looks a lot like a proper desert now. There's better buildings to construct, its got better stability and less bugs. You can steal, build proper fortresses, hire many more squad members into your empire. Heck, there are even animals in the game added in.The gameplay itself is.. A little bit repetitive(Note: only a little). You charge a bandit down, watch the fight, get absolutely smashed, get back up again, then charge a different bandit until you get strong enough to beat them down. However, this is not the whole game. In Kenshi, there are quests to do, stuff to loot, civilians to save from cannibals, cities to pillage, robbing dying people in the desert then patching them up etc. There's plenty of things to do, you just have to decide which ones you want to do. It's free-roam after all.Now this game isn't complete yet and even if it is has less bugs that doesn't mean it doesn't exist but it at least means there's still progress within the game. The developers take their time in this and I admire them for taking it slow, albeit a bit too slow. But the fact that I still see progress in 4? 6 years? is simply a testament to the love they have for the game and developing a game itself.Seriously, thank you, for being one of the Early access games that I've bought and still not abandoned after all this time.P.S. I voted this for the 'I thought this game was cool before it won an award' award on this. Partly, the reason why I made a review just now. :P			"

								Where to start. I can honestly say Kenshi is an addiction for me. It just keeps pulling me back in. The devs have taken the effort to keep this game user firendly all through the development and updates by providing an import feature. Even with the addition of the new world I was able to import and to this day I am still running the same squad I started with countless moons ago.Yes, it is early access.Yes there have been times where It has been very frustrating because I need my Kenshi fix but the latest patch crashes on game start. ( usually fixed very quickly and often even on weekends)Yes the optimization is pretty poor depeneding on the in game viewpoint. (Top down view runs fairly smooth on my rig while traveling across the map)Yes there are issues that come and go regarding AI pathing and implementation of the crafting tasks.BUTIs there anything I just mentioned that you wouldn't expect from an Early Access game?The devs always keep a stable branch available that you can play if the experimental branch is too annoying for your tastes.The modders have done a fantastic job of filling in with content that that hasn't been implemented or has changed, sometimes not for the better during  development.it IS difficult and testing of your faith in the beginning. There is no hand holding and your character is no born hero. Just a lowly Joe and everyone will hurt you. But that's the hook. As your character begins to grow and learn there is great satisfaction when you take down the first bully and take all his s**t for your personal use.Satisfaction building your first outpost building.Satisfaction when your researcher discovers a new technology.Satisfaction when your armorsmith or weaponsmith finally creates a noteworthy item.Satisfaction when you complete the last wall and lock your base gate feelling you have created a secure home for your squad.I say this because none of it will come easy and after all of the hours invested you begin to care for your squad. They have worked to become something possibly great and when they get hurt there is a real feeling of anxiety when a member is on the verge of death, laying unconcious and being eaten alive by cannibals or local wildlife.It has been a long drawn out process and the development still continues. There is no story, you become what you choose. Befriend factions, make enemies with entire factions, your choice.If you like long term gameplay (like Eve online) where there is no quick win and you  take pride in what you can achieve over many, many hours then I say by all means it's worth every penny.  If you have no patience and are easily pushed to rage quit, then please purchase to support the devs for ME! and play something else. hahaGood Luck in the world of Kenshi "

								This is probably one of the most unique games on steam because of the endless choices given to the player and the amount of reward and punishment that come with each choice, I'll give a few examples:-If you decide to hone your combat skills choose carefully who you pick your fights with, the stronger your oponent is the faster you will gain on skill, infact losing the fight will make you tougher and stronger than winning it, but this is not always the smarter choice since the world is filled with cannibals, slavers and monsters that prey on laying bodies, so getting knocked out sometimes means you will lose more than the fight (kidnapped,chained,sold off, eaten alive, etc).-If you decide to settle down and build a base learn who and what roams around the territory where you build, you might get harassed by racist/sexist factions who want to take your non-human and female workers as slaves and will raid you if you don't cooperate, or you might have bandits and monsters trashing your gates and slaughtering your workers and farms constantly. (this made me rage quit a few times, but it is so rewarding when you finally get to stand on your own and hunt down all these mother***ers.)-If you become a trader and make enough cats(ingame currency name) you can hire really powerful mercenaries to act as bodyguards to keep your business clean, and have a slave serve you some homemade sake and rum at the commodity of your tower while someone else run your bar, shop, armory or whatever business you own.-If you just want to live as an adventurer and explore the world you might find hidden ruins with unique treasures and weapons that sell for insane prices or an outpost at the ends of the world owned by some most wanted criminal that has an outrageous bounty on his head.The list goes on but is hard to describe everything you can do in this game because it is almost up to your imagination, mechanic-wise it has few limitations. I started the game in 2013-14ish but it became unplayable because of the constant crashes, now that the crashing and most of the bugs are gone the game it's starting to show it's true potential,  if you are a fan of this type of game you are missing on a lot even though it's still on beta. The game has a steep learning curve, I recommed watching some of the recent tutorials and gameplay videos on youtube because those on steam are outdated and don't even show half of the things you can do in the game mechanic-wise.

								0.92 version patched ---the current versionKenshi is a different kind of game. It's a a squad based survival type game in a different land. Players can start in different game options but the main idea is to aquire other squad mates ( 30 Max. More with mods ), train is skills, research new technologies, build bases, farms, ore processors *er* processers, make weapons, armor, clothing....etc. You can even build booths for NPC's to buy your stuff. And of course new technologies mean new buildings and things to make. All the while, their are various factions that are either neutral to you or are trying to kill you. Combat is realtime with small battles up to huge armies (well like hundreds * w/ mods*). Various body parts can become injured and it will have a real effect ie. leg badly damaged? your character limps..arm nearly cut off? it dangles on your body. Your characters will lose conciousness before dying and depending on the severity of the wounds may just bleed out. However someone may heal you or pick up your unconcious body. This may be a bad thing. See, there are slavers and cannibals. If slavers capture you, you'll be hauled off to the nearest city and put in a cage, or forced to join another groups faction (as a slave). If cannibals capture, you will also be put in a cage...but they plan on eating you. Its not game over here in either scenario as you may be able to pick the lock and sneak out of the cage and make a run for it. Better find some food though, your characters can and will starve. A neat graphic here is if your character starts to starve...you will start to see the physical effects on them...ie ribs start showing, arms and legs start to get skinny...Now keep in mind you may have many characters, so if one gets hauled off to a slave camp, your other characters can go free him. Also characters can be assigned jobs, which the AI handles quite Nicely. A farmer may plow a field put the farmed material (there are several things you can grow) in a container, obtain water from a well, water the crops, and resume farming if there are still plants to be reaped. And thats just one job. Impressed? Thats not even close to all you can do in Kenshi.As read my review I realize I sound like a DEV of the game. I can assure you I most certainly am not. I am not exaggerating one iota about the tons of stuff you can do.Note: Kenshi has been in development for a long, long time. I have had this game for over 2 years. Things didn't always work right. Because of this there are some bad reviews. But I encourage anyone who played in the past to pick up on it again. Gone is that slow laggy game, replaced with a smooth as silk gaming experience. Still lags when changing regions though.The one negative comment I have is there is no verbal dialogue. It's not terrible or anything but it makes the world kinda flat. Now I'm 50 years old so of course I've played tons of great games with no dialogue. It's just a wish of mine to enhance the world. Also quest would be nice, but I LOVE sandbox games.I STRONGLY reccomend this game. It's really fun and different and coming together nicely now. For me 9/10.So thats it. I'm going back to the land of Kenshi now.....Cheers all			"

								I've been waiting on this game to become playable for like 4 years now. The developer obviously has never had any clear direction in mind for this game. It's just a case of throwing random♥♥♥♥♥♥together into one hideous abomination. There is no consistency to anything in this game. None of the features feel like they work well together. You start the game and immediately ask yourself ""Okay, what is there to do?"" I still don't have an answer for that. Build a house I guess? But why bother? Get money maybe? Oh that way I can get that one expensive sword at the shop. To do what with? Oh, kill the same old bandits you've been seeing right from the start that use the same old rusty pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥swords.Kenshi never progressed from feeling like a tech demo into feeling like an actual game. There is no feeling of progression in this game. There are no goals that feel worth working towards. None of it is satisfying. There's no point to anything. This is not a sandbox game, it is a tech demo at best.			"

								Not a full review just a few words.IF and when this game leaves development I will give a solid review.I have played Kenshi for nearly 130 hrs.. The game has a great foundation, several mechanics that could become inovative in their form and a nack for me to continue to check the developers progress. Unfortunatly, the progress is far and quite few between. I will have to no longer recommend this product to anyone who would be interested until the game reaches something beyond an alpha state.My personal message to the developer: I tip my hat to you and want to thank you for your work on putting this project together. If I am not mistaken, I belive you were the only dev for the game for the greater part of the game coming to life and that in itself is a feat. Keep it up man and show us a major benchmark!-EDIT- 20160120Beta... Soon (TM)... Seriously, this sounds interesting and I am very interested to see the deployment of Kenshi Beta!			"

								Allow me to say this: If you do NOT have a large amount of patience, this game is not for you, at least not yet.Kenshi is a wonderful game, I've sunk days and days of my time into this Early Access, and I love it. The feeling of being horribly puny in a world that seeks to better itself , and then becoming strong enough to crush the world is a feeling only comparable to doing the same thing in your everyday life. That is Kenshi. You write your story, you act it out. Crush your opposition, or bankrupt their pocketbooks? Annihalate the bandits, or help them take over cities? You are, or will, be asked these questions over and over.Another of the great things about Kenshi is that it takes the motto of Urbanprophet; Unfair, Random, Brutality; and takes it to the next level. The game is exceedingly Unfair. You will probably lose men. That one-man army you really want to be? Well, he's lying on the ground, dying slowly after being attacked by 30 bandits. It's a painfully wonderful experience. It is Brutal, the enemies do not go easy on you- You just killed those Samurai's buddies? The entire faction wants you dead now, and you have armies of some of the strongest people in the game after you. Oh, now you can watch your 12 man squad rot slowly on the dusty desert. It is Random. No two people are the same unless they're twins or you made them that way. Every combat experience is utterly random. Yes, there's SOME consistency, as a soldier with 40 combat skill and 40 Defense skill probably won't get taken out by a couple of hungry bandits, but lucky hits DO happen. It can be frustrating to see that up-armored beast get KO'd by some thugs with sticks, but even SAS Operatives get shot by untrained Guerillas. You almost have to be a masochist to play Kenshi. Almost.Unfortunately, the game is consistently buggy, whether it be from minor graphics glitches caused by saving/loading, upto pathing issues that can be game-breaking. It's painful to be forced to watch your men die on the sands, and the fact that the game can't recognize your men are all pretty much dead and allow you to start a new game is a little offensive. The lack of a ""Return to Main Menu"" button is a little disconcerting in itself.In addition to that, it lacks a lot of diversity in its content. The ""Music"" is virtually nonexistent. It almost makes it difficult to want to play the game. Almost. Weaponry and Armor for your characters has a distinctly Asian flair, but doesn't deviate far from that. Combat animations are virtually the same for all people and weapons, and Melee combat is currently all there is. You buy Mercenaries. You kill things. You might even build a base. It's easy to become disillusioned if you aren't patient, or a good role-player.At the moment, the one game I can compare this to is a 3D Version of Caravaneer, without guns, and that is a very good thing. What the developer here tries to pull off is an extensive trade network with fluctuating prices; towns that have surplus stocks and will pay desperately with whatever they can to get what they're on a shortage of. That doesn't happen.Despite all of its flaws, Kenshi is a masterpiece. While dated in its mission, lacking in content, and occasionally utterly monotonous, Kenshi delivers the ultimate RPG experience that even real life cannot give you: The chance to write your own story, completely unfettered by society. The only problem you have left to figure out is: Do you cut your path into the ground, do you line it with the ruins of empires, do you gild it with coin, or do you merely walk it? It's upto you to write the story; it's upto you to buy and play Kenshi.			"

								Kenshi is a refreshing, challenging, and unique sandbox game where there is no main story, no main character, and certainly no friends. That is, unless you make those things happen. But to create that story blood, sweat, and tears must be shed for the bustling town that you build from the ground up or the greatest warriors the land has ever seen to be created. The first few hours of this game are hard, very, very hard. You typically start off with rough spun pants, a medkit, a few hundred Cats (the currency), and a stick in a city within the wasteland. And off you go. No tutorial, no hand holding, no direction as to what you should or can do. There are certainly in-game Help menus you could look through, but you yourself have to discover how to make money for food, where you should avoid going, and how best to survive in a wasteland where you're nothing more than another grain of sand in the dessert, just as easily treaded over, discarded, and forgotten. You can't even kill a lone animal, much less another person, for survival. At least initially. Kenshi is a game where stories, your stories, are made. There are no scripted events, no unkillable NPC's, and plenty of random events that you encounter travelling the wasteland for adventures to happen. I left my base once to explore, found a ruin, almost got killed in it, half my squad limping away carrying the other half of my unconscious, but alive, team. Limping home through a forest before Bam! I got attacked by twenty or so cannibals and somehow, by some miracle, held them off with my wounded, conscious members. The moment when the walls of my base rendered on my screen was filled with so much joy, relief, and amazement that everyone somehow made it back alive still makes me shake my head in disbelief that a game made me experience that.This game is all about growth and development, discovery and adventure, survival and death. It does a remarkable job of invoking the doubts involved with exploring the unknown. Everytime I send out an expedition with enough food and supplies to last a week or more to bring back new trade items or rare treasure I worry whether or not everyone, or anyone at all for that matter, will make it back alive. I don't know what I'll find, what I'll encounter, and if the journey will be worth it. And that's an incredible feeling.This game is still being developed and still has tons of things to improve, but what they have now is a fun, albeit challenging and buggy, squad based, sandbox game where it's you and the world. Is Kenshi, an Eary Access game, worth the $20? Having played almost 52 fun, stressful, amazing hours at the moment of writing I'm very much inclined to say yes, absolutely. A good chunk of time has to be invested to actually experience everything Kenshi currently has to offer and considering that the game isn't even complete yet pleases me, knowing that there's that much more for me to discover.

								I bought this game in 2014. I played it for a little bit, but I couldn't really get into it, and it seemed that the devs had gone awol so I stopped.last weekend I was feeling really burnt out on my go to games and wanted something new, and I spotted Kenshi in my game library. Kenshi was that game that I really regretted buying, but I held on to a hope that I would one day get my money's worth out of it. With this in mind I decided to see if such a day has come, and started her up. I no longer regret getting this game. The devs are updating it, a community has gathered behind it, and it's gameplay is absolutley golden. I've gotten used to the graphics, and even kinda like em now(objectively they are crappy though) and the interface could use some improvement. Once you get used to the controls, and begin to see how things work in this unique world the devs have created, the rough edges start to fall away.I've never been one to write reviews, but I felt that I needed to share because there are definitely alot of people like me who picked this up in the earlier days and abandoned it to what we thought was going to be a silent death. If you are one of those fellows I recommend you give the game another try.			"

								If Mad Max, Samurai Champloo, and The Dark Tower had a weird kid that ran around shirtless with nothing but a rusty katana and an empty stomach, then it would be this game.The setting is unique, taking place in a varied post-apocalyptic enviroment that's soon to be expanded with a shiny new map. Combat is dangerous and every encounter has the potential to be your last. Numerous factions have their wars and alliances, and you can participate if you want, or just loot the corpses like a gross human vulture that has no honor.The problem with the games are thus: The engine isn't the best in the world, so graphically it's rather unimpressive, however the artists have done a great job with worldbuilding and locations look unique enough that graphical limitations don't hinder the game at all. Another possible gripe is that the early game's combat is very, very hard. You will be knocked out for most of your time with Kenshi without proper preperation. It's stupid to brave the wasteland alone, you aren't the Dragonborn; you're Jeff from accounting who's decided to become a vagrant warrior with little to know chance of survival. That being said, a larger party and training vis a vie the practice dummies can make combat easier.All in all Kenshi has been developed slowly over a long period of time, and it's clear the developers have put love into their game. Updates are progressing steadily and adding in new content and features. Kenshi's a good game now, but it'll be a great game when it gets released.			"

								I don't write reviews, infact this is the only one i've done or probably will do because this is my favorite game on steam.Pros:-The ability to customize units is what sold me on this. I've always loved being able to make my own stories and characters within a game and it works well in this.-There is always a new story to tell with your character(s). Example: Getting kidnapped by cannibals and barely escaping(if at all), then building/training an army and taking your revenge on them.-You can mod the game, however it isn't the most straight foward and there are not too many made for it yet. You can find some on the nexus, if you know what you are doing.-Updates. The makers of this game DO release updates and patches even if they do take a while, adding new content that stack layers of gameplay. If you do some research you can see the guy who made this game loves it and truely wants to see it finished (even hired more people to help build it).Cons:-Like I said, the updates can take a long time to come out but they do.-Some people experience bugs and crashes while others do not.-Once you get your characters up to a certain level in combat it may become a little too easy. However, they are adding new stuff to keep it challenging.If you enjoy these games you may enjoy this one:X-com, Age of Empires, Mount and bladeOver-all I give this game a 8.5/10 in the experimental beta build. Like a fine wine, it gets better with time.			"

Having said THAT, I just cant stop playing it! If you are on the fence just wait and see what it becomes.

								As an owner of this game for nearly two years I can say that it has come a LONG WAY from when I purchased it. I rarely write reviews but after reading the negitive ones below I felt compelled to add my two cents. While development has been slow, it has been consistent. For me I purchased this game because I liked the concept and I wanted to support its development, not because I wanted to play it (yet!). I would say that while buggy, the game is fully playable now, and really stands apart from any other game I have played. If you enjoy a CHALLENGING RPG/Open world steam punk sim, and you want to support the developers who tackled this very ambitious project, then BUY IT!			"

								This is a great game, I understand some of the basics but it would be easier to play with a few more instructions or tutorials. I've had this game for almost a year I think but it seems like out of all the other games I play, I would rather play those. This game need a few minor bugs fixed and needs to have a few more additions to it that capture players into playing it more. Other than this I don't really have anything bad to say about it. This game is unique and creative but like I said, there needs to be a few more ways to seem interesting to more people. "

								This game...I have lost 18 hours within 2 days to this game so far, and no change in the pattern in the foreseeable future.Its intensely hard and unforgiving. Fierce battles and insane slavers and cannibals. Most of the situations you will get into are outside your control.This game ****s me... just the way i like it.			"

Though if you dislike a game with a medium learning curve you'd have to dump that habit and have patience with this game, because this game, Kenshi, is a game worth playing.			"

								Well Ive been playing this for a few days and I love the game, as long as it works. It bugs out 70% of the time.I understand its an alpha game. Its been six years, so I figured Id try it out.The experimental mode is very unstable and game over before you can get too far in your quests.I don't recommend getting this game until they do more work on it. Not playable in my opinion.Lots of hoping and wishing here because this game has a lot of potential.			"

								It was "" 29 Oct, 2013 @ 12:07pm "" when I created my review on the game, I praised it with such adoration but times change and thanks to the sales it has been brought to my attention. My first question is; why hasn't this game been completed yet? I shall now answer my own question with: it is because of you, the loyal customer, only you the ones who have been active in the forum have interfered with this game being completed the way it was intended. How? You ask? People like to demand that the developers include everything under the sun they desire, pointless trivial things such as 'race' and I recall someone mentioned 'hot-air balloons' and so on and so forth. Let us all remind ourselves that this is a post-apocalyptic world that thrives because of its realism, now then, I've had this game since it came out and I am certain this game was never supposed to go down the road of 'races' and the mystical such. If you are angry that this game is not complete like I am, it is because of said developers not having a clear focus and an active forum. Now I am not saying it is a bad thing that the developers are allowing their customers to influence the game I mean, we paid for it, we should be allowed to have a say, yes that is good practice but what annoys me is when the game starts to spin off into a half complete spiral of forever being at 50% because people keep asking for 'cool' stuff and as a result unforseen bugs occur that require manhours to fix which all builds up and here we are. Now they have added cannibals, and I think great, something to keep the player focused on their...well, squad I guess, this might have been a player-suggested idea although from the general feel of the game when I had first made my review I could have predicted a group as such existing. My only main issue, is that the game often finds itself struggling to balance the micro-management aspect and the combat aspect of the game, for example, at the beginning of the game, you are by your own (assuming you picked either the merchant or the default spawn), you have to survive and learn, you lure some bandits into a city they get violently murdered and you sell their stuff, get some more squad members, rinse and repeat, it's great fun, I'm sure each player would agree. THEN we are tempted into creating our own city.The city building is a fun aspect but it simply becomes a process of just sitting on your♥♥♥♥♥♥staring into nothing watching your members work away for hours on end until you travel back to sell your wares, remember that there are bandits, end up having to sacrifice a slower member for the 'greater good' and then get back into the combat aspect, bored of base building. All-in-all I'd still actually suggest that you buy this game but just don't expect too much clarity in where this game will end up.  "

								In 2016 I can safely say that abandoned games get updated at a faster rate. You know those games that sound very, very good? Kenshi is one of those games. Unfortunately, Kenshi has sounded very good for a long time now and hasn't actually had much added to it. You'll spend most of your time watching a character walk from place to place while keeping the game on fast forward. But perhaps the combat is redeeming, you say? Nope, you fast forward that too. In fact, there's very little reason to not just play this game on fast forward the entire time. It's basically a watching simulator. But the fun doesn't end there. The forums are rather heavily censored and anything that isn't praise toward the developers is deleted and followed by a ban. As of now, I don't think people who don't own kenshi can even post there. This is clearly just an attempt to censor the forum more heavily.So, why should you consider kenshi? Well, if you like games that have been in development for years with minimal progress it's right up your alley! If you like games where you hit an endgame with almost nothing to do it's perfect as well!And if you go to the forum for tips you'll be told to ""make your own game(Within kenshi)."" Yup, the consistent suggestion on the forum is to make your own little game, with your own rules and a load of artificial difficulty that you impose on yourself.  The reason for this is, of course, that there's absolutely nothing else to do. You make a little base, get a few guys, and that is it. That is completion of the game. It's not even a matter of ignoring a bunch of features. That is all the features right now(and has been for a very long time).			"

								TL;DR: Yes.As of this current day (2nd of March, 2017), I can honestly say Kenshi is worth it, after a long period of ""not quite there yet"". But for the love of everything that is good and decent, INSTALL THIS GAME TO AN SSD! Seriously! The loading times and the general performance are still awful!I've been game since the 0.2x alpha, can't exactly remember which exact version, but it was the one before the first foliage update. Back then, the game was pretty barebones. All you could do was to wander around beating bandits or the members of bigger factions up, until your character became a god of war. The game had so much potential, but little to do in terms of diversity. The game also crashed constantly, the pathfinding was abysmal and everything was generally clunky and frustrating, so I couldn't really recommend the game.Now, the performance is still crap, the pathfinding is still occasionally annoying (although much more tolerable than what it used to be) and everything is still quite clunky. But the game has so much to offer, it packs in so many great details, and it's all-around a completely unique experience!Kenshi is an RTS sandbox, with relatively heavy emphasis on RPG elements, one which absolutely doesn't hold your hand with pillow-padded tutorials and scaling levels of enemies. It drops you to a cold, incredibly merciless and unforgiving world, where your survival, a pathetic little weakling that you are, is tough! You need food, you need weapons, you need armor, you need a MUCH higher skills to do anything, you need allies... even the lowliest of bandits will beat your starting character with ease, and don't except any kind of one-on-one action, as these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will outnumber you ten-to-one! And when they beat you senseless, they take loot your body and take your precious food - and that's the best case scenario! If your opponent happens to be a fogman, a cannibal or a wild animal, it will probably eat you as well!But the beauty of Kenshi isn't just the magnificently cruel, beautifully crafted game world with tons of places to explore and millions of incredible little details that no other game offers, it's when you FINALLY make it! When you finally recover from the beatdown, when you finally rebuild yourself stronger, when you finally get back to those #¤%&/! bandits and shove their rusty sticks down their throats, when you finally save your tortured comrades from slavery, when you finally have a place of your own, when you finally make your base self-sufficient... that's when the game feels like an accomplishment! This trick is hard to pull off by a game, but Kenshi absolutely nails it.Unfortunately, the game isn't without its flaws. The unforgiving nature of the game can be a turn-off to some people, so if you expect a relaxing base-building game, look elsewhere. As mentioned before, the game absolutely requires an SSD at its current state, or else you can expect hideously long loading times ALL THE TIME. Some UI elements, as the game mechanisms in general, are incredibly clunky and probably will always be. But if you can look past its flaws, Kenshi is an incredible experience, one which I can definitely recommend! :)			"

								Why you should buy this game?I actually bought this game many years ago off the lofi website as i really liked the concept of what he was trying to achieve. The game had no sound. Was totally empty, but somehow seemed really cool still.Many years down the line we now have this beauty of a game! Its not what i would call a mainstream game. Kenshi is hard and if you mess up it punishes you for it. It still has some bugs yes, but there is enough content and a big enough world map to really get stuck in and explore and do what you want. There are frequent updates, usually once or twice a month that add significant content. Only half the actualy map is currently in play. Its huge, so dont worry about ever running out of things to do.Buy this game. For me, its the only early access game i have not been dissapointed in.			"

								I've had this game before it even came out on steam, it has come such a long way since then. A lot of people complain that the dev team isn't working on the game enough but the dev team is a long list of roughly 3 people last I checked, it began as a one man project so updates are slow to come out but thats because there's such a small team. The big draw to the game is seeing how far you came. When you start you are the suckiest person in the game, and there is no better feeling than seeing the character you start with be able to take on 4 guys at the same time because you know how much work you put into that character's growth. If you don't like games that require a huge amount of investment this is not for you because it takes hours to understand why the game is great. 5/7 perfect score "

You can start anywhere from a group of settlers to injured, starving, and penniless and work your way upwards from there. Unlike most games, Kenshi sees no difference between the player and NPCsYou are not The HeroEvery action has consequencesDefinetly the most underrated game in Steam.			"

								TL;DR:It's a true to the word Alpha so it crashes and there are clearly parts of the game that do not work yet. However, the greater vision for what the game will be is clear and it clearly is going to be a game of epic proportions with plenty of replayability.Full Review:The game lets you play as you wish. Want to be a BA swordsman with an elite squad of goons? Done. Want to be tader making your way through the waste lands? Done. Want to settle your own town and be the greatest blacksmith in the land? Done. Want to by a sleezy tief in the night? Done.The game has a fantastic engine that allows you level your character based on the actions he takes. If you fight a lot, he will become better at fighting. If you run around a lot he becomes a faster runner. Carry heavy things - builds strength. Unit growth is very organic, though you can also setup tasks to help power level guys as well.The main game, which is not completed yet, will allow you to effectively build your own clan. You will be able to raid other towns and even take them over. If you do not want to run your own clan with towns then you can try your hand at being a merchinary in one of the many conflicts that will going on around the map.The game is also introducing multiple races and ambient creatures that will kick your butt!!All the fun stuff aside there are some drawbacks. At the time of the post this is still very much in Alpha. The game crashes regularly, your save files become outdated or unable to be retrieved often, and your are constantly tantilzed by the features you can see but not use. For an Alpha it is pretty playable though and the dev makes balancing changes every so often so that the game remains fun to play.If you cannot handle losing your entire saved game or getting randomly kicked this is not the time to buy, wait for the proper release. If you can't wait to be a steampunk samuri in a desert wasteland then by all means get it!			"

								This is roughly how it went for me. The first 10 hours I was just running away from things and reloading, cursing at the game and wondering how you were supposed to play this if you just got jumped all the time. The next 10 hours was spent discovering things, some on my own and some from searching. I got a small group of people together and saved up several thousand working resource nodes outside the cities. Whenever I had to travel though I was just running away from things and reloading, cursing at the game and wondering how you were supposed to play this if you just got jumped all the time.Then I started to get my bearings in the game. I learned that losing is part of the experience, literally part of the experience. If you pick an even fight and don't come out on top, you've still gained big defensive stats on anyone that didn't die. At that point, about 30 hours deep into the experience, I realized I just started. Game mechanics start springing up and spider-webbing outward. Character advancement, technology research, crafting, settlement management, supply runs, training, assaults, battles, wars. Now every time I assemble my elite crew of four to the gate, I get excited that I have so many options to choose from. We go to a city, make some money, recruit more people for the town, work their strength up a little to make some more money nearby, buy some supplies and sneak them back up.The game creeps up on you and owns you with complex, interesting things to do. The mechanics, dialog, options and behavior of npcs are deep and seem very well thought out. I often find myself doing something I fully expect to result in losing something and figure out the game already thought of it and provided an option. And if you're worried there may not be enough RPG in it for you, each and every character you recruit is playable, equippable and trainable independently. The vanilla cap is I think 30 right now total recruitable, but there is a mod already that increases it to 256. Give it some time and you'll be hooked.			"

								Kenshi, holy ♥♥♥♥, where do I start with this one? Hmmm, how about my experience on my first proper playthrough(s).....I started with a new playthrough after re-installing this game yesterday, as the default wanderer. All was well, at first. I spawned in Blister Hill. I mined some iron, sold the iron to a trader in Blister Hill and got a fair amount of money doing so. I built a small outpost with a shack, farm and a well down near the river, just outside of Blsiter Hill. My crops were growing fine, I had a fair bit of money but I needed some materials, so I mined more iron and made more money in the easiest way I knew how, MINING!!! After I arrived back from Blister Hill I noticed all my crops had dissappeared, ""what?"" I thought to myself, ""How?"" I originally thought the starving bandits had knocked me over, so I replanted my crops, mined more iron, sold more iron in Blister Hill and after arriving back for the second time....my crops where missing, again. So I re-replanted them, headed to the Holy Farm to get some stuff, come back and my crops had gone AGAIN. At this point I was just baffled, ""a glitch maybe?"" I re-re-replanted my crops, waited in my shack and nothing.....then I see my character yell out ""BY OKRANS HAIRY NIPPLES"" he draws out his sword and sprints out of the shack, I pan the camera and a dozen of these rat creatures with 2 legs are eating my ♥♥♥♥ing crops. ""No match for me"" I thought, wow how I was wrong. I get completley destroyed and killed by these creatures. RIP Zan.Second playthrough, this time as a trader with a pack bull, seems fun! I spawn in some remote area with a few buildings dotted around the place, I decide to head to Blister Hill and sell my luxury goods that I spwaned with. Less than 5 minutes in, I get ambushed by cannibals, my bull gets killed and I get kidnapped. Then, the cannibal just stops walking, glitches and I am stuck like this for around 10 minutes, dying on this skinny cannibals shoulder. ""♥♥♥♥ sake, new game it is...again""RIP Bill.Third playthrough, this time as the retired army captain, ♥♥♥♥ yeah dude. I chose him due to my 2 previous characters being absolutley dreadful when it comes to combat. I spawn in The Hub, a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ full of low-lives and outlaws, I find an iron vein, so I repeat the mining method in order to get some money. I have 5 raw iron ore, I see a building just outside of The Hub, I walk in, sell my iron and buy a nice sword to go with my other one, I step out of the building and BAM, badnits do me over and loot my weapons......""This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke"" I shout out loud. Fortunatley, I recover and the traders kill the bandits, unfortuntaley the one who robbed me, took off with my swords. I loot an iron club off one of the bandits, buy some food and set off. I approach a hive village, BAM. Ambushed by cannibals and kidnapped again.....""Wow, what the ♥♥♥♥!?!!?"" I exclaim, fortunatley I am saved by these bug looking ant men, who are actually rather nice! I set up camp outside of the hive village, mine some copper, sell to the trader, make some more money and set off to greener pastures. BAM, ambushed by fogmen, kidnapped and hauled around the fog islands for about 20 minutes until cannibals attack and kill my kidnappers. I play dead, then immediatley run for the hills. I run into a cannibal, who is not attacking me. ""Talking meat?"" he says, I ask him not to eat me due to my body being diseased with plague ""STILL HAVE TO EAT"" he yells back at me, BAM, his posse attack me, kidnap me and again I am hauled around the map, knocked out cold, then, starving bandits save me! ""OMG Saved again, thank ♥♥♥♥"" I say to myself......no, the bandits then knock me out, steal my food and take off. I wake up from a recovery coma, heal myself then limp off toward Mongrel, A town located in the fog islands. I arrive, and to make more money, I mine a nearby iron source. I go to the weapons trader with my recently aqquired iron, ""OHHH a smithing machine, I'll make armour plates and get♥♥♥♥♥♥loads of money"" I work on the armour plates in the shop, then I take my armour plate, a message pops up ""Caught stealing"" I get attacked by 20+ guards and arrested for taking an armour plate that I MADE.....""♥♥♥♥. THIS. GAME.""Kenshi is a nightmare, its harder than life, harder than dark souls, but it's actually fun to play. You arent a god, you are a weak, feeble character looking to make a name for themselves, and man it is hard. The graphics are bad, the performance is awful at times due to poor omptimization but the gameplay and replayability of this game is outstanding. The world, that seems to be a mix of Japanese culture mixed in with some steam/cyber-punk aspects, has an interesting story with weird characters inhabiting it, what a strange yet good game Kenshi is.I hated this game at first, which is why I ultimatley uninstalled it a few months back. The game just needs time for you to grow attatched to it, which bizzarely, will happen. "

								Kenshi, Kenshi, Kenshi you are like a mistress on the side of real life. I wish I could put more time into you but things (work, child, fiance) keep getting in our way of eternal love. I know I keep promising that I can just leave them and we could spend the rest of our days frollicking in meadows of beautiful flowers, desert landscapes and the occasional cannibal lair. I know we could be happy together taking on adversary and even build a place we can call home from nothing but the goods we traded from our previous lives. I feel like I am at war with some holy group telling me my feelings are false and us being together serves a dark purpose. I shall enter you and end up leaving just before we get to the fun stuff while I am seen by prying eyes behind my back and whispering voices telling me this is not real and I shouldnt be spending my spare time with you. I hope you can understand that I am torn in every direction but yours as I know you do not judge me for letting you sit idle while I create false memories with people who will never understand me like you do. Maybe someone else will pick you up and have the wonderful times we have had, I would be sad to see you with someone else but happy that you get to have the adventures we have spent those dark nights dreaming of together. Kenshi if this is our last moments, I would like you to know that I rate you a solid 8/10 although I know you are currently just a bud on a bush about to blossom into a beautiful flower and will only increase in enjoyability.

								So with the latest 20 hours added to the timer, i think i get the main idea of what the game is so far, please do pay attention to the date of this review as this is to the corrisponding version, now to give a short summary, the game has bugs, it has memory leaks, so expect to restart it a few times a day if you're limited to 4 gigs of ram like me, it looks okay in graphics department, nothing amazing, but i would rather have this then games that pose the best thing in it is the graphic's, because Beautiful looking Crap is still just crap... this game poses as a Sandbox Survival RTS that i suggest you only play if you're ready for some depressing notions of racism in it's own sense... the rest will explain but for those who just want the short review, i DO suggest this game, but to a rather... certain audience...Pros:-Customization, Most RTS games just give you a set number of looks and style and that's just it, while this game HAS that, you can make ""Your"" characters look however you want, 4 races, plenty of attributes from facial to physical body, this game let's you make your team as unique as you desire.-No levels, Just skill and survival, and this can be an issue in some cases, the game has added a hunger meter (and also a mod to remove it for beginners, just look through the workshop.) and note, most things you fight one on one, WILL kill you, now note, this game has factions, and there far, other people will join the fight, if it's against you however, you may be rather... dead, in the next few seconds, you're NOT the chosen one, you're a new person in this harsh world, and you have to EARN your power the obvious ways, running around will make you run faster, carrying heavy stuff will make you stronger, taking hits will make you more durable... if you survive.-The whole world is free to Roam... Granted if it's Not Owned... i say this because this game goes on common sense in that, if it's there, you should be able to go there, BUT it also knows that, if it's someone's home... well you're not link are you? this is'nt hyrule, this is a game that makes common sense REAL common real fast, and the open world outside towns is open for more then just combat...-Base Building, want to build a town? Have the recourses, go ahead, but make sure you know this location is ideal for what your setting up, because this game won't hold your gand in this, it's either you get ahead, just get by, or get dead... and this does have it's pros, but don't think just having a place to call your own makes you safe, if fact... it can attract some... unwanted attention-Time, and Pause, this i feel is a requirement, if a game as relentless as this DIDN'T have this? well... it's a small note, but deffinitely still worth noting, it atleast let's you think about what you're gonna do next...-No Story, Exept Your's, this game has no story mode, it's you, the world, and whatever you do in it, or don't do, and quite frankly, i feel for a game like this, is a good thing.-Multiple ways to start, start with a group, or alone, start with a dog, or as a slave, or a prisoner, it give's many ways to play, most however, WILL be a challenge...-Character Value, a jack of all trades is a master of none, not to say you can't train all character's in everything, but you'll be spending a few months to try with just a couple characters... overall, this game makes you pick and choose of your own will what person will do what, by this i mean, you can have everyone fight with no healer's or anyone building a bse, BUT you will die very fast, there's also permadeath... so yeah, once they die, they're gone...And now the notes i'm affriad count against this peice...Cons:-Memory Leaks, as said before, this game has issues with even the 5required specs, after 3-4 hours, 4 gigs will be lookin... bare... and the game will lag to the point it'll be getting difficult, but then again, any game that tries this WILL run into this, so this is really more of a given...-Almost Depressing, this game can be rather... Depressing, so anyone with the idea that they can feel better from playing this game when you're in a bad mood, unless you're a masochist and even then... the game has a nation, known as the ""Holy Nation"" that hates anything and anyone who is NOT human, and will either demand you die by them on site while sparring those who are human, or just downright kill you and the other's, it gives that sense that ""Are you different? Die For it!"" that makes it kinda feel difficult to...well yeah... i'm not gonna ask them to change it by any means, i just can't recommend this for a certain audience or two...And now things that are both or neither good and/or bad that are still worth noting,Nuetrals:-Early Acess, this means the game still has a way to go before saying it's finished, so if you buy this expecting a finished game, then don't buy it until the early access catagory disappears from the named tags on this game, it's still subjected to change, be updated in major ways, and over all, it's NOT a finished game...-Bugs, i place this in nuetral because, YES it's bad, BUT they WILL be fixed, and as such as of the current time, there is a bug that annoys me a bit but i beleive it can be player fixed by rebuilding nav mesh in game, in the notion that if you put your character's in a closed space, they will stop moving and if you try to move they will go to the gate you just close and open it before moving to the designated spot...Overall, yes i recomend this game, but i would like to note, Not for it's ""Fun"" factor, because it CAN be fun, once you find a correct way to do thing's your way, there is not a ""set in Stone"" correct way to do things because this is a sandbox game in it's fullest extent, but positive and negitive are in this, if you want a challenge in sandbox survival RTS, this is the best one Iv'e found, just be ready to die if you are'nt ready to fight...

								9/10! I love this game! I am not usually one that enjoys really difficult games, but there is something about the brutal difficulty of this game that actually keeps me around. It's not like ""Oh I'm not good enough..."" kinda hard, it's more ""I need patience and dedication to prevail"" kinda hard. Basically, you start as a nobody. There are different backgrounds and starts, which I love, but I also love that the game is unforgiving. You can't just kill a group of raiders, hell, you probably can't even kill one at the start. The difficulty of this game is appropriate, and lends to the brutality of the harsh reality in which your characters live. With time, one can really succeed and have fun with this game. The challenges along the way, those are really the best part. I am a self-professed save-scummer when it comes to many games, but despite saving very often, I find myself reverting to old loads less often in this game than others. Devastating things occur to my party, but the way it happens... most of the time I just roll with it!This game features multiple ways to play, perhaps one of it's coolest features. You can get by as a lone wolf, stealing and killing while living on the run. Perhaps you yourself wish to organize a group to raid cities and farms. Maybe you wish to raise an army to do with what you please as you traverse the wastelands... in any case, you have a great deal of freedom. Basically, you can play it like a single player RPG, or more like an RTS, city builder, merchant goods management, etc. There are a few bugs, but nothing really gamebreaking. Another feature I love is that they allow you to import your old characters/buildings and so on into new versions of the game as it approaches release. There are factions in the game, and it is particularly interesting when you get involved with any of them. The factions are all unique and have interesting relationships with one another. Luring that band of bandits up to that Holy Nations City you visited may be the perfect distraction you need to rob them blind.As I mentioned before, this game is BRUTAL! My beloved characters have been enslaved, tortured/forcefully starved to death, murdered in cold blood and even eaten alive... that's right, I said EATEN ALIVE!!! Normally in games when my characters get, let's say, eaten alive, I save-scum to the save before that happened. This game encourages me to go along with the brutality though. I had a party of 17 characters or so, while running to a certain city, we were attacked. We fended off the Fog Men at first... but they kept coming... hoardes of them! All but two of my characters were left standing, carrying the wounded bodies of two other characters to safety (which in itself had my blood rushing!). As 4 of my characters got to safety, rested up and healed up, 3 were EATEN ALIVE by the Fog Men. I used what little money I had and sold everything to hire 2 more characters to join the party. We went out and managed to pick off the Fog Men that escorted our friends by setting up ambushes at tactical points. Thus far I have saved all but 1 of the captured members of my party (minus the 3 that were EATEN ALIVE), doing tactical stealth missions, solo runs and distraction assaults.Overall this game is outstanding! The aesthetic feel of it is perfect, mixing the feel of like a sumurai feudal system in the post-apocalypse. The difficulty of the game can make it a tough pill to initially swallow, but it is well worth it. The characters and races are unique (I love the Hive characters and the robotic mechanid ones, sooo cool!) Everything is fitting for the environment, nothing stands out as too high tech or too low tech. You can tell that this is the remnance of a world that once had tech, but that technology is long forgotten. There is electricity to some extent, but only what windmills and such can generate. Think Mad Max and/or Waterworld tech. Despite the brutal difficulty and the patience/sacrifice needed to succeed, I would give this game a 9/10 (as of patch 0.93 or so). I anticipate my score my go up when the game reaches full release.			"

								great game. constantly being updated with new features and huge bug fixes. you can build up a huge army or keep a small party of warriors, builders, doctors, etc and build your own city where NPC's will come and visit and buy items that you manufacture. Great game and get a lot of time out of it. I recommend looking up other reviews as well as youtube videos because it is a unique type of game, not everyone will love it.I can not recall any games being anything like this, and for that reason it offers great releif from the average game genres that can eventually get old, no matter how fun the game is. I am very much looking forward to see what new features will be added on when it reaches it's complete state, as I'm sure everything that will be added will be very new concepts and things you just don't see or do much of in other games.

								This is seriously one of the coolest games I have played.  The whole game is based around you and your sqaud, wait...  Scratch that...  This game hates you...  You aren't the biggest baddest guy in the world, you aren't going to be able to defeat an army by yourself, you can't do shiznit in this game...  Unless you work for it...The only way to get anywhere in this game is to work for it.  If you want to be the strongest man in the game, you have to train long and hard.  If you want a giant city, you have to get the resources, and build it by hand.One of the coolest parts about this game is the work mechanics.  Say you want one guy to be your engineer and build all the buildings and such.  Well, you aren't always going to be building things, are you?  No, so you set engineering as your permanent job, which means that if there is a building job going on, then he will do it.  And then his second job may be researching, so when there is no building going on, he is researching more buildings.This game may be an alpha, but I have played 25 hours and it seems like there is still more to research and build.  There is no sound, but the Torchlight 1 soundtrack sounds pretty good in the background!  So yeah, if you want a game where you aren't the biggest baddest guy in existence, get this game...			"

								loads of reviews as well as you tube videos tend to share player stories about their game. That's because Kenshi leaves the story up to you in a way many games fail to do these days.You could lead the life of a simple farmer, or rise up to warlord and face the holy nation, be a trader, slave, a bounty hunter or just a scum bag scavenger making a living off loot from the dead. It's a game you put away and come back to later on again, and for that reason alone it's worth the money.			"

								I found Kenshi to be quite the enjoyable game that you can use to immerse yourself for hours in without realising that time has actually passed. even though it is still in the alpha stages it provides the player with with challenges right from the get go no matter the starting that you choose it never fails to force the player to resort to obtaining help from the city guards in quite a number of larger scale engagements. it allows the player to travel a quite literal sandbox world finding their own goals and objectives from the singular large time bounty hunter to the creation of new settlements and factions that can be used to take over the entire world, and with it still in alpha stages the developers (Lo-Fi games) are still releasing bits and pieces of the game as they slowly make their way to obtaining their finished version, I for one am excited to see the end result from this ambitious company just knowing how good the game currently is and the possible amazing outcome that awaits it in the end. 9.5/10			"

								Kenshi took me by surprise i thought it was going to just be okay but man i love this game and have put 26 hours into it over 3 days The game has a lot of content for an Alpha like farming crafting cooking weapon and armor  smiting and a lot more to come. it is an open world squad RPG where you can build you own towns and bases. it has a cool  skill system where you person gets stronger just by walking around carrying a lot and gets faster by running more.  the game forces you to do nothing, don't want a squad you don't need one, don't want a base you don't need one!In the begging i was horrible and it took me around 3 tries to start a game where I didn't die in the first 30mins and even now i have close calls  This is by far the best Early Access game i have played!! highly recommended!!!!The developers are in touch with the community and have a clear road map, that this game will follow and its posted in the forms now Go!! look up some videos and read some more my fellow gamersI hope you will one day be wondering the sand covered dunes of Kenshi very soon			"

								TL:DR? Buy it, would lay unconcious being robbed by bandits again.As I write this I lay unconcious with my face in the desert sands after being mobbed on a lone trade run by hungry desert bandits.  They taught me not to run over burdened.Kenshi is Warband+1.It will take time to get to grips with the UI - which is improved from some of the youtube videos I watched before buying it.I'm playing it on an i5 1.8mHz laptop with nvidia 710M, and it insits on using the cruddy inel graphics card.  But this doesn;t affect gameplay for me.Returning to the desert to wait out my survival coma.  On the plus side I am not bleeding.  Though the bandits took all my inventory - including a sword which I aqquired from a samarai who was erm, sleeping face down in the desert!Love the game, give it some time.If you like warband you'll love this.  RPG/business/hack/slash.Though all I've done so far is get beat up and turn in a dying man for a bounty :)			"

								Kenshi is a fun game, but there are a few deal-breakers that I hope get future attention:-No way to recruit new guys (in the latest version) without forking over thousands at a time. There is maybe one character I've encountered that is willing to join you, and he costs 6000 in game currency.-And you're gonna need some help, because the game is irritatingly difficult when beginning. I know it is supposed to be a challenge, but the only way to level your guy is to follow around a patrol which may or may not encounter hostile groups. Even then, expect to get only a few hits in before the patrol wipes out the enemy.-Getting your character to attack is a hassle. Right clicking works some of the time. Other times you have to hold right click over an enemy and tell your character to attack him.-The staggering animation after being hit often leaves you open to another attack, which can stagger you again. Kinda lame considering that...-The punishment for losing a fight is way too severe. When you get KO'd you can be waiting upwards of 300+ seconds to have your guy wake up. After bandaging yourself, you must limp/walk to the nearest city to sleep if you don't have the materials to make a camp bed. Getting to the nearest city can take long enough, but sleeping till recovery takes waaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy too long considering how the rest of this recovery process goes...-If you do make a camp bed, because limping to the nearst town takes too long, I hope you don't mind spending the night with bandits or dogs, who will stand over you until you wake up. And then kill you. And if it was dogs instead of bandits, then you might as well make a new game, because they're not going anywhere after you get KO'd.-Poor optimization in its current state.A lot of people enjoy the game, and for good reason. Just be warned that you might find this game to be pretty tedious, frustrating, and possibly unplayable. I'd say to wait a while before buying.			"

								Not to bad for a little EA. Seems my library is filling with those. Not a whole lot to do at this time except roam the waste and find new members, and sadly they dont respawn, so once you empty a bar out of potentials thats it. Otherwise its about build your base / manufacturing facility and then set out to make money. The combat is rough at first, your so overclassed, but just because your team is beaten down does not mean its over, sometimes some wake up or are just playing dead and will get up after the bad guys leave and you can save your team with them. Its also persistent in damage, if a guy has a bum leg, he will limp, and slow the party down. Having the best weapons and armor wont save you either, you can have it but if you dont know how to use it then its just a burden and for show. Lots of fun though. I dont feel like I wasted anything on this one.			"

								Actual Review after the first chunk of Text.I've been reading quite a few Negative Reviews about this game complaining about how it's bugged and how slow the development on this is, though I do not find this negative, especially since this game Is in Early Access and in it's Alpha Stage. People complain about games not being Bugfree while they are still in Early Access, which is meant to help the developers to improve the game by finding said bugs and reporting them to them. About the development being slow though, yes i have to agree the development is quite slow, with the game being in Early Access / Alpha for over 5 years now, though they do release updates quite regularly most of the time. well now that this rant is over on to the Actual Review.Kenshi is a Squad Based Open World Role playing Game that is currently in it's Alpha (for over 5 years now).The Game in it's current version has already quite a lot to offer, especially with some of the bigger updates still coming up. The Development on this game can be quite slow since it is being produced by a small Team consisting of 6 Actual members and a few Volunteers and Freelancers.Positives about the Game:+ You currently have quite a Huge map that you can explore and build your base on with more and different Land to be released in a future update.+ You aren't god in this game, you are a basic human (or group of humans) that has to survive in the desert (maybe other places in later updates), not more, not less.+ The game is actively being Developed even if it may be slow, the game has been receiving updates for over 5 years now so I'll doubt that the studio has any plans on abandoning it.+ Has great music (not too much different music but great music)Negatives:- You won't get a full on Role Playing feel yet as the game is still in development.- A bit hard to get into at first- Kinda slow development though i don't blame them, I have enough respect for them for even trying to make a game like this.- Obviously, you will experience Bugs since it's in Early Access.Final Verdict:This Game is already great and shows potential to become one of my favorite Squad Based RPGs. If you are a fan of games like these go ahead and buy it, but be aware that the Game is still in Early Access / Alpha which means you won't get a full on ""Finished Game"" experience. Early Access is here to help Developers find bugs and help them find ideas not for actually playing the game early. So if you want to help the Development (even if it is quite slow sometimes) go ahead and get it. But if you want a full game experience wait until the Game gets out of Early Access somewhen.			"

								Used to be my favorite game of all time.  Now I find the map & content to be cluttered.  It used to be about samurai, and now it's about something I don't understand yet.  The game expanded too much on too many different things & themes at once, which took away its main appeal to me.  If you're looking for a samurai game, then this isn't it unfortunately.  I bought it when it was a game about swordsman traveling the land making a name for their self.  Now there's monsters, the map is too big, overpowered NPC's in large massive groups and despawning NPC's.  I feel like every single update for the past year or so, has not made the game any better, if anything.. all of it feels random to me.  Why are there monsters?  How do they make the game any better?  What's the point in the map being so large when the game insists that you build a base and just turtle your entire playthrough.  Things like being a merchant is really dumb now with how large the map is and so on.  Seems like the only ideal way to play this game is to turtle at a base, and bait enemies into your harpoon nest.  Game used to be more of a ""do whatever you want"" now it's just a RTS survival game.  Having enemies in a massive group (like 20+) teaches you that you should be prioritizing getting the largest squad, not attacking anyone, and baiting bandits into them for the first 20+ hours.  NPC's need to be more scattered, not only are these NPC's capable of soloing 10 of your dudes, but they also have to be in a large group?  There's nothing you can do other than cheese it with harpoon nests, play it like a base building simulator and hope you don't get bored by the time you get strong enough to engage in the content.  All the other NPC's are turtling also, some of the races have like 50+ or something NPC's all cluttered in a single town.  So attacking a single one will get you mobbed quickly.			"

								After searching for a game that even resembled Mount & Blade. I was able to find this gem of a game. I have played way more hours then what is currently said on steam, I had the game before they even put it on steam but I don't recall how long ago that was. Anyway this game is amazing and I love how unique it is from every game. The game first will first ask what gameplay do you want to start was and the option was wanderer and something else. Then you got thrown into game and had your character customize screen show up to change the way your character looked and name him as well. Then it would make you feel that you could not fight alone in the game and that you were just weaker then everyone since they've been through experiences that you haven't even experienced yourself like fighting. Since then they've added tons of new features like farming, mining, and crafting, as well as a lot of new defensive weapons at our disposal. They haven't done an update in a long time though since the next one is supposedley the 64-bit build, new pathfinding engine, and the map too. So i'll update this review when it comes out.			"

								After waking up in the desert with nothing besides a stick and some pants I decide to wander to look for someone who can help. I come across a small fort that was well off and had slaves gathering materials. When I approached them they did not seem to mind me. Knowing this, I enter one of their buildings and try to steal some Sake. A guard quickly knocks me unconscious, puts me in a cage and strips me of my belongings, which were already next to nothing. After weeks of trying to pick the lock and attempted escapes I manage to sneak out close to 3am in the morning when the guards were asleep. I swiftly and silently steal some clothes and a sword, and when the time was right I legged it out the compound. After a good hour of fleeing the compound and its many guards, a group of bandits attack the guards, allowing me to escape into the distance. I am now a free ex-slave that is trading items to try to make enough money to survive.Edit1 (hours later irl);I have now established a thieves den hidden near a lake in the desert. I frequently travel to cities to collect ""pre owned"" merchandise and resell this to another village deeper into the forest. Good game/yes			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi as an idea has taken me in a way that most largely produced titles haven't been able to.  Having played just above 80 hours I feel I can write a decent review of this game.  Having bought the game almost a year and half ago and seeing short progress I was worried; however, it's good to see that there are dedicated people still out there not just trying to get their quick cash and move on.  Kenshi offers you a vast empty (which is good)  desert world where you must fend for yourself and that's as far as the story will take you at this moment in time.   The choice is yours, what do you do? Read a bunch of f**king guides is what you do, or at least myself, but I digress.  Throughout gameplay you must make decisions where to incoporate your time....as in...do I take my only 2 soldiers to escort my 3 traders to a town to sell Ale/chainmail/katanas/fragaxes/medkits/etc, or do i keep 1 soldier at the outpost guarding 2 of those traders while they continue to produce while only sending 1 soldier and 1 trader....which could possibly be attacked by a multitude of people (have fun with that population setting!)  At the same time you must research and dedicate certain squadmates to certain jobs where they will become more proficient as such.  Efficiency is key in Kenshi especially when you just start your outpost.          Base building is relatively smooth with only minor bugs which can be avoided by a quick save and reload  (applies to entire gameplay as well), and although there aren't uses for many of the items currently ingame besides monetary value there is much promise for the future.  The core buildings on the other hand are useful and there are many of them with industry like processes to advance your small faction as such.            As far as skills go Kenshi has many of the same skills you find in any other RPG game out there, the difference is that these skills actually have a real-time effect in gameplay.  What i mean by that is that if you have low strength, good luck carrying that backpack full of steel, wearing durable heavy armors, and larger weapons all while slowing you down becoming cannibal food in the process......AND making your Attack say (-14) because you dont know what you're doing with said weapon......fool.         So the game hits on the saying ""practice makes perfect."" in a nutshell in all skill-like aspects.  The unfortunate side is that there are still a considerable amount of skills ""greyed"" out not finished yet (awesome when finished)  but do not let that take away from this light of a game in this dark re-hashed titled clone world of ours.  It's EA and for as imperative as the devs made the skills (not just stat raises) is something fresh, oh what else is fresh that i forgot..LOCATIONAL DAMAGE!  wut, indie game? Naw that's unheard of...WRONG.  You get your leg beaten to a pulp?  Well I hope you can afford a walking stick Mr. Gimpy until you treat it medically.  The best part is that you don't die instantly, you bleed, you fight, pass out to wake and fight again! then pass out! and die.  Game over unless you have meds.           Visually, the game remains desolate yet somehow pleasing.  It actually feels like a post-apocalyptic world that you were just thrown into with the sole goal to survive however you see fit.  Some of the structures do look a little edgy at times, and not everything lines up 100% but the end result is fair enough.  Things look as they should....In conclusion, because I'm mediocre at reviews,  I find Kenshi very immersive, well thought and executed, and a challenging game considering the dev's choice of realism.  That's saying a lot for those indie's and with this one you'll dump hours into it without even realizing once you understand the concepts.  Honestly, I can't wait to play this thing once it's finished....seriously.  There's nothing else like it right now.  For how much this game costs and for how much content you get it's a decently fair price, try to get it on sale if you can.  Plus, I totally believe in supporting devs that change the industry with great ideas like this. Keep it up!Gameplay:    8/10Visuals:         7/10Updates:       6/10  (steadily increasing)Overall quality:    7/10Progress?   I'd say it's around 60% done overall (don't murder me it's an educated guess)P.S.  The bugs (not crashes) i've personally found to be more amusing than not most of the time.  Watching bandits and sometimes fellow squadmates violently ragdoll into the sky for a brief moment when are knocken unconcious can somewhat take me by surprise.  Or when the ai gets stupid and bunches up for a massive aoe 1 hitter with a frag axe. KO mother*****  "

								As it stands now in Early Access, Kenshi shows a lot of promise as a hit game.  I play with experimental patches enabled, and I get to see the latest additions to the game- bugs included.  If you're a fan of participating in the course of a game's development, your input can- and will greatly impact- the course of the game's development.  This is one everyone should get onboard for!For starters, I'd like to thank members of the development team and their forum moderators for being so involved in discussion.  Many of the threads created in both the Steam forums and the Lo-Fi Game forums end up with answers from members of the team, and what you say can and will make an impact.  To be able to get in touch with someone heading up the game and recieve a personal response is both uplifting and noteworthy.  For me, this game gets high marks for this level of involvement in the community, as for many other development teams, such close coordination has been too much to ask for!On to gameplay; Kenshi is an interesting mesh of Real Time Strategy, base-building, caravaneer mechanics, where you have many choices of how to make your living.In terms of RTS, you can choose from or mod your own Game Start that allows you to pick a set of characters or character, and enter the game world to begin an adventure.  Mechanics are simple:  Using the Numpad or your mouse, you select your character and order them with a click to move.  You can do this to adjust your active navigation, taking detours where you need to, or you can rely upon the surprisingly competent pathfinding AI, which can take you from one side of the map to the other appropriately if you let it, though sometimes patches make this feature a bit fragile.  There is no first person or third person play, it's really a game of watching and hoping you've trained your guys enough that they can handle themselves in a combat situation.Your life revolves around your squad, and what you choose to do with them.  You will, at some point, be attacked, and you will have to fight back, so it's best to train up your brave men and women any way you can to keep yourself above the frey.  At lower levels, combat can be hard, if not embarassing.  You can be slaughtered and not even see a rational reason why (other than your guys just suck at swinging a weapon).  Currently, swordsmanship is the big deal going around, granted the namesake of Mortal Kombat character Kenshi (literally; swordsman), though turrets have been added to the game and ranged weapons are expected in the future (no muskets or revolvers, though modding will make that quite easy to do once ranged mechanics are in, so look forward to it!).The real fun in Kenshi is in what you decide to do with yourself once you're in.  Bounty Hunting, Raiding, Murder and Looting are all part of the possibilities, but more than that, you have the option to become the target of such things.One of the lifestyles you can fall into is a sort of wandering trader, or caravaneer.  Basically, you throw backpacks on a few of your squad members, put the best weapons in the hands of your best muscle, and send your people from town to town crating goods for sale.  Each town hosts a unique set of prices for certain goods; Chainmail can be worth 76% of it's base value one place, and 130% of that value in another, allowing you to invest a lot of money that makes a good return.  All that matters is that you don't oversell to the extent that it breaks their bank.  Being a traveling merchant grants many benefits, and it's a good way to get a leg up in a new game, as running builds strength and athletics, which aid in fighting, running and hauling later on in your lifecycle.Alternatively, the player can create their own town and have the merchants come to them.  Now, this is a fantastic feature, the construction mechanics of the game are pretty solid, even in it's current state.  If you see a man-made structure in the game, chances are that you'll be able to build it.  You start with a decent shack or house, build a research table, set up a farm, and start work on learning new things and stockpiling new resources.  It takes a while for a town to become self-sustaining, but when it does, you can feel free to hermit it up.  You basically have the same tools at your disposal as the developers do when it comes to construction, and you can make the same quality of layout if your talent allows.  Setting up shops and resource centers allows trade and storage, and building walls and turrets keeps out any unsavory individuals that you might find in the wasteland.  Yes, sometimes a world without borders can be a dangerous one.If being a nice guy minding his own business doesn't suit you, or if the Holy Nation stumbles upon your town of peaceful Shek peoples, becoming a more hostile force is also an option.  You even get the option to be a little creative...  Building cages and holding areas for the people you knock out on the battlefield gives you the option to take prisoners, and there'll certainly be more that you can do with this mechanic as the game progresses.  The Role Playing options offered in this game exceed those offered in many others, and the style of gameplay isn't just fun, but addictive.With this said, there are a few downsides to the game that you would probably want to know about before buying.For one, Kenshi seems to be set-in-stone in terms of what lore it will follow.  This is no problem to most people, but to some, it's pretty concentrated on one Apocalyptic Eastern theme.  I've found that the concept the game follows is a bit rigid, as it celebrates the way of Eastern warriors, yet, leaves out the opportunity to equip shields for added defense, neglects any Western-style weaponry (no Claymore, Gladius, Spear, or Cutlass styles), and the story behind it all can be a bit confusing, at times, with regard to finding a point in it all.What bugs me about the weapon variety is partly explained by the fact that I'm more familiar with Western swordsmanship than Eastern, and I feel that these arts are something that the game is missing out on in a great opportunity.  As it stands, there are a limited number of weapon classes and they're pretty much wide-spread, though manufactured by different ""companies"" and distributed across the world.  There's a lot of room for far more variety, and it'd help a lot to convey the differences in design between factions if these weapons weren't just different shaders and colors, or cousins basically (different but the same).  Don't get me wrong, there's like 12 separate weapon types in the game, but they're all pretty closely related.  If more varieties were included, you could see a stronger divide between each faction, and one sword from Holy Nation could convey an entirely different culture than a sword from the United Cities.  That's the biggest thing about this metal craftsmanship; it makes unique combat styles for unique cultures.  More weight should be placed in this category of diversity.The next thing is definitely the lack of shields.  Blocking is done by swords, and if you've studied metal, you know at some point it'll give out.  Eastern warfare did involve the usage of shields in battle at times, and they really do deserve a place in the combat dossier.  Additionally, including shields would open up a new realm of possibilies for modders possessing the talent to model new designs for inclusion in the game.  Imagine having an entire Roman Legion patrolling the game world, the possibilities are endless.When it comes to the background of Kenshi, I feel that it might be set in stone, and since I don't know what's written on that stone, it leaves me unsure of how the development will play out.  I am confident in the team's ability to carry out their mission and bring this game to completion, but I do worry that some ideas might not see the light of day.All said, this game is well worth buying!

								Well..................I bought this at the end of Crimbo 2016 as the writeups were quite good and seemed like a challenge from what I was reading. + I was bored to tears.And.............in the space of 3 weeks I have racked up 146 hours!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-O I got over 300 on Fallout 4 for over 3 months playing it on and off, so this has been a real developer achievement to me!!!!Okay, so yes, it's ard!

								Hi everyone, I don't have many experience with early access games but if only games supposed to be fully developped could be as complete as this one, I don't think I have ever been that satisfied with a game for a very long time, Kenshi is the perfect game if you like micro-management, personnalized gaming, and non-linear evolution. To me it feels like the Elders Scrolls, Age of Empire or Jagged Alliance were mixed into one big sand-box, The game itself is tough, which makes the building of your outpost or even a short trip with your weak team a challenging process but also gives the player a feeling of achievement, every move is at-risk, which explains why succeeding in creating an autonomic settlement is so gratifying.If you're tired of RPGs following a linear narration with predetermined characters reproducing repetetive actions over the same dungeons, then this game is made for you: personnalize every of your recruits (up to 256 with the current mods), their daily functioning (farming, working the mines, building, hunting, using cross-bows to guard your town, crafting, sneaking....), your settlements (many and many possibilities that will evolve through research), your equipements,  changing relationships with other factions according to your actions and background, random and various bands roaming , a large map with different landscapes and populations (already huge and half the map is still in development and will be hopefully accessible soon) including hidden places and several towns with racial specificities, ruins to visit and loot, a varying weather and its related effects on the gameplay, day and night shifts, numerous mods and recurrent updates, it would take a much longer review to explain every possibilities and factors included in that game, it's only my opinion but to me everything's here. Being a trader, a bandit, a slave (a slaver?), a ninja, a cannibal, a peaceful farmer, a lone scavenger, a tribal leader... it's up to you to do whatever you want with all this content, Sincerely, I would like to thank the developers for this amazing work, please keep going			"

								This game is not for the faint of heart. If you like modern hand holding RPGs or on rails games like fallout 4 this is not for you. This hearkens back to early RPGs like Fallout 2, Balder's Gate etc. You are the story, you make the story. It's similar to mount and blade warband in that respect. You can choose to do anything however its a time sink.You can play it like the lone wanderer, group of adventurers, or you can play it like age of empires.The choice is yours			"

								A great sand box game, with a promising future. An interesting progresion of your characters, they dont start as powerfull as is the nowadays norm, infact they are really weak and have to be really carefull and lucky. But suriving long enough in this game brings great joy. The only game i can compare with Kenshi would be dark souls series. They are both really hard, and involve a lot of deaths. Althrought the game is still in alpha/beta stage, I believe that if your searching something new and refreshing, you should try this game. I dont think that everyone will love it or like it but nevertheless its quite a good game with dedicated creators who try to improve the game as fast as they possibly can and give it a lot of love.

								Kenshi is a squad based open world post apocolyptic RPG, but you probably knew that already. When I forst bought this game like maybe one odd years ago it was rough, but I could see the potential and managed to enjoy almost 50 hours of it. I was coutious to recommend at the time because I wasnt sure if development would be dropped or not seeing as it was slow and economically unstable. Recently I checked back and was thrilled to see development is continuing and significant progress is being made. With these doubts out of the picture I am confident in recommending this game. It has alot of charm and is well thought out, A truly free RPG.			"

								Firstly, my 'hours played' isn't accurate, I've played more than it shows. I had a weird stint where Steam Overlay didn't work for a couple weeks and blah blah.Anyway, this game is great.It's one major feature, one that people either love or hate, is that it's a true sandbox. At this point, there is no objective, no beginning - middle - or end.You choose a specific start (the starts that you choose from are kind of a template of the type of role play you're looking for) then.... well, whatever you want.Want to go over there? Do it. Want to start a base up and make it into a city sim? Have at it. Want to slaughter everyone in a town? Knock yourself out. There's a lot of stuff to do, but some people can't find enjoyment in doing it if they don't have something the game is telling them to work forward to - which isn't a bad thing, people can like whatever they want.There's a lot to be had in this game;- Party Based RPG- Squad Management (multiple squads)- Buy/Sell Merchant sim- City Builder & Management- Pickup and play for fifteen minutes or hours- It's... Just a giant sandbox, you can do damn-near anything.Something that I wont add to the list of it's features is its modibility, it's ridiculously easy - but there's only like, ten mods made for it, which is for the best anyways since the next planned update to the game is an entirely new map.If you like games that blend fifty different genre's together and don't mind there not being a point, you'll most likely enjoy this game as much as I have.There's a wierd 'either love it or hate it' review battle with this game, people claiming that if you say something bad about the game then you're an idiot and if you say somehting good about it you're a ravenous fanboy - the old ""Everyone's opinion matter as long as it is in full support of mine"" rhetoric seen in all games/movies.Honestly, it's a great game that has come a long, loooong way, and it gets exponentionally more fun with each update.TL:DR -- A ton of genre's slapped together very well.- Almost out of Alpha; soon to be fully featured.- Has no end goal - you make you're own up (in true roleplay fashion)- Can be played as little or as often as you want, there's currently (may not ever be) actual missions, so there's no ""Let me just finish this part""- I like it, you might like it, try the demo (yeah, it has a demo, for some reason video game companies refuse to make demos anymore) it's available on the Lo-Fi website (steam too?)

								Kenshi Is a fantastic idea but is one of those gruesomely Beta/Alpha games that we all know steam to be a hub for. There is still alot of work to be done on stability (The experimental version is very prone to crashing) and aspects of the game are still in progress of being developed. So if you have a short temperament you may wish to wait till it's finished.That being said it's very difficult drawing yourself away for it. Creating your charaters from hair to feet then training them up in whatever respected fields you wish them to delve into from farming to swordplay to thievery . Beautifully thought out landscapes and structures to explore and the abusive bandits that wander there. Once you make enough of a living from selling your scraps to traders in towns, you can even build your own settlement from scrach and make a town of your own.Hopefully if and when the game is finished being fiddled with, this can be an amazing game giving players the full freedom every RPG deserves.

								I love this game!I'd say Kenshi is a one of a kind, a bit of a niche game.. there are very few you can compare it to.The learning curve is steep, but the mountain top is not too high!Because it is a open world sandbox game you can play Kenshi in so many different waysEverything from being just a handful of very highly trained ninjas to a big warband of mercenaries, or perhaps you want to be a merchant, set up shop inside a city ? or build your very own city and bring trade to you!I have 140 hours on record all played with the same savegame and i consider myself having reached 'end game' if that term even applies to a game such as this :P and what I will say is there are end game features missing, such as proper diplomacy, ways of making your own actual faction/kingdom, waging war + the fact that only half the map is playable. So I feel like I am out of things to do on my current savegame because I am strong enough to assult cities and wiping them out, but it doesnt lead to alot currently..but trust me when I say the journey there was SO enjoyable I can't even.. and the devs do work on it and update it frequently adding in all these things that are missing!Very much reccomend this game!

								Brilliant game. When I bought this game quite a long time ago I had originally thought the developers had bitten off more than they could chew as the sandbox feel, and being able to do almost anything you want with AI reacting accordingly seemed ambitious, but its coming together now and they are pulling it off as promised. There are still a lot of things that need to be fixed but so far I am having a blast and am glad I re-installed the game to give it another go.Build a massive town, recruit people to help you run it efficiently and have them setup for certain tasks so you dont have to micro manage them. Steal, kill, kidnap, do whatever you like to get ahead. Just be cautios of the reprocutions of your actions. There isn't to much of a story line that I have found, but that doesn't really matter as you are essentially creating your own story. It seems as if only a 1/4 of the world is done and can be explored, but its big enough to keep you busy for quite some time. Once the other 3/4 are done it will take you quite some time to thouroughly explore all that the world has to offer. Setup your town almost anywhere, just can't set it up to close to another town. It seems like there are well over 100 different things you can build in your town, and that is not including the massive amount of things you can craft. Setup a shop and sell your wares to passers by even. If you are into well thought out sandbox RPG style games, you wont be dissapointed unless you are not someone who can get over little quirks.The Devs seem to be throwing in updates way more often than I remember and I think that had something to do with them changing engines or re-writting things back in the day which held them up. I am hoping they can get to more content and features soon, but am satisfied at the pace they are going as of now.Right now my character has a $23,000 bounty on his head, is hated by half the map, and I am loving it. It makes it challenging and then doesn't make me feel bad when I sneak up, knock someone out stealthy, take their stuff and throw them in a cage.I must say this game is a buy, and once it has been completed I would pay at least 2.5 as much as what the game is selling at now. Nice Job Devs!			"

								Of course trhere need a lot to be done.. On the other side: this is a realy great game with a lot more potential for the future! Worth to buy and play it now allready; in my opinion YES !!! With the start as 'wanderer' you have to do it all the way, and this is very nice to play. My first money i spend on good boots and an extra backpack, with a bit luck i found 2 dead body's and take there cloths & weapons.. so good enough to equip at the moment.. Then i found a group of bandids, i run back towards the city i started and let them killed by the guards there.. did enjoy the battle myself also, and making progress in attack & defend that way. With all those loot i found on there body's ik make nice money and could hire the first 2 members of my group..Did this a couple times and could hire 2 more (already trained) other members + better gear. Start to get building on my self.. started with my 1st settlement with a little barack and a stone mine.. Now after +- 30 hrs playing time i have 8 members (3 last recruited in the second city i visite), upgrade the stone mine, build also 2 power-generators, a stone working machine, build the 1st house with 4 beds and training body + first city walls build to protect my 1st settlement a bit and.. All members well equiped for there level. Some little inside story's.. : After several fights with smaller bandit-groups (i can take them down) and bigger groups of sand-bandits (witch i take after me to the city-guards, to fight them together and take there loots.. + selling the gang-boss for good money to the head guards).. ..then there came a group of 'cannibals'.. to my little settlement.. they take 2 of my members down, picked them up and running away with them.. omg.. lol.. bud, they run into the arms of a walking patrouille from guild guards.. they take the cannibals down and my members could struggeled back to our settlement... pffftttt.. end good :P In all the time i played till now, i only have 2 crashes (saving regulary is always the better thing to do), so that's not so bad for a starting game i suppose. There is a well done balance between the attacks from the (4 differend types) of bandids walking around and the time you can spend on selling, buying, training, building).. That's very satisfied to play like this in a game like this!Conclusion: Like i say at the beginning, there is still a lot to do.. but for sure it's worth to buy and play! For now allready nice playing and we hope it will be more and more in the future.. All by all; Thanks to the maker(s) : nice & good work allready, hope a lot more to come.. Have fun by playing this xD  "

Early Access Review
								I bought this game early Alpha on steam and from then up until now i have not once regretted that decision, I have played countless hours of the game and every time i pick it up to play/start a new game i find myself locked into the world of Kenshi for countless hours without realising just how much i need to get away from my PC. Since Beta the amount of content added has been amazing, the game has progressively gotten better without breaking away from what makes the game gorgeous. The game is immense in terms of how you can play it and what you can do within it, the quality of the content is in no way lacking and neither is the replayability because of it. Starting as a lone wanderer and deciding to build a town or village from which to build your own trade empire has such a wonderful feel to it as you slowly watch as your carefully maintained entourage survive and grow stronger. The only reason i cannot give this game 5 stars is because the game is of course in early access and thus prone to bugs, of which I have experienced none, and constant change. I find it exciting as more get's added, starting fresh never feels boring as every new game can be played wildly differently and watching my main character grow stronger, and with the combat your successfull battles actually feel thoroughly fulfilling, never seems to grow tiresome. I highly reccomend this game, it is not like most top down Sim/Rpg ish game's are and it's definitely tough to get a handle on at first but twice as rewarding once you start to understand the hidden beauty behind this game. Even down to the music and plentiful subtleties that can be found within the game, i found the experience and continued experience of playing this game to be unchangingly pleasant. Most definitely worth far more than they are asking for price wise.			"

Well done. addicting, great game play, amazing concept.   i've been with this since it first came out and watched the entrire EA process.   It has been a long developement but the light of release is super close.  Played occasionally through early access, and while i havent logged as many hours as i should have, it's just amazing.			"

								This game is a very interesting concept, hence why I bought it, its even fun to play for a while untill the content quickly runs out. This is fine as its an alpha, however, updates come verrrrry slowly on this, its taken more than a year to get to this point. I appreciate that this is a small dev team (1 guy?) but people should know that it will (based on current trends) take years for this game to finish, if ever, by which point you will most likely be playing something else as you will have done this to death.

								Kenshi Is one of my favorite games of all time. The free roam combined with the ability to play however you please is great. The sword fighting is smooth and feels like a action movie. Your always determined to get more powerful and in depth base building so your rarely left wandering around with nothing to do next. The game has multiple starting back storys to choose from and after you spend a good bit of time completing those you can mod the game quite easily. The ability to create and mod the entire world of kenshi after watching a 10 minute youtube video is amazing. Ive spent close to a hundred hours just modding kenshi the way I please. Anything in kenshi I think is to hard or easy I can fix. You can also create custom armor,weapons and pretty much change the entire world in anyway you want. I only wish more games would give there community the ability to do this so easily. Kenshi gets a 10 out of 10 in my book.			"

								155 hours of play and climbing, this game is a great combination of player punishment and self driver objective gameplay. Do I want to farm? Do I want to fight? how do I know I'll even survie this fight? que the lone medic picking up their kin from the floor and dusting them off before the scavengers arrive. Such a great game but not recommended for people used to being spoon fed virtual achievements. This game is a slow crawl to the mountain top, clenching your teeth the whole journey, only to know that one mistake will throw you back down again.			"

								I've actually created a video for this game if anyone is interested in viewing it. It is more of a collections of musings and my thoughts on the game as well as whether I think the game is worth the purchase. In the video I say 15 dollars when the actual price is 20. My recommendation still stands. Watch it if you want and let me know if you agree!

								This game provides all the elements I look for in a game if any of the following apply to you, you will enjoy this.1. Micromanagement; As your group grows the functions for each grow and multi tasking stays fresh, you wont go long before a bandit attack. There's always work to do, training to be done the tasks never end. Making your party run laps in their precious down time, training your combat skills on captured prisoners, producing gear or buildind/researching the list goes on.2.RPG; Each character has its own stats, the time it takes to get anything to level 20+ is abit time consuming, but it gives a sense of satisfaction as you make another character a mighty warrior in the wasteland.3.City Building; Build your own city! it takes time, but building your own utopia complete with shops, workshops, homes, outposts, defense walls, mounted crossbows, the only limit is how long your willing to spend preparing your characters for the coming construction.4.Crafting; At first its more about gathering gear from fallen foe's outside the city gates, but once you begin teching and producing your own gear, a high quality katana compared to a rusty one is a beautiful sight, you can also produce all the raw materials needed for self preservation which is tougher, but for some more rewarding.5.Diplomacy; Want to be friends with a certain group of bandits? Heal some of their fallen kin, eventually they will stop attacking you and come to your aide. (This takes time, I also assume in the future there will be many diplomatic aspects, but have yet to be added).6.Permanent Death; Think your starter character is a badass? wrong. Each unit becomes precious, you grow attatched as they become valueable, and then at the worst moment a critical strike leaves them stranded far from a safe location, too far to carry safely without a character with strength above 30... you keep watching hoping the bleeding stops and he'll enter a recovery coma but no his status switches to ""dying"" and you panic, time to decide if your capable enough to make the rescue, because even if you are, a large enough band of bandits/cannibals could strike you all down, and end your game. (Also note, the cannibals will take your people prisoner and amount of time you have to wait for a distraction is FOREVER, but its great).7.Travel/Relocation; Making it town to town in the begining is thrilling, as your group grows and you safely reach each destination, perhaps traveling with a caravan or a squad of UC/HO troops for safety, or braving the journey alone it's deadly every time. Also, the town you're in could be overrun. (I've seen it happen twice lol)8.Huge Replay Value; Start in a new town, new conditions, different starting squad, death at the start, who knows? The randomness is astounding, you could find ""wingman"" at the start, walk out near ""Shark"" and get hacked to piece by roaming sand ninja. You've read enough. Buy it, before it gets better and you feel like an idiot for not have gotten it sooner.			"

								I played this game for over a year on Desura before it came to Steam and let me just say, if you're looking for a fun tactical-strategy-rpg-citybuilding extravaganza, look no further. Kenshi has the most open playability of any game I've played since Ultima Online. If you want to develop a trading outpost into a bustling town, you can. If you just want to be a bunch of nomad bandits, have at it!Pros-Such Depth! Much Fun!-Deep Character Progression-Develop your faction into whatever you want from honored to infamous and enjoy the faction effects it has toward every other group in the game.-Awesome Music, but it gets a little repetitive after hours.-Fun Crafting and Construction System!Cons-There's a bit of a learning curve and -Unrealistic combat. The best way to grind skills is to walk fights and just kite the enemies to a town to level up your fighting which gets monotonous and doesn't make any sense. Were I a bandit, I doubt I would chase some nobodies to my doom, but that's just me.			"

								GOD I want to love this game. I really want to. I've played over 40 hours in an absurdly short amount of time trying to love it and make it work. I know it just went Beta, but this is one of the least playabe Betas (or even Alphas) I have ever taken part in.Pathfinding is absolutely terrible. The worst of any RTS I've ever played. If you build a wall, plan on randomly getting stuck on terrain and having to deconstruct part of the wall so your resources are *poof* gone. Oh it's not over there - good luck trying to get the two parts of the walls to attach again, because there is random wall collision detection that prevents you from attaching the two pieces of the wall, so there's a good chance you'll have to start over on a huge section of wall. There have been modest improvements to pathfinding, not least of which is your squad tries its best to use the road rather than going offroad. This seems to be a hasty workaround, because going offroad seems to get you stuck for no apparent reason a lot of the time. Also plan on reversing your path and straightening out an approach on one squad member when going through gates into cities. The devs have the best intentions by attempting the following:- Auto-hauling- Priority queues- Clicking on a point on the map and having the squad automatically go thereThe problem with these is the execution. Auto-hauling works alright, but you have to have a specific box for the item. For example, autohauling stone has to go to a stone box. So you're taking up a ton of space with storage boxes. This leads into priority queues, which only show 5 of the tasks you have lined up even though you can have more. So if you have 10 resources you want to haul to 10 different boxes for efficiency's sake, you won't see the 5 tasks in the bottom of the queue so you have no idea if you actually have them queued or not. So you might have to deleted and restart your entire queue if you forget.When going to a city by selecting a point on the map, there's a good chance your squad will randomly stop and just stand there because it doesn't know where to go, even though you selected a point on the map. This map feature is very new, so I'll give it a pass. It just needs some polish. It works a lot of the time.Whoamygod crashes. Pre .90, crashes used to be once every 5-10 minutes (so lower your Autosave threshold unless you want to constantly lose progress). Patch .90.11 made the game literally unplayable (crash shortly after load every time, regardless of whether you start a new game or not).  However, since then the crashes have gotten LOADS better. I just hope this continues.The devs try hard (it seems) but it feels like they're playing a game of whack-a-mole. They squash a bug, another bug (or two, or three) appears in its place. I just hope to god it gets a lot more polish in the automation and pathfinding departments. Micromanaging to this degree and especially with this much frustration is not fun. If these key areas improve, this will turn a messy, bug-ridden game into a GREAT game.All that ugliness aside... I will continue to support the game (because it's the only one of its kind really right?) and will likely change my review if there's a lot of polish. Right now it's not lookin good though.			"

								I have played this game since version .15 or so, back when it was nothing but a desert and black portraits for characters. Having said this, the game has come a long way since then. However, after the version that added the first new expansion to the north of the new map the additions are trivial and ""same old"" as the ones that came before them. While some bugs have came and gone no actual meaningful features have been added just new areas to do the same old things in.I've played this game on multiple different saves, some with huge squads, some with just 4, and on steam here this many hours was put solely on a single character. I mention this because playing with a single character will allow you to see the overglaring flaws that this game has fundementally. I loved Kenshi, when the first map expansion came out and I ran into the armor king I couldn't wait for chris to add more depth to the story or even special characters like him but I've been let down every single update since then as I said previously any new expansion is just additions to the same old routine. At this point in my solo playthrough I can kill anything without much effort, even being hopelessly outnumbered. Most of the main draw of the game *was* the difficulty for me, that has now been shattered. It took over 100 hours to get to that point but the fact it exists and any new content is null because of it shows that this game will not be anything more than it is currently. It lacks depth it lacks character. Even if they throw the rest of the map together I'll just roam aimlessly to find all markers and slaughter the highest stat enemies I can find but none of it will bring the fun back.You can steal things, why bother after the 2nd or 3rd town sack? You can kill things, why bother after 80+ stats, you can trade, why bother when you don't even need cats unless you need material from shops. That is the current feature list as it stands. You cannot meddle within the current factions, you cannot influence them in any way, you cannot help them against eachother in any way. In short, the only decisions you have to make seem rather dull and tiny compared to when you let your imagination run free and fill in the gaps for you. There's no doubt that anyone who first loves this game as I have will do that very thing. In the end it comes down to this; Is Kenshi worth 20$ as it stands? Yes, it is. even playing as I did, 100 hours is easily worth the money, I've spent far more on far less gametime. But do I recommend it to others? No, it's a love-hate relationship for me. Once you see the game for what it really is it's a shell of what could have been. I can only imagine how chris will decide to salvage what tiny bit is left to finish and tie it all together. Unless he's hiding some major features that he has yet to even announce to anyone after all these years the game core itself, the very heart of it, will be a cheap experience that will continue to make you feel empty and ask ""what if"" or ""what could have been""			"

								Kenshi is a very good and fun game, Kenshi is the kind of game I love because it has some features that big games don't. First thing I'll say is: ""don't buy this game if you have no patiance"" This game is a little bit hard in the beggining because you're not special... in the begging almost everyone is stronger than you so be careful, to BE special you have to work for it, you gotta pursue it, and that's what I love about kenshi. I can't describe with words, what I can say is: download the demo in their website and you'll feel/know what I mean, I haven't played much but I loved what I played of it. It's buggy, it crashes a lot, sometimes you'll rage in front of your computer and stop playing it for a week but Kenshi is amazing and you know you'll play it again. the developers always keep updating with bugs fixes and add some minor content, and from time to time there's a ""big content update"" wich adds a lot of new stuff.

								I have been following Kenshi for around three years now. It has grown from very basic mechanics and framework, to this very ambitious and well deserving piece of RPG interpretation. The sky is limited on what you can do now. However, the creator has been able to utilize a team to help him create the game he wants. Key features include free roaming, base building, character development and many more mechanics that make Kenshi great but also set it apart from the rest of the crowd. It has the environment and finesse that allows you to craft your own story in a very unique and different setting than a traditional RPG. It's easily the embodiment of everything a die-hard RPG fan would want to play. It's probably the Sienfeld of RPG's.			"

								(MAY BE A SPOILER) I love this game, especially because of the very large battles that can take place in one area. Excluding the lag that can occur in those battles, a income that can be obtained is the loot after the battle: off of the NPCs killed. The best thing about this game is the vastness of the map! I love how there can be, say Bandits, Holy Men, and then Cannibals all fighting outside of a village. Big problem, or maybe a little confusing/disappointing feature in this game is the money shown on NPCs that you kill around the map (what I mean is how it'll say that they have,for example, 6000 cats or money on them when you loot that character - but those 6000 cats are only pointed among their whole team put together; main problem is that the only money that you can obtain is the bounty on the leader which can be about 1000 cats). All in all, this game is HIGHLY recommended to those who like to play strategy games in an open world, build anywhere game. ~15/10			"

								It was a loooong time ago that I bough kenshi, when all characters we hairless, and the world was one big desert. There have been times when the game has been completely unplayable, bugs, glitches, crashes and low frame rates. Happily the game moves ever forward and gets better and better. That's not to to say there aren't still bugs and gliches, there are (I'm writing this review right after the game crashed to desktop), but honestly those problems don't stop this from being one of my favorite games of all time. The main hook for me is how you can create so many different stories with your character, a soldier, trader, thief, lord of your own settlement all starting from a nobody who gets beaten up and left for dead by everybody. I have a real emotional attachment to my characters, we have been through a lot in the 135 hours together. Honestly, I recomend this game to anyone who likes creating their own stories, RPG sandbox world and really some of the most entertaining fights ever.			"

 You Are Not The Chosen One Never has a game so bluntly said this (Besides Mount & Blade, but that didn't curb stomp it into your skull like this one does)Kenshi is not an easy game, at the start.But as with any game, you get better.You're going to fail, alot.But you'll learn more from these failures than anything else.And eventually, you will become  the one I'm not going to lie, this game can look quite bad, but that's not the point of this game to look amazing, it's doing  alot  under the surface.

								After playing the game for 10 hours straight, I was stunned, the beautiful rolling landscape and the music put together made for a wonderful game, at the time of writing this, the game is largly barebones, but with a wonderful creator behind it releasing many updates, the game is growing into one of the best buy's I have had this year, I strongly reccomend this game to people who love to fight, build a town, or just survive as a traveler.9/10 (for now, 10/10 once it is fully released, it is an incredible game.

								Saw this game featured in recommendations for several of my favorite games and some i have been following the development of for a while. I decided to give it a shot after reading comments on the atmosphere and music. Once installed i was quickly transported to a world of desperation and brutality. The learning curve is a bit intense, but the freedom granted by getting the gist of the smallest game functions grants enough reward that i think it could appeal to a fairly large portion of the gaming community.  As mentioned in other reviews, there is no story, there is no goal, and there is no point to survival other than those goals that you set for yourself. There is a potentially high true roleplay factor generated by the simple fact that each sect has its own set of rules and laws, You can either conform or reject, you can fight or flee, you can walk a fine line or separate yourself from ""society"" completely. Any play style can reap its own set of rewards and the replayability factor is very high.The negatives seem to all be the typical early access flaws, mainly in fine tuning a few lag issues, some buggy behavior in the town generation every so often (two builds of mine so far produced nothing but destroyed/abandoned towns and farms). There have been a few strange bugs involving theft and whatnot but nothing unmanageable or repeating on reload. If you are a fan of open world games, and NWN style squad based games, Use based skill leveling, base building etc... give this a shot. I don't have any regrets with the current price and am looking forward to being done with this review so i can play some more.			"

								Adventure, survival, RPG, we’ve all seen it before; no matter how many times a game promises that you will forge your own adventure, there seems to be only one effective way to play and one ultimate end where you have max-stats and all the rarest weapons. What if there was a game where you actually had options and could have your own adventure, where there are so many ways of getting through every challenge you face and so many ways to recover from such that in simply travelling from one town to another can end up with you making lasting fun memories and maybe some lasting great enemies?Like that time I was heading though a desert valley, got spotted by wild dogs who started to chase me, I ran as fast as I could and ducked into a shack at the nearby farm. The Dogs were distracted by the cattle which they attacked and brought down. The farmer and his family came out to try and fend off the dogs, I ran out to help but we were overrun as more dogs came. We were all knocked out from our wounds in the battle, I awoke later and did what I could to bandage myself and the dying farmer’s family but it was no use, the dogs came back almost immediately so I retreated to the shack and closed the door. When all was said and done I was the only survivor, I collected what supplies I could and snuck away as cautiously as possible. To this day the farm is a ghost town with an eerie lack of life, shrouded in the memory of that fateful day…Yes this game has bugs, the AI pathing is ludicrous and optimization is questionable, there are many features that are missing and seem to create holes in gameplay but never-the-less in its current state it is still bar none the best roleplay and best adventure game I have ever seen. There’s potential around every bend and every time you close out the game it’s a cliff hanger you just can’t wait to see resolved, if you are looking for an adventure game where the decisions you make don’t just put you closer to an ultimate end but rather shape your character and the world around you alike, then this game is well worth the $20… "

								The game is still in Alpha state. That being said, it is still an amazing game.Its an open-world sandbox game with no main character. No leveling up, no overpowered bosses, no magical ""Hero"" character. You start off as a regular Joe and can either join a major Faction to help you hone your combat skills or trek off into the wastes and ATTEMPT to make your own life in this harsh world with no mercy.I highly recommend this game. If your not too sure about purchasing it straight out, go to Desura and download the Demo. Its the same as the main game except with a 2 member squad limit I believe.			"

								Kenshi is a well thought out RPG and RTS that is still in development but I think with my playtime a review is granted and anyone looking for a good game that still has a lot more to come to it this would be one to look into. I bought this game early on in its development because i saw what they were putting together and its exactly what I look for in a game. The developer who started this wanted to make the game out of wanting to put together a game he wanted to play himself but couldn't find out there. This game when finished will be a high point in early access even with seriously long development it has shown what the potential of early release games should be and it will be a benchmark hopefully for other developers out there to stick with it and truly finish ones vision. Without early access I doubt this game would be where its at now as the development team grew as people purchased the game early which helped this games progress tremendously. Its at beta now with a few bugs but well worth it to see the progress being made to bring this epic scale game together. I enjoy playing it and spend hours on it when I do which shows signs of being an interesting game and its not even finished yet an people play it like it is. Out of the many games I have this one definitely stands out in the crowd and hopefully for you it will too.			"

								Started out with one man. Recruited a partner before leaving town. Instantly beaten by bandits and then captured canibals. One man escaped and managed to amke it to the nearest town. I had to watch my original character be carried away. That is until a flock of giant beak things riped apart the entire pack of canibals. My character wakes up from his coma and meets up with his partner only to both be knocked out by the next passing groups of bandits -_-After more time spent i managed to set up a base of operations between two cities and have runners who constantly bring supplies. We have six people and still barely can defend ourselves so we were all forced into slavery by a traders guild. All six of my people -_- I watched as my best warrior bled out while being carried across the desert i managed to escape with all of my characters and hide them until everyone forgot. Now i live cautiously slowly building up my people in preperation to start the biggest slaving industry i can.I love playing this game!!!			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi is a well thought out RPG and RTS that is still in development but I think with my playtime a review is granted and anyone looking for a good game that still has a lot more to come to it this would be one to look into. I bought this game early on in its development because i saw what they were putting together and its exactly what I look for in a game. The developer who started this wanted to make the game out of wanting to put together a game he wanted to play himself but couldn't find out there. This game when finished will be a high point in early access even with seriously long development it has shown what the potential of early release games should be and it will be a benchmark hopefully for other developers out there to stick with it and truly finish ones vision. Without early access I doubt this game would be where its at now as the development team grew as people purchased the game early which helped this games progress tremendously. Its at beta now with a few bugs but well worth it to see the progress being made to bring this epic scale game together. I enjoy playing it and spend hours on it when I do which shows signs of being an interesting game and its not even finished yet an people play it like it is. Out of the many games I have this one definitely stands out in the crowd and hopefully for you it will too.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game on a whim when it was still in Beta (I remember when my little baby Kenshi didn't have sound and occasionally the vendors in town could be found a few kilometers away from their shops trying to solo a squad of dust bandits) and after sinking nearly 500 hours into the game I can honestly say Kenshi offers one of the most innovative gaming experiences I have come across. The early stages of the game can be daunting and being that it is still in development it's easy to feel like the game is lacking content. However, the 'open-ended' tag on this game is no joke. As long as you are willing to emerse yourself in the world that Chris and the other developers have worked so hard to create you will find an overwhelming number of possibilities. Personally, I love this game and I hope to see Lo-Fi games receive the attention they deserve.			"

								This game is great if you have a big imagination.  There is no story, and there never will be.  Quests do not exist, but the developers are working on a job system which will give your characters some short-term direction; these ""non-quests"" will not advance a plot.  The map is large, some complain that it is too large, and there is enough explore.  The game is close to release and they've scrapped about 1/2 of the features that were listed back in 2013-2014 when I added this game to my wishlist.  The current experimental version is 95.14, full release is at 1.0.  I'm not sure what else they will drop before they release the ""final version,"" they have scrapped so much that the developers have stated that they ""may"" release a post final version patch which will add some of the cancelled features; but it seems more like they are eager to put this project behind them.Despite my concerns, I really like this game as it stands.  The premise is this right now: you start out with a character.  The character is weak.  Over time they develop their skills (combat, crafting, labor).  Eventually they're not weak anymore.  You can have up to 30 of these characters.  You can built a base, craft, trade, etc.  Since the game has no goals, the thought behind play ends up being.  It would be cool if I ..., or I want to have the best .... There are several factions scattered throughout the map with their own culture.  On final release you should be allowed to ally, and war with whoever you choose.As with any early access game: only time will tell what makes it into the final version.			"

								While still lacking fine polish, Kenshi is a game of absolute freedom wherein you start out as a noone but can become the leader of your own clan of nobodies!  Eventually through training and hard work your ragtag group can be turned into a force to be reckoned with that can carve out it's own existence in the harshness of the desert.			"

Early Access Review
								Honestly a very good and promising Early Access title. I'll tell you my story so far...It started off with just me and my dog. At the beggining things were tough, I was starving and only had 13 cats (Money) to my name, I've been begging in this little farm community for quite some time now, but the people have stopped just giving me food. I had no other choice, I started mining with the local populace to sell at the nearby market to get some food for myself and my dog. After about 10 days of selling iron ore I bought my first Bison and a bag to go on it's back. Now I started venturing further to the cities around the farm selling minerals to barely scrape by. I saved up some funds and bought some building materials to build my very own shack, nothing amazing and quite small, but it's the first roof i've had for a long time so i'm not complaining. After sleeping the night and eating some dried meat i built a well and a vegetable farm, along with a wheat field. Things were finally looking up.  The only problem now is that it's just me to defend against the local wildlife that pillages my fields of vegetables. Some days I spend the whole day inside just so the animals don't eat me. I can see the farm that I used to live at just across the river, it's quite nice out here when there's nothing trying to kill you. I woke up today and heard someone using my well and the clanging of the rock. Is someone stealing all my things? I walk outside to see my friends from the other farm across the river helping out here, I feel relieved as now I can focus on other things while they do the hard work. TLDR: If you're into a Village Building, Squad Tactis game with some RPG mechanics that's what this game is offering right now, not too much in the way of RPG right now but the games not finished yet. It's mainly just a build your own village right now, but it does a very good job at that. I definitely recommend this game.			"

Slow♥♥♥♥♥running.This is when the death march back to civilization began.Spiders, spiders everywhere. Took out the first few groups and bandaged up but began to get more and more beat up.Group of 8 spiders got me. Knocked me out and crippled my leg.Didn't die! Woke up but now even walk slower with crippled leg.Crippled leg and crazy amount of loot in inventory. I will not give up any loot. Too greedy. Keep walking at snails pace.Spiders again. Knocked out. Wake up. Spiders again. Knocked out. Wake up. This is my death march.Happens a dozen times and then i realize that i left all my food at the armoury to make room for more loot.So now I'm starting starve to top it off. Still a long way from civilization. Damn spiders. No fabric to make bed to sleep and heal. Starvation issue becoming more dire. So much amazing loot in backpack.No slavers around. No cannibals around. I might be ok. I am a walking living treasure chest for whoever decides to beat me up and steal all my glorious loot.Watch distance to town get smaller, as well as my stomach. Can i make it before i starve or run into slavers?Roll into town about 20 points away from death. Skinny as hell. Eat glorious meatwraps. Sell loot i dont want. Profit from deathmarch? Almost 175 grand. Greed paid off. Would death march all over again. One of my many adventures. Love this game. Support it. Buy it. Damn spiders.			"

Early Access Review
								So, I've only played Kenshi for a few hours so far and I will be honest it's been a strangely lovely experience. I have felt more immersed in this unusual game with graphics that remind me of the original dungeon siege games than Pillars of Eternity or Dragon Age, games designed just for that. I can't tell anyone what the progression will be like but I can tell the little story I've already created in my head from just a few hours has been, which made me laugh out loud and have to retell it to my girlfriend.I begun my adventure in a waypoint, barely able to comprehend the floor system and feeling completely useless and daunted. No one wanted to speak to me, there are very few npc's around who have dialogue except barman, potential companions and traders. I was unsure what to do; there are no quests, only a few tutorials to help guide you. I figured I should buy a water jug and saw another town on the horizon. Why not travel there, explore the lands and see what is offered. Kenshi is huge, you have to use the speed up options to cross these great canyons and deserts. I spent my first day travelling to the closest town I could see, which was actually an abandoned town with no one in it. However there was a copper ore vein, so I mined it. I had a dream of becoming a wandering swordsman, but this felt distant and mining was the first interactable thing I could do, so why not? Maybe I could sell the ore and buy a sword instead of this wooden club? Turns out swords are insanely expensive so maybe not.I tried to run back to the town where I started, but realised I was lost (I have later discovered that if you zoom into the map, more places are visable, duh) and found some bandits instead, waiting on the road. There was at least 20 of them, I was no match I knew it so I gave them 300 gold. Then, I had the option to talk to some of the bandits. Maybe they were friendly bandits now? I spoke to him, he demanded that I gave him 300 gold. Apparently not friendly then, I am a naive surviver of the apocalypse. I declined, as my money was already running short so he attacked me. So I ran. Apparently, that is something I am good at. I quickly out ran them, found another copper vein and mined a little more. I was getting better at mining at least.I explored, ran away from more bandits and mined a little more, selling some ore for food and a sleeping bag. Some hungry bandits chased me but luckily a group of slavers were there to help me out, defeat all the bandits with my assistance. Suddenly I had a t shirt, some terrible bandit gear to sell and things were looking good. The slavers looked preocuppied and I noticed they were picking up the unconscious bandits. I guess they were named slavers for a reason, but they wern't interested in me so I decided to carry on. I bandaged myself up but had a horrible limp but felt victorious and hopeful, I was progressing and had my first set of 'better' items.Eventually, I found the shek capital. In the bar their was a shek girl with broken horns. She asked me what I thought about fighting to the death, and I instantly decided to lie and said that is exactly what I would do and that I would never run when outnumbered. She wanted to join me (for free), and even though I still dreamt of becoming a lone swordsman, at least to begin with I could get the help of this shek women. We trained for a while with some training dummies, I had melee attack skill to 10. I felt ready to take on anyone. We left town and saw a tech trader walking down the road. It's time to test out our new skills, let's attack! At exactly the same time, 10 hungry bandits joined in the fight. The lone trader was armed with a katana and ruined us and all the bandits, leaving us all unconscious. I am not ready to be a lone swordsman yet it seems, but I suddenly wanted to be like him. When we woke, we took everything from the bandits (a cleaver, finally a better weapon), heal up and as it turned out, mine some more.On our way back to the shek capital yet MORE bandits attacked us. Spurred on by the lie I had told my companion, we decided to stand our group, outnumbered 6 to 1. Naturally, we were oblitterated. The same hero slavers who had saved me earlier in the game walked past, spyed us and heroicly destroyed these pesky bandits. Amazing, I love slavers. However, this time, we were the ones picked up. When we recovered enough to walk, we tried to limp away. Nope. The slavers came to us, knocked us both into COMAS and started walking towards the hub. COMAS. They dropped me on the ground, bored of carrying me I guess, just outside the shek city where I lay in a COMA for another 12 hours recovering from a stomach injury. My companion was halfway to the hub now. When I woke up, I picked my shackles, and stumbled into town to heal. In my hurry, I forgot to actually take off the shackles and the guards preceeded to knock me out into ANOTHER coma and put me in a jailcell. My companion was dumped on the road just south of the hub by these lazy, devious slavers who like to steal people and dump them randomly in the desert in comas. When she woke up she ran/limped back to come save me.She was sensible enough to take off her shackles and went to town to resupply when I bravely tried to escape the cell. Which took ages. She then proceeded to sneak to the guardhouse in the dead of night and wait for me to escape. It was 5.50am, almost dawn when I succeded. But how were we to escape? I was wanted by the entire city. But she wasn't. So she picked me up, slung me over her shoulder and ran out of town as an unsuspecting shek citizen. We ran to the nearest hill, shared a sleeping bag taking it in turns to rest up while the other mined (I was getting pretty good at mining). We had escaped, now we just had to avoid large settlements and mine and sell ore. I had a new dream now. No longer did I want to be a lone swordsman. I wanted my own group of companions. I was tired of being attacked by bandits and slavers, left in comas on the floor and then beaten up by alien guards and thrown into jail with my second coma of the day. I decided I would become a bandit myself. Suddenly, I had a plan...Never has a game made me subconsciously narrated such an indepth story in such a short time, especially without barely any dialogue. And thats why, even though I don't know if the game will be good or bad in the long run, it doesnt matter because of those first 4 hours.			"

								Kenshi is An amazing Open-World game! ive been up to date on it sense it began early access, and it has come a long way. I love to start a new game and create my own story, I honestly think ~ with how in-depth this game is ~ that one could write an interesting story from their gameplay. i may not have but 50- hours on this game, but that is due to the fact that my pc can no longer play the game smoothly enough for enjoyment. I hope more graphic options are added in the near future, but it would be more simpler for me to get a new system rather than them redoing their program for users. they have already done so much to make this game as fun and as in-depth as possible. Thumbs up, and Post your own recommendations to let others know of Kenshi!			"

The depth is perfect, I am always talking and look for more lore on the races and on the old ans new empires, I have played sense .40 or earlier I bought it right around when steam greenlight launched, I am iffy on time frames. I have tried my hardest to sell my friends on this game, few gave it a chance but those that did understand my love for it.

Went there, hoping for charity from preists or something.No, religious fanatics. Enslaved me after I tried to steal some food. Beaten, worked as a slave, tried to escape, got caugth, brought back to slavery. I repeatedly esacped, and repteadly got beaten and brought back to slavery.Until one time, they just stabbed me in the stomach, and left me to die.I didn't die. I survied, started mining ore and sold them to the Holy Outlaws, hired more people, eanred some money, and now we're travelling the world, and recruiting warriors to rebel agains the HOly Empire.

The beta has much more of a sense of immersion into the games rustic and barren wasteland, you can feel your fear running from town to town as you don't know if you have enough to bribe the bandits walking past, get eaten by cannibals or even stumble across a hive of cancerous BEAKED THINGS. Great game if you love the micro management , very difficult and time consuming game. However also very rewarding.8.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi is a very ambitious, low budget game. Unfortunately this usally results in a very undirected, dull experience and Kenshi is no exception to this rule. My experience progressing through this game was very unsatisfying. For a good portion of the game none of your characters will ever be strong enough to kill any of the animals or humans you encounter in the world. The most feasible way to progress I found, was to game the system by stealing valuable items from settlements that should have been defended were it not for bugs, or by leading enemy packs into guards then selling their equipment back to the people who killed them. If there were any legitimate ways to make a living in this game I was not able to find them. The world of Kenshi may be huge but there is so little to do other than run from stronger enemies while scrounging for abandoned loot to sell.What's rather impressive is the party system which allows you to split your tribe into smaller groups who are then able to travel all around the world in real time. However, loading between areas isn't instant, so while you'll want to constantly switch between groups to ensure that none are in danger, generally this will mean most of your time will be spent waiting for terrain to load.I don't believe the party system scales well either. For every group it takes nearly all your concentration to spot and avoid enemies. If you are split between two groups this becomes impossible so that the best strategy by far is to strip down all your survivors in order to outrun any enemy rather risk fighting some of them. This game would greatly benefit from some kind of spotting skill to empower the ai to avoid groups that are too strong, or at the very least it should include some kind of warning system.In short if this game had a team twice as large they might have been able to fill this world with interesting content but as it stands there's not much to do other than running around, hiding from enemies.

								This is one of the best games I've played in a long time. If a tactical sandbox rpg combined with city building and crafting etc sounds interesting, this is the game for you.It has a few glitches, mostly with the pathing at times but just saving and reloading usually helps.Also I captured a bandit, put him in a bed in one of my houses and then locked the door. When he woke up and tried to get out the game crashed.. verfied this happening 3 times in a row lol, eventually I just reloaded and carried him to a cage instead.Atm using 10+ captured bandits to train my recruits. They get their asses beaten all day long by the bandits, but some are starting to man up lol. When they are all unconscious on the floor my main character moves in to clean up and put them back in their cages. 9/10Can't wait to see what this game will become, one of the most enjoyable early access games I know. With some polish, optimization and a few more features I could see this game becoming a masterpiece.			"

								-IMPORTANT - > The first thing you should know about this game, is that the Devs care. I first realized this when the updates came not with speed, but with good, quality content. The Devs do not rush updates to make people happy, they are not filled with fluff and pointless things, but instead are filled with bug fixes and content that truly help advance the game state. In fact in a recent news post about an upcoming update the devs said ""•Entirely new world map.  More detailed and polished, new factions, new content, things to explore.  Its' like Kenshi 2.  Crazy.  I should have called it Kenshi 2 and charged for it again, but I didn't.  Damn."" That comment right there just shows you that these devs understand what other Early Access developers do, and that they are not like those other early access developers.Now for how I feel about the actual game. This game takes time to get a lot of enjoyment out of it, but you do get just that. In most starting scenarios you choose from, you are dirt poor, and you are nothing close to a hero. Kenshi is not easy, you'll most likely die quite a few times at the start. As time progressive you gain more members to your squad and your existing members become more experienced. There is a really great feeling that comes when your squad finally becomes strong enough to destroy a group of bandits without any outside help. Eventually you will be able to build an outpost, which if you do not build incorrectly can be quite difficult (and by incorrectly I mean not building a stone mine and building materials producer first thing). Eventually you will be able to build research stations which allow you to learn how to farm and create your own items such as armour and weapons. Even balistas and walls can be build eventually. If you put in the time this game can be vary rewarding, and best of all, a huge update is coming out quite soon, which will greatly improve the game. I 100% recommend giving this game a try, you will not be sorry.			"

Early Access Review
								When I first found Kenshi it was but a poorly formed early stage physics game set in the deserted land of God know where, I fought to create my kingdom and would eventually stick around long enough to see my squad grow large, slavers invade the land and cannibals rampage recklessly.Then things got stale, as progress was slow at best, I left for probably a little over a year, checking back here and there to see what's up.Thing's have really changed around here, the landscape is majestic and diverse(v90.X), the engine can still be slow at times but I am also running it on as high quality as the settings allow, which aren't too bad.My story starts in Western hive, I awake with my new found sword, a hefty bounty on my head of 10000 cats and basically nothing to my name, as I spend the early time exploring I quickly come to realize that while I can buy raw meat to cook I can't actually cook it around the hive or they will think I am stealing from them, and let me tell you having the entire hives personal army after you can be a scary sight.Once out of the immersive jungle atmosphere I found a familar sight of mountains followed by long flat sands. I made my way East.  Stumbling upon a large city, which I avoided once I realized the holy knights of whomever didn't like me so much, I turned North, towards a small mining community, there I learned the basics of sneak and thieving before eventually being chased out by the guards.  They didn't have much to offer anyway.Through the crashes as I tried to head into a misty valley I quickly turned back East and made my way to some small farming houses, here I learned the basics of Assassination, spending my time quickly smacking some basic farmers across the head and waiting for them to regain conciousness so I could do it again, it was a good chunk of fun watching my failures turn to *Thunk*s, but the holy paladins would eventually find my shenanigans and chase me out.From here I would venture further North, then East into the mountains, I had stolen just enough food from the farmers to get myself over the mountains.  It wouldn't be long before I would eventually find another mining community, here I truly refined my skills and smacking people over the head, and when I was all done and good I jailed the guards and freed the prisoners, who would for some ungodly reason choose to stand inside their unlocked cells permanently.  Whatever.After my skills in sneaking, thieving, and Assassination where at an all time high (and after battling through some crashes) I found myself back on the road and heading south, I needed food pretty bad, even if I had enough to tide me over for the next day or two.  Heading South in the mountains I ran into a strange man from the Adventurers guild, Paste was his name.  He never saw me, he was unconsious in seconds and before long I was trading my shirt and pants for his ninja garb, leather shirt and hat.  All of course of high grade quality.  I needed not for his weapons and left him to fight his way out wearing the trash I had just discarded.From his dreamland body I made my way up the nearby mountain where I ran into some ninjas, none of which seemed to rule the roost and all seemed quite pleased to simply sleep and smack the training dummies all day.  I joined in on this fun and boosted my otherwise pitiful swordplay to a reputable level.  Before long I tired of their boring game, and made my way back on the road.It was from here that I faced my true challenge, running farther south through the mountains I noticed a tower on the hill, hoping for more fun like the ninjas (but better) I made my way towards it.  As I reached the main gate I realized I had come across the main hideout for the Dust Bandits.  Oh how those buggers had long been a thorn in my side in patches previous.  It was time to see what they were hiding.Inside all but an unobservant sentinel were asleep on their bed mats, even the king of the bandits himself.  From this dangerous ground floor I made my way up and up to the prisoners floor, where I met poor old stupid Cat.  What an idiot, getting himself captured under the false pretense of being a noble.  Annoying to talk to as well.  I knew the king had to  be carying something worthwhile as his bounty nearly tripelled my own, 30k cats.So after talking to the buffoon cat, I waited and ambused one dust boss after another, until all 9 cages and 2 chain spikes had a prisoner attached, and there is poor old cat, unlocked chains and he's lost his mind, unable to leave from the shackles he has spent the past few seasons attached to.Not my problem though, I knock out the king and loot myself a beautiful new shirt, better than the last.  I proceed upstairs so I can unlock a nearby chest, looting all the bandits food supplies + a new small backpack to carry it in.Made off like a bandit in black, just before crashing again.Anyway,TL;DR immersive game, multiple play styles, okay graphics, choppy at times, loading can be annoying, map isn't full sized yet but speaks volumes for what it will be.  Talking to NPC's is sub par, sneaking system very easy to manipulate and break, same with assassination skill.  Thieveing a bit harder to bump up but seemingly good system.Great game if you can work around the current crashes and stability issues, very excited for the vision this game is headed for 7/10 currently, potential for 10/10 in the future.

								As it stands, this game too unpolished and has a long way to go until it is running as you would expect. If the developer(s) can deliver what this game sets out to be however, i will probably be spending as much free time as possible playing it as the potential is amazing. Just too many limitations as it stands, for example i spawn in some area and the map shows a town nearby, i go to visit this town and am greeted with a 'beta limitation prevents you from going any further' or something along the way. Head back the way i went to see if can discover another town somewhere and get killed by a boar or something, lol. There seem to be regular updates but at the moment when something gets fixed and several new issues arise. Saying that, if you enjoy Mount & Blade then you should enjoy this as it is a similar sort of game just in a different setting. With all that said this game is a tremendous amount of fun and i for one am willing the developers to get it completed as even with the content thats currently available, once its all working and running as it should then this game would be worth double the asking price.

Early Access Review
								The freedom in this game is amazing, you can do everything you want.The combat system is one of the nicest of ever seen, but can be very frustrating at some point.Training of your characters is a long process of grinding teeth and smashing keyboard, as you will be losing nearly every fight you get into, and especially at the start it will force you to alot of screenstaring before you can play again, waiting for your guys to heal up.Every little mistake is punished brutally hard, some early mistakes will haunt you later on in the game, rushing things will get you in trouble, the game is very unforgiving, and at times you even wonder if the game is even any fun at all, as you will get annoyingly frustrated at nearly every aspect of the game.From graphics, to Ai pathfinding, to combat to building, everything has something that will annoy the hell out of you, top this off that the game will put your PC to its limits, since the game is badly optimized.I cannot recommend it in its current state, unless you are able to cope with frustrations well, and have the patience of a dead cat.Still the game is somehow dispite it all, kinda fun and addictive and unique.But it needs stil alot more time to evolve its gameplay, as half of the features are incomplete or even missing, and that what is in, all has issues/bugs to a certain point.The interface is a utter mess, and doesnt handle big number of NPC's, but the game is all about having alot of NPC's working for you, so here it shoots itself in its feet. The Ai is still WIP and will make you cuss and swear hard at times, even make you wonder if they ever will get this right, if that is in a game on this scale even possible.Still yet what they have done in this regard is remarkable, but it does make you wonder if they arent pushing it to far, and that its even possible Ai wise to every get this working perfectly.This is one of those games, that is pushing the bounderies of gaming, giving a unique game that cannot fully be compared to other like-wise games, mostly due its scale and size with absolute freedom.And its logical this comes with a price, and the price is a very... extreme long development time, so i play the game now and then, to a point where you really notice its pretty much WIP and trying to play it further just makes you hate the game too much.And still.... if you can deal with this all.. its one of the most original hardcore brutally hard games out there, with topics most other games dont even dare to touch, slavery, extemetism, narcotics, crime and even cannibalism and opression, its all there.And some factions will put your moral compass to the test, and uther loathing them for what they stand for.I never had such feelings in any other game for virtual factions, but in this game, i really have a deep hatred for some of the factions views and laws...This is a game that you want to see completed, but you prolly have to wait a very long time before its done.Very fitting for this game, as the gameplay is nearly as slow as its development.I recommend this game only to those who can deal with the game, its certainly not a mainstream game.IF you cannot deal with bugs, unpolished gameplay, long development time, and frustratingly hard gameplay, with every odd stacked against you, you will not like the game at all..

Early Access Review
								This game is absolutely great for generating your own personal stories. Better so than most games of its ilk. It starts off at a grindingly slow pace, but once it gets going you'll have developed a deeply personal attachment to your first four or five guys in your party. Let me tell you one that I am very glad I experienced.Roud, A weak, hot headed man half starved and an injured arm has just barely escaped with his life from his sacked hamlet. The lone surviver and least respected of his people, is now thrusted into an unforgiving world with nothing but a pair of torn pants and a lead pipe. On his first week he attacks a small group of starving bandits, quickly learning just how easily outmatched he is by even the most ill equipped of raiders. He only survives thanks to wandering band of merchants who tended to his wounds while he was passed out. Thankful for his saviors, he decides to follow them. The merchants tolerate him, despite his almost complete uselessness. Roud acted as one of their bodyguards, slowly building up his strength and being able to suffer a few hits from a rusty sabre. Always reassured in the knowledge that should be begin to fail, the other bodyguards would be willing to lend a hand. He had his share of the loot since the merchants didn't take any interest on what the bandits where carrying, only focusing on running goods from town to town. This didn't last long for Roud however, for after two weeks they encounterd a large, organized group of bandits.He fought hard as did his allies, even managing to down bandit or two on his own, but merchants steadily began dropping one by one, followed by the guards. The main culprit? The bandit leader, adorned in heavy armor and sword far larger and more thick than any man should be able to wield effectively. eventually Roud met the end of the hulking nightmare of a man and was struck down.Miraculously, he woke up to a pile of eviscerated corpses and nothing but a minor cuts on himself. He had merely passed out from bloodloss, a massive relief to him. Even more miraculously he found the corpses five bandits including their leader, the very one who had slaughtered guards and merchants alike with ease. A band of Samurai can be seen from the distance, no doubt the perpetrators of such an act. Roud ignored the small fry and immediately pilfered the massive man's body, adorning his armor and plucking his sword from his cold hands, only stopping to grab a helmet from the one of the other dead bandits. His face now hidden behind a metal mask, his torso protected by iron platemail, and massive sword so heavy he must drag it along the sand, he heads west towards the nearest town, the one he had left only a few days ago following the merchants. After such a defeat, only one thing rested on his mind: ""I must become the strongest fighter in the sands"". He exhausted, he's injured, he's carrying valuable loot, and more importantly he's alone. When he arrives in town, the first thing he does is rent a bed and collapse.When he awakes, his mouth is dry. He heads to the local pub and trades all but his most valuable loot to the barkeep in exchange for a decent sum of cash and a stiff drink. Out corner of his eye, an absolutely gigantic dark skinned man stands in the corner of the bar with his arms folded. In dire need of an extra sword, he saunters over to the giant and drops a sack of coins in front of the man. ""Five hundred catts straight up if you join me"" The dark skinned man only nods and steps forward, only uttering what can be presumed to be his name ""De-Zerka"" The two left town that evening to wander the desert. They had very few victories, but each fight left them stronger, more experienced, and more dangerous. The two became close friends, and eventually made it to the point they could cleave through half a gang of bandits before going unconscious. This was a blessing, as they proved too risky to risk staying in the same viscinity, unconscious or not; not to mention having to tend to the wounded, if not outright abandoning them.Eventually, the two realized the necesity for a third sword, more importantly one who can sow and bandage wounds. The next town they greeted a friendly, short and nimble woman, ""Tuner"". When asked if she knew her way with a medkit, she nodded and hired her on the spot. She proved skillful with a katana, and very effective at not getting hit.The three travelled for a long while, long enough to be feared by many wandering parties across the desert. Even the Holy Nation, very organized, and heavily armored knights with fanatical beliefs, felt threatened by them, though their patrols only served as fodder for the party's quest for becoming the best fighters in the land. Along the way even allowing a Fourth member, ""Hanbu"", an man of average size, stout legs, and a firm back. He served mainly as the pack mule, carrying a large backpack for most of their loot to be stored. Even he became a formidable foe to fight against.By now, Roud had become a very skilled in his own right. His own hot headedness made him very aggressive, often charging straight into the enemy and going berserk. Not even a broken arm, cracked skull, and a knife in his gullet could stop his rampage. De-Zerka as well, wielding the looted armor from Holy Nation and weapon more reminiscent of a long, metal paddle than a sword, becoming renown for destroying a man's skull in one swing. Tuner kept mostly to the sidelines, choosing to pick off the bandits from the flanks rather than risk charging headfirst into danger. She was easily the fragile of the group, but most effective at dealing with the small fry.But this party would soon meet it's untimely end, their quest cut short.On their usual run between towns they  see a strange sight ahead. A gigantic mob swarming around the settlement. Upon further observation they realized it was cannibals. They would always travel in large groups, but never have they seen one as large as this. Their numbers were so many that their howls and cheers could be heard from miles away. At least 5 or 6 hundred of them. Not willing to travel to another town and feeling heroic, the party decides to attack the mob head on.The Cannibals came pouring from the gates, some of them carrying the unconscious residents with them and easily surrounded the party. Roud, whipped into a fury, charges deep into the mob, cutting down cannibal left and right while De-zerka, Tuner, and Hanbu instead of following him, stayed behind, choosing to cover their backs and fight defensively. Roud fought valiantly, but each hit the cannibals were able to connect with him wore him down. Slowly, but surely. All around him lie corpses, yet the chanting, screaming mass of ugly, tatooed abominations surrounding him were unfased. He had made a significant dent in their numbers, but there were still far too many to be considered done.A cry rings out, Hanbu had been struck dead. Tuner panics and runs through the thinnest part of the crowd, fleeing for her life as ten or fifteen cannibals give chase. Roud, distracted and dishearted, takes a blow to the head. He staggers, his vision blury, and he swings his massive sword into the crowd. Another blow, this to his arm: it dangles by his side, effectively usless in the situation. He continues to swing his sword, furious at his sloppyness, the death of one of his comrades, and the betrayal of another. No matter how many cannibals he slaughters it seems like no use as they wittle him down to the point where he can barely stand. He sees passed the crowd one of the tribal monstrosities carrying De-Zerka over his shoulder.... This was it... this is his last battle and it only took him until now to figure it out. He can barely muster enough strength to swing his sword one last time before a pipe to his head fells himBy the way the last bit was in no way an exaggeration, the game bugged and accidentally spawned a gazillion of cannibals. Good game			"

								This game is early access, like super early access. It's got bugs, and issues, and crashes from time to time. But its got potential, and already has many working features. But I love the game to bits already. Options are numerous is very custimizable, varied starting choices, even got mods!Some people fear that this game will never be finished; that it's just a cash grab, well they're wrong. The developer has monthly updates with what they're working on, what new features, races, etc are being planned.It's a giant endeavor, and the one single developer and a couple of hires are working as hard as possible to make updates live, but its slow work yes.If you're looking for a complete game, get the ♥♥♥♥ out now. But if you're looking for that something that fun that could consume hours upon hours of your time, this is it.You're looking for that 100% open world game, this is it.You're looking for something to hope for, to once more confirm the belief that a game in early access can become great? This is it right here.They even got a demo if you're unsure about buying the game yet!It'll be a slow process, but I am 100% behind this game and the developer(s)!More information at http://lofigames.com/ "

Early Access Review
Imagine if Mad Max was made by Akira Kurosawa.A desert world, bleak, hostile, vast.  Sparsely populated by junk towns and populated by newborn cultures based on old black & white samurai films, with a touch of the spaghetti westerns born thereof thrown in for good measure.  Men and women in coolie hats with katanas fighting against groups of bandits and crazed cannibals, trying to build secure outposts of safety in a violent and chaotic world.This was the game that advertised back when I bought into it.  This was the game that was promised.  Does this sound like a great idea for a game?  Does this sound like a game that you would want to play?  Well tough crap, suckers, because all that is going bye-bye!Welcome to a fantasy world filled with lush jungles, mysterious forrests, dangerous wolf packs, and strange races - bone men, bug men, and robots.  Oh joy, robots!  And giant monster things!  That's just what every samurai adventure needs, right?  That vast wasteland that took hours to cross is now a map ten times larger!  Why?  Because we can.  Not that you'll ever get any use out of that, but so what?  This game is no longer about wandering ronin traversing the desert in search of adventure.  It is now the living avatar of feature creep, fueled by what seems like some kind of unending mescaline binge and slowly morphing into new game entirely... a game that's only common denominator with the original is that there are swords.And all this has been while continuing to fail at fixing bugs that are literally as old as the game itself.  Constant crashes, dysfunctional pathfinding, and broken tools thrown around like a gas explosion in a mechanic's garage.  Rather than fix the game they already had they instead decided to turn it into a RTS version of Morrowind, only weirder, if you can imagine such a thing.Now maybe that is a game that you'd be interested in and I won't begrudge someone for liking that, but personally I don't care for the bait and switch.  I certainly do not appreciate the constant adding of more crap that I don't recall anyone asking for while everything that came before it is still horribly broken.I saw an idea, a great idea, for a game that I would like to play.  I paid for that game.  Today I see a completely different game being made, one that I simply have no interest in, while the one I bought was never finished - and never will be.So if you're looking for a high-fantasy, RTS version of your favorite magical wonderland, go right ahead and get Kenshi.  If you're looking for the post-apocalypse desert wandering ronin adventure originally advertised on the box then you're out of luck - keep looking, maybe someday, someone will make that game for real.Final note: Posting this as a review since I was being banned from forum for saying the same things.

								The game is exactly what you would expect from it, the pictures give out alot about the game. though the game has been in development for over 8 years now, its recent sucess as a green-lit steam game has enabled the team to grow ( 6 now), the game is pushing beta soon as many great features are being implimented. This game is aleady inovative and fun, a no loss investment with a great dev team that still hold onto their dreams for kenshi. Lo-Fi games could be standard barrers for what indie devs should be, but thier future as devs is still something to be seen, hopefully the team continues to grow and we could see even better, larger scope games from them.In short, defo worth the price and a safe investment for an early access.

								A game you can play your way, from wandering the world doing good or evil to making a village and expanding it to a town or a fort. Set up trade with other CPU towns and defend your self from the raiders and bandits that roam the land.This game is not finnished but its more playable than most other EA games and has a somewhat realistic feel, combat will result in damage to body parts, bleeding, broken limbs, coma's and even death, but fear not your villagers can not only heal each other buy carry them to bed to heal faster.well worth the asking price, rarely crashes but the combat can be a lil difficult early game due to poorly trained warriors.

								Kenshi is a RPG-RTS featuring a slow progression and massive learning curve. It's core features, being RTS battles and Dwarf Fortress-like base building, are made more complex with every patch. Though, it does lack somethings, for instance: The beginning starts you out fairly weak, even the beginnings geared towards making you more combat ready only leave you with a powerful weapon against an army of more experienced bandits.The difficulty fluctuated heavily a few hours in though. Even after amassing an army, you still aren't strong enough to take on a single bandit party. However, when you reach a point, and you've leeched a few kills off of guards with your squad of cowards, you're able to leave the game running with no fear of attack -- or agency. I'd automated an entire camp. Random events and the like, a feature of base-building games that it emulates, would and have been a boon. This game could easily be the greatest game I ever play -- the potential is there. I need that 3D dwarf fortress.			"

								A very well done game. Kenshi provides the player next to nothing and tells them to make something out of a harsh enviroment full of dire wolves, maruders, and cannibals. The hurde is very high for getting top quality gear and experienced people to use it, granted they arn't mauled or killed in the process. But after that, you run out of things to do. Point being, the journey to the top is fun and challenging, but the end game is boring.			"

								The Game:Kenshi is a game that can't be catagorized. It's a beautiful, sword-punk blend of RPG, RTS, and to some extent a city builder/Sims-style survival game where you cater to basic needs. The demo does the game little justice, and many people who rate it poorly probably never experienced the transition of this game into what it is now. The developers are committed to creating a living world, and tailors an RPG-style game where you are no hero. Even if you choose a start that makes you top dog when it comes to the scum of Kenshi, you bite the bullet. Pros: -Multiple ways/""genres"" to play.-Multiple settings for adjusting the difficulty, for better or worse.-Beautiful world, at least for an independently developed game. -Creature/racial artwork and variety is unique, and funnily deceiving (cute goats that can massacre a small squad).-Dedicated development team, which has proven itself over the long-term.-Lots of replayability, and even punishing starts can have a silver lining.-Combat can be sometimes frustrating, but always beautiful to watch, with drastic outcomes based on even the smallest decisions.-Character customization can be oddly entertaining, and...-Mechanics can be easily caught onto, and easier to work around with a little time and effort.Cons:-Bugs. Lots and lots of bugs. It was much worse at the initial release of the Beta, but within a week or so the most game breaking were patched. -The Dev team actively makes use of bug reports, even catering to some very specific issues players faced in the past.-World can be laggy, even on a good computer. This is, however, on high graphics and almost exclusive to high density bandit zones or rendering of the map.-Updates may feel slow, but minor ones with huge impacts are frequent.-Game can crash due to random errors introduced with an update (commencing specific research, as an example when the game entered beta), but these are once again usually patched within a day or few.-Can be painfully punishing, and some mechanics are unrefined, but bear in mind many mechanics are fresh to the beta and much of it is an EXPERIMENTAL build.Kenshi isn't everyone's cup of... well, dust and rust. Despite this, its flexibility, originality, and progression through the years has proven it a capable contender and worth the attention.			"

								Probably the most effective genre-busting game in its' time. It's real, -real- post-apocalyptic game that doesn't teach you anything easily and lets you figure the game out as you go, and if you're an idiot, you'll be killed. Be a smart survivor - Realize that people are absolutely insane who live in the wastelands and will likely rob you, or at the very worst, outright eat you limb by limb. - And those in the cities treat you as far as your money can throw you. . Passed that, they will let you die from starvation, don't care if you bleed out in the streets and die, may rob you - or they might  join you in your cause. . as long as you have the money to sway them. You can be anything from a Adept Scavenger quick on their toes and trade goods for great profit between towns, to a bandit crew who massacres a farmers village for their base and all of the goods within  - whom you can trade to a fence inside a town while in a disguise as to not alert Bounty Hunters or the guards of the nation whom you've killed their subjects, to a group of settlers trying to eek out an existence amidst the wasteland and start from a lowly village to a legendary town with an abundance of food and technology new to the post-apocalyptic world. You may learn of hidden locations, if you're lucky, and encounter a plethora of characters. . Though not all are friendly.You may be lucky and find a wandering traveler in which you can sell your goods, as well as purchase blue prints to upgrade your skill set or your very own Factional town - Of course you could just murder them and take all their goods, though you may incur a bounty that will cause you to be hunted by lawgiving police. - You could either turn yourself in and face a smaller stint in jail and/or be forced to slave away in the mines, OR you could become an infamous raider whose tales of dread are recognizable to everyone in the province. Of course,  you could always be successful noble and create your own Faction city in which all nations depend on for their trade and have the most legendary army that no one would dare question your authority. -- Or, if you were to be really ambitious, you could become an abolisher of slavery and take over the province as the rightful sire of the lands - if you're ready for hardship, effort, death, surprises, and ultimate victory.

								I remember stumbling across this game's website years ago, very early when it was a mere concept with a couple of screenshots. I didnt really understand it and there was no release or anything, but I liked the name and it had ninjas and open world rpg elements. I bookmarked the page and forgot about it until I found it on Steam when it first released as early-access. Bought it and it turned out to be what I expected from my first encounter. Different, with a learning curve, but extremely unique and tons of fun. Some of the coolest combat and health systems in any game ive played. Its early in it's stages but it is tons of fun with lots to do. The devs are active and fixing the game, and when there arent any game updates, they update us with progress and their plans for the future. buy this game			"

								I love this game, it combines the best aspects of an RTS base building game and an RPG, it has its fair share of bugs as an EA game. But nevertheless its a very good game. As of Beta this game is finally showing its true colors. They fixed most of the bugs that plagued the game and have implemented a huge new map as well as new races, and tons of new features, all around 80% polished and thank god its now pretty much crash free, after around 10 hours of gameplay only experienced one crash after dismantling a building with people in it. Everything else is pure perfection! Cant wait until they unlock the rest of the map, only about a 6th is playable right now and its still around 3-4 times bigger than the old map, its exciting and even more so since its now playable performance wise. If you where thinking about getting the game, get it now!			"

								(This review was created on March 3rd, 2014. It may become obsolete sooner or later.)This game has potential. It really does. It's a sandbox in a steampunk neo-feudal Japan-esque setting. The dev has not clarified what's going on and probably won't tell us for a very long time. I bought this before it was released on Steam, and I have to say: It has grown. It has trading, city building, realistic warfare, a complex medic system, and a whole lot of other things. There is one major issue that has been plaguing the alpha: a good portion of the game progression right now is attracting bandits and luring them to town guards. Once you have accumalated enough ""Cats"" you can try your hand at founding a faction, building an army, then start a town. Recent updates have added more difficulty to maintaining your humble abode. Raiders will come knocking and try to extort money off of you and cannibals will invade and attempt to take you and your men to their kitchen. You can research new technology with a certain workbench, but I won't bother saying much since I have yet to experiment with it.So. Do I recommend this game? Sure, but not in it's current alpha state. If you want to invest in a gaem that has a bright future, go ahead and buy it. Just remember that it's alpha.			"

								Okay where to start, While I am giving this a positive review let us take that at face value. I feel as if the game is good and is going to be great when finished but if judge the game by what it should be then we often give false review's. I see the game as fun to play as new content is added each time I find myself playing more and more. Now what I do see is a huge amount of bugs while they can be overlooked they are an annoyance that can all but bring me to not want to play for at least week, now I will cite an example of my own experiance, I was playing the game when two of my men were caught stealing the guards took them but didn't lock them up instead they just carried them and went to a guard position and just stood there holding my two men even after there time was up the two guards would not put them down I tried everything restarting the game, reseting squad positions, and even attaking the guards but it was to no avail, its little stuff like that what I cited that can make the game feel almost unplayable once glitch caused me to lose two of my best men in one run. I also question why would they put us in the most racist part of the map, almost making it impossible to play as the shek as new person to kenshi? Looking over it, I would rather have a more polished experiance with less content then a buggy large amound of content, overall though I can't talk bad about the gameplay though, its fun and addictive, building your own settlment or industry maybe even a small army, the choices make the game unique. I give the game in a conclusion a 7/10 a standard score which if the game is improved upon could easily be an 8 to 9 out of 10. "

								If you ever want a game to succeed, you must keep your players invested. If there's anything I can say about Kenshi is that it has definitely gotten me invested in bettering my character through hours of training. The first time my bad♥♥♥♥♥level 50 Attack and Defense character took down an entire cannibal camp, I felt like I had truly accomplished a feat (considering how much trouble I had with them in the beginning). Watching him cleave unhindered through their bare, tattoo-ridden bodies made me so happy, albeit a bit doubtful about my sanity at the time. I can safely say that Kenshi has finally fulfilled my desire for a squad-based game in which individual progression and background really means something to me.Now, I just want to address something that many of the backers of Kenshi have been pondering recently. Lately, Lo-Fi's been making some good progress, having implemented DX11 into the game (though it is very unstable), and added a new race and such, which is all great! But, simply said, it's still been very slow. However, I don't believe, like many people do, that this game is going too slow. In my opinion, and I feel as if people have forgotten this what with triple A games and the likes such as Star Citizen, indie developers should be slightly exempt from the time-frame criticism. I think this is especially true for a game like Kenshi, which hasn't even received that much funding. These guys need to make a living, and nagging them everyday isn't going to fix that. I guess you could say that I don't want people who are pursuing their dreams to be discouraged for going too slow.Keep it up, Lo-Fi. I still have high hopes for this game!			"

								Kenshi is a unique game that is finding its niche in a mix between an RTS, Sandbox-Builder and Survival game with possible future elements of an RPG. While it's still in Alpha it is a very well polished game that offers hours of play and even more replay-ability. It's definitely not a game for the easily frustrated because you'll find yourself starting as probably the weakest character in its yet-to-be-defined universe. Combat reflects a very realistic feel at the start: You're weak and everyone can and just about will kill you. It's a game of judging whether or not combat is really worth the possible outcome. Groups of 2-3 bandits will destroy you at the start so luring them back to larger groups is pretty much you're only option while you slowly build up the skills of your character. Having a large party will improve your odds but if they're still untrained it would be like sending a bunch of children to fight an adult. Yeah, they may overpower the adult but more than likely they'll all get beaten. There's already several ways to make money and the economy in the game is being tweaked. This just means you don't always have to fight bandits and other patrols to get the capital necessary to start your own outpost. Then when you have that the game definitely delivers several different ways of improving your little town and building your own army. I recommend trying this game out. There's a demo version of it available somewhere, in case you're the type worried about purchasing and not liking games still in development.			"

								It's a pretty good game and worth keeping an eye on. Most glitches can be resolved by saving and loading the save which takes maybe ten seconds. It has a long way to go before it becomes worth more than twenty dollars, but for now that's a fair and economical price for the promises being made and the content we're getting. Keep in mind that this is an alpha. It is not smooth, it is not spitshined and polished, and it is not complete. Do not cast any final judgements until you're looking at a final product. For now, keep an eye on this game. It's shaping up to be uber fun.			"

								This game is a masterpiece. Despite the fact it's still a work in progress with some minor and some major tweaks. I first downloaded this game when it was F2P. It was a slow start, the game was very dry and I found myself getting bored very quickly. I didn't hesitate to delete it and this was I think, back in 2012. I decided to give it another go in early July 2016 and boy was I in awe. I honestly didn't know what to expect this go round but, I am definitely impressed with the direction the developers took with it. It's almost like you're absorbed in a fantasy world where self-preservation is key.  you kill, you starve, you build, you recruit and you defend what you work hard to accomplish. If the developers read this, I love sandbox games. I was kinda heavy in to ""Omertà city of gangsters"" I believe if Omertà had the mechanics that Kenshi has, it would not have been such a disappointment. Please develope a gangster game for all of us mobster fans.			"

								Takes about 1-3 hours to get a grip on what's going on in the game and how to do anything. Once you grasp it, though, it's one of the most thoughtful and creative games you can experience. Lots of tiny details make it that much more realitic and thrilling to play. Plus, the aesthetic of the game is mad wicked. It's like steampunk without the autism. Many different ways you can play the game, many different paths to take, many different variations on how you do things. Overall best game I have played in a long while, a very good break from the monotony of today's gaming industry.It's relatively new, so there's a few glitches and bugs. It only really gets annoying if you have a big automated base and your farmers keep getting stuck under the stairs for no reason.However, this game is definitely worth it. It's worth a lot more than $20, I can't wait to see how they improve it. I'd recommend anyone to buy this (I already bought a copy for my friend).			"

								Amazing open world game. Lots of potential, I find that I sometimes lose myself in this game. It's very easy to start playing and get so involved, you just go ""whoops, got fired because I haven't moved from my desk in three days.""			"

								Train! Gather! Build! Get beat up! Do it over again! This game is so much fun, it's scary. It's slow paced, but the feeling of reward is fantastic. Never before have I cheered for a character of mine so much. No other game gives you the feeling of watching the process of training from end to end, and you'll get a big smile on your face the first time your character takes down a dust bandit on their own. Fantastic game, 11/10 will play again. Oh, and you can build your own city.			"

								Do I recommend this game, Yes. But not for everyone.This game has the potential to be Frak'in amazing.  I've been following the game for a year or two, and their have been patches and addition that come relitively frequently.  Personally, I was hoping for the game to develope faster, but their are quite a few things that they are putting together, and the interactions between each Start location/faction/character skill/base construction/tech advance/and so on...  is a very complicated to balance and intagrate.The're quite a few bugs still in the system, like pathing issues, caravan guard ""visits"", building inaccesabilities and such, but they are slowing fixing bits and pieces. In recent patches, you have been allowed to assign tasks to your ""villigers"" and they would run arround and complete that task with no further intervention on you behalf; Which was an awesome upgrade from before.Remember before you continue to read this that the game is still alpha.But, to sum up some of the issues that are negitive. you have about 5 primary stats, and currently have access to 3 of them, of which one was only recently added (Toughness).  their are about 6 or 7 weapon skills, of which you currently have access to only 4 of them, and unarmed is not one of them. their are about 20 or so skills, like armor smithing, weapon smithing offence, defence, medic, labourer, engineer, science, and a couple of others. You have access to all of these skills but their are about half that you don't have access to. Again this game is still in Aplha!The awesome thing is that what is planned is things like, renting a building in a City to use a as a store front. Being able to replace severed limbs with robotic ones. Building cities, creating trade routes, starting you own faction (possably even your own empire) and so on.I'd like to recommend this game to everyone, but some people will not be able to enjoy it becuase its not completed, yet.I would advise to those people to add it to their wish list and follow the updates as they come out.To those of you who don't mind a game that is in the works, and can play though and help identify bugs, strap on a sword and come adventuring/build a city/trade with npc's/scavenge the unconsious bodies of the fallen/ or just plain become the scourge of the wastes, this game's for you.

								This game is a masterpiece. Despite the fact it's still a work in progress with some minor and some major tweaks. I first downloaded this game when it was F2P. It was a slow start, the game was very dry and I found myself getting bored very quickly. I didn't hesitate to delete it and this was I think, back in 2012. I decided to give it another go in early July 2016 and boy was I in awe. I honestly didn't know what to expect this go round but, I am definitely impressed with the direction the developers took with it. It's almost like you're absorbed in a fantasy world where self-preservation is key.  you kill, you starve, you build, you recruit and you defend what you work hard to accomplish. If the developers read this, I love sandbox games. I was kinda heavy in to ""Omertà city of gangsters"" I believe if Omertà had the mechanics that Kenshi has, it would not have been such a disappointment. Please develope a gangster game for all of us mobster fans.			"

								If you ever want a game to succeed, you must keep your players invested. If there's anything I can say about Kenshi is that it has definitely gotten me invested in bettering my character through hours of training. The first time my bad♥♥♥♥♥level 50 Attack and Defense character took down an entire cannibal camp, I felt like I had truly accomplished a feat (considering how much trouble I had with them in the beginning). Watching him cleave unhindered through their bare, tattoo-ridden bodies made me so happy, albeit a bit doubtful about my sanity at the time. I can safely say that Kenshi has finally fulfilled my desire for a squad-based game in which individual progression and background really means something to me.Now, I just want to address something that many of the backers of Kenshi have been pondering recently. Lately, Lo-Fi's been making some good progress, having implemented DX11 into the game (though it is very unstable), and added a new race and such, which is all great! But, simply said, it's still been very slow. However, I don't believe, like many people do, that this game is going too slow. In my opinion, and I feel as if people have forgotten this what with triple A games and the likes such as Star Citizen, indie developers should be slightly exempt from the time-frame criticism. I think this is especially true for a game like Kenshi, which hasn't even received that much funding. These guys need to make a living, and nagging them everyday isn't going to fix that. I guess you could say that I don't want people who are pursuing their dreams to be discouraged for going too slow.Keep it up, Lo-Fi. I still have high hopes for this game!			"

								Kenshi is a unique game that is finding its niche in a mix between an RTS, Sandbox-Builder and Survival game with possible future elements of an RPG. While it's still in Alpha it is a very well polished game that offers hours of play and even more replay-ability. It's definitely not a game for the easily frustrated because you'll find yourself starting as probably the weakest character in its yet-to-be-defined universe. Combat reflects a very realistic feel at the start: You're weak and everyone can and just about will kill you. It's a game of judging whether or not combat is really worth the possible outcome. Groups of 2-3 bandits will destroy you at the start so luring them back to larger groups is pretty much you're only option while you slowly build up the skills of your character. Having a large party will improve your odds but if they're still untrained it would be like sending a bunch of children to fight an adult. Yeah, they may overpower the adult but more than likely they'll all get beaten. There's already several ways to make money and the economy in the game is being tweaked. This just means you don't always have to fight bandits and other patrols to get the capital necessary to start your own outpost. Then when you have that the game definitely delivers several different ways of improving your little town and building your own army. I recommend trying this game out. There's a demo version of it available somewhere, in case you're the type worried about purchasing and not liking games still in development.			"

								When it is completed, eventually, the realized vision of this game will be truly incredible. However, as early access goes, this will take a while to be completed. Currently, most of the game developement is features implementation, because the groundwork has only been laid recently, but after six years of developement I seriously expect a finished product you can be proud to have supported. Very soon, enough features will have been implemented for the final phases of developement to begin, but make no mistake, this game will be finished one way or another, and as most of the features are being added now, now might be the time to get with the program and take an interest in the project.

Fight bandits to the holy empire, treat the wounds with careful first aid and carry the fallen to safety!If you love RTS games as well as ""sandbox"" games this is the game for you!			"

								Purchased this game back in April of 2013, played it for around 8-10 hours, then put it on the back burner. Came back a little over a week ago, and have since put 50 hours in. This game has improved so much its crazy, I love it too much.Start with the drawbacks-- Pretty buggy, but there is usually a work around that is a little inconveniant but fixes the issue for a while. - Pathfinding is hilariously bad- pretty hard if you dont know what your doing- no real intro to the game or what to doHere are the reasons i stick around - + Completely open ended, this is a hugeeeeee turn on for me (Could be a negative if you need set goals, as there are none)+ Love the building crafting system+You are free to have a squad of just you, or a squad of loads of people (more than 10 needs some mod help (but you can have 30 in vanilla, just split in 3 squads))+ Learned curve is satisfying, not too steep, but its there. + Loads to explore, and a ever present sense of danger+ Getting a charactor OP in stealth is pretty fun/funnyStuff Im not really into / Dont know much about - | I dont do combat much, i am mostly just a trader with a walled off town, i fight pests, not people| Cant say much about the experiance with other races, as i play soley human, because i like the protection of the holy nationTo be honest, the bugs in this game drive me up the wall, and make me clench my fists in rage sometimes. They can get frustrating, and the lack of fps is annoy af, but i keep coming back, every time i rage quit due to a bug, or a bad battle, i always come back, i have had dreams about this game for chistsakes. This is the game *I* have always wanted, it may skew my judgement, but i would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat.			"

								Dope-a-lisious.  Very unique, completely fresh new game!  Nothing really to compair it to cause it's so one of a kind, except maybe (it's like WarBand, the best game of all time, except without the advanced combat sim but introduces crafting and building instead).  But open world sandbox RPGs are the way of the future!!  Still rather rough around the edges, I hope the devs keep chugging.  Specifically, it needs SOUND updates.  There are no battle souns effects which really takes away from the experience.  And the sounds that are included seem like a cheap quick afterthought... Needs some work dudes.  Also needs some general polishing overall.  But on the right track! And totally t*ts in it's current state!			"

								Purchased this game back in April of 2013, played it for around 8-10 hours, then put it on the back burner. Came back a little over a week ago, and have since put 50 hours in. This game has improved so much its crazy, I love it too much.Start with the drawbacks-- Pretty buggy, but there is usually a work around that is a little inconveniant but fixes the issue for a while. - Pathfinding is hilariously bad- pretty hard if you dont know what your doing- no real intro to the game or what to doHere are the reasons i stick around - + Completely open ended, this is a hugeeeeee turn on for me (Could be a negative if you need set goals, as there are none)+ Love the building crafting system+You are free to have a squad of just you, or a squad of loads of people (more than 10 needs some mod help (but you can have 30 in vanilla, just split in 3 squads))+ Learned curve is satisfying, not too steep, but its there. + Loads to explore, and a ever present sense of danger+ Getting a charactor OP in stealth is pretty fun/funnyStuff Im not really into / Dont know much about - | I dont do combat much, i am mostly just a trader with a walled off town, i fight pests, not people| Cant say much about the experiance with other races, as i play soley human, because i like the protection of the holy nationTo be honest, the bugs in this game drive me up the wall, and make me clench my fists in rage sometimes. They can get frustrating, and the lack of fps is annoy af, but i keep coming back, every time i rage quit due to a bug, or a bad battle, i always come back, i have had dreams about this game for chistsakes. This is the game *I* have always wanted, it may skew my judgement, but i would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat.			"

								Kenshi, this game has never failed to disappoint.  I've been with it since the greenlight, before there was even audio in the game.  I think that is probably the main point.  This game has been in development for awhile now but Lofigames has not done what other developers have done and simply abandoned the game.  Yes the progress has been extremely slow (small updates) but there have been constant updates.  Each time I come back to the game, yes I do stop once I've explored all the features, there is always something new to explore.  But the point is, it has never stalled out, there are always updates.  Lofigames has always continued on with development.  I'm not going to sit here and tell you about the features of the game.  Figure it out for yourself, just know that it will definitely be worth your time.			"

								The developers are really taking their time with this one.  Upon release it's gonna be a great game.  They are fixing bugs and taking time to really make it fun.  I've seen this game grow over the past two years and it's really turning out to be a good g ame.It has a fairly steep, but rewarding learning curve, so be prepared to be frustrated early on as bandits overpower you.  They are making ways for you to run away from slavers asap and escape from slavery if you are attacked and knocked unconscious, then kidnapped by slavers.  Often early on, its simply easier to run from bandits than to get slaughtered.Early on, try to spend money on building up your team.  Having many low skilled npcs on your side is a huge bonus against the highly skilled enemies you'll face.  If you can, train them up on the training dummies in the towns before heading out to the dangerous wastes.			"

								Do you remember the good old days with D&D and using your imagination and how invested you were in your characters? How you died early in the beginning over and over again in anguish? How you kept coming back to this painful experience because you were hooked?... That's Kenshi minus the magic and in a total new world with new races, new Lore and mystery. And yes very very painful in the beginning. As you can see I have put over 300 hours in this game and only scratched the surface of this game.By the way it is in Beta not Alpha and it is much more stable. The world is huge and only 1/3 of the world is open at the moment. If you have the patience with bugs and can contribute to the development, this game is well worth it!  Don't expect hand holding or that you start off  as the chosen  one... But just like the good old days, you can slowly and painfully be pleasantly surprised how strong you can become.			"

								A Squad-Based Sandbox RPG, where you can become and do (almost) anything you want.So I became a rotting carcass after my first encounter with a group of Dust Bandits. 10/10!I purchased this game a long time ago in early-alpha state with nothing more than a desert map trying to survive in my own created settlement. I set up a small trading caravan and travelled across the desert to purchase and sell good for the highest profit. I really enjoyed it but stopped playing for some reason I can't recall.Recently rediscovered the game and came back to a brand new world. Some amazing new features have been added, like a completely new map, new species (love the Shek and Hiver Races!), new skills, new researchh tree. Really Enjoyed it once more!For people who don't know if they should buy it, just do it. It takes a bit of time and practice to get used to the game, but once you do you're hooked!			"

								The amount of work that has been put into this early access indie game is phenominal. Hands down a great and engaging game that has completely changed everytime i play. This game came a long long long way from the initial release and i pray to god the good work keeps up to improve the game (especially in terms of stability) so that this titile may rival mainstream games. The concept is unique and a lot of work has been put forth into making it engaging and visually appealing. 10/10 keep up the good work and if you are new to the game dont let the brutal difficulty at the start discourage you. play tactfully and use city guards for help hahaha. I love how this game focuses on your people just being a ragtag group of average individuals.			"

								An RPG game with quite a nice graphical detail and quality. Kenshi is quite fun and addictive even though it's still in Alpha stage. It has a few bugs here and there (mainly movement), but they are normally just a slight annoyance. If you know and love the web browser RPG games Caravaneer and Caravaneer 2, you will probably love Kenshi as well. It is similar in many ways, with the difference being that Kenshi doesn't have a story line and is in 3D.Build version when I wrote this review: v0.74.32.Some tips I'd like to share with everyone who is new to Kenshi:-- Ctrl + Shift + F11 will probably be your best friend in the game when it comes to getting characters unstuck. -- If you are having problems renting a bed to sleep for your character to recover quickly, and you have more than one character in your party, use any of them to pick up whoever that needs a rest and place them on the bed. This allows you to use the bed for free as well. Recovery while standing still is a very slow process unless your characters have a high toughness value.-- Even with the fast forward button, Kenshi can still be fairly slow. The start of Kenshi will probably be a slow one unless you get lucky. Don't worry about creating a settlement early on as it isn't really important. I took about 100 game days to start establishing my settlement after I got enough money and was satisfied with my crew members' skill level.-- The training dummies provided at towns can only train melee strength until level 4. Don't bother leaving your characters to train after that because you'll be wasting your time.-- Make use of the melee defence button for weak characters. You can train their melee defence easily this way while buying time for your attacking characters.-- Loot high value items from bandits only (weapons, headgear, shoes, and armour). Keep an eye out for sand ninjas because their armour is nice and light, and so is their weapons. Take note that their stats are quite high though.			"

								Like many others, I bought this game a few years ago. Back then I could only think of one thing: rough. Really rough. The UI was simple with very basic sliders, the sand on the ground was smoothed over as if detailed in microsoft paint, and the game was completely unforgiving. I revisited this game in 2017 and I can safely say everything that was rough about the game back then has been improved and ironed out including the unforgiving nature of the game.   This is one of my favorite games i've ever played because it fits a neat niche I didn't know I was searching for.  You create a character or a few and set out into a wasteland. To give players guidance, it is reccomended you start mining and selling until you can safely equip your character(s). From then on is up to the player to do what they wish be it mining, fighting, basebuilding, slaving, stealing, etc. This is a strategy game with real time combat. You select your character and right click on a potential threat, and your character fights. This is melee only combat, so battles are fought with swords, greatswords, katanas, etc. Depending on the skill levels of your characters and how geared they are compared to the threat will determine the outcome of total defeat, or victory. Player controlled characters have skills that can be trained to better cooking, fighting, mining, and smithing. To train these stats, the characters must do the action to progress. Training toughness for example is done by getting your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥whooped. Being downed in a fight and getting back up and surviving increases your toughness exponentially. This means you can stay alive and fight longer. This was such a great mechanic for me; in other strategy games, losing a battle would always have me restart to see if i could change the outcome. With this game however, if i lost a fight, I would try to get the character back up and limp back into town to recover. This mechanic is a small example of how the developer utilizes mistakes and losses and benefits the player with not only lessons learned, but stat boosts as well. The developer of Kenshi has made a game in which stories are unfolding for the player each time they play. With the open nature of this game, I've had plenty of intriguing moments. One in particular was mid game. I had a three characters all who wielded heavy weapons squaring up against seven bandits. My main character Jack swings his enourmous sword and staggers 4. I manevuer the other two around to get a better position but they're caught off gaurd and take damage. My tank named Bard breaks his right arm and has to use his back up weapon. As he swings he gets struck down and knocked out. I send my doctor Soo to heal him while my main character jack fights the remaining bandits. One by one the bandits dropped until the leader strikes down Jack. Soo sees this and enraged, pummels the bandit leader. Jack gets up clutching his broken chest. We need to get back into town before more show up, so Jack picks up bard and throws him over his shoulder. Jack and Soo both crippled and beaten limp three in game hours to find a town to rest their wounds. After resting up, they venture into the wasteland once again. I love this game.  "

								Brutal, lovely, lonely, and wicked. There are many games, and there is Kenshi, too. Not since Dwarf Fortress have I had such a primal connection to a digital dude. Kenshi is like a greedy nerd, it steals all the good ideas around it and  claims them as it's own. And it is wildly successful, there are few sandboxes as interesting as this one. You'll set out to make a mark for yourself, but be lucky to not get obliterated by a herd of goats on your journey.It's a game that, as I can see in my 'Guy and his Dog' initial playthrough, wants you to explore it. There are a number of different launch conditions and each is different enough to warrant at least a gander. $20 is not a lot of money anymore, but Kenshi is sure enough a lot of game.Hardcore stuff, I couldn't recomment his game any higher. This is dystopia.			"

Early Access Review
								A Squad-Based Sandbox RPG, where you can become and do (almost) anything you want.So I became a rotting carcass after my first encounter with a group of Dust Bandits. 10/10!I purchased this game a long time ago in early-alpha state with nothing more than a desert map trying to survive in my own created settlement. I set up a small trading caravan and travelled across the desert to purchase and sell good for the highest profit. I really enjoyed it but stopped playing for some reason I can't recall.Recently rediscovered the game and came back to a brand new world. Some amazing new features have been added, like a completely new map, new species (love the Shek and Hiver Races!), new skills, new researchh tree. Really Enjoyed it once more!For people who don't know if they should buy it, just do it. It takes a bit of time and practice to get used to the game, but once you do you're hooked!			"

								I have been following this games since months, finally I made that hard decision of taking a risk of buying an Early Access game (I just Hate Early access games).However, I found that this was really worth the investment. Kenshi is a genre in itself. You are thrown with a single player (or a group depending upon your choice of gameplay at startup), to live in a harsh world. Now it is upto you as to how you play and what your objectives are. You can buy backpacks  and bulls and be a trader, or you can create industries and be an industrialist. You may choose to become a fighter and hire and train other fighters, to create a fighting squad and boast your power upon the world, or you might want to be an ordinary man (or women) trying to survive and live in this world. On the downside, the game is an unfinished product and has performance issues (The devs have promised to improve performance significantly in coming days), and bugs. But it is still very playable and appears like a Beta version, though it is listed as alpha.			"

								I really like this game, I'm not entirely sure why I do.  It could be the brutal difficulty, or the fact you can play about five different ways, and it feels like radicaly different games in doing so.1) Base building and trading2) Mercenary and Bandit hunting3) An RPG with a small well monitored team4) Grand stratagy with dozens or more soilders (I once had 256 at one time, all outfitted differently).5) All of the above at the same time.The game is a massive time sink, and I often find myself starting it up and playing it whenever I'm not sure what I'm in the mood for, or if it has updated recently.  It is a game where time goes to die, and you will find yourself at a loss of what happened to the last 12 hours of your life.  Overall, I recommend it to anyone who likes micro-management games with lots of little details to go over and make sure are working.Some downsides are, the graphics aren't the best, and there are some clip issues, and the base building could be a lot more natural, but I think even with those falls it works as a game.  But like I said, no idea why I like it as much as I do, just if you aren't sure about it, and you like micro-management stuff, well, give it a try!  If you don't like managing inventories and resource management, and always needing just a little more cash, not for you.			"

								This game has a lot of good things going for it.  One of my favorites is the ability to choose how you wish to play, be it one man rpg or a squad based builder, whatever you like.  That said, the level at which it runs is just awful.  I've checked time and time again to see what might be bottlenecking my system on this game, in particular, but have found nothing to suggest it is anything but poor optimization.  I get that it's in alpha, beta, whatever, but it's been out quite a while.  I imagined it wouldn't run like♥♥♥♥♥♥anymore, but alas.  If you can get through the stutters, or hell, if you don't have them at all, great!  There's fun to be had with Kenshi!  I know I enjoy the game, but the performance issues have turned me off to it.  I look forward to seeing it in its final iteration, but til then, I'll be leaving this one alone.			"

No pay to play dlc or any of those useless things in here. This might be the only game I would buy them though lol. Really makes you want to get a bucket of rocks and throw at the teams of game designers that have the bank backing them and make a third of a product this game has.

Early Access Review
								There is so much to be said about Kenshi... I will try my best to structure and condense it in a way easy to go through.First and foremost, Kenshi already is everything it promises to be in the descriptions, no exaggeration. A very important thing to state for an early access indie still in development, in my oppinion.Even in its yet unfinished state, the game world feels real. One might be concerned that a game that tries to be too many things at once might feel disconnected, stitched together and some portions of the gameplay might feel out of place. Kenshi however manages to turn city/base building, classical RPG and open-world exploration in one complex experience, with a reasonable amount of atmosphere on top.Going through this experience is strangely captivating, with a dose of small but noticeable wonder. The first time I realized how weak I was on my own, the first time I realized I can use my other party members to distract guards and shopkeepers so that I can thieve safely while wandering around a shop. The point at which after a lot of building and researching my outpost finally started looking like a small village, my first attempt at raiding an ancient lab that ended with half of my 10-people away team slowly carrying the other half to the nearest village, but with everyone alive and with spoils to show for it...On to the less important things, the game's graphics are good enough considering they are not the focus, but do look a little dated. Soundtrack is good but a bit repetitive.It is stable, in my 40 hours of playing it crashed once, and that was after intense and prolonged Alt+Tabbing to and from it so that is fine in my book.Overall, the game is a great pick for any classical RPG and/or Sandbox fan.

								Kenshi.Purchased 16th Dec 2014.Playing as  Hive drone, one of 4 playable and original races (minus the obvious humans who have various subraces) whom I named Peaceful Kubo, I started in a Holy Nation farm, mining iron for Cats (the currency of the realm) I scratch a meager living from the rocks, I purchase greenfruits, grown on the farm I now reside on, I endure the soldiers racism as they march past on daily manouvers. I stare off to the north, alone, as the sun rises. I rush into the bar and sell off the last scraps of iron ore, buy food an animal companion and outfit it with baggage. I fill the bags with food and meds. And set off into the unknown abyss that is the desert sands. A scuffle between holy Nation paladins and some bone dogs breaks out, I swoop in, take some furs and a kit of Paladins armour and his blade - he wont be needing them - I now have a bounty of 2500 Cats on my head. As I travel northward to my freedom.Kenshi Includes -Good stuff-Base building, entire villages can be brough up by yoru hand and hard workSquad building and recruitmentInteresting lore and an original world filled with interesting and unique species.A medical system consisting of injuring different parts of the body and having different detrimental effects.An utterly huge open world - But not too big so to as get dull and boreing.Multiuple factions. A dozen or so skills.Research for better, more upgraded items and building to help with your skills and your,Modding community is already bloomingBad/ not good points -Though the game does suffer slow down and the occassional crash (To cut a long list short my PC is far above the recomended specs)The game does take a few seconds to ""warm up"" and load in textures, models etc - its a big game.The game - if your unprepared for a ruthless world, is utterly brutal, this may be very off puttingThe game is without a doubt poorly optimized - BUT it has improved drastically since I firts purchased it.Yes I have pathetic playtime, owing mainly to my older♥♥♥♥♥♥poor build of a pc when i purchased the game, Now with a more powerful beast and several patches of content and optimisation the game flows - there is some slow down in certain situations (which for a game this size is no bother at all.)

Early Access Review
								Like many others, I bought this game a few years ago. Back then I could only think of one thing: rough. Really rough. The UI was simple with very basic sliders, the sand on the ground was smoothed over as if detailed in microsoft paint, and the game was completely unforgiving. I revisited this game in 2017 and I can safely say everything that was rough about the game back then has been improved and ironed out including the unforgiving nature of the game.   This is one of my favorite games i've ever played because it fits a neat niche I didn't know I was searching for.  You create a character or a few and set out into a wasteland. To give players guidance, it is reccomended you start mining and selling until you can safely equip your character(s). From then on is up to the player to do what they wish be it mining, fighting, basebuilding, slaving, stealing, etc. This is a strategy game with real time combat. You select your character and right click on a potential threat, and your character fights. This is melee only combat, so battles are fought with swords, greatswords, katanas, etc. Depending on the skill levels of your characters and how geared they are compared to the threat will determine the outcome of total defeat, or victory. Player controlled characters have skills that can be trained to better cooking, fighting, mining, and smithing. To train these stats, the characters must do the action to progress. Training toughness for example is done by getting your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥whooped. Being downed in a fight and getting back up and surviving increases your toughness exponentially. This means you can stay alive and fight longer. This was such a great mechanic for me; in other strategy games, losing a battle would always have me restart to see if i could change the outcome. With this game however, if i lost a fight, I would try to get the character back up and limp back into town to recover. This mechanic is a small example of how the developer utilizes mistakes and losses and benefits the player with not only lessons learned, but stat boosts as well. The developer of Kenshi has made a game in which stories are unfolding for the player each time they play. With the open nature of this game, I've had plenty of intriguing moments. One in particular was mid game. I had a three characters all who wielded heavy weapons squaring up against seven bandits. My main character Jack swings his enourmous sword and staggers 4. I manevuer the other two around to get a better position but they're caught off gaurd and take damage. My tank named Bard breaks his right arm and has to use his back up weapon. As he swings he gets struck down and knocked out. I send my doctor Soo to heal him while my main character jack fights the remaining bandits. One by one the bandits dropped until the leader strikes down Jack. Soo sees this and enraged, pummels the bandit leader. Jack gets up clutching his broken chest. We need to get back into town before more show up, so Jack picks up bard and throws him over his shoulder. Jack and Soo both crippled and beaten limp three in game hours to find a town to rest their wounds. After resting up, they venture into the wasteland once again. I love this game.  "

								For anyone who likes RPGs and RTS', this is the perfect combo. I absolutly love this game.It gives alot of freedom, and the progress is good, not too fast, not too slow. Everything is learning by doing. No levels. And if you want to, you can equib a newly recruited peasant with the biggest swords and armor. Although it might not be the best choise, it does give you somewhat of an advantage. When you do get to the point of where you have a secure foothold and a few soldiers, you reap the rewards of your labour. You see and guide your small society of people to advance and trade. And once in a while a few roaming bandits will come by, to keep your guards entertained and help with their training. OR you can just go around being the hermit samurai and doing your best to defeat the bandits you meet, although this will mean death, if you dont have an extremly strong soldier first. And such training can be gained by follwing the traders around, as a bodyguard. This game is a game i have been waiting for, for a long time. Its open ended. And its a perfect RPG sandbox. And its not even done yet. I recommend you to get this game, while its cheap! Its worth it already now. However, if you want a game where you can dive directly into high action, this is not the game for you. This game rewards patience and tactical gameplay.			"

								If you're a fan of building your own towns that span the ENTIRE GAME WORLD, leading an entire army, hardcore gameplay where if you die you die (but game doesn't end! Carry on with your community and let your previous shell rot in the sands of time!), a free roam game, or hell just swords, katanas, straw hats and ninjas, then this game is for you. It's quite unrivaled in its free roam aspects (base building / attacking towns / trading etc) despite being in an early alpha stage. You can send out different squads of people to different parts of the map, start several towns, just click on a character to move your camera to them. It'll cause quite a micromanagement hassle, as everything keeps going (unless you pause it. It features pause / x2 / x3 / x4 speeds, but lacks a notification / alert system for when people are being attacked - at the moment.) I've been enjoying and will continue to enjoy this game, with future updates sweetening the deal.If you're a fan of ""real life simulators"" (hardcore elements, no artificial levelling, no hero characters, no scaling item & equipment quality, etc.) or titles like Mount and Blade, Sim City, The Sims, or any other simulator where you control the way a community grows, then this game is definitely for you. Oh, and there's bounty hunting. Kenshi also has a tinge of the post apocalypse feel, being set in the seemingly never-ending desert. (No fast travel! Buildings take a while to build! It's a good time killer :D)			"

								Still in early alpha stage but already so awesome. Grow wheat and hemp, make medikits, rum, weapons, armour, roam around the huge map and start wars or trade, almost everything is (or will be) possible.Edit:Over a year later I don't see any improvements. Maybe some features. However performance is worse and the UI is equally (if not more) glitchy.I saw regular updates and pictures of future races and animals and I got the idea that progress was going really fast, but based on what's actually in the game right now little seems to have changed. I'm sure there will be cool stuff in the future, but it's still far from done.Still a lót of fun though, if you know what to look out for.(For instance they sometimes keep walking for no reason. This could get you killed. But if you're on top of that it's no biggy)			"

								Kenshi is one of those games that once you start playing, it is very difficult to put down. I believe the 9.7 hours that I have on record is from one sitting. Unfortunately, the lack of content, performance issues, and bugs make it hard to come back. The one man development team is hard at work though, and continue to fix these issues and add more content. If you enjoy open world RPGs or city-builder RTS games, this may suit you very well. The desert landscape is fairly bland and I can't say I'm a huge fan of the asian theme, but they have mentioned adding new areas to explore. The map is fairly large and once you begin building your own city and army you won't want to stop. $20.00 is a bit steep at the moment, but I highly recommend Kenshi.			"

								Alpha, and thus rough around the edges and with huge chunks of gameplay still to be implemented, Kenshi has already given me more hours of enjoyable entertainment than many triple-A titles. If it fulfils even a fraction of its promise, this game is going to be one that sets the bar for years to come.It reminds me in many ways of a ""more RTSy"" Mount'n'Blade crossed with a colony-building game like Dwarf Fortress, which is no bad thing.

								I admit I havn't played 100 hours yet, but of the 30 somthing i did so far, all were well spent. Sure its a little buggy, but thats early acccess. Suprisingly, this game runs just fine for me, even on my potato of a laptop when set to low graphics (I would still recommend better though, cause we all know low gaphics are no fun.) I've only found one real bug with the latest update (wont let me build certain things anymore), but with my playstyle where i just run in and go ham with katanas,  it doesn't really bother me much. Ive also tried out some of the mods (YES, THERE IS MOD SUPPORT!) and found most of them to be stable in the experemental version. All in all, I truly enjoy this epic game.What I enjoy: Choose your own playstyle. You dont have to be the goodguy (I know I'm not).A wide variety of swords and armor with different stats.Four different playable species (with sub races too).KATANAS!Mod support.A big map (that is going to get even bigger).What I'm dissapointed about:There are a few bugs (Early access, Bugs are garanteed).No ranged weapons (yet)....

								With the state that it is currently in, Kenshi has proven that it is something worth keeping an eye on with alot of potential in the future. There are alot of options for roleplaying, allowing you to become a trader, a fighter, a bounty hunter, or whatever you feel like. There are alot of options for customization and building your own settlement legitimately feels like your carving out a little peace of the landscape for yourself, giving a sense of achievement and identity in the pretty fully realized world. The whole world is full of other characters and factions for you to interact with and understand and each one has its own set of rules, customs, and trades. you could get pretty invested in trying to make sure you stay on good terms with the faction you prefer, while also attacking and stealing from the ones that act like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (♥♥♥♥ The Holy Nation). While the game is deffinitly rewarding, it is pretty brutal at the beginning, so dont expect to be crafting vast cities in under 50 hours. That and a few minor bugs do occasionally make the game frustrating, and it can run rather slow at certain times, but none of this really detracts from the overall quality displayed here. all in all, id say that the expiriance outways the minor bugs within it, and i can honestly say that this is a great title for anyone who is into exploration and crafting an identity in a rough and hardened world			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR pros and cons:+ Awesome game (unique style, interesting design, great gameplay etc.etc.)+ They did it to beta, yay!~ Seemless blend of RTS and a Town-builder on a solid RPG foundation.~ Tru sandbox (no story-quest-line, just sand, your toys and your imagination)~ Game is mod-able so you can add a sexy-armor, i guess... ~ Still being tested, so expect some instability and small bugs   - Some little bugs and glitches are still out thereNTL;WR (Not Too Long; Will Read):Synopsis: First of all, i have to say that the game's description and videos are quite accurate and trustworthy. Pay a close attention to the game's description, by the way. First goes ""free-roaming"" then ""squad-based"" and only then ""RPG"". While it is indeed an RPG, in the same time it's not. Not in the familiar today wiev that is.  You character(s) has a set of stats and set of skills that could be raised in particular ways. You can equip your character(s) with whatever gear is accessible out there, in any combination possible. You can tune out the phisical appearance of your character(s) in any given way. Basically, you can build your character(s) whatever you want in every possible meaning.  But that's where the ""RPG"" some may grew accustomed to ends.  In Kenshi nobody will give you a story and send you on the epic quest. Not even a minor quest. Not even to gather 5 rat skulls or deliver a love letter or wake up 11 guards. Every second NPC won't unwrap their soul to you in a complicated system of carefully thought-out dialogues with dozens of possible outcomes. You can't get married. You can't even woo anybody, if only figuratively.     What you can do, however, is to use your imagination, and with help of afeatures given in a first paragraph write your own story by action. Gameplay: Assisted by a dozen of starting conditions, set a foundation to your game. Start as guy with a dog, or try and lead the group of settlers to prosperity of their to-be-built town.  You do not have a direct control over your character(s), instead, it's a traditional RTS\MMO Point-n-click, so you select your character(s) and send them where needed, either to be or to fight, which is also done automatically, based on stats, skills and equipment of your character(s) and those of an enemy.  You may build your own outpost\town, with all the work-stations and various interior set by yourself. Build a shed and fill its inner space with whatever you want. If only it fits there and is available for construction. It's your choise whether that building will become a bar or a hospital. In most cases it's also up for you to decide what role which character will pick: assign them to a mining task, for instance, and their mining skill will progress, which affects the work efficiency. Various traders are available across the vast map, who'll either buy what you've produced, looted, or stole, or gladly sell something to you.  Stealth, stealing and lockpicking is available, and authorities do recognise crimes and in some circumstances - criminals.  Even in it's current state (ver 0.95-ish) map has a very large size and would require some dozen  hours to explore briefly, while only being roughly a 1/2 of a planned map.Conclusion \ impression: All in all, i'd call Kenshi a seemless blend of RTS and Town-Builder on a thick and strong RPG foundation, means, whatever you do - stats and equipment are always there and never neglected.That's said, gameplay is fantastically flawless and natural: Start a character, get some coin, keep wandering alone or hire more characters, build a base, research new tech, build industry, set  people to auto-work... oh, look, your guys didn't go anywhere, it's still they and their stats underneath that thick heavy layer of management and strategy. Quick, assign this guy to guard this girl, and tell her to do the same about him. Boom, Kenshi marriage just happened!    __________________________________________________First version of the review left here for the historical purpose:I want to ask you a few things. Do you remember Fallout? Nah, not that fancy F3 and F:NV, no, i'm talking about '97th Fallout. The world, completely destroyed by nuclear warheads, and then, intensively dried by merciless impartial Sun for over a century, become a harsh, empty desert... that was the world we lived in for a while. We did things, necessary for our cause, we met people, hardened by this hazardous environment, we saw rising nations, mindless bandits, we saw the life after... We were free to go wherever we wish and do whatever we want... Now, do you remember Mount-&-Blade? Where we could roam absolutely free, with no particular cause. We had a party of trustfull associates, we could've trade, fight alone, or swear an oath to a ruller, and fight by their standart. We had to think about provision for out group, so they won't starve and leave us...Before this point we had everything we could possibly want, except one thing...In Kenshi, besides all other things mentioned above, one of possibilities we have is actually settling our own village. Gather some coin, get some bricks and start to build your little paradise in a middle of nowhere. Build it in a trade route, open a tavern and watch caravans going by and leaving you some coin for your goodies. Build a large house and put some beds in, so roaming patrols could rest their feet and heal their wounds. Grow your own crops to make food. Grow your own hemp to make... err... fabric... Beware though, as not only peacefull force roaming the desert. Cruel bandits and mindless cannibals could show up in any hour. They will crave for your supplies, your money, or even your bodies and your life. Build walls, gates, and take deffence of what rightfully yours! Then gather some strenght, and send a squad of trained warriors back, to their den! Take their lives to bring peace across the land and earn respect of other factions. Travel, trade, fight and settle: ""The world is yours"". I can't forget to mention the party itself. Every buddy you hire is, in fact, a full character with same set of stats as your first created guy. So eventually, if you want to, you can go from a single hero to an army of individuals, and even if ""your"" character dies, it's not a ""Game Over"". Everyone are equall, and everyone counts as your character. Besides i'd like to say few things about a graphics. Maybe the textures are not perfect, maybe collisions are not always right, maybe animation is a bit dull sometimes... But, brick hit me, characters even has their FOOT FINGERS modelled! They don't even have this in Skyrim! Anyway, just buy it and help Lo-Fi Games finish this ambitious project and grind this diamond to the brilliant!			"

Early Access Review
								Before I begin, I won't sit around and pretend like Kenshi is a perfect game. You are looking at an Early Access title. Maps will get wiped. A town you spent hours building in that perfect spot between two mountains will be gone when the next chunk of the map releases. The game is constantly being changed, and will continue to be in that state for a long time. The graphics are somewhat dated, an artifact of when the game first came out. Collisions can be very buggy, and you will probably have to deal with picking up your squadmate that won't stop blocking the stairs. The autopathing will do what you want it to do half the time if the distance is further than 50 meters. At least once, the captured dude that you put down will rocket into the sky and fall like a meteor because you approached him from the wrong side. That being said, I'll go into what Kenshi is, and why I recommend it:As the description will tell you, Kenshi is an open world, squad-based RPG that takes place in a post-apocalypse style region (I say ""style"" because of some disputes about this canonically). ""Open world"" needs to be emphasized hugely. There is no overarching task to the game other than survival. Any goals you have in Kenshi are self-set. However, certain items can incentivize you to explore the world; a map from an old library that shows you the far-away location of an ancient armory, or a bounty for a bandit king, or a rumor from a crazy, inebriated man that turns out to be nothing. The absence of any concrete goal isn't new to the sandbox-survival genre, but it's fairly unique in Kenshi, where there isn't any multiplayer. I initially thought this would result in the telltale problem surrounding nearly all games in this genre, but I learned later that two main elements of the game ensure you don't exhaust it:1. The map of Kenshi is absolutely massive. Only half of it is available at the moment (as the developers are constantly working on new sections), but in my experience, going from the south end of the continent to the north took an actual, real hour without utilizing the speed features (Sims-style buttons that accelerate time). In my 31 or so hours of the game, between two squads, I have only explored a good quarter of the available half-map. The land is varied and unique as well. Swamps filled with wandering assassins and blood spiders, a crater brimming with robot spiders and horrible giraffe-like monsters that run as fast as a car, or river valleys dotted with small farms belonging to a theocratic empire. The developers have clearly spent their time cultivating each biome/area to make it feel alive, complete with ruins of an old space war, alien-like flora and fauna, and a soundtrack that mixes pad-based wasteland ambient noise with a strange asian tone to create an otherworldly tone.2. Kenshi is a difficult, unforgiving game. I am aware most people see that warning and roll their eyes, as every undercooked developement team tries to desperately convince the consumer-base that their game is ""the next Dark Souls"", a marketing tactic that needs doing away with. But Kenshi is truly the embodiment of unforgiving. If I can give one piece of credit to the trailer, it is for having the phrase ""the world doesn't care about you"". Nearly everything in Kenshi will try to kill you. I distinctly remember within my first five minutes of the game, my efforts to attack a group of hungry bandits resulted in my character being beaten nearly to death and stripped of his shoddy weapon. Everything in Kenshi starts out stronger than you. Becoming stronger in this game is a matter of how much you are willing to risk. You will not become better with a weapon by targeting weaker enemies. You constantly have to aim above where you are, and that risk can result in being imprisoned by slavers, or captured by guards, or kidnapped and eaten alive by fog-men. Even if you fail (assuming you live), some good comes from the encounter; you gain toughness, and will be harder to fall in the coming fights, as long as you tend to your wounds. This mechanic is the central point of Kenshi; you will not become better unless you fight someone better than you. So you need to find or buy some friends, train them up with you, and make a name for yourself.---------But what I find to be the most unique part of Kenshi is how you can become attached to these characters, despite them not being attributed with a real personality (save a fair amount of unqiue hires). I would save a slave passed out from bloodloss, nurse him back to health, and equip him with clothes, hoping he would join my party. And when he was kidnapped by northern cannibals and locked in a ruin with 50+ men well above my strength, I would try and devise a plan with my other party members to get him out despite it being much easier and efficient to leave him to die. Nothing would be gained by saving him, but we still did it because he was part of our squad.That is where Kenshi shines, at least for me. It makes you care about these people that have never uttered anything more than trade dialogue. It makes you chase after that old man that was really awful at learning how to swing the fragment axe that was too big for him, after he was imprisoned in a tower of the Holy Nation. It makes you keep that dumb-looking basket on that short dude's head because you're certain he has to wear it because you decided he was the assassin when you first rescued him. It makes you give every shiny new nodachi to that girl with the best armor, because she was your first recuit and you just know she has to get the good loot.Kenshi doesn't pull its punches. It is dedicated to making you fail and wiping your squad. Your death will likely not be ceremonious: you're probably going to die to skin-spiders more than you are to an evil slaver army you tried to attack. When you get imprisoned and your Katana worth 100,000 Cats is stripped from you, I hope you're ready to spend 30 actual minutes checking each container in each guardhouse for it. If you really really want that Falling Sun manufactured by the Catun Scrapmasters, you better be ready to spend a whole in-game night picking that 0.6% chance to succeed lock with the shop guard sleeping nearby. If you've finally decided you're sick of your friends bleeding out and you want to get some Skeletons (robots) on your side, you better start shelling out thousands of Cats for repair kids, or else they're going down quick. You will think you're invincible after finally finding an Edgewalker Naginata, and you will probably get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you by some bum with a rusty chopper that's done nothing but fight his whole life.You are never too high on the food chain to be invincible. Believe me, I know:I had raided all of the northern armories and found two Edgewalker weapons. I had a squad of 6 people: Dave, Kai, Soto, Hobbes, Kara, and Gynn. Through almost 20 hours of training, they had become true warriors. We had accumulated 120,000 Cats from our exploits, and were ready to finally settle down and establish a town for some money before we explored the next part of the map. Since the swamp was perfect for farming, we saw a little flat plane near the southeast on the map and decided to make our home there. We were off with nearly 30 building materials, a month's worth of food cubes, and some advanced health kits. When we finally got to the area, we noticed there were a fair amount of ruins, usually a sign of danger. And even despite this warning, we pressed on.And when we reached the plane, our long days of training, weapons worth their weight in gold, and samurai armor stolen from shops around the continent meant nothing. Against the blood spiders, swamp raptors, and acid rain, we were fallen within seconds and our unconscious bodies were eaten by the monsters. Weeks of training, great escapes, fireside meals, stealthy heists, and grueling battles - they were all undone in seconds.That is Kenshi.			"

You got to have a good PC to run this! Not because of the graphics but how big the map and the amount of npc/buildings/vegetation/animals inside the game!This game is currently playable! When i bought this game long time ago, I used to think it was abandoned. There was not a lot of things to do and there were a lot of bugs. However most of the old bugs are fixed but there will always be new ones so we must keep reporting!Now enough with the old past and gibberish that no one likes to read them.Let get to the Pros and ConsPros:1.A lot of replayabilities because of the different background stories where you start your game from. (You can add more with mods)2.There is Steam Workshop where you can add mods to the game which adds more fun.3.It is quite fun and you make your own stories.4.You get to build a settlement, make a huge clan and raid big bases.5.You can customize how your character looks.6.Huge map with npcs (You can add more npcs with mods)7.You can adjust your own difficulties.8.The combat is quite in-depth with different body parts which your character can get hit.9.You can imprison people and people can imprison you! (If you add mods, you can become a slaver)10.You can control your settlers at home while you go shopping. Meaning if your character goes to a far away place, you still have full control of both your character and settlers. (Similar to the Sims 3)11.Like most rpgs, there is experiences and stats. So there is grinding!This game has not been abandon yet. Which is already a good sign!Cons:1.Not a lot of content (Mods can counter this problem!)2.Slow update (Who can blame them? Developers are humans too)3.Not really that great graphics (Probably due to how big the map is or my PC need some upgrades!)4.The building mode is quite annoying because of the terrain which bothers me a lot. You will encounter unnecessary slanted buildings similar to Fallout 4 settlement building. (I am the type of person who likes to make pretty bases)5.Crashes a lot after a few hours of gaming so be sure to save a lot! (Probably because i put a lot of mods.)6.Bugs (Just report them!)Meh? Don't know whether it is right or wrong.1.There is no linear story.2.It's a very random game.3.I used collections for my mods.4.No guns. (except turret which is stationary)5.No transport. (Be it horses or vehicles)6.No special skills or perks?This is my review and if the game has updated more content or whether the game is completed or the game is abandoned.I will come back and edit this review.

								Addicted. While still a work in progress with an admittedly long development cycle, Kenshi offers dynamic factional interaction, a functioning economy, and a SPRAWLING world married to interesting lore. The sheer scope and freedom of self-driven narrative offer deep replayability, while the XP grind and research tree keep number junkies engaged.The depth can seem daunting as, right out of the gate, you're hit with a chargen system awash in variables. Stick with it. The core systems, be they crafting, research, farming, theft, or combat will shed their mystery in short order, leaving you free to create the game you wish, not the one a developer has decided you will undertake.Early on, embrace your failings. You'll die. You'll lose. You'll assail the heavens with ""WTF?"", but it's the best way for the realities of Kenshi's world to sink in. It's no JRPG and it can feel nearly cruel. That's just the fun you're feeling.Pros:+ nearly infinite replayability.+ engaging world-building with interesting and consistent lore+ the capacity to build BIG groups of henchmen / men at arms+ satisfying tech research / crafting / building+ the world is HUGE+ (in case you missed it) - the world is HUGE+ free-form gameplayCons:- early access (doesn't bother me, but some loathe EA titles)- infrequent world-breaks resulting from patches- graphical hiccups / oft-times bland imagery- upper tier hardware required for truly smooth play- a myriad of beta-level bugs and niggling issuesIt's hard to convey Kenshi's ability to capture the imagination. I haven't been this enamored of a title since the dawn of Space Engineers. Kudos and high fives all around both to the man responsible for this project from its birth, and the team he has recently surrounded himself with to complete it. Props.			"

								To begin with, this is a game for the patient, tedious-loving, and hardcore gamers, that seek a fulfilling experience. If you played the pre-CU SWG, and loved it, then you should feel at home in this. It's slow paced, and requires a bit of thought, and I swear you could write a book based off of the experiences of your character. From being enslaved, escaping, and becoming a bad♥♥♥♥♥ninja, to slaughtering entire cities with your army of samurai. You could, instead, buy a house in one of the towns and live a peaceful life as a trader/farmer. Don't want to buy a house? Build one then, but why stop there? Build a whole damn fortified town, guarded by ninja with freak'n harpoon guns. Great early access game, maybe one of the best. The devs also appear to be fairly active, so I can't recommend it more.			"

								I'll admit that at first the game sucked real bad. I had no direction, no purpose, nothing. I was bored and felt like I made a bad purchase (around 5 hours into the game). I only had some basic armor and 1 follower who I named Grandpa.(The game has no storyline so spoilers ->?) I got brutally KO'd and tied up to a pole by the Dust King after I stumbled into his tower. That was when the game opened unfolded before me. I spent 2 days picklocking my way out and with no items weighing me down, I ran away but Grandpa had an injured leg. He didn't make it out. A few people joined my band. Some freely joined, others I paid to join. Now I have purpose. I'm building a town...my own faction. My goal now is to avenge Grandpa and capture the Dust King. Unfortunately, I've♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off most of the other factions, but oh well.The game isn't easy at first and the optimization isn't great. It takes a while to understand. It's basically a do whatever you want type of game with no clear goals. All I know is that I can't...stop...playing...If you like resource management games such as RimWorld or Prison Architect, this might be fore you. There's just more depth to it than most others.			"

								Let me start out by saying one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure of owning and playing. I currently give it a 9/10, it will easily be 10/10 once they fix the crashing and the path finding and a few very minor bugs it will be one of the best games out there! I have logged 87 hours currently and I have played all of the starting options and let me tell you just because you start out as a group of 5 nobodies dosnt mean jack! This game is a true open world sandbox! I have played as a travling merchant who brought life saving medic packs to the local police, Iv been a smuggler who had to slip pass the same police to smuggle drugs. I played as a bounty hunter who got his butt handed to him many times and Iv been a bandit with horrible luck! Iv also been a slave and a slaver! and there is so much more to this game! You should give this game a chance even though it has a problem with crashing just be sure to save very often! My hope for this game is for it to become stable and to be moddable I get goose bumps just thinking about the greatmods that can come out of this! I will write a final review once its finished till then play this game and immerse your self in Kenshi!			"

								I decided to go wih the freedom seekers for the idea of making a nation and conquering Kenshi. Day one My group and i travel about a 2 minute run from a town to begin building our haven (incase we get overran and have to book it). If you attempt this the first tech you should learn is makeshift walls. By the second day a little post at the top of the screen had said. Aldonia (name of my town) has been noticed by starving bandits. I only had one gate because i thought my walls would hold. Nope i was wrong. 20 bandits came like the Fire nation. They breached my gate. The Old solider and I ran to battle to defend our workers so they could get to safety. They saughtered us all and looted everything. This game is challenging yet appealing at the same time. If you like the sims, with apocalyptic feel and sword fighting. This is your game to try.			"

								While the concept and mechanics are good, the execution is terrible. Little thought (or capability) was given by the developers for things like the pathing of the characters or the resources in memory.Characters are frequently unable to find their way to complete a task unless manually guided. The rendering of textures along the world is slow and buggy. NPCs and beasts are erratic at best.This game screams of Unity plugins and copy'n'pasted code. All-in-all, it's an amateur execution at best.			"

								Time to buyI’ve been following Kenshi since steam first started greenlight. At that time there was no sound in Kenshi, the world was bare bones, heck the whole game was obviously very bare bones. I really liked (and still do) the idea though. I like to play this game as sort of a city builder.Step 1 - make an outpostStep 2 - farmStep 3 - Profit. This is the first time in about 3-4 months that i've even started the game. I was waiting for more to be ready. I must have picked a good time because the game is now feeling very alive, and complete. I might as well say goodbye to the next 100+ hours of my life now.			"

								Do you enjoy free roaming and getting owned at the beginning all the time? Then this is the game for you!On a more serious note:This game is slow paced, you will start out with almost nothing (Depending on which start you choose) and you WILL get rekt all the time at the beginning. But once your squad has grown in number and power the fun starts kicking in. Slaughtering silly bandits that used to slaughter you!Sadly I haven't been attracted to the building alot, it's still a little buggy in my opinion to enjoy the building part of this game. Also the View Distance is attached to your Camera, not to your characters so it's a hard time to spot enemies sometimes.All in all, this is still Early Access and I can see this game having a big potential.

								Avoid, only in the past few years has this game even started to gather any form of pace , let alone any kind of play. Despite the hundreds of hrs put into this and 5 years of waiting this game is still unplayable. Countless times have i unstalled this game because of it bugg ridden and constantly crashes. Verifying cache, rebuilding the nav mesh, broken pathfinding- still,and endless bug reports filed .Yes the game has an approach and style that come as very appealing to the sandbox/ sim / stratergy. But the implementation of these ideas are ham fisted and generally break the game. Resulting in a gameplay although i paid for 5 years ago, i have never been able to play this game to any sort of conclusion , even if it was a narrative or a play style that i wanted. It will list on the store that its a game for all sorts, And in theory it is- but only if ALL of these options work, which for most part they dont.  Want to be a trader- path finding is iffy- so is trading most of the time. Want to be a fighter- the a.i for your squad and group control is basic at best , no formations , its a drag box -gather all affair point and attack. Its rather warband mount and blade sorta thing only with slight dumber a.i /npcs.Which is a reall shame considering once you have a base set up and start crafting your going to win- full stop. The a.i in the game wont counter u in anyway. This is daft considering this game has factions, but for what ever reason other than some npc running after u to kill / or steal theres no real war going to happen. Its u gathering your troops and attacking what ever u see fit- the game wont counter or gather other factions to help. It wont come kick your♥♥♥♥♥if your getting to big. In all honesty buy warband  if your after a large warfare siege building  faction game. This is quirky and it has it moments , but waiting 5 years for this to come half way playable at best was a step to far for me. Early access has a bad name for good reason, companys came along , promised much and then sat on our money while we got broken codes, false promises, delay after delays in ""well fix that patches"" this imo was one of those companys.Now the fan boi's on steam will tell u the company lay golden eggs and there ideas for the game out way any gripes u have . Which is total b.s, if u sell something , even if its early access theremust be some form of timeline, steam must address this, because the dev of this game is like""o0 i have another idea"" so u have to wait while he codes his idea and then breaks the game again. All along while waited for his first 10 ideas to be fixed. This has been my first 5 years with the makers of this game.  You've been warned.This is the 3rd review- 5 years on			"

This game will not be *won* anytime soon. I think i am up to 140 hours or something like that, and still no where near enough to be able to safely say, I can easily take over the whole map. That is MY end game. The dev's are working hard. They are doing some good work. But remember this is still in development. So there are bug's. But so far from what I saw. *I had this game from pretty much close from first release* I have always enjoyed this game for what it is and offers. I strongly suggest you get this game is you like sandbox LONG games.			"

								I've been playing for a long while now and only recently transferred my account from desura to steam, reason for my almost non-existent gameplay time...it's all about preference. All I can say is that this game is unique in its own way and a lot of reviews had gone into details which I would rather not repeat. The developer and maker of kenshi had before worked as a security guard before to make a living while designing this game until recently he got enough money from sales to form a small team. We had waited years for long intervals between updates but he had never disappointed us before. It is his persistence to complete this game, come what may attitude, is the selling point to me. I see it having a lot of potential and modable qualities, his preseverance and persistence at work is the deciding factor. Believe me, it will take some time to get a complete game but it will arrive and you will not be disappointed. It's just quality work by a single master-craftsman with a few helping hands to produce this gem, so you can't expect work to go fast to your liking....he wants it to be the best so for me, take all the time you need, just don't take too long....I hope. ^_^			"

								Dang...  I helped to greenlight this game. It was actually the first one I ever voted yes for.  And I've followed it since then, waiting for it to become complete enough for me to want to give it a try. And so I tried it today. And I'm a bit saddened by my disappointment. It reminds me of the old Neverwinter Nights mods that were just vast tracts of open space with occasional randomly spawned monsters. Those weren't games. Those were templates for games. I could open up the NWN toolset and hammer out something like that in 45 minutes. People often did do that.So Kenshii looks like it's just a template for a game. And, given that it's in the .9x version series now, It appears to me that the vision for it may not shift very much. Oh well. :(			"

								As of January 2017, the play experience Kenshi has offered has declined for several years in ways not attributable to the normal churn of development, to evolving code and ideas, or to the good and bad experiments we hope to see during development. So, I think it is fair to consider it one the very, very few early-access titles that can and should be ""reviewed"". But, it is an early access title and a normal ""review"" would be pointless and unfair. Instead I'll summarize why I recommend to hold off deciding to buy or not to buy for now.In a nutshell, what began as a great little gem with a focused and tight presentation and play experience, lacking only in polish and game-mechanic features, has become a bloated, unfocused fever-dream of bad user interaction, inscrutable play, poor reliability, and abysmal rendering performance. The only area that has improved is the length of the checklist of features implemented. But even those feel scattered, random, and not truly essential to furthering the core of play. Kenshi used to seem it was destined to be a master of one thing, now it is an amateur of many.Given that long and steady trajectory, so opposite in direction to its early course, I would recommend holding off on a purchase decision until LoFi releases this and it exits Early Access. Put it in your follow list, keep an eye on it, see how the critics and lets-players you respect get on in their games and hope, as I do, LoFi will prove me utterly wrong with their 1.0, because the early promise and execution were wonderful once and so there is still reason to hope.

								An interesting, innovative game created by one guy. In it's early Alpha stages it's completely playable, but with minor bugs and some major crashes. If you're a fan of Mount and Blade's open world, KOTOR's combat, and Elder Scrolls's skill system then you'll have a blast with this game. Along with the similarities to the title I previously listed, Kenshi also has a fully creatable town system where you can craft buildings, create your own town, sell your wares to NPC travelers and merchants, and get raided by bandits. It's a unique experience and a fun, slow-paced game where every squad member counts, and every swing of the enemies sword could mean death to your party.			"

								If you mainly play survival or rpg games, you may fall in love with Kenshi. If you enjoy customising a game to your own tastes or creating your own story, this is the game for you! Despite being early access and missing many of the features to be implemented in the final game, this game has so much content and so much potential. Currently, for me, the only downside is the bugs, but early access often comes riddled with bugs. Luckily the current ones don't make the game unplayable.The pros:-Lots of customisation-Huge map (with bigger map in the making)-NINJAS!-SAMURAI!-Solid economic and trading system-Enjoyable combat-Build a town/fortress/prison/camp any way you want-Deep weapon and armour crafting system-Custom team building (custom names, looks, armour, weapons, strengths and weaknesses)-in-depth character customisation-quicksave (F5) (you will be thankful if it crashes..)Cons: -Bugs (can be quite rare, but often frustrating. Verifying game cache can often fix the bigger bugs)-Crashes (even more rare, mainly happen after hours of having the game open)-TELEPORTING UNCONSCIOUS GUYS!!!All in all, well worth the low price it is, a game with incredible potential that will suit most play styles. Recommended.			"

								One of the most ambitious and creative strategy games I've had the pleasure to play. Multifaceted RPG-City Building-Micro managing-Squad based(soon) strategy honeycluster of a game. Think open world Dungeon Siege 1 with city building, crafting, trade goods system with more stats to level up than things to do in real life. Currently it is still in alpha and enjoys frequent crashes and multiple game-breaking glitches, so don't buy into it just yet if you'd get annoyed at game crashes every 25 mins of gameplay, but do keep this game in mind. Amazing soundtrack, unique immersive atmosphere, fantabulous HP system and over all spectacularly well thought out game mechanics. This game is so good it made me write my first review on anything ever. ehrmagherd kenshi, please get funded by a gajillionaire so you can be completed ASAP.			"

								9/15/2015TL;DR at the bottom.  The Team I have been following the development of Kenshi for almost two years now. It started with only a single creator, but as the game gained popularity, the team has expanded greatly. One of the biggest drawbacks that may push many people away from this diamond in the rough is the slow development. But while the updates may be slow, the Lo-Fi team has proven their consistancy and dedication. Updates are regular and often expected, thier website lists projects currently in the works, and the team is very responsive to the community.  The Game Kenshi is an open-world, tactical, squad-based RPG, with a 'Sword Punk' style. It runs on the Havok engine. While a great engine, it has created significant obstacles in the way of pathfinding. However, this issue has almost completely resolved. The world has a post-catastrophic event type feel, but this may change when the giant 0.8 world update is released. Currently, the environment is a sparse desert with settlements dotting the land and bandits roaming the dunes. A faction system is present but not fully explored (you can decrease relations by attacking, increase it by healing). The art style is Jappanese influenced primarily, and the newly updated hud adds a rustic, bloody feel to it (A+). When starting a new game, you can choose from several different scenarios, from starting with a legendary sword to a group of traders to absoloutly nothing and a bum leg. The combat is based on your characters' skills, and damage is locational. One of the main portions of the game is base building. You can create a completely self sufficent settlement with farms, textile industry, arms crafting, and more, and traders will stop by at your stores.  Conclusion/TL;DR Kenshi has a LOT of promise, so much that this has to be my most anticipated game currently (besides Fallout 4, of course), and has been since I bought it. It is perfectly playable as is, but gameplay can get a little dry. But having gotten 173 hours out of an early access game started by a single individual, it'd be a crime not to recommend it.			"

								11-1-2017 UPDATEI played the game in the latest released version, not the experimental as it crashed while trying to save every time. so i played the normal steam release.Here are my findingsThe RPG part of the game has improved, its more fun, more interacting and way much to discover.  Even animals are now available for sale.Map is extended and the items that are available and can be found, also for research are expanded and more difficult and fun to collect.The progress is clearly there on the RPG part and the fun playing it has also increased,The city building part, creating your own town, walls and buildings still slow down the game a lot and the walls have the same bugs as i had before, characters just walk through your walls as if they arent there. game crashes and slows down a lot when building a larger town with multiple buildings. with the improved research and need for special blueprints its way more challanging getting to Level V tech, but i managed to find the blueprints and the needed AI cores and was disapointed in the fact the town i wanted to build was as buggy as before.In short,Stability and memory usage is still shaky, the Havok system is still being used, and these fundamental issues remain in the game, they have not solved it.RPG partGreatly enhanved and way more fun, lots to discover and play, will keep you entertained for a few weeks.Town buildingStill buggy and shaky, a major disapointment after another year of waitingOverall progressLofi studio made progress, but at this rate the game will be 100% when a competitor already released a new game with the same ingredients and possibilities. they develop way to slow, only half of the map is available and its still Beta. Same bugs are in the game that i encountered 2 years ago.New rating:I give it a thumbs up now for the RPG part of the game and the fact it will entertain you for a few weeks. But only if the price of the game is no more then $15, buy it on sale would be my advice.It is a small thumbs up, after carefull consideration._______________________________________________________________________________Old update:Review updateAfter a year, i revisited the game, and was very disapointed again.Not much updates, other then new buildings, lights et (more of the same)c, but no resolving of standing issues, no new content that makes the game more in depth. The website states in January a maasive new update is about to arrive. It is now March 7. No massive update..It took them a year to get more of the same in, not resolve the most pressing issues and didnt add any content that the game so desperately needs.I will revisit again in 6 months, but my review stands, stay clear untill they finish the game properly.Great potential,However, Its still Alpha the devs say, and its been that for over 3 to 4 years (talk about slow development!).They have huge issues with their HAVOC software, and HAVOC isnt solving these issues yet.Forum is full of diciples who dont want to hear anything bad on the product, even waiting for over 4 years for a proper functioning beta.Best to wait untill they prove that they will actually finish the product properly, now its a bug filled annoying game, with great potential, save your money for now (and check in a year if they made real progress).

								Absoluely awesome even in it's current Alpha state. The gameplay and features planning to be added definately set this game apart from the crowd, in that it's hasn't been done over and over again.If your a fan of RPG and RTS games and would like to see a melding of the two come together then you should definately give this one a look. Understandably as it is still Early access it lacks what most would hope for from a finished game. I however think that the developers have worked hard enough on it that it warrants my money being invested.Keep in mind that it is still very rough around the edges and make sure you do a bit of research. I sincerely hope more people see this game for the absolute Gem it can and will be.			"

Kenshi - A RPG mixed with some tactics and base-buildingDid you ever want to play a RPG where your character was not the chosen one until you achieved the skill to be him? Did you ever want to play a game where you can play with a single or multiple characters with pros and cons for each style? And most of all: Did you want a game with an open world where you can build your own outpost which can produce materials, weapons a.s.o.? If you don't mind some bugs and pathfinding problems (only sometimes) then even the alpha is good for you.You begin with a character for whom you first choose the background. There are a few backgrounds you can choose from and each changes the difficulty (i.e. you get a better weapon or none at all, have a squad or are a loner...). So you begin on a big map (which shall get bigger as the development continues) and don't have a real goal. Except to survive. Bandits may find you very fast and the first thing you REALLY want to do is run away. You need experience. The levelling system is like in Oblivion: You get better as you do it. So now you should get to the next city or a patrol. Bandits are Bandits and you don't have the experience to fight them. Like I said: You are NOT a hero. As you venture to the towns you may find better equipment and buy it from money you got for selling looted stuff from dead bandits or ninjas. Maybe you even find better thins on them, but that does not happen very often. To get the best equipment you need to produce them on your own. As soon as you have got money and found a safe place (not too far from a city would be best) you can begin to build a research bench and begin building an outpost. It takes a lot of time. Many hours (real time, not the ingame time) until you researched everything. You also need to buy some blueprints for better weapons and armors. Now that you have even better equipment you can do more in a fight and if you already have more experience, you can take on at least 1 or 2 enemies at once. Since I only played to this point, I cannot go further with the gameplay. Oh, did I mention you can lose limbs? And need to bandage your wounds? There are no health potions and it takes a lot of time to recover. Conclusion:Pro:- Huge map- Learning by doing- Build your own outpost/city- Research- Limbs can be severed- Different weapons with different playstyle- Research better weapons- Not as easy as most of the games nowadaysCons (at the moment):- Still alpha (includes bugs and similar problems)- No animals- Mines can be build anywhere- World seems very empty- Cities are small- Even if more guys around sometimes 1on1Neutral:- No AAA-gaphics, but still not so bad- Animations			"

								I am not recommending this game in it's current state, but I am giving it a thumbs up because of its amazing potential. I mean, seriously, if it gets through EA without the devs abandoning it as so many do, gets the updates it needs and is released in a finished, polished state, then this could be an absolutely amazing open world RPG. It has all the elements of the,perfect game; base building, farming, recruiting town/party member then upgrading them, crafting, research, factions, a huge open world, there are many more elements but I didn't intend for this review to be a long one until I put more time into the game .The reasons that I am not recommending this game in its current state are simple.The terrible, seriously flawed control system.The ridiculously bad camera,The awful performance. I have, literally, a top of the range PC, and the FPS still drops to a level where I want to throw my base unit across the room this is ridiculous for a game in late 2016.I appreciate that it is in EA, and the regular updates make me hopeful that the game will get finished. In the meantime, buy it on sale (unless you want to support the devs, which can only be good for the game), or wait until it is rather more polished.			"

Otherwise their is a good amount to do to keep yourself busy until more updates come out. The biggest drawback is poor optimization but the team have made this their main concern along with finishing the whole map. Thumbs up for insane potential.			"

								Let me start off by saying I've been following this game from it's early days. I never thought that this game would turn out as awesome as it has. I thought that it would've remained in it's previously quite barren alpha state. I was wrong.Kenshi is now one of my most favourite games of all time! It's become quite an amazing sandbox experience and I would definitely recommend this game to everyone and anyone. Although the world and lore still has a little building to do at this time, the game and it's features are well worth the £12.99 I paid for it (If its on sale, then even better!) The world is bustling with activity and things to do. You can do literally whatever you want (within reason) and all the hours I've spent playing this game have felt definitely worth it. (Bear in mind that i've played Kenshi off of steam for a long time)This game is truly a hidden gem and I can't wait to see what comes next. HOWEVER, currently this game is based around what YOU MAKE OF IT. If you're looking for storyline or cheap staright up violence then this game isn't for you. It's better played with a mindset of creating your own story (although the factions and lore help direct this I feel). Also the developers are bringing frequent and progressive updates to the game, and the mod community is very active and talented. A plus on the side!10/10			"

								I know this game isn't finished. I havn't played alot of it though.  This game I have been waiting for a very long time to be complete. The devs are getting there. The squads and people you make in them, can tell a story right now even without any use  dialouge in the game. I enjoy the harcore aspects of it, being brutal and unforgiving to those just trying to eat food or cross the road. I love it and will wait for it to be done before I start my real journey out of the desert and into Kenshi.			"

								I've played Kenshi for about 80 hours in total (I bought my first copy of the game directly from Lo-Fi several years ago and I also have it at GOG). Around 60 of those hours have been this summer. I expect I'll play it  a lot more. Sure there are some negatives, such as camera control, minor path finding errors and such, but if you dig beneath the relatively minor technical imperfections this game is a gem. In some ways it's like Mount & Blade in other ways it plays like an RTS. The game is really addictive, and given the passion the developer has shown for this project over the past five years or so I'm sure it will get even better. I strongly recommend this brilliant gaming innovation :)			"

Early Access Review
								      In this review we will go over a few of the key features along with the pros and cons of this game. I personally am at a stand point between loving the game and distaining it while keeping in mind the game is in alpha stage. I will explain if and why this game is worth the price.     This game has been in development since 2012, the development cycle has been slow, and an update roughly every two months at the time of this review (3/14/2014) the last known update was February 10th 2014. The game has a few of the features spoken of, the vast land scape that is truly every meaning of the word large. It would take you quite some time to get across the map, I clocked it at 24 minutes on standard speed (the game comes with three speed rates) There are a few things you can do at the beginning of each game, mostly attempt to trade with other factions or cities. As most factions are less than vanilla, the rewards are arguable. You could make a living hunting bandits, or you could simply create a single structure and have the bandits come to you (After maybe 3-4 hours of excessive training). Unless of course you would like to know how it feels to be a three legged cat chased by a pack of wolves. The fighting animations are fairly nice a few clashing of swords, however does get a bit repetitive which is fine considering the game is in alpha. Now there are other things you can work to accomplish if you actually want to feel some progression in the game, consider there is no story or dialogue to guide you in the game at this time  (3/14/2014). There is however a simple tutorial in the options menu. The base building of the game is fairly nice; you can make a nifty manufacturing system mine, research and build. Then find something else to do, which of course is all there is at this current state (which is fine) as the amount of time it takes to get to that point is quite hefty. The amount of available research is quite vast, which will take you at least six to nine hours, depending on which game speed you prefer. Once you have your super industrial enterprise and have the best warriors equipped with the best weaponry and training that the game allows the next step is to find something else to do. That can be a daunting task; you could put little outposts all over the map and make your own little empire with a few squad-mates. 	On another note, there are mods available for the game. The construction kit is easy to get. (http://kenshi.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Modding) Although, the amount of mods aren’t a huge attraction, but they do exist! Now then to pros of the game are. -Awesome concept.-Based on Sword fighting with nice animations. -Build a small empire.-Very large map.-Mod-ableNow for the cons.-Slow development.-Many game breaking bugs.(which is forgivable for an alpha of  course)-The game-play will come to a point where there isn’t much to do and wait for updates like many on the official forum.-The super crash (I clocked it at every 50 minutes) Quite a few of the fellow Kenshi players know what I am talking about.    The question you need to ask yourself before purchasing is the game worth the price tag (I picked the game up for 20 dollars). The developers do need the support I will not argue that, I merely want the buyer to understand what they are getting for their hard earned cash.  As of right now (3/14/2014) the reviews for the game are quite positive, especially from the players themselves and for good reason! The amount of potential for this game is beyond words. I am personally excited about the development, and so are many others. As a personal statement, please understand the game is in alpha stage with slow progression as most alpha stage games are just keep that in mind. If you are in doubt, watch some youtube videos on this game.

								Been playing Kenshi for a while now.  Its definately not the kind of game that is easy to pick up and play, its a bit rough round the edges but if you persevere you will be rewarded with a very deep gaming experience.  I love open world games and games that give the player a lot of options which enable them to choose their path, Kenshi does this to a high standard.  One tip I will give new players - when you starting a new base; you can assign your characters jobs on the bottom right.  This makes them perform tasks automatically.  When you are up and running you can train your guys on dummys and start fighting with banditos.  Very fun game, constantly being developed and updated.			"

								Let me start off by saying I've been following this game from it's early days. I never thought that this game would turn out as awesome as it has. I thought that it would've remained in it's previously quite barren alpha state. I was wrong.Kenshi is now one of my most favourite games of all time! It's become quite an amazing sandbox experience and I would definitely recommend this game to everyone and anyone. Although the world and lore still has a little building to do at this time, the game and it's features are well worth the £12.99 I paid for it (If its on sale, then even better!) The world is bustling with activity and things to do. You can do literally whatever you want (within reason) and all the hours I've spent playing this game have felt definitely worth it. (Bear in mind that i've played Kenshi off of steam for a long time)This game is truly a hidden gem and I can't wait to see what comes next. HOWEVER, currently this game is based around what YOU MAKE OF IT. If you're looking for storyline or cheap staright up violence then this game isn't for you.

								Well, I've bought this game couple of years ago, and now I can see that it was a great «investment». Even with all the bugs the game has, it is one of the best single player games for me, since it uses a totally different way of interacting with you as a player.The world lives around you, and it doesn't care if you die. You are not special, and yet, if you've got patience, you can grow really strong and get your own faction going.That's what most modern games totally lack, and this one delivers.Totally recommend.

								Well worth the money. It's a great game for the price it's at, there are games that currently are out and ""AAA"" that arn't nearly as fun as this (i'm looking at you skyrim!) Yes, this is still early access, but it's decently stable with the odd crash here or there unless you opt into the experimental version. And if it doesn't look like it's that intresting now, check back in later down the line and see what else has been added, you might be surprised.Edit for 0.95.5: The game is coming along very well and recently has added unarmed combat and the dodge skill into the game. Now you too can live out your fantasy of being a hyper aggresive Saitama and devestate entire cities.			"

Early Access Review
								Clearly an early access game, so a lot of content is still missing. However, it's a very FUN game even now, and since I bought it about a year ago, it's a very DIFFERENT game than what I bought, in a good way. The team has grown and is steadily updating with new and improved content, and they're quite dilligent about squashing bugs.The ambitious idea behind this game is pure sandbox gold, and thus far, I see no indication the game will fall very short of its goals. Even in its current state, it's a game I sink 4-6 hours at a time into. I tend to take long breaks, usually coming back after a big content update overhaul patch, but when I do pick it up, ""I think I'll play Kenshi for a bit"" always turns into ""Wow, I played Kenshi for that long?"" It's an addictive game with an extremely promising future.If you enjoy sandbox games, survival games or games that let you make a personal mark on the world, you'll love picking up a guy here and there from the taverns in the local towns, banding together for protection, and watching your recruits grow into hardened warriors and master builders as you carve out your own little piece of the world to call your own. I definitely recommend Kenshi for anyone who like a game that gives you freedom and rewards you for surviving in whatever way you see fit. I also recommend it for those who like to start out with nothing and eventually (a long time into the future) have to means to obtain anything they wish.If I were to compare it to other games... It's a little bit Mount and Blade, a little bit Age of Empires, and just a tiny bit Minecraft. (Tiny bit; you get to build, but you don't get to design your buildings. You can, however, place useful constructions like beds to heal in and containers to store materials and items into these buildings however you choose.)Do bear in mind that Kenshi is still in alpha, so it's a little barren and it does have its bugs. Also keep in mind that Kenshi isn't a game that holds your hand too much. You're plopped down in a world populated with various hostile and neutral factions, and your purpose is to survive however you can. Trade between the cities, start your own society where you mine and farm for resources to sell, or prey on starving bandits until you become bandits yourselves capable of waylaying wealthy merchants and their caravan guards.However, what you do and how you do it is left entirely to you, so do bear in mind that at first, you might feel a bit lost and without direction. Also keep in mind that the world is a dangerous place, and you might lose quite a bit before you start to see gains. Don't be afraid to fall; just speed up the time, and there's a good chance you'll wake up. If you do, you'll be tougher than the last time. Every scar in Kenshi brings you a small step closer to being the big dog in the game.Long story short: If you're thinking about buying Kenshi based purely on what the store page has to say about it, you'll probably be glad you bought it. It's an amibitious game that is slowly doing all it set out to do, and gives you the sense of accomplishment you'd expect. It's paced to be played for the long haul, so if you enjoy open-ended sandboxes where you reap your rewards after many long hours of effort and character growth, this is definitely a game you'll want to consider.

Early Access Review
 Overview – Kenshi version 0.93.28 StableKenshi is an interesting game that's very hard to describe. It's a blend of RPG and RTS that functions quite well. You can dwell in the broken world just by yourself, with a squad of faithful friends, or with an entire army (using a simple mod, you can control up to 256 characters). So, what all does this game offer? Plenty of options you can find in most other RPGs. Be a thief, pawning off stolen goods to make profit, or you can travel the cities to make a living off honest trading with a bull to carry your load. Scavenge the ruins for artifacts with a faithful bonedog companion by your side. Establish outposts/villages/cities, serve a holy purpose, hunt down cannibals, become a leader of an army to sweep over the lands, battle giant creatures, or just chill in a tavern and listen to some of the stories others have to tell. Sounds good, doesn't it, but does it actually work?  The Good   True sandbox experience – almost all that the enemy can do, you can do too (and if not, there are mods for that) Official mod support (with Steam Workshop) – modability can carry the game when the game can no longer carry itself Giant map – even though only about ¼ of the map is implemented so far, it is still quite large, and will become only larger and more diverse as time goes on Updates – disputable (read more in The Bad), but the game is basically being made by a single guy (except for sound, music, and art), so with that taken into account, the game is being updated quite frequently Soundtrack – the music is great, and I applaud the composer for pronouncing the atmosphere of the game with fitting music. Look up the sound engineer and music composer of this game, Kole Hicks. You'll find that the music system of Kenshi is a lot more complex than you might think. Gameplay – All I described in the overview, you can truly do.  Replayability – Even when I explored the map, seen what there is to be seen, I still have the urge to play again and again, just to try a different style, a different race, or just to hang out in the amazing scenery once again   The Bad  Bugs – the game, to be honest, is a buggy mess. Some features that are implemented are not working correctly. For example, mercenaries that you should be able to hire to protect your outpost or to bodyguard you on your adventures don’t work (they just eat your money and act as if they had done the job), clipping textures (your characters can get stuck in inescapable places), shops can get bugged and be opened when they shouldn’t, which leads to guards attacking you, and more Pathfinding – While it’s amazing that you can just click anywhere in the map and your characters automatically go there, it’s not quite so useful when your characters get stuck, run around unnecessarily, etc. Your outpost workers will get stuck in buildings, behind staircases, and in other places. Learning curve – it will take you quite some time to get the hang of the game. This means you won’t be able to experience the game in enough time to be able to claim a refund if you don’t like the game anyway. So, buy at your own risk, knowing you won’t be able to get a refund Long development – the earliest Kenshi development video on the developer’s channel is 9 years ago, where in the description he also states that it’s a pre-alpha footage of something he had been working on for a few years by then. It just might be another decade before we see this game enter at least a beta stage. Still, at least we have an actually playable, feature-rich something, unlike another game that comes to mind – Overgrowth. What’s notable, though, is that even through such a long development the game is still being updated on regular basis, so the developer is definitely determined to see this game through. Dubious PR – I can’t attest to this myself, just thought I should mention it anyway. There has been, allegedly, some controversy. I don’t participate in the forums/steam discussion, so make your own picture of this. For further inquiry, read Extrasmooth's review of the game. If what he says is true, I fear that the developer might dig himself too deep into unfixable bugs. We shall see. Optimization – the game runs like garbage. You will have to contend yourself to playing the game at low/very low if you have older hardware like me. Still, the game will run like♥♥♥♥♥♥in some areas. Be wary. I don’t really care about the graphics as long as the gameplay is fine, but I know some people do care.Phew, that's quite long so far. I don't think I'll be able to write the story of my first serious journey in the end due to character limit, but I might do some ""greentext"" version later on once I get it written down. Just so you know so far, yes it does indeed ""work"" and you can experience all I have said you can. With that, I do recommend this game even in its kinda broken state, as I most definitely got my money's worth out of it, and will continue to do so in the future.  But, I still urge you to read through other reviews and to take ""The Bad"" things into account.			"

								I feel like Kenshi is a whole different type of gaming experience. The strategy to survive in this sword-based civilization really gives you a challenge when leveling up and recruiting followers; once this is through with alpha phase it is going to be a very popular game (if it isn't considered one already).

								This game is definitely unique. One of the first titles to be released when Early Access came about onto Steam.I've had so many different adventures playing this. It can be frustrating, challenging and even cheap at times. Yet I love it. Everything the developers have done has been great. Making new maps, units and races. You can build a city out of nothing. You can go to war with major cities or small farms. There are no right and wrongs. Just whatever you feel like doing. I did have an issue for a long time. My game would constantly crash making it really unplayable. Since a few patches, the game runs great for me again. I know it's been in development for a very long time, but that doesn't matter to me as long as the game itself so far is solid, which it is.			"

								This game deserves recognition. One of the most original games I've ever played, and don't be misled by the hours I played before it was even on Steam and for many hundreds of hours offline.It's harsh, as they say you are NOT the chosen one, you aren't dragonborn or some save the world badass. You are just some dude, and every encounter could be the end of your life. It's pretty rewarding to put the time in, strengthening yourself and the friends you meet.This is one of those games where when you take a substantial loss (home destroyed, friends dead or enslaved) and you either put the game down for a while or you pull your broken bloodied body up and get back to work. To survive in Kenshi is to do whatever it takes. Luring bandits through a peaceful village and plundering it afterwards, leading your warband several days through the mountains and ambushing passing traders, looking for wounded enemys retreating from battles...

								-Early Access Review-The game of an alternative universe which is a strange mixture between apocolypse/Japan/RPG, the game where you cannot be a one man army and you actually have to work to be something useful. The game has a number of starting points for you to choose from with varied difficulty. To be honest when I first bought the game I was a little let down, the content was awkwardly done, the terrain was dull and lifeless, the pathfinding was just... horrific, base building was more than a chore and the optimisation was less than good.Here we are now! The game has come on leaps and bounds and the developers seem to truly listen to you. We now have sound, good basebuilding mechanics, Squads that seem worthwhile (You actually feel a little heart broken if they die), pathfinding has improved although its still not quiet there and a number of new features and terrain additions have been added.Pros:- Interesting setting- ALOT to do once you get the hang of it- Buildings, lots of buildings.- Combat is actually quite fun, nothing better than watching 40 people scrap it out over your little farm.- I like the ""Everyman"" (Everywoman) type of setup- Getting chased for MILES by angry Sand Ninjas and Bandits.Cons:- Pathfinding and wall placement is still hit 'n' miss at times- Getting new squad members can have you running for hours at a time, would love some periodic respawning- AI can be dumb, I had squad members watching my team die while they mined stone- Alot of stuff still cannot be sold which makes early game money making a case of stealing items of corpses (Vulture simulator)- The real lack of need for water, food or anything really.Overall a nice game, plenty of game play options and very sandboxy, even more so with future updates. If you have some spare cash and time, why not build a nice functional little down and shank some cannibals?Current rating: 6.5/10~Liquifiction			"

Kenshi - A RPG mixed with some tactics and base-buildingDid you ever want to play a RPG where your character was not the chosen one until you achieved the skill to be him? Did you ever want to play a game where you can play with a single or multiple characters with pros and cons for each style? And most of all: Did you want a game with an open world where you can build your own outpost which can produce materials, weapons a.s.o.? If you don't mind some bugs and pathfinding problems (only sometimes) then even the alpha is good for you.You begin with a character for whom you first choose the background. There are a few backgrounds you can choose from and each changes the difficulty (i.e. you get a better weapon or none at all, have a squad or are a loner...). So you begin on a big map (which shall get bigger as the development continues) and don't have a real goal. Except to survive. Bandits may find you very fast and the first thing you REALLY want to do is run away. You need experience. The levelling system is like in Oblivion: You get better as you do it. So now you should get to the next city or a patrol. Bandits are Bandits and you don't have the experience to fight them. Like I said: You are NOT a hero. As you venture to the towns you may find better equipment and buy it from money you got for selling looted stuff from dead bandits or ninjas. Maybe you even find better thins on them, but that does not happen very often. To get the best equipment you need to produce them on your own. As soon as you have got money and found a safe place (not too far from a city would be best) you can begin to build a research bench and begin building an outpost. It takes a lot of time. Many hours (real time, not the ingame time) until you researched everything. You also need to buy some blueprints for better weapons and armors. Now that you have even better equipment you can do more in a fight and if you already have more experience, you can take on at least 1 or 2 enemies at once. Since I only played to this point, I cannot go further with the gameplay. Oh, did I mention you can lose limbs? And need to bandage your wounds? There are no health potions and it takes a lot of time to recover. Conclusion:Pro:- Huge map- Learning by doing- Build your own outpost/city- Research- Limbs can be severed- Different weapons with different playstyle- Research better weapons- Not as easy as most of the games nowadaysCons (at the moment):- Still alpha (includes bugs and similar problems)- No animals- Mines can be build anywhere- World seems very empty- Cities are small- Even if more guys around sometimes 1on1Neutral:- No AAA-gaphics, but still not so bad- Animations			"

								I am not recommending this game in it's current state, but I am giving it a thumbs up because of its amazing potential. I mean, seriously, if it gets through EA without the devs abandoning it as so many do, gets the updates it needs and is released in a finished, polished state, then this could be an absolutely amazing open world RPG. It has all the elements of the,perfect game; base building, farming, recruiting town/party member then upgrading them, crafting, research, factions, a huge open world, there are many more elements but I didn't intend for this review to be a long one until I put more time into the game .The reasons that I am not recommending this game in its current state are simple.The terrible, seriously flawed control system.The ridiculously bad camera,The awful performance. I have, literally, a top of the range PC, and the FPS still drops to a level where I want to throw my base unit across the room this is ridiculous for a game in late 2016.I appreciate that it is in EA, and the regular updates make me hopeful that the game will get finished. In the meantime, buy it on sale (unless you want to support the devs, which can only be good for the game), or wait until it is rather more polished.			"

								This Review will tell the story of my first 3 Charakters.The first one is short. I left the town and got beaten up by bandits.The second one took way longer but is as short to tell. I left the town and built a house. Then after watching my people working for about 20 min I got bored and started a new game.The third try I was exploring the world, hired a few followers and built another house. Then a single ninja walked by and killed all of my people.I see a lot of potential in this game. Right now it feels too easy to just roam the map, get rich, build an army and then a settlement. I expect that to change once needs like hunger are introduced and you need to get them covered. Also I miss a lot of RPG-content. But I trust the developers that they can deliver what they planned. The game right now is quite entertaining and once they do it will be near to infinite fun.			"

								Oh my god this game. An alpha that i've consume so much hours and it's still the case to transform into weeks. The first time i saw those image and thoses tags i was like... what the hell... I MUST TRY THIS!!! and oooh boy i don't regret my choice. Kenshi is a squad based rpg where you're basicly a rat in a giant world. Depends on witch start you choose, the journey beggane with you, mostly with a pants a rusty sword, and you strove the desert to make your legend. In this game, your an ant at the very begganing. imagine that you, normal guy/guurl of all day decide to take a sword and start off you're companie. As you fight and fight, you'll learn what a true fight is. you can literraly see your character getting better at fighting. faster, wiser, deadliyer. Recruits other squad members, engineers, medics, fighter, then train and equip them : cloth, plate, mail, depends on your play style. like all plating knights style? alright. you love it fast and ninja style? alright! take what suit your play style. The fight system is an awesomly done speacking of dynamics and there is a limbs system that we can think of the fallout 3 limb system. If the Hp of a limb go to 0, either he or she won't be able to use that limb and if its a vital limb (head chest stomach) then they'll be K.O and need some medical attention. If the HP bar of thoses vital limb go to a certain negative treshold, those wounds are deadly. That's how you know that one of you mate have died in combat. This realistic mechanics also request of you to take care of your mate and leave them time to heal up, before going out and start murdering again. Go out in this majestic and awesomely well done desert. i'm totally serious here : i've passed several minutes just watching the dune, mountains and the horizon. ALOT of work as been put into the enviroment, and you feel it as soon as you have that sand in your sandals. Also, the map is ENORMOUS. Sometimes i was even saying to myself : jeez... i have to walk all that? but the reasons i'Ve just said make that you want that walking experience in this wounderful desert. Make a gigantic and prosperous town or a secret Samurai HQ, trades, fight, you really are the master of your own destiny. no missions or objective, simply survive and make a good and badass living. it's a sandbox where you do what you want and of course what you can to survive. Start off as a battleground looter to a blademaster to a rich caravan traders, to a formidable bandit or cannibal hunter, Be a bounty hunter and capture bad guys for ransom, or be the inquisitionning justicar and bring their judgment. the choice is yours. your blade awaits and the sand is thisty for blood. Get that game and start your legend!!!P;S : sorry for the tones of grammar errors.Have a great day wandering the dunes!			"

								This game is a lot of fun, but be prepared to wipe a lot. The game will require you to sell better loot, and farm near towns for a long time. You can travel with a caravan, but beware that they will continue without you. So, if someone in your group goes down than heal them(let them recover on their own) and keep moving with the caravan or you'll be left behind. Don't think numbers alone will save you either. I've had a full group and been wiped by a couple of sand ninjas before.... Still an awesome game. Still in alpha, so it has its share fair of problems, but it's playable.			"

								An interesting, innovative game created by one guy. In it's early Alpha stages it's completely playable, but with minor bugs and some major crashes. If you're a fan of Mount and Blade's open world, KOTOR's combat, and Elder Scrolls's skill system then you'll have a blast with this game. Along with the similarities to the title I previously listed, Kenshi also has a fully creatable town system where you can craft buildings, create your own town, sell your wares to NPC travelers and merchants, and get raided by bandits. It's a unique experience and a fun, slow-paced game where every squad member counts, and every swing of the enemies sword could mean death to your party.			"

Kenshi - A RPG mixed with some tactics and base-buildingDid you ever want to play a RPG where your character was not the chosen one until you achieved the skill to be him? Did you ever want to play a game where you can play with a single or multiple characters with pros and cons for each style? And most of all: Did you want a game with an open world where you can build your own outpost which can produce materials, weapons a.s.o.? If you don't mind some bugs and pathfinding problems (only sometimes) then even the alpha is good for you.You begin with a character for whom you first choose the background. There are a few backgrounds you can choose from and each changes the difficulty (i.e. you get a better weapon or none at all, have a squad or are a loner...). So you begin on a big map (which shall get bigger as the development continues) and don't have a real goal. Except to survive. Bandits may find you very fast and the first thing you REALLY want to do is run away. You need experience. The levelling system is like in Oblivion: You get better as you do it. So now you should get to the next city or a patrol. Bandits are Bandits and you don't have the experience to fight them. Like I said: You are NOT a hero. As you venture to the towns you may find better equipment and buy it from money you got for selling looted stuff from dead bandits or ninjas. Maybe you even find better thins on them, but that does not happen very often. To get the best equipment you need to produce them on your own. As soon as you have got money and found a safe place (not too far from a city would be best) you can begin to build a research bench and begin building an outpost. It takes a lot of time. Many hours (real time, not the ingame time) until you researched everything. You also need to buy some blueprints for better weapons and armors. Now that you have even better equipment you can do more in a fight and if you already have more experience, you can take on at least 1 or 2 enemies at once. Since I only played to this point, I cannot go further with the gameplay. Oh, did I mention you can lose limbs? And need to bandage your wounds? There are no health potions and it takes a lot of time to recover. Conclusion:Pro:- Huge map- Learning by doing- Build your own outpost/city- Research- Limbs can be severed- Different weapons with different playstyle- Research better weapons- Not as easy as most of the games nowadaysCons (at the moment):- Still alpha (includes bugs and similar problems)- No animals- Mines can be build anywhere- World seems very empty- Cities are small- Even if more guys around sometimes 1on1Neutral:- No AAA-gaphics, but still not so bad- Animations			"

								I have absolutely loved watching this game grow over the past several years... All the way through college. It has seen an amazing amount of updates, new members to the team, whole new worlds and area, new combat styles, fighting techniques, harpoons, and just... Honestly this game is incredible. It feels like yesterday that the game didn't even have sound. You'll get the occasional crash, you'll get some lag, but it has gotten significantly better and it's almost non-existent now. 10/10, definitely recommend it.			"

								One of the best rpg/rts games ive ever played, and its only in early access. I bought this game ages ago after seeing the first part of a lets play thinking it looked amazing, Altho it looked really complicated and it seemed that it would take a long time to figure out how things worked and played so i put it off for almost a year. Finally a week ago i decided to pick it up. One week later and i have 57 hours clocked in this game. Do yourself a favor and get this game. It may seem a bit daunting at first but its worth the first 30 minutes to an hour floundering about, because once you figure out how everything works it becomes an amazing experience. I only wish the entire game was out so i could enjoy the full vision of the devs, patience was never my strong suite tho, and right now it shouldnt be yours either, so stop being patient and buy the game!

								Ah sweet sweet Kenshi, first off I want to point out I stole numerous copies of Kenshi before but in the end the game was so great(and had so many new bugfixes coming out) that I just had to buy it, so my gameplay time should be way way higher.  When I first played Kenshi the walls weren't in the game because they were to buggy, this was 2-3 years ago then im guessing, there was no background music in the game and a bunch of items didn't even have functioning icons but man was it great anyway.  Eventually I had to take a break for a while because a gamebreaking glitch where your characters take forever to respond to commands and then just stop responding.  But the glitch was repaired and they even came out with a whole new map for the world that looks just beautful instead of the rather barren one before.  Kenshi has a delightful limb damage system and a few dozen skills/attributes that all improve with use.  Kenshi has an easy to use base building system that allows you to set up basically anywhere.  This is one of the few alpha games that still seems truly unique every other major game has something a lot like it out or coming out as well but not Kenshi.  I haven't even tried out the new hunger system yet and I love survival aspects in games.  The only complaint I have right now is that the Slavers are like everywhere and if your team gets beaten in the start of the game looking to settle down theres a seemingly 25% chance you will all get picked up while knocked out and locked up.  The slavers seem to be a little too annoying at this point even on the easiest settings.  Oh and how could I forget the new races, they are awesome and unique and fit the feel so well, nice work on them.			"

								Edit - Map is almost done! Such a great game. And now there has been a serious optimization upgrade. From 20-30 fps to 80-100.Edit - The map is expanding...the game keeps improving by leaps and bounds.Edit - Beta is out and man...it has gotten THAT much better.By an order of magnitude.The strangest, best, least, most RPG you will ever play.If you like free form games that allow your imagination to supply the details then this is the perfect game for you.Do you remember Daggerfall? There was a story, but it was easily ignored allowing you to do as you wished. It was the best sandbox a gamer could ask for in 1996. (I still have it)This is Daggerfall made by intention. There is no story...other than the one you supply.There are a few character types to choose from and that is it. You are plopped into a town with whatever cats (currency) and weapon the character had. No quest. You can stand there and watch the sun rise and set until you have logged 1,000 hours if you choose.Or...I trained on a fighting dummy for a month to improve my sword skills.I walked to a neighboring town some days away, avoiding the Dust Bandits along the way.I hired two mercs and took them to train with the dummy as I had.I looted a few unconscious people, and a couple of dead ones.I upset the local constabulary because I had looted one of them after they had been killed in an unrelated (to me, at least) battle. ""Damned looters.""I plan on building a town after I recruit more bodies. The history, the lore, the quests are all up to ME.One of the significant differences I have found is that although I save a lot (due to the early state of the game) I do not reload when something adverse occurs to my squad.I know that by combat itself my squad improves. The better the opponent the faster you learn defensive moves.We got jumped by some Sand Bandits and suffered wounds. In the run-of-the-mill RPG there is little benefit from suffering at all, so you reload. Replaying a particular battle over until you figure the puzzle out is frustrating and usually results in my abandoning a game.Not now. In fact, they are badges of pride. ""Dude, we fought and won!""edit - I just beat the boss of a local bandit posse. He followed us, alone. I turned my crew and fought him 10:1. Yes, we won. Danged straight I am beaming. I thought his group of bandits would cower after seeing me holding his head but...I had to run to fight another day.I also am impressed with a dev that loves their game more than I do. It is a labor of love; it will continue at whatever pace Lo-Fi can afford.edit - Support is amazing. The Beta introduced some issues so the response was to issue a quick series of hotfixes. A game-breaking bug is reported, a game breaking bug is quashed 5 hrs later.This is the weirdest RPG that I love so much.			"

								      In this review we will go over a few of the key features along with the pros and cons of this game. I personally am at a stand point between loving the game and distaining it while keeping in mind the game is in alpha stage. I will explain if and why this game is worth the price.     This game has been in development since 2012, the development cycle has been slow, and an update roughly every two months at the time of this review (3/14/2014) the last known update was February 10th 2014. The game has a few of the features spoken of, the vast land scape that is truly every meaning of the word large. It would take you quite some time to get across the map, I clocked it at 24 minutes on standard speed (the game comes with three speed rates) There are a few things you can do at the beginning of each game, mostly attempt to trade with other factions or cities. As most factions are less than vanilla, the rewards are arguable. You could make a living hunting bandits, or you could simply create a single structure and have the bandits come to you (After maybe 3-4 hours of excessive training). Unless of course you would like to know how it feels to be a three legged cat chased by a pack of wolves. The fighting animations are fairly nice a few clashing of swords, however does get a bit repetitive which is fine considering the game is in alpha. Now there are other things you can work to accomplish if you actually want to feel some progression in the game, consider there is no story or dialogue to guide you in the game at this time  (3/14/2014). There is however a simple tutorial in the options menu. The base building of the game is fairly nice; you can make a nifty manufacturing system mine, research and build. Then find something else to do, which of course is all there is at this current state (which is fine) as the amount of time it takes to get to that point is quite hefty. The amount of available research is quite vast, which will take you at least six to nine hours, depending on which game speed you prefer. Once you have your super industrial enterprise and have the best warriors equipped with the best weaponry and training that the game allows the next step is to find something else to do. That can be a daunting task; you could put little outposts all over the map and make your own little empire with a few squad-mates. 	On another note, there are mods available for the game. The construction kit is easy to get. (http://kenshi.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Modding) Although, the amount of mods aren’t a huge attraction, but they do exist! Now then to pros of the game are. -Awesome concept.-Based on Sword fighting with nice animations. -Build a small empire.-Very large map.-Mod-ableNow for the cons.-Slow development.-Many game breaking bugs.(which is forgivable for an alpha of  course)-The game-play will come to a point where there isn’t much to do and wait for updates like many on the official forum.-The super crash (I clocked it at every 50 minutes) Quite a few of the fellow Kenshi players know what I am talking about.    The question you need to ask yourself before purchasing is the game worth the price tag (I picked the game up for 20 dollars). The developers do need the support I will not argue that, I merely want the buyer to understand what they are getting for their hard earned cash.  As of right now (3/14/2014) the reviews for the game are quite positive, especially from the players themselves and for good reason! The amount of potential for this game is beyond words. I am personally excited about the development, and so are many others. As a personal statement, please understand the game is in alpha stage with slow progression as most alpha stage games are just keep that in mind. If you are in doubt, watch some youtube videos on this game.

								Even though this game is at aplha state, its still gives a new style of gameplay mixing RPG, RTS and Simulation at the same time. Few minor bugs but its acceptable in aplha state, ive seen soon to come updates which looks intresting. Also the upcoming development of A.I which they learn from their mistakes looks highly intresting in my opinion and this will make the game have a new style of difficulty in strategic movements. Either 'wait' or 'buy now' its your choice, still has minor bugs that needs a bit of tolerance but its acceptable.			"

								This Review will tell the story of my first 3 Charakters.The first one is short. I left the town and got beaten up by bandits.The second one took way longer but is as short to tell. I left the town and built a house. Then after watching my people working for about 20 min I got bored and started a new game.The third try I was exploring the world, hired a few followers and built another house. Then a single ninja walked by and killed all of my people.I see a lot of potential in this game. Right now it feels too easy to just roam the map, get rich, build an army and then a settlement. I expect that to change once needs like hunger are introduced and you need to get them covered. Also I miss a lot of RPG-content. But I trust the developers that they can deliver what they planned. The game right now is quite entertaining and once they do it will be near to infinite fun.			"

								I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who is all about open world games. If you arent into the whole grinding of exp or items, you can mod the hell out of the game, which only takes like 5-10minutes of going through the mods.. And yeah, you will get a huge start, easy playing, but WOW this game still is a lot of fun even with cheats. I have spent hours upon hours  playing this game even with millions of dollars and 10X Exp. It is super fun and still a challanging game with mods and all.			"

								I was seriously hyped for this game when i got it on sale. I watched a bunch of lets plays, and was really excited about the potential of the game. As a lifelong masochist,I started my game at rock bottom, and after the first hour, was like, ""well, this game isn't as good as i thought."" Two hours later i was addicted, and let me tell you, this game has surpassed all my expectations. The developers did an amazing job, an continue to provide feedback, and updates.			"

								Epic, fun, impressive, and ready to play now.If you like free-roaming sandbox games with no level scaling and tons of base building options and exploration then this game is a must buy. There are no other games remotely like it that i'm aware of.I won't go into all the features but this game is rich and ready to play.  There are some large updates coming up so you can either resume playing or import everything into the new version depending if the update requires a new game.  Very impressed with being able to do the latter.Some other random good stuff:- The world seems plausible instead of a theme park like other games.- The dialogue is pretty good and funny.- You can fully automate your workers in your base(s) while you devote full-time to your exploration squad.- It's very challenging at first, it's fun getting past that hump and becoming strong.- Location damage is really cool, for instance if someone takes a hard blow to the stomach then they will be pressing on it with one of their hands until it's healed.- Combat is fun to watch as it's physics based animations.  If a blow is landed then you'll actually see the animation connect.- If you see something in a store inventory, then it's also stored somewhere in the shop physically that you can steal.Things I'd like to see:- Multi-threading and performance (coming very soon I believe)- Further help screens explaining some more of the game mechanics (how armor stacking works, damage reduction, etc.)- Audio improvements, especially combat- More of the map available- Notifications, for instance when one of your crafters's queue is empty and is idle.- Able to add notes to the world map- Underground structures to explore.  Like dungeons.- Traveling trader caravans.			"

								Beta 0.92~ UPDATE for 0.94- With the new engine upgrade performace is increased and the map is now very large. A great addition to content too.I've been following Kenshi for quite a while and put a fair amount of time into the different aspects of the game. But by far the best parts are the style and music. I cannot find anything quite like kenshi on steam and it makes it a pleasure to enjoy.This is not a fast game. This is not an easy game. It is deep, beautiful, challenging and full of promise.It has been in development for a long time and there was a period when the engine was being overhauled that it seemed to have died. However it is back on track and the updates are coming fast.If you have been considering this game at all, with the inclusion of workshop support, then now is the time to give it a try. It's only getting better!			"

								This is one of the most ambitious games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Kenshi is one of the reasons the gaming community will never stop dreaming, and will always have something to be excited about. It shows that one mans dream can become a reality as long as you stick to what you love. It also shows that you don't have to have millions of dollars and corporate funding to make a gem of an experience. Now on to the meat of the review. Kenshi has come a long way since I first bought it when it first came to steam. A lot of content and technological improvements has put more meat on it bones over time, however there are some bugs and a very steep learning curve and some people might get overwhelmed with the initial difficulty. The bugs come and go mostly except for some that have lingered on and have been a real issue for some people. Like the path finding and super crashes. These bugs usually flood in when a new update comes out and they get fixed relatively quickly as time goes on. The dev does a really good job at listening to his community and the moderators and players are generally helpful and will answer any questions you have about the game. There are tons of guides and YouTube videos so if you don't understand how to do something in  the game it's pretty easy to get an issue resolved or a question answered.This game offers many ways to play. You can be a trader, a bandit, a caravan guard, lone warrior/ wanderer, explorer, blacksmith, laborer, scientist, ninja, fragment axe wielding juggernaut. The list goes on and on, and the best thing about it is, more is going to be added in and you'll only have more ways to play the game.			"

								Like sand? Who doesn't?Enjoy walking upon the countless ended lives of creatures that once were?Well Kenshi is the game for you!Start a game with some random scenario that you decide and get thrown into some random town, I got Capan.And now comes the biggest feature of the game: Learning Curve!!Wanna find a mission? Learning Curve!Wanna find someone to hire? Learning Curve!Wanna pick up that bounty? Learning Curve!Wanna turn that bounty in? Guess what ♥♥♥♥♥ - Learning Curve!that's right kids if walking on miles of the dead creatures doesn't tickle your pickle get ready for some good old fashion learning curves, joined a city but you don't know how to pay your taxes? Neither do I!Tried building your own town but your neighbors wont stop yelling at you to pay them or die? well tough♥♥♥♥♥♥Nancy that's Learning Curve!""This game is like 'Sims' for masochist and people who get overly aroused by ♥♥♥♥-tons of sand.""And if any of your characters weight too much you're gonna wish that timer speed could go up to 11 for your face is going to be rocked with the seemingly endless amount of sand this game has to offer. And prepare to leave your slower friends to die as your inexperienced characters leave your heavy friend behind as that cannibal party comes charging from the sand dunes.""Remember, I don't have to be faster than them, I just have to be faster than you.""And for you gore fans out there be amazed and horrified as one of your characters gets their stomach ripped open and starts to bleed on the sand as the rest of your team undoubtedly get ripped to shreds by those damn Sand Ninja Jounin, believe it. Be amazed as said Jounin, after massacring your pathetically untrained party, starts to casually walk away and then sprints back as one of your surviving members recovers from their♥♥♥♥♥whooping just to have their head or arm cut off.""It's like 'Desert Punk' the video game, but with more sand!""And if your the type of gamer who enjoys spending hours of time running [and pry to your gods not walking] from town to town in awe of the ridiculous amount of sand, this is the game for you!Ignore all of the bandits and buy trading goods and go from town to town trying to find the best price. buy and sale and become the wolf of sand-street as you flee from everyone who just wants to beat you up and leave you for dead. Because don't worry, they'll never steal your stuff, all they want to do is make sure you suffer and can't move.And you better believe they'll hunt you down until the end of the sands just to hurt you, hell they'll even run past city guards, run into the inn and attack you in your sleep, because ♥♥♥♥ you that's why.Over all if you want; Reality/Masochist 'Sims' with 'Desert Punk' meets medieval china all in the worlds largest sandy-box of ♥♥♥♥ you this game's for you!Did I mention there's a lot of sand?

								I love this game. I will in detial describe the good and the bad. But in my opinion the good FAR outweighs the bad here!First off the bad:Sometimes the ai gets stuck. Yes sometimes the ai will get stuck running between projects or delivery, towns, buildings or just plain start to stand there. But they know this and are constantly working hard trying to fix and update this.Sometimes buildings get a little buggy with placement of walls or and other ""Shell building.""Wall placement is a little... off... to be nice, sometimes bandits will walk right through/under a wall and attack you leaving you shaking your head after you kill them and figure out where in the world they came from!? They had no shovels on them so... there's that.Graphics are a slight eh. They are updating these as they have just switched to a x64 bit engine. (Yes they are still keeping x86 and DX9 so no worries about specs there)there are a few more oddities in this game, but those are the biggest.Next are my favorite things about this game:It lets you create your OWN tale! Whether you and your band of nomads roam place to place conquering and killing everything, which I might add, is harder than you think! Or perhaps a peaceful trader just trying to make an honest living out of your hard work, or otherwise ill gotten gains. But maybe, just maybe you are the daring settlers off to make your own mark on the world, or what's left of it, by building yourself a nice and cozy town amongst the barren wastes.Maybe become the dreaded sand ninjas/samurai/drifters/assassins of lore!!!You can create or destroy in life as in this game, the options are limitless... well as limited to your imagination and what the game has so far.In the future they will be adding slavery, ranged combat, robotics, new lands, and it all makes me excited just thinking of the new tales and stories to be had!In the end, I rate this 8.3/10 so far, and I am expecting a 87/100 finished. I set my expectations low as not to be dissapointed. Hope this helps!!!!			"

								It's half finished, buggy and incredibly fun if you're into the RPG/simulator/strategy genre. It reminds me quite a bit of The Guild 2 (also sold here on Steam). It's a bit unstable. I crash about every 2-3 hoursI made character, picked the origin where you start with a broken arm and a stick in the middle of nowhere. I was the gimpies gimp that have ever gimped. Knowing what to expect from reading other reviews I looked at my map and headed for the nearest town. As expected my crippled self attracted the attention of some bandits on the way. Knowing that fighting them would be brief and pointless I just kept running (bravely) away. Made it to a town and hid. The town guards dispatched the bandits. When it was safe I sauntered back out and started looting, making several trips to the local shops. After I had confiscated all the bandit possesions and profited I headed to the nearest tavern and recruited some backup. I could now confiscate things twice as fast! And that's pretty much how things went for a while. Traveling from town to town, luring bandits along into town guard ambushes, recruiting more and more people. Invested in some backpacks. I even started getting a little bolder and would help the townguards with dispatching these outlaws. My people would get hurt and sometimes even knocked out but I always made sure everyone had first aid kits on them, ready to patch a fallen friend up.  Before I knew it I was leading a group of 20 people, 18 females and 2 males (amazons!),  and we could actually kill single groups of bandits alone without the help of town guards.  It was time to build an outpost!Outpost life is hard. Not a day goes by without getting hassled by bandits, ninjas or cannibals. It didn't take long before I decided to pay the Dust Bandit faction off to leave me alone. One payment and they havent bothered me since. That cut the constand hassling down to about half and made it manageble. I can usually handle any town ambushes but I do sometimes get overrun and have to make a run for it to the closest town (Brink). But I finally finished the wall surrounding my outpost and my little group gets stronger every day!			"

								This is the first early access game i have bought, and i am verry happy with it.  There are some bugs, but it is still in alpha so that is to be expected. Just recently started building my own town and the first attempt ended horribly with all, but one of my squad getting killed.  I was so upset watching them die while i was helpless to do anything, as i had been training each to specialize in different skills.  I reloaded a save file (save as often as you can) I worked twice as hard to prevent their deaths. I would recommend this game to any of my friends. I can't wait to see what future patches hold in store for this game, if you are on the fence check out youtube for let's play series featuring this game.  That was how i ended up making my decession to buy.			"

								Made a guy that was a mongoloid. Spent 2 days picking a lock, then proceded to lure bandits to the town for easy loot. After much looting I thought it would be a nice time to leave my safety net... I built a small shack, and was loving it, then a evil gang of sand ninjas circled around my shack. The leader emerged yelling ""Oi! Come out 'ere pansy"". So I complied with the bandits. I walked out there and they offered to be best friends for the ""small"" price of 2,000 cats. Being the poorfag that bark was, had to decline. They enclosed me, and beat me into a small coma. They lingred there until I woke up and finished the job, and left me out in the desert to die. It took 3 days to die.10/10 would die again			"

Focused on squad or team members, you create your own town/village and try to excel in the wild lands. Bandits will attack occasionally and you'll have to move your goods to market to make profit. Overall, a fun game and will be even better if final version in the future brings the full integrity of the game to light.			"

								Like sand? Who doesn't?Enjoy walking upon the countless ended lives of creatures that once were?Well Kenshi is the game for you!Start a game with some random scenario that you decide and get thrown into some random town, I got Capan.And now comes the biggest feature of the game: Learning Curve!!Wanna find a mission? Learning Curve!Wanna find someone to hire? Learning Curve!Wanna pick up that bounty? Learning Curve!Wanna turn that bounty in? Guess what ♥♥♥♥♥ - Learning Curve!that's right kids if walking on miles of the dead creatures doesn't tickle your pickle get ready for some good old fashion learning curves, joined a city but you don't know how to pay your taxes? Neither do I!Tried building your own town but your neighbors wont stop yelling at you to pay them or die? well tough♥♥♥♥♥♥Nancy that's Learning Curve!""This game is like 'Sims' for masochist and people who get overly aroused by ♥♥♥♥-tons of sand.""And if any of your characters weight too much you're gonna wish that timer speed could go up to 11 for your face is going to be rocked with the seemingly endless amount of sand this game has to offer. And prepare to leave your slower friends to die as your inexperienced characters leave your heavy friend behind as that cannibal party comes charging from the sand dunes.""Remember, I don't have to be faster than them, I just have to be faster than you.""And for you gore fans out there be amazed and horrified as one of your characters gets their stomach ripped open and starts to bleed on the sand as the rest of your team undoubtedly get ripped to shreds by those damn Sand Ninja Jounin, believe it. Be amazed as said Jounin, after massacring your pathetically untrained party, starts to casually walk away and then sprints back as one of your surviving members recovers from their♥♥♥♥♥whooping just to have their head or arm cut off.""It's like 'Desert Punk' the video game, but with more sand!""And if your the type of gamer who enjoys spending hours of time running [and pry to your gods not walking] from town to town in awe of the ridiculous amount of sand, this is the game for you!Ignore all of the bandits and buy trading goods and go from town to town trying to find the best price. buy and sale and become the wolf of sand-street as you flee from everyone who just wants to beat you up and leave you for dead. Because don't worry, they'll never steal your stuff, all they want to do is make sure you suffer and can't move.And you better believe they'll hunt you down until the end of the sands just to hurt you, hell they'll even run past city guards, run into the inn and attack you in your sleep, because ♥♥♥♥ you that's why.Over all if you want; Reality/Masochist 'Sims' with 'Desert Punk' meets medieval china all in the worlds largest sandy-box of ♥♥♥♥ you this game's for you!Did I mention there's a lot of sand?

								I'm writing this during the Alpha 0.62 phase of development. Positives:Self-set goalsInteresting worldEpic mass battlesA wide range of gameplay optionsDetailed battle system and character creationNegatives:Self-set goalsMany bugs (for now)A lot of patience requiredvisually bland environment (endless desert)I got this game as soon as it was released on steam and I can say that it is absolutely fun to play. It has plenty of bugs (for now) and there are many unfinished aspects of the game but that is alright. Whatever this game is lacking right now it makes up for in excess with its gameplay. You do not start strong and there is nothing designed to be ""easy."" In fact, you will get demolished by anybody at the start of the game. The real fun for me came from building up my squad (I started with two characters, i now have 20) creating a town of my own, and then using my expanding reserves of money, skilled fighters, and tradesmen to utterly dominate anyone who crossed my path. Be warned though, because of the nature of this game it takes a LOT of patience. If you are able to strive through that though then it will be both extremely rewarding and enjoyable for you. I expect many great things as time goes on and can't wait to see the new game dynamics which will make this even better in the future.			"

Early Access Review
								This is one of the most ambitious games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Kenshi is one of the reasons the gaming community will never stop dreaming, and will always have something to be excited about. It shows that one mans dream can become a reality as long as you stick to what you love. It also shows that you don't have to have millions of dollars and corporate funding to make a gem of an experience. Now on to the meat of the review. Kenshi has come a long way since I first bought it when it first came to steam. A lot of content and technological improvements has put more meat on it bones over time, however there are some bugs and a very steep learning curve and some people might get overwhelmed with the initial difficulty. The bugs come and go mostly except for some that have lingered on and have been a real issue for some people. Like the path finding and super crashes. These bugs usually flood in when a new update comes out and they get fixed relatively quickly as time goes on. The dev does a really good job at listening to his community and the moderators and players are generally helpful and will answer any questions you have about the game. There are tons of guides and YouTube videos so if you don't understand how to do something in  the game it's pretty easy to get an issue resolved or a question answered.This game offers many ways to play. You can be a trader, a bandit, a caravan guard, lone warrior/ wanderer, explorer, blacksmith, laborer, scientist, ninja, fragment axe wielding juggernaut. The list goes on and on, and the best thing about it is, more is going to be added in and you'll only have more ways to play the game.			"

								Honestly, this game has been the most fun games I have played in a while. I wouldn't really be the type to recommend a game, but this game is just so great, I just had to. The amount of content in this game for an early access alpha game is beyond incredible. There is just so much to do, you can never really get bored. If you have the $20 (Current Price 7/11/14) I would encourage you to try the game. Its pure, original content, not really any game like this. For an early access alpha, 10/10. The developers are genius.			"

								Wow! Really got a surprise with this game.For a beta nearing release with plenty still to be fleshed out, I give this 10 out of ten and, for once, I don't even vaguely regret the cash I spent. Fantastic game. (See Budkai's video on YouTube for a slightly dated but excellent preview.)Kenshi is easiest described as half squad combat, half sandbox builder.It's not at release yet but very very playable. The graphics and its engine are not spectacular but the gameplay is enthralling.There are bugs and glitches as well as computer load and game balance issues but these are few and far between and don't stop the game being playable at all.I definitely recommend this one!

I decide to steal some food since I'm starving. Decide to try out the selling back mechanic,get caught for selling uncooked meat to the bartender. Proceed to get demolished by the city guards. Drop the game for two days. come back in and try to escape. Escapes five times before being taken to a different cage in another part of the town.The town gets attacked by ninjas. I take that as my opportunity to run. Realize I have no gear at all at this point.Steal from a dead guard.I am now disguised as a guard. I am not known as an escapee anymore. Leave the town with a big grin on my face.			"

								I'm changing my review from a negative one to a positive one. There's just too much potential and fun in this game to hate on it. It has camera control issues, lag, and sometimes incredibly frustrating pathing issues, but I found that cranking down the graphics settings helped with some of those problems. With a great mod that increased the population limit and squad size, I've been having a lot of fun establishing bases and sending out parties to explore. If this game ever reaches completion (the full map accessible, some of the mechanics fixed - i.e. kidnapping/stealth kill which doesn't seem to work) this game will be incredible. In my opinion it's a better Fallout than Fallout - if you don't mind some beta flaws.Holy ♥♥♥♥ the pathing issues tho - those seriously need to be fixed.			"

 Kenshi: a promising gameI'm totally in to sandbox games so this game caught my eye. Interesting design and even is its in development stage very nice to play. It has a big map to play on even if only a part of the world are released in this early access.The game is promising in early and late game stages. Early on its hard to get money and you relay feel ousted by the societies. Late game has endless possibilities if you want to go to war on parts of the world you hate or be more friendly to allies in other part of the Kenshi world. There is lots of factions and some of them can even be a bit wild and eat you if you don't be careful....insert more ....			"

								This is a very in depth, fun game. You travel the world, recruiting other people to help you in your adventure. It's difficult to survive. I've been killed countless times because I enter a wrong building. Once you get set up and establish a decent sized village, the game gets a little easier. It's still being developed. I enjoy it so far. The difficulty makes it an enjoyable experience once you start to build a community. You have to research everything, practice skills for tremendous amounts of time and then hope you don't get mauled by some ridiculous creature while exploring and trying to expand your knowledge/resources/skill set.I would buy this game again without hesitation. I reccomend it for anyone who enjoys challenging RPG style gameplay in an enormous open world.			"

								Well worth the money. It's a great game for the price it's at, there are games that currently are out and ""AAA"" that arn't nearly as fun as this (i'm looking at you skyrim!) Yes, this is still early access, but it's decently stable with the odd crash here or there unless you opt into the experimental version. And if it doesn't look like it's that intresting now, check back in later down the line and see what else has been added, you might be surprised.Edit for 0.95.5: The game is coming along very well and recently has added unarmed combat and the dodge skill into the game. Now you too can live out your fantasy of being a hyper aggresive Saitama and devestate entire cities.			"

								I love this game. I will in detial describe the good and the bad. But in my opinion the good FAR outweighs the bad here!First off the bad:Sometimes the ai gets stuck. Yes sometimes the ai will get stuck running between projects or delivery, towns, buildings or just plain start to stand there. But they know this and are constantly working hard trying to fix and update this.Sometimes buildings get a little buggy with placement of walls or and other ""Shell building.""Wall placement is a little... off... to be nice, sometimes bandits will walk right through/under a wall and attack you leaving you shaking your head after you kill them and figure out where in the world they came from!? They had no shovels on them so... there's that.Graphics are a slight eh. They are updating these as they have just switched to a x64 bit engine. (Yes they are still keeping x86 and DX9 so no worries about specs there)there are a few more oddities in this game, but those are the biggest.Next are my favorite things about this game:It lets you create your OWN tale! Whether you and your band of nomads roam place to place conquering and killing everything, which I might add, is harder than you think! Or perhaps a peaceful trader just trying to make an honest living out of your hard work, or otherwise ill gotten gains. But maybe, just maybe you are the daring settlers off to make your own mark on the world, or what's left of it, by building yourself a nice and cozy town amongst the barren wastes.Maybe become the dreaded sand ninjas/samurai/drifters/assassins of lore!!!You can create or destroy in life as in this game, the options are limitless... well as limited to your imagination and what the game has so far.In the future they will be adding slavery, ranged combat, robotics, new lands, and it all makes me excited just thinking of the new tales and stories to be had!In the end, I rate this 8.3/10 so far, and I am expecting a 87/100 finished. I set my expectations low as not to be dissapointed. Hope this helps!!!!			"

Be a mercenary, bounty hunter, bandit, trader, create your own city or pirate haven, live off the land, beware the bandits and cannibals.

								Great for an engrossing and stylistic sprawling civ builder, but the unit cap and the limitations of early development means that you have to expect to give up for a while as more stuff gets added at some point. Still great for 20 hours for me so far.			"

								This game is great, even in it's early stage. The fact that you have many start options is amazing, very few games will give you this opportunity. I must admit i started at least 20 games... At first, the Freedom Seekers, a group of 7 people with a very good stack of building materials is tempting. So you can build a farm or mine very fast. In the long run, i decided to start solo, with the trader, no cash but what you have in your backpack is enough to get you started. If you're brand new to this, google a guide for beginner, believe me, it helps... As i said previously, it's in an early stage, so you will encounter some bugs... Thank god you haven't deselect the auto-save which will save you're skin many times, believe me. The producer is updating regularly so if you encounter some new bugs, like i did, it's fixed in no time. So, overall, all good except for the camera style... I can't adjust myself to click on the middle-mouse button to rotate camera, and for some reason the camera system is only for top-bottom activity, so if you're heading to a city that's up to a moutain, you can't see it until you're almost in it, as if you were trying to see a bird in the sky, it's only top-bottom, that's mainly the only problem i see on the current version of this amazing game... Enjoy!			"

								so an idea came to me while playing. i imported unit buildings research.  and seeing as my settlement is close to the town of catan for when ever reason catan inhabited my buildings and in my GUI i had one citizen and control of all of catan and still my own units. thats when the idea occured to me. give a scroll wheel on the GUI for the units (i know simple but needs to be said) and add tabs above the GUI so i can then assign units to a squad and make tabs at will that stack like cards in solitare. now i would rule the world with an iron fist with the largest city backing me but the game seems to enjoy crashing. but overall amazing game its been a long time (normally i would of fizzles out waiting) but the end game from what i guess is going to be insane! keep up the hardwork!

								A lot of people worry about buying Early Access games. And they should. Early Access is a risky investment for the consumer. But you don't need to worry about this developer. This is a solid team making a great game. I've had it several years now. It started off rough around the edges, buggy, unstable, but fun. I had a lot of fun in its early stages. Its a testament to the core aspects of the game that I loved it even with its Pre-Alpha quirks. It pre dates Early Access on Steam altogether. After all this time. The original lone developer, Chris, (and now a complete team) made something really special. Its got a ways to go. But it has grown exponentially since when I bought it even.I bought it just after they added sound to the game. I want to say that was 2012 but I don't quite remember. I had my eye on it prior to that but that is when I took the plunge. I started off confused. I wasn't really sure how the game worked. The style was nice but the world was a little off in the ways that any game is prior to an alpha release. Despite that, I had a great time. Its fun just roaming a desert. Its fun talking to the weird inhabitants.  It was awesome when I finally WON a fight. And base building is as fun as it is time consuming.I was running from city to city, gathering resources, gaining a comrade or two in the process. Booking it past Bandits and Ninjas to the safety of city. And, once I was strong enough, fighting back, with mixed results. It is interesting that the sense of relief I feel when my limping character carries a bleeding out comrade to the safety of city walls... is immediately followed by the desire to venture outside of those walls yet again. Thats Kenshi for you. Its all in the goals you set for yourself. The original map was a massive desert. Fun but monotonous. The new map adds quite a bit of spice to that. Swamps. Fog Islands, Coastal areas, Forests, Mountains, and a new and improved desert. More is to come. Only half of the map is available at the moment, but it is huge. I'm not even close to discovering all the major cities and I have put 20 hours this week on exploring it (and that is all I have been doing with my squad)First the danger outside of those walls was Ninjas and Bandits. New updates added Cannibals, wildlife... fog men. There are hostile areas (particularly in the North) you should back off from unless you have a group of solid fighters. Either the enemy's numbers or skill will overwhelm a new player there. I really enjoy the creature design. Familiar creatures exist like dogs, bulls, turtles and then there are Garrus, Beak Things, and some creatures that should be avoided altogether because they are four stories tall. Its a journey for your squad and its a personal thing, because the game doesn't tell you where to go. It doesn't tell you to stop until all of your guys are dead. It just says, ""GO."" From a guy with a sword to an impressive company of nomadic traders. From a crippled old man stranded in the desert to builder of a city. An escaped slave to the conqueror of an empire.			"

								Can´t believe this started as a one man project. It´s still ALPHA but it´s totally awesome. A sandbox RPG kinda like Mount & Blade  but much better with realistic swordfights that improve with experience. Can´t wait what comes in the next Update- The dev is clearly a genius specialised in AI and it´s unbelievable what he´s done so far. I would love to buy this at full price- finally something new in a time where devs just like to ruin the old games in bad remakes. Please excuse my bad English, it´s not my native language.			"

								The game can be described as Skyrim meets town building.I think the beauty of it is probably the early game struggle whether you're playing a single warrior or a weak bunch of settlers... in both experiences you'll only just be barely surviving and it's that edge of your seat moment to moment that makes the game so addicting. Yes in time you will become a master but it does the early game better than other survival rpgs in the genre. You will come to care about your characters if only due to all the extreme close calls you've been through with them.If you can imagine your most ideal open sandbox game lacking only a well written story or deep characters, well that's Kenshi.It does go from being one of the best games I've played to being a painful bug-ridden headache. But the Dev is very active adding a lot of new content quickly and likewise trying to fix bugs just as fast. I have a lot of faith in the Dev and the beautiful game he's creating and know it will be a labor of love that only continues to get better over the years.The highs for me overcome the lows. I'd recommend playing, it will be a game you remember fondly for a long time to come - provided you're lucky enough to have your first playthrough be a stable experience :)			"

								I Love the idea of this game and have put about 90 hours into it.  I believe in being honest so here is the good and the bad.First the bad, the game lags quite a bit if you don't lower view distances even with an I7-6900K, 64GB ram, 1080 video card, 3 SSD raid 0.  In other words a pretty decent gaming rig.  In order to get it to a playable state I had to drastically reduce viewing distances, turn off shadows, reflections etc....  I am able to play in the correct resolution for my monitor 3440x1440 but I had to turn most options fairly low before it was in a playable state.  Game is still in Alpha apparently, so may be this will be worked on and get corrected in the future through some sort of optimization.  Now for some of the good things about this game!  Character customization is superb, you can drastically change the way your toon looks when getting setup.  The devs have made massive updates to the game content wise since I first started playing it.  The game world looks substantially better than it used too in almost every single way imaginable.  I am not saying the graphics are F'ing amazing or something but they have improved and the world is not nearly as boring as it once was visually.Long story short it is a good indie title and definitely enjoyable if you have some patience.  Just remember your character sucks badly when you start and your best bet is running from danger to begin with.  You characters improve steadily through harvesting, fighting, running, carrying heavy objects, manufacturing etc... etc... if you like the idea of a squad based sandbox game with no real end game goal this could help you kill many an hour of boredom.

Extremely addicting tactical game with alot of possibilities... that just improve with time. 8/10Because of its numerous possilities (can make a town, make a squad, research stuff, sell stuff, set up a shop etc..) as a squad game (in other words, you give commands... your units will do actions without you manually having to do them 1 by 1) i give it a 5. 2 points i reserve as a matter of taste and 1 point for the amount of details and uniqueness this game has.Updates are slow so im still waiting for more stuff before starting all over. but its definetly a great game that proves that, unique and awesome games may come from the smallest or most unexpected places.

Early Access Review
								If you are looking for a game you can casually play for a few hours and be done with it, you should not buy Kenshi. This game takes a lot of time to get almost anything done. The huge world alone (and not even all of it is playable at this point) takes hours to explore, especially if you dont want your characters to starve on the way. The different zones make the world feel interesting enough, even though there are a lot of huge open spaces (perfectly suited to start a base).There are a lot of different ways you can play this game:Build a base with everything you need protected by a huge wall strong enough to withstand groups of raiders... orGather a few capable fighters to pillage camps, raider groups and whole cities if you are up to it... orMove swiftly in the shadows while you steal the most expensive goods to sell in another city where nobody knows (or cares) that the goods were stolen in the first place.But no matter what you do, be prepared to lose fights and almost get killed or enslaved over and over again, until you are an experienced survivor, because the start is very rough and the first few hours you will probably barely hang on to your life. But keep going, because once your stats allow you to withstand a proper fight, it will be so rewarding to pay back the beating.All in all this game has already very deep and intriguing mechanics and no matter what play style you choose, there is enough content to keep you busy for days. The development seems slow at first, but whenever there is a content update, it is usually pretty profound. The game is still a little glitchy, but there have been big improvements over the last year, so apart from occasional reloading, the bugs are not really much of a problem anymore.			"

								I remember seeing this game a couple years ago and being genuinely interested. I had a He-Man Lunchbox for a rig back then, so I figured it wouldn't run and held off on the purchase. Fast forward to my current rig, and now I still can't run it at max. But even with choppy frames it held my interest.The open world of Kenshi gives you an interesting post-post-apocalyptic backdrop where death is a constant threat, but survival is rewarded. Next to nothing remains of the old world, and there's been too many generations since for anyone to remember it or even know about it. The desert sands have left only unrecognisable hulking metal structures for scavengers to gather scrap iron, and the technologies of the past are only hinted about in tattered books that are sold at high prices. A fanatical religion dabbling in feudalism controls most cities and outposts, but searching beyond their military's grasp will find you in stranger places and their people, where you might find reward or a desolate death.In Kenshi, the player's role in the world is never specified. Your actions are completely free to you, but the world does react to them. What sets it apart from other sandbox is that NPC's can perform the same actions as you. Bandits will loot you after knocking you out, and factions may send trader's if your shop interests them. When you're researching walls and farming techniques, NPC outposts are studying the same, if not better, technologies. The Kenshi world is truly large, and set to be even bigger with future updates. There's nothing else really like Kenshi in similar genre's, and it's a truly ambitious idea. Only regret is not buying it earlier.			"

Even though it's early access and still bug riddled, the devs are still putting out updates so it's not like a Stomping Lands kind of deal.The soundtrack is probably my favorite part of it. Beign a video game design student that is focusing on audio and visuals, the soundtrack sets the tone and just gives me chills. I would very much like to meet the head of the sound department for this. Gameplay reminds me of Baldur's Gate in a sense, with the stop starting squad movements.Overall, quite an amazing game well worth its price.

Graphics are a bit heavy on low end PC's but meh.. we need to evolve eventually.

								The most important thing first off to mention is it's an early access game. it is by no means complete, and if you choose to buy it keep that in mind. However, I myself bought it when it was $15, and really after playing it for so long and getting so much out of it when it is not even close to complete I would have been willing to pay much more than that. This is a masterpiece in the works, and is well on its way. The only complaint I can make is the updates are fairly spaced out, but this is very understandable because of the type of game this is and the size of the development team. If anything they are fairly sporadic in their updates all considered.If you like the idea of building a city/army/both, or strategy games in general, this is for sure the game for you and I recommend buying it as soon as possible not only to support the developers in their endeavors but also to experience the greatness.

								This game looks extremely promising. Gameplay is amazingly good. Its a sandbox (on the sand) RPG, with heavy strategy elements. You can be a solo adventurer or gather a group of people to fight alongside you, or even get lots of people and work to build an entire city for you.  Graphics are a bit heavy on low end PC's but meh.. we need to evolve eventually. Its 2015.Now depending on how the story is going to be and the interaction with NPC's, this might be one of the best games so far.Or just another preety game that we play for some time and abandon.. But sure looks very promising.			"

								A realy great game and worth a buy even in its early access state..An rts/rp/sim/ninja/running/headf**k of a city building style game with alot more..Im not gonna get into all you can do go look at youtube for that..Great building system.Fresh Training/leveling system (The more you do something the better you get).Large map (All sand but new bios comming soon).Not easy mode, if you want a squad of elite ninjas you will have to train them. rest/house them. keep them alive with medics and craft them gear and weapons.The game will crash .... alot so get used to saving and its not so bad.The ai tends to get stuck, stand around and do strange things but ...ya know early access.You need to put time into this game to get the good so if your looking for an arcade style fighting ..keep looking.But all that said i love this game and if you can look past the early access bugs buy it as its gonna be something unique.

								My take on Kenshi is a mixed bag.  Bottom line is I love the game but it's horrendously buggy and development is extremely slow.They bill it as an RPG with RTS elements, but it doesn't play that way for me.  I see it more as an RTS with RPG elements.  You scavenge materials, build a base, train recruits and laborers and defend or go on the aggressive.  It reminds me a bit of Earth 2150 in how each unit can earn experience and lvl up (the RPG aspects) while maintaining an RTS-like squad-focused feel.It's a lot of fun training your troops and building your town up.  But the bugs, oh my.  If you play the ""stable"" release, expect to crash randomly every hour or so like clockwork.  I honestly had better stability with the ""experimental"" opt-in steam beta branch, however some friends with similar rigs say they can't play the experimental version at all due to single digit frame-rates (it plays fine for me).  But either way you go, the sad state of pathing AI in this game really kills the joy.  Regular reloads when your own guys get stuck in the landscape and terrain and a constant spectacle of enemy units stuck on hills and corners.   This is by far the worst of the bugs, but there are lots of others.I really like the game and think it has awesome potential, but the state of development and the persistence of bugs through so many releases really has me discouraged.If you managed to pick it up on sale like I did and don't mind risking a small investment on a game with great potential, then go for it.  If you aren't willing to throw money at a project that may never be completed and has too many bugs to enjoy for any length of time in it's current state, then I suggest you wait and see what happens.  For me, I'd do it again.  I knew what I was getting into and the sale price of $10 makes it an acceptable risk.			"

								So, I've been playing for 20+ hours now and I can Say I love to hate this game.Its a good RPG or Town management game that you have to manage squads, hunger and resources.Only downside, is that there is a tonne of stuff that needs to be fixed.All good games do take that time of course but when you are trying to farm and get raided and crash as it auto saves will drive you mad.Pros: you will lose your squad mates, you will want to build more, you have the freedom to mod the game for your self. BUGS THAT CAN KILL YOU, and holy arsehats they hate anything non-humanCons: the game is still being made, it doesn't run smoothy at first but does after a while. FPS drops alot in new areas. BUGS THAT WILL KILL YOUR COMPUTER, and lack of playable races(without you adjusting some stuff in the game editor)It has a lot of content, Its a solid game, needs alot of work but I think it will be worth it in the end. Limit your self in this game to see if you can do well. And have fun waiting for your guys to heal in cages. "

								First of all, my playtime is not accurate as I bought Kenshi well before it was available on Steam. Just want to add my thoughts about the dev cycle of this game. I rarely buy games before their full release given the risks of doing so. In the past years I have seen the dev team for this game go from basically one person's passion project to something more likely to be able to provide the grand vision the dev has. I have to say I have been impressed with this dev's committment to this title, even after making a good deal of pre-order/beta sales over the years. Integrity is important, and in my view this dev has done a good job working consistently to live up to his promises during this time. If watching a passion project game slowly grow is something you can be patient and handle, Kenshi is worth the ask price.tl;dr I do not regret buying this title years ago pre-steam. Would buy again.

I wasn't disappointed. Even with the alpha glitches this game is great fun, and with upcoming features and more polish I can see myself being sucked in for many more hours.The way the skill system works is great, it's a style you don't see very often anymore. You want to get faster, run. You want to get stronger, carry heavy things. You want to get tougher, get hit in the face with a brick.I will continue to play this in it's alpha state and look forward to each upcoming patch.			"

								If you liked M&B you will love this. Bear in mind that being in alpha state the game has some issues like glitching, AI pathing conundrum, and squad members randomly forgeting what jobs you have assigned them. Apart from that the absolute freedom of gameplay is there. The grind to level up your skills is substantial as well but then again you feel a certain satisfaction when you hit that coveted threshold. I am looking forward to seeing this game bloom into its final release version.			"

								This is a unique game, like no other. Very good and hours can be put into it.In this game, you are not the chosen one, you are a nobody, make a name for yourself, get strong or sit in a coma for days without food in the middle of nowhere, maybe bleeding a bit...... And as I lay there gazing at the skyMy body's numb and my throat is dryAnd as I lay forgotten and aloneWithout a tear I draw my parting groan.			"

								Update 2/20/2016:This has been a LONG time in the making, but the game has progressed nicely. Content is always coming and the game is looking amazing. The struggle to survive is real. Now with food and water being an issue, it's not quite so simple as scavenge what you can to sell and get better weapons and armor. Nope, now it's actually more surviving. Great game if you are looking something more realistic in terms of survival as in most things can kill you, and if it doesn't, it give you a broken arm/leg making the next thing so much more likely to. Highly recomended. This is a very cool and HARD realistic type game... which makes it AWESOME!!! Definately recommended!			"

								A one of it's kind genre of a game. Open World RTS RPG ect ect. The work on the game is quite fast (considering the features added all the time) and was slowed down by a huge amount of work on Pathfinding, which is finally done. In the meantime, they've been adding animals, random insult generator, and all sorts of fun stuff to their dev build in preparation for the finished pathfinding. I found the game fun back in the earliest stages of alpha, without sound, great graphics, or any polish at all. It was buggy but fun then, now the bugs are fewer and the fun is far greater.The limitations for the game are slowly getting reversed, and the game is becoming more grand by the day, with lots of dev updates and supports. The community is still small, meaning it's a lot easier to get a message across to the devs if you are feeling concerned. Overall, this is my all time favorite strategy game, start the game with a stick and become a martial arts master who runs a fortress with well armed squad of companions who tear up all sorts of bandit life in the wastelands.The game is great, but it's only gonna get better from here!

								This game. Its worth the investment people, even if the develpoment process is a bit slow. The game filled the part of my soul that yearned for freedom within a game. Ive put in a decent amount of time and tried a few different playstyles. This game is definitely meant to be played as a team based rts, but my favorite style is to go for the one man army. Picking fights, losing misertably, watching your bruised and battered swordsman crawl back from the brink of death...nothing tops it. 11/10 would brutalize my character again. thank you lo-fi games			"

								 Kenshi deserves your money. Not only does the store page entice buyers, but it seems that the devs are actively listening to their buyers and are updating the game on a semi-regular basis. I owned this game when all I had to work with was a barely functional ""promise"" that, for the most part, held up and made an enjoyable ""God game"". Now the 'one-man' dev team has escalated into an actual team, there is actual music and sound, base defense, talk of a stealth/interogation mechanic, and wild animals! This is more than I asked for and I thank the devs personally for making this game and continuing to improve upon it.			"

								Kenshi is a game that i have always loved because of how harsh it is, in other games like this you can destroy bandits and other enemys easily. But in this if you go out and try to fight bandits you will die, and fast too.its a game where it doesnt have to be about combat either, yuo could be a farmer, shopkeeper, bandit, trader and many more occupations. i dont have many hours on kenshi but i do plan on playing more and i think it was worth investing my money in.

								my my where to begin... this game is over 9000% early access (strange bugs, horrible pathfinding, very little variety in anything, very few updates, so many unexplained crashes) and yet... it appeals to me like very few other games have. i mean when you first jump in the game is hard as diamond and as rough as sharks skin and more brutal than dark souls but i think it really sets the mood.the game takes place on some sort of desert planet full of bandit groups, thugs for higher and shabby towns. its survival of the fittest and you better hope you and your crew are fit to survive.Pros:-completely open ended gameplay (you want to murder and cage every npc in a particular town? if your characters are strong enough then by all means!)-super in depth damage system (some bandit breaks both your legs? prepare to crawl on home boy, and pray that you don't lose em!)-build your own town/outpost (for training, crafting, and trading)-lots of crafting to be done-super in depth character creation (can also be used on newly recruited characters)-indication on the hud on who is being aggroed allows the easy snapping to any battle situation no matter what you are doing with verry little load time (like if you have 3 units running weapons to a nearby town for trading when suddenly a group of bandits shows up to your town)cons:-some structures can not be deleted-its not entirely clear whether or not your machines are not working because you don't have any power or they are full of junk at first glance-some of the UI is cut off-fast forward not fast enough (i don't want to watch my guy with broken legs carrying tons of stuff and an unconscious ally inch along the barren desert for hours looking for a town with a bed)-beds are easily exploitable     -if you have no cash or the bed is not public you can just pick someone up and lay them on the bed and it just works        -you can place NPCs with bounties who are ""dying"" in beds to prevent them from kicking the bucket and as an added bonus they also won't take any♥♥♥♥♥♥from guards who will be aggroed on them until they are removed from the bed(s)-very peculiar bugs (one that comes to mind is my armor smith somehow getting a stack of 40000 iron plates and another stack of the same size in the container i was keeping them in when he only had time to make 40 or so of them and his AI constantly taking way more that the armor making station can hold and stopping work on armor production as a result)-SUPER ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PATHFINDING!- one of the towns has 2 gates however one of them is blocked by a poorly made hill or something and the pathfinding dictates that they exit the other gate and go all the way around the outer town wall just to get to where they are going.-super steep learning curve-amazingly slow pace-HaVOK physics engine makes ragdolls look silly (even the dev made fun of it on twitter)-strange bugs with carrying people some distance and later dropping them-job allocation not clear enough (and for the longest time i didn't even know it was a thing making for a lot of tedious micro management)if you don't mind bugs and don't have interest in any finished games at the moment: get itif you do mind bugs or are looking at other games that are complete: go get those other games! its early access (at the time of writing this its actually in alpha) its not done and many of the cons i listed may be fixed by the time it actually comes out. so for you guys i would just wait until then.

								I have played over 40 hours and so far I had a nice ride. Here´s my review:good graphics and setup. the character design and customization is neat, although I played zoomed out most of the time anyways. nice ideas and gameplay when it comes to base building and crafting. pretty good production chains. very nice concepts in this game. I love the post-apocalyptic-style of world design. atmoshpere-wise this really stand out.BUT... and there´s always a but it seems:( i know it´s early access , I get it. I never expected a finished game. it´s not that I bught it without having experience with other EA titles.)1. core mechanics not working or not working consistently enoughthis one is my main concern. workers forget their jobs, which means you end up a lot of micromanaging individual group members. also pathfinding and collision is a mess sometimes. even the workaround (which are offered, that´s a plus) don´t work consistently2. slow development cycles. the game is in development, which is nice. but so far I have experienced only one real update. the devs are in contact with the playersm which is nice. but I wonder how this game will ever pick up some momentum and gain some ground. basically from my standpoint, i couldn´t care less about great char graphics and player customization... thats all icing on the cake once its baked and finished to eat. but pathing, collision and AI behaviour is so essential for this kind of game that it needs to get taken care of asap. and when  Í read on the forums that some core game bugs are dependent on the actual game engine chosen for the game, I am prone to believe that maybe the have chosen the wrong engine....its been a good expense/reward scenario for me. I don´t mind spending the money as the time I played was great. but there´s no poin fo rme in keeping playing right now, because of the points mentioned before. keep in mind: it´s early access. so if you want to support the game and idea behind it (like I wanted to):buy it. its a good investment as the game itself will be sweet once it´s far more advanced. whenever that might be though...

								Update 10/07/15Kenshi has gone through a massive bug bash and is now far more playable than ever before. It is still missing the complete world map and still needs more content, but the majority of the bugs i mentioned in my review are now squashed! Kenshi has all the potential to be a great game, possibly even Warband great.At the moment it is fun but with no real longevity and a lot of bugs. This is to be expected in any Early Access game and as more content is added and the bugs are slowly squashed the game will only get better.Pros* A different play style - the world is cruel and you are but a grape waiting to be stamped on. (being beaten to a pulp by a group of starving homeless people with sticks, wearing pajamas is a cruel start to any game.)* Excellent damage system - limb damage and animations.* Base building (leads to CTD's at the moment but you can still experiment.)* The beginnings of an economy, with many items to purchase, craft and sell. (selling is a little bugged and not fully implemented yet.)* Open sandbox world - with the promise of many more biomes to come (currently there is only one flavor, desert!)Cons* Bugs glorious bugs! - CTD's every hour or so in the stable version, less to none with experimental, but a boat load of others such as NPC's getting stuck everywhere.* Without quests, faction relations and other planned features the game can get a little repetitive after 4-6hrs. (you will need to create your own adventure.)* Thrown in at the deep end - steep learning curve (can also be seen as a pro!)* Slow developmentMy main issue with Kenshi, and i believe the only reason you should not buy it if you like this type of game is the slow development speed. I cope with this because i really do believe in the devs and understand that this was a 1 man show for a long time and that this is their 1st project together. Everyone has to start somewhere! But because of this big bugs, such as the memory leaks and pathfinding are taking a long time to squash!So, should you buy Kenshi? If you like open world RPG squad management games... then it all depends how patient you are..... if you are not, then i would wait, there is an option on the Kenshi website to receive an email when the game is fully released.

								I'll write a short tale on how I became Hitler of Kenshi, the human experimenter.My journey began in wanting to be the world's greatest swordsman. So naturally I studied how to increase my combat skills. It says in the description of leveling up your combat skills, such as katana, dexterity, offense, and defence to fight stronger opponents than you in order to gain a bonus in leveling them. But, the obvious problem to that is when fighting stronger opponents you run a very high risk of dying. So I took on a passive approach. In the beginning I aggroed stronger mobs into friendly cities in order to maybe get a hit in between the crossfire. After the fighting was over I looted and bandaged the mob. Then I realised something, if the mob were not armed (because I looted them) they cannot fight back. Thus I learned a faster method to grinding my skills. Every once in a while I would get hurt so I ran to the local inn and rested my injuries. There I wondered, if I can rest my body faster this way, can I rest the bad guy's bodies? Of course I can. So I started making a human farm of looted enemies where I would beat them to unconsciousness, put them on a bed, then beat them to unconsciousness when they got better. But, the story doesn't end here. Later when I was building my village I noticed I can construct prison cages. What originally started out as a simple outpost for researching weapon crafting, turned into a human livestock factory of caged samurais and holy paladins where they would be beaten to unconsciousness every momment they are awake.tldr: I made a post-apocalyptic japanese concentration camp.9/10 (1- for the damn glitches, go finish the game)			"

								I gave this game a negative review about a year ago. The reason for that was at the time, the game had stuff to do but doing any of it required you to travel across a vast and featureless desert. I played for two hours and most of that time was spent doing almost literally nothing. It was a slog. I didn't mind the difficult and unforgiving combat, and the lack of ranged options only put me off mildly. It was that wide open desert, that vast expanse of nothingness seperating all that juicy interesting content.I noticed Kenshi in my library recently, and knowing well that it's developer was dedicated to making this game, I clicked it to see what had changed in the last year between now and when I had written that first review. As a friend of mine said, Development had gone from slow to frantic in that space of time. The old boring map was scrapped in favor of a far more interesting landscape. I installed the game and upon booting and making my character, my eyes were met with far more than brown sand and nothingness. The landscape is clearly still a wasteland, but it is now filled with interesting flora and fauna, and dotted with the twisted metal wreckage of some long gone peoples. I actually WANT to see this new world that Kenshi's creator has put foreward. That alone is enough for me to turn a thumbs down into a thumbs up. Apart from that, the game also features several races and female characters now. Sneaking and theft are a thing. Ranged combat is still not planned except for as mounted crossbow emplacements, which irks me a bit but not badly. Some of the stuff I didn't get to see before has become more accessable thanks in part to a landscape which isn't ballachingly tedious and boring to cross. The UI is also a lot more attractive and fitting.As a final note from my new experiance with Kenshi, I entered a town and immediately some preist told me I was a ♥♥♥♥♥ and needed to repent the darkness in my heart. Also, Someone shouted that some bandit nearby was ""possessed by skeletons!"" I know that one of the races is called ""skeletons"" but at the same time, I find the concept very funny.			"

Early Access Review
KenshiI will start by giving a brief history of my experience with Kenshi....When I first seen this game I was ecstatic, I felt like finally an rpg like sandbox/simulation game was being developed that had a theme which I found fitting and unique. It came across as something being built upon and in a very ambitious manner. When I first jumped in kenshi I did not have much to work with other than running from town to town across this expansive desert or farming hemp. NPCs were pretty rare at this point and it did not matter much to me. I still found myself running around aimlessly, having fun just imaging what this game can eventually turn out to be. I truly believe this game has nigh endless possibility for the fans out there of this style of game play.I have to say all in all this game is pretty self explanatory from the trailer. You can choose several starts for your character, all of which give you a different style of game play starting from a solo rp play style to a squad based one. (you can start with 1 pc or 5, you can start as a trader or retired soldier) When you get in after creating your PC you are given a rough ui with all the controls laid out in a help screen. Forewarning this is not a walk in the park, expect your survivability to be low especially when picking a tougher starting.However, regardless of what start you end up picking you will most likly be forced to do a few monotonous things to survive. Such as having hostile npcs chase you into town, staying alive while the guards kill said hostile npcs and then looting/selling the gear you recover from them. Admittedly this is an issue, one I see being resolved as the skill and stat system is fleshed out more. Albeit I feel as of right now, in the stage this game is currently in (alpha) it would not appeal to someone lacking the needed patience or interest in Kenshi's development. IMO - I am willing to wait as long as it takes to see this game reach it's full potential. A project of this magnitude takes time, and I hope the devs keep updating it with the slow and steady approach. This means working updates that actually change major aspects of the games mechanics, graphics, ai, landscapes...I think I have seen these guys rework or update about almost everything this game has to offer since initial release.  UpdatesIf you have any doubts about this game seeing updates, I would ask you to consider the following. I have been following Kenshi closely for some time and the developers are making a fantastic effort with updates. I have about 60 hrs so far putting in a few every other week since initial release. I can say the changes this game has undergone is tremendous. Here you can find any info regarding updates and the roadmap[www.lofigames.com]Be patient and take solace in knowing you will be supporting something that does take great effort to create. The team for Kenshi is not all that lucrative afaik and the amount of work I personally have seen put in at this stage is well worth the current price tag. Pros vs Cons(All subject to personal preference)  Pros Cons   Price Tag Very Long Devel Stages   Endless Possibility/Modding Support A lot of monotony in this stage/Very Long Devel Stages   Major bugs are hot fixed fast You Can Find A lot of bugs   Time Consuming Time Consuming Short of the developers studio being swallowed whole by the earth itself or losing all funding...I don't see this one not living up to it's potential. With the extent of this games mechanics and the capability of a modding community, the sky is the limit for this one. Another game that will surely, one day become a classic among the host of others.Recommended "

Early Access Review
								This is one of the few early access titles I've not regretted picking up early. It delievers a decent level of content already with a lot more promised on the horizon, and it actually abides by the spirit of what early access is rather than just being a sort of super early preorder; the developer actually uses community feedback to determine what features to focus on.The game itself is also very engaging, but that's more a matter of personal preference. At its core it's primarily a sandbox game (and as far as I'm aware the first sandbox game to feature primarily desert, which strikes me as odd; think of the symbolism!), though at the moment it isn't as flexible as you'd expect a sandbox game to be. Even in early access, however, there is a decent level of easily accessible moddibility to be found. You can tweak and create weapons, NPCs, characters and even build NPC towns and modify the base mechanics of the game with a simple and relatively straightforward GUI.There is unfortunately not much more to say about the game at this stage because it is still early access and seemingly a long way off from release, which may be enough to put a lot of people off. Let me repeat because it can't be overstated: this game is made by an incredibly small team (it was a team of one for a long time) and it isn't likely to be finished in 2014, maybe not even in 2015. But it's already a fun game at its core if you like squad based RPGs or town building simulators or a mix of both, and it is steadily progressing. I also expect that over the coming year it'll start seeing some decent modding.			"

								The game used to be fun and great to play ( normally only the settlement start anyway ) but now it perfoms horrible and as always it crashes constantly , I appreciate its still EA and that its recently been updated in a huge way but for the years ive had and loved this game its just been 1 step forward 2 steps back the majority of the way , new implementations are rare and very badly optimized . I hope this game acheives its potential because It truly is a great idea but as it stands currently save your money.			"

								To preface this review I would like to say,  ""I really did not want to rate this game negativly. I also understand the early access stance of the game"" It has a bold and unique style. And presents great ""Potential"" for gameplay. Many systems are implimented and more will be added. The game handles adventure and  the life of a wonder very well. These aspects will get even better with the new map. This is were my issue with the developers priorities come in. Far more resources need to go to bug fixing at the moment before adding new content. The second you start trying to build any mildly complicated base you will be in micro managing hell. Characters commonly get stuck  when depositing items into storage, get stuck under the stairs of buildings, randomly get their position confused and think they are outside a gate (this one is a little wierd), characters fill their inventories with♥♥♥♥♥♥when the container they are trying to hall to is full (I could probably fix this one if given access to the code. Check if their is space to stire the item in before allowing a character to pick up items from the original container. Items currently being hauled there by any any other character assigned to the task of auto hauling are counted into this total as well. They would still have issues if the player fills the container they are going to manually, but it is a start.), river raptors congregating at the base door and glitching through. Most of the issues involving characters being stuck can be fixed by reloading saving and loading the game. Until the game crashes as a result of this.			"

								A very fun and addictive game a cross between stratergy and survival game genre. You can choose diffrent sceneries to start your story all of which add diffrent difficulties and fun to the game for example one spawns you in the middle of a camp of cannibils in which your be knocked out and have to escape, Another starts you off with a bunch of freedom seekers wanting to start their own town with a few supplies to get you started. This game adds a lot of replayability and freedom it has a few bugs here and there but it has a lot of promise and in this stage i find the game very fun and addictive.  One of my favirote features is the body health feature which if a body part gets damaged too much it will effect how you move and behave like holding your stomach from being damaged in the torso or being damaged on the leg causes you to limp which adds a dramatic feel to the game trying to limp to safety to a town or your outpost from bandits. this game still gets updated and improved on and i'm excited about seeing the future content they are lining up for this gem of a game.

								Kenshi is the best squad based game I have played since I started playing games. I've played it for quite some time and could recommend this game to anyone.In it's current state Kenshi has some bugs but they will be worked out by the developers, it is most definitely worth buying and proves to be a great game to play for hours on end. In it's current state you are able to create a base, run a trade empire or even bring law to the lands by slaughtering bandits and turning their bosses in for bounties.Kenshi is a great game and deserves more patience from its crowd, there is no other like it and so you cannot judge it as you judge the others.

You can become many things and do even more things. If you like Open World RPGs with  some management elements and alot of your own choices leading somewhere interesting.The game has been in development for a long time with useful updates. It shows that the Devs are devoted and really wanna make something worthy for themselves and their players. I'm liking/supporting, maybe you should be too?  :) "

								This concept is the best i've ever seen, hands down. Love it.INSTA FANBOY, of the concept!!!I'm not even going to list to many of the bugs and flaws...because it's still in an alpha/beta  stage,and has been so for a long time.7 years + mostly with one guy working on it.Biggest Cons imo are,Lack of Heavy armor types/skinsNo AXESNo Maces,hammersNo bows/ranged combat..is planed tho on the roadmap.lack of buildingsBuilding walls is so broken its sad after countless fixes over the years including the new beta build.Men building the walls bug getting stuck in place or just will not build them etc.Can run through walls.(will be fixed )Even with chase disabled your men will chase enemy and start to spread out across the landscape.Game needs a stand ground or hold postion option for squads.The lag is real,game needs to be optomized.The stuff that makes this game just Great.(really to much to list)You can set up bases anywhere you want and as many as you want.Have up to 30 men in your faction,you must arm them and train them(this number will go up during beta maybe,if not easy to mod or DL a mod off the workshop)Buy and sell  goods.NPC SHOPS WORKCan have pack animals so far Bulls are in gameCan have dogs.Craft yourself and your men swords and armor.Huge open would. check the roadmap on their website.(Google LO-FI games.)The combat  is good,lacks good sounds tho.You can hardly hear any combat sounds in general.Hard at first, after maybe 10 hours or less becomes a cakewalk till more things are added.(that is if your starting guy or men are built up enough and have not been KILLED!!!)Each of your men have about 40 or so skills,its pretty crazy that you can lv up.Lots of research trees to upgrade everything.PERMA DEATHImport to a new world(map) with your squad you had from other saves...Steam workshop-modsCreate mods with the FCS,comes with game.Overall tho this game is cool and worth the time.Play this games experimental build that way you can play with all the new stuff before it gets added into the ""stable build"" the games gonna crash no matter what build,so imo its better to see all that the game has in it.After playing on the new map a bit,94hrs+ so far...got to say its looking good lacks flat areas worth building a nice looking base.I give the games concept a 10/10  the build 7/10 so far. Worth the 20 bucks as there is nothing like this one.			"

The game features town building, tech research, farming, mining, smithing, squad building and lots of exploration and fighting.  There also seems to be a growing mod community for the game.			"

								Update: April 6, 2016The Beta landed on 4-1-16 (EST) and already there have been no less than nine (9) hotfixes. The map is long and dark and full of mystery. All of the game mechanics are being refined. I know it seems to be a bit assholish to declare one's self correct, but, I was right about this one. Kenshi is an absolute joy, even when it is killing me. Its difficult nature lends to its developing world. Its unforgiving nature challenges the Player in ways that almost make her quit. Yet, she can't. Because the world of Kenshi is so beautiful and full of challenge. I highly recommend this game.Update: March 31, 2016Gotta say, I am super psyched for the beta release that is incoming. I have logged at least 150 hours since I wrote about my initial reaction to the thing that is Kenshi. I say 'thing' because this game is quite unlike anything I have ever played before. Yet, it is something I have always wanted as a gamer ever since I can remember.It scratches an itch that I've had for years. It combines sand box with squads and squads with player characters. It merges tower defense with  world domination. Troop dispositions and enemy  patrols so seamless, you might have died and gone to Heaven. But no. There is no Heaven in Kenshi. You could build a haven though, if you live long enough...There are strange beasts that roam the lands, looking only to pick off your weakest squad member. Leviathans prowl the dunes searching for... I don't know what... Best hope your haven isn't in their path.There are roving bands of dispicable men who would surely cut your throat as soon as rob you.There are strange tribes of what once were people who seek only to sate their hunger in this wasteland. I have grown used to dealing with the Cannibals, but, I wonder what brings them this far South? A lack of meat, maybe. Or perhaps they wish to test me and mine's swords...The Lo-Fi folks have lovingly and diligently crafted an amazing game. I have had a ton of fun playing it over the years. Yes, development has been ""slow"". But, damn if it didn't develop!!!I wish nothing but the best for Lo-Fi and thank them for the amazing times I've had playing in their world.After only an hour and a half, I can say without a doubt that this charming game is a gem and one I will enjoy watching develop even further.There is some nicely layered gameplay here with the RTS styled squad-based combat, base building and research opportunities. I have only skimmed the surface of this game but I can already tell I have many hours of fun ahead as I develop my army, base and economy.With the currently ongoing STEAM sale of Kenshi, I'd recommend jumping in now to support the developer in bringing this game to fruition as the little online research I have already done reveals that there is much more fun to be had in the comming months!

								Kenshi is the best squad based game I have played since I started playing games. I've played it for quite some time and could recommend this game to anyone.In it's current state Kenshi has some bugs but they will be worked out by the developers, it is most definitely worth buying and proves to be a great game to play for hours on end. In it's current state you are able to create a base, run a trade empire or even bring law to the lands by slaughtering bandits and turning their bosses in for bounties.Kenshi is a great game and deserves more patience from its crowd, there is no other like it and so you cannot judge it as you judge the others.

								This game has come a long way from its humble beginning. Even at the early stage it was very playable. Since then more features and improvements have been made. I like the fact that the dev does not rush things and in doing so I can see this game having a very large fan base when its finally completed. Its difficult to describe this game accurately as it contains many well thought out ideas. Its a great combination of things and because death comes swiftly to the unwary you actually start to care about each individual member of your group. They are vulnerable like any human and require training and experience. As this takes time you can get quite upset should one day your group get attacked by a large group of bandits and many members die or become seriously injured. Its this level of detail that makes the game so rewarding because you have to actually think rather than just throw a bunch of disposable, easily respawned soldiers into battle as you would in other RTS games. In Kenshi a human life is a valuable commodity.			"

								Kenshi is well thought out and being actively worked on with quick responses to bugs. There is a lot to look forward to and I can't wait to see how this game matures.  It is already quite enjoyable putting together a squad and leveling up. The character development, combat, crafting, and building have interesting mechanics which refect nuances of reality. The game can be paused and saved at any moment which makes it great for short stints or a weekend binge, but I often find it hard to quit.			"

								It took me a long time to decide to buy Kenshi a year ago or so. I was really intriged by this game I've never heard of before and that poping up in my steam suggestions. After reading some reviews and watching some gameplay videos I decided to risk a 20$ on this wierd looking game. Had this game for a while now. And I can say I really really like the skill system. It's a lot of fun to start with your weak♥♥♥♥♥squad and struggle to build a settlement that will survive a starving bandits raid. I had my main character becoming a martial art expert by kicking my bandit prisoners' asses on a daily basis. Said prisoners in return improved their defence skills, making it more chalenging for my character. Profit. I gave them little names.Of course the game is still in developpement and new features are still appearing and bugs are getting fixed as time passes, so I don't really mind if it's not as polished as you would expect from regular game. The gameplay is lot of fun, once you understand what the hell is going on, and the universe/lore of the game is truly unique and fascinating. I did not regret buying it.			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi hates you and will punish you for every terrible thing you’ve done in your life.It will sometimes bring its wrath down upon your unsuspecting character right out of the gate and other times it will bide its time, waiting and watching you as you build up your perfect village, before it crushes you into the sand of its hauntingly beautiful world.And that’s just one of the reasons it’s so great.At its core, Kenshi is an open world group survival simulator. You begin the game with up to five characters and your goal is to keep them alive, heck maybe even try to get them to prosper in the Japanese themed post-apocalyptic world. This is by no means easily done – your characters start out pitifully weak and even a starving bandit can (and will) beat you half to death on his way to the shop before leaving your broken mewling body lying in the sand hoping you don’t bleed to death. Which brings us nicely onto death. Losing in a fight doesn’t mean death in Kenshi, it means you’re left lying in a pool of blood. Often you’ll recover on your own and limp painfully away but even if you don’t, all you need is a single member of your group to get back to his feet and he can then run around giving medical aid to everyone. Assuming you have a medical kit. You really should have a medical kit.With your character created (from a selection of origins, ranging from easy to hard – though easy isn’t all that easy) you can choose what you want to do. Do you want to hunt down bandits, loot them and sell their gear? You can do that. Rid the world of cannibals? That too. Become a trader, ferrying goods from town to town or even start your own village to try and make your way in the world.Whichever option you choose there will be a host of enemies that want to stop you achieving your goal and they will descend upon you time and time again. Interestingly, the initial point of the game is the hardest – being poorly equipped and rubbish at everything means that anyone passing can mug you. As the game progresses you hire additional mercenaries and gain skills, perhaps a fortified town with nitro-powered crossbows all around the walls; which means that the difficulty curve is strangely reversed – the game starts hard but becomes much easier later on.Despite its roleplaying open world sandbox style, the game which Kenshi struck me as most similar to was X3 (Not X4. That was a travesty) in that you are provided with a world where you may live however you want to, and expand to become whatever you want.The graphics of the world are nice if a little sparse. The world is a barren desert and there’s little to see when travelling from one town to another. At first this sets the mood quite nicely in that it’s a barren world that’s harsh and unforgiving, but this feeling drains away after a while since there’s little change and not a lot happening. There are bandits, traders, cannibals, and all sorts of factions, but no other signs of life – I’d have liked to have seen something like mutated scorpions, giant radioactive yaks, or even an occasional cow to give the world more life. Additionally the user interface is extremely basic in looks if not function – I’d very much like to see a more graphical interface rather than the generic default grey boxes.This is Alpha though, and there is a brand new world on its way with new biomes and, hopefully, wildlife that will serve to bring the world to life.Progression is through doing. There are a host of skills related to survival and combat and each skill is improved by doing work in that skill – the Engineer skill, for instance, is improved by building things. There are also three stats; strength, toughness, and agility, and these too are improved by doing things related to the stat – Toughness is increased by getting your face kicked in.Sound is still somewhat lacking; there is a pleasant music track throughout but ambient sounds – the hum of generators or creaking of windmills – is noticeably missing.I definitely recomend this game but, if you do get it, prepare to spend some time looking at your character whimpering and  gushing vital fluids.

								Kenshi, well well ok it took me about an hour to get into the game but when i did i have to say i love it, i like that you start out how you want to wether as a trader, a lone warrior or as a group of settlers looking for a new home. The trading system is very good and is part of the game that could really make it do great things. One word of advice for the creators though maybe you could include in the game that when currently looting dead or unconcious npc's you can take there clothing and swords and whatever items they are carrying but you can't touch there money, well how about in the next update we can loot there money aswell this would make the game more realistic which isn't a bad thing.

								Best purchase I've made on steam thus far, the amount of joy you can get from this game is incredible and only seems to get better and better with each update from the dedicated developers.

								Worth the money I found. Ive got most of the game figured out other then the exploring part. I stuck to mostly town building. After that I made an army of people and made my way north to get a better feel for the fighting part. I found it usefull if you build resting outposts were ever you wanna send troops. All in all though I have to explore the combat and the world map more. For now though im taking a break so I can come back to the game later with a bunch more updates. Even if it wasant updated anymore I would be fine with whats is working and done so far. Really easy squad management. A little buggy for plotting movments on world map but eventually you figure out that there is certain points that work. If  you try to really far spot on the map you squads might not make it. As for graphics I actually really like it. I always enjoy all the detail off how diffrent some of the areas look. Its nice that its not some generated map for once. Worth the price! Its a game that I know I will always play.			"

								It's a very good game and i love it very much. Have some bug but it's not problem, you can handle it. The dev make this game success with the concept: make a character, be a slave or leader on your community (RPG Mode, one of the choice mode in game), make a building, grow your community, give them some job or controlling them all, be a mad so you have a bounty and make sure you have to survive from the crazy world, be hunter or hunted. And one thing, make sure to save the game often because nobody know's who is coming for you to kill and robbed you.			"

								1.9 hours in(at the time of this review), I think its safe to say this game is worth it. After reading through the planned features on the main website, its clear the devs have  the potential to make this game a success.Its true, the start is hard. Especially if you're playing on rock bottom like me. But in time, each hour you survive, you get stronger and faster. While not being too powerful, this game teaches you how to be smart and humble. Don't be fooled by that herd of goats wandering aimlessly. To give you a visual of what its like in Kenshi, here's my first playthrough.>naked dude walking around>see group of people in the distance>'hello friends!'>nope, slavers.>'don't think about running!' 'C'mere meat!'>at first it was just one guy>whole squad joins in>1 blow to the head>KO>unconcious for 400 seconds>wake up>hungry, broken arm, bleeding head>reach lone shack>broke>see iron resource>its mining time!>8 ingame hours later>fed and recovering>mine some more>get iron stick>stats increase while mining(str and labour)>see goats>prepare to get sacrficed to okran! >whole herd attacks me>dying>in lone shack>some guy picks me up>im saved!>lolnope.gif>throws me outside>die outside of lone shack>endThats how exciting my life was in Kenshi. All in all, worth it.			"

								After a long back-and-forth, I finally decided to buy this game. It's become one of my favorite games right now, but it definitely still has a ton of bugs. I understand the developers have been actively developing this game for a very long time, and have many more features in store; and for that, I'm very grateful. That said, I do hope they do a massive bug hunt soon. The majority of times I close the game is because an unfair bug frustrated me too much. It's unfortunate that that's the impression I always leave with, as it's such a fantastic concept.			"

								FIrst off, I have had this game for a good many years now; It has progressed so greatly that I feel proud when I play it now. Proud for the developers and proud of how I have learned the ins and outs of this game. This game started out pretty basic, just lots of sand dunes and hungry bandits everywhere. Slowly, a game started to appear out of the haze. Building towns, getting invaded, shop counters (still kind of broken, oh well) and then cannibals. Gotta love cannibals! Now the map expands and there are new places to uncover. I recently uprooted from one area into Holy nation land (Although they hate me) once I had a devoted military group. I have a base in on an island sorrounded by rivers and the holy nation must cross the water to get to me... Which is no easy feat while getting hit by mounted crossbows =)This game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥hard though. I started out in a setting that gives you a veteran soldier who is hated by the biggest faction in the game currently. It gave me a springbox to move forward though. I worked up his stealth and was able to kidnap a holy nation soldier in camp and use his armor as a disguise to get into their cities. Oh there are also raptors and giant turtles to kill and eat11/10			"

								This, at the moment an early access indie game, is an RPG game with elements of RTS. You can play this game as one character, or play it as a group (at the moment maximally 20 peoples).None of your characters will be ""unbeatable"". Even your main character is just a man - and in the beginnings practically everyone will be better.Usually I start the game in hardest mode. Totally naked, with bad arm and a STICK. Yes - I can survive somehow... The best way how to show that any character can die is to give a preview of my game:I got around six peoples group and went from city to city. I walked too close to Cannibal outpost, and all my group except one girl had been prisoned. I walk then with that girl, and found a band of samurai's. And I made her to walk with them... Then I ordered all the rest of the band, to try pick-lock their cage to get out. one by one I managed to get out... One of the cannibals started to attack to my first character - to the AssassinLV, they beated him up... And were eating my character... After time He managed to get out... But My band was beated up - again but still alive... Later I was close to the city - when bandits attacked on my band... After many attacks AssassinLV were dying... Then that girl - who was not kidnapped, I ordered her to save my character, cause he had the bag full of trade... She managed to prevent AssassinLV from dying, but also she was noticed by other group of bandits... Then she was dying... And no one could been able to save her... She died - cause she was saving the other......			"

								Do you like The SIms, or squad based RPGs in general (games where you can control multiple characters or individual ones each with their own skills, and statistics)Do you like Ninjas? Have you ever wanted to play a sims type game in a ninja / samurai filled apocalyptic world?this is the game for you, its a bit rough around the edges still, and sometimes the glitches can be quite frustrating But with the bad out of the way this game is a master class game that you should try. Favorite parts: The game plays without you and your characters are not ""heroes"" they are probably weaker than almost anyone you can encounter.. however they have the ability to grow depending on what you do. The game will not need you to start events, or to stop them. You are more of a drop of water in a big puddle. You can influence and affect what happens.. if a big band of bandits shows up at a city your base is near, they can take out the guards and shops, effectively neutralizing the town. Later a travelling group of lawmen might take it back.. either way, even if you could have changed the outcome, the game keeps playing. Your characters have stats in almost everything. if you want yout character to be stronger, give him or her a lot of heavy equipment and have them run around. Eventually their strength will increase. Speed is the opposite, have someone run around without anything in their bags and they will become more athletic and therefore faster. Laboring from mining, or smelting. Crafting from weapon or armor smithing. Medicine from healing. The characters become increasingly valuable as time goes on..The fact that you  can plop a town wherever you want, build walls, turrets, arm your soldiers with swords and armor and have your builders be guarded and automated with designated tasks is beautiful. Kenshi is absorbing, Rough, Frustrating, Comically suprising and has the potential to be an amazing game. Id say get it.. try it, support the devs and enjoy the process of their creation  "

								Started with a few people, made a bunch of wheat farms, and established a bread factory. After fending off tons of overly hostile beaked giraffes and endless patrols of king kong, finally got some walls and made a pretty respectable town. Every once and a while, characters would get stuck and glitch on many items (terrain, buildings, enemies)... all solved by picking up the char with another char and putting them back down (some kind of reset)All glitches aside, things were going great. Never mind the random spawning of ♥♥♥♥♥ons of cannibals and hostile wildlife that made my characters constantly stop and battle (inside town walls). I ended up making 500k running my bread factory and selling excess armor/weapons from the smithy. SO I decided I would set out with my fairly rugged, well laboured, farmers and see what hell I could raise. I walked not even 200ft to see a char get stuck. WELL I try my normal technique of using another char to pick up char... etc. Hrm WHAT IS THIS!?Somehow, I managed to get no one unstuck and my entire squad stuck instead. Then my autosave kicks in...As I'm trying to problem solve...My previous hard save was from over 4 hours ago. I feel like I just lost time in my life I will never get back. Overall, very fun addicting concept, but with multiple years in, you'd think they would have character pathing and tracking down. "

								Hi, this game would be really great if we could have a purpose of playing it a bit more(I am demanding player), like having stronger agressive foes, not simply roaming-patrolling empires but grinding, expanding (at a reasonable rate tho).Building a town is an achievement for me, but it's so peaceful when you reach that point. I know it's 0.9X, and a lot of work still going. This could be to me one of best RP/RTS game if it has more devs because yeah, the project is real and lacks of workers I'd say.as a fantasy it could be funny to see undeads and necromancer wandering at night to make a use of all these starving bandits corpses lolthere already is a lot of work we can feel it, but keep going please !!!

								I was enjoying this game after 4 days of gameplay. I've owned the game for a very long time and quit due to excessive glitches. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SAVING YOUR MONEY AND BUYING A GAME THAT ACTUALLY WORKS. Everything was working just fine for the MOST part and I could deal with the minor bugs no problem. Then... people walk through my gates. It's set to private locked and closed while the door condition is max. But yet they just stroll up in my city and start wrecking all of my workers. IF YOU PLAY THIS GAME, YOUR CITY/WALLS/GATES WILL GLITCH AND JUST LET PEOPLE IN. Because of this I have absolutely no defence from the river raptors nor do I have anything to stall the holy nation from running up in my base. I can almost assure you that by the time you make it to day 100 everything you have spent hours working on will be completely useless. Then you might think oh well I'll rebuild EVERYTHING THAT DOESN'T WORK! Nope wont fix the issue whatsoever even after 5 rebuilds. Almost I can't go inside my storm house filled with countless cages, beds, research bench, battery banks etc. All I can use now in my massive base is the stone mine and my small shack. I gave this game another chance and yet again they made me feel like I wasted hours trying to train a group of people to be combat worthy. GG RIP KENSHI			"

								This is gonna be an painfully honest review. This is just my opinion of the game. Honestly I personally like the game, it's entertaining. So that may make me bias but let's just put the genera things about this game out there.1. It's a sandbox game.  Meaning there is no purpose, no goal, no direction what so ever. As that may be it's a pain in the *** to start. The game will rip you the hell apart in a second and you will have to tough it out. There's been times where i just started up and got killed for no reason. You'll have ""what the f--k"" moments by galore and it may just♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. Talking of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off this leads to the next thing perfectly.2. The bugs. Not just one or two bugs either. Just to name some you have people walking through your walls, bandits spawning as giant group in your base, your guys walking off, randoms guards attacking, yadda yadda yadda. Theres a good amount of bugs but thats just a warning. I would go on but i think you get the picture. If you have a calm head you may be able to stand this. If not then don't get it. Go play something else. The game is overall fun, but also makes a good rage bait. I like it personally but i would not recommend getting it just yet.			"

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThis game has been in my library now for awhile and I'm cleaning up my reviews, here's how I feel after owning this game for over a year:The concept, the depth and the artwork are golden but why negative? They overhauled this game to what it seems to come back to the same conclusion, it's unplayable. The bugs, performance issues will slowly if not instantly ruin your game (mind you that this game is a grind, bugs and show stoppers will wash away hours of work). They have been adding to this game which is great but they still have yet to deliver something that's playable. Most of the previous positive reviews were more than likely from the previous build which was more playable to an extent***The game itself will be a masterpiece if its ever finished but thats where I give it a negative review, it felt almost complete before the overhaul now it feels like its taken a few steps back but with even more depth and with the scale I'm wondering if it will every be completed. I'd grab it on sale or hold off, its one of those games that wow you, you play, the bugs and un-optmized feel have you back shelf the game to only revisit. Devs are active but are quick to ban... recommend not bringing up bugs or scorn against this game or commenting on the active state of the game.Below is a response from a Dev/Moderator that I wasn't too fond of, if you have a questions and it can be generically answered by a moderator like below, you may see this again. Originally posted by Captain Deathbeard:This is what game development is like: -You've got a list of 100 features and 100 bugs.-Every time you add a feature, it adds another 50 bugs.-Every time you fix 10 bugs, you discover 3 more bugs.-Occasionally to fix one of the bugs you might need to totally restructure something. This will probably add 10 more bugs.-When you fix bugs people say ""These updates don't do anything, where are the features?""-When you add features people say ""Why aren't you fixing the bugs?""

								Decided to come back and update my review for this one.The basic concept of a squad combat is solid and meshes well with the RPG style caracter progression.Combat itself is both simple and complex at the same time, and there is no real right or wrong way to equip your caracters. Though some builds do require alot of certain stats to really shine.That being said some balancing may be nessisary (and is probably allready planned) in the future. Going alongside the caracter managment is as of so far fairly basic faction system. What is there mostly works and there is alot of room for improvement. What is there though is enough to know for certain that if you steal and murder everything in one town you wont be totally screwed out of profiting off your illicit deeds.Speaking of illicit deeds there is also a system for stealth, and thivery. Again its not fully implemented but what is planned is enough to make both Garret and Etzio foam at the mouth. From simple B&E burglary to disguises, and even assasinations planned further in the pipe. Speaking as a player with over 500 hours in the game, the ability to one hit kill anyone and anything in the game with assasination is a very powerfull gamechanger.The game also features an economy with growing diversity. Better yet, unlike most other games that feature combat and trading a full blown trader focus is a viable option to transition from rags to ritches. Especially if you take the time to venture out and build your own Outpost/Town/Fort and produce your own trade goods/weapons.Not everything is sunshine and rainbows obviously. It is currently an alpha (soon to be beta) and there are optimization issues with DX11. DX9 runs alot smoother and dosent look all that different in my opinion though. The game does crash from time to time (especially again if your running with DX11) Alot of newer players seem to have problems with the difficulty mof the game but personally I cant fathom why.All in all though its a very fun game as it is now with a lot of new features and content planned in the future, so as long as you can tolerate the flaws that are pretty common with anything youl find in Early access developement.

								All things considered I like the permise for this game, I like what I see might be possible, but after spending most of my first 20 hours of this game with multiple tabs on my browser open trying to find work arounds and trying everything i can find in every forum, I have to see, this game is no where near playable at present.  Not even playable enough to test out base-building which is what I really wanted to see.I'm not an impatient person by nature, but after getting loading error after loading error, getting save games corrupted time after time, and having it be impossible to even load into my base, I just can't spend more time on this in late June 2015.  I will come back later when the guys who just grabbed my $20 have enough time to make simple loading and saving possible in the game, fix the major memory leaks, and figure out how to make the game modestly stable.I would encourge anyone to hold off presently, it's currently a VERY unstable build.

								If you want a game that is so differnt from what you're used and combines your favourite elements from RPG's and RTS's, as well as some aspects of tell your own story Sims-like gameplay. Then this is certainly the game for you. However, as the devs say this game is unfinished and is still in a buggy state, your games will crash, and the frequency differs for what you are doing.The game is fun, challenging and rewarding. I myself have got a large pack of freedom seekers that have stuck by each other through thick and thin, I've lost some along the way, but more importantly my two characters that have been together from the start are mated for life. I only wish this game had a relationship and memory system whereby the friends you make will enjoy your company and hang out, protect you and will remember the times you saved their♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that you could show that friendship or love through interactions. Would give this game so much more life in terms of the human interaction.This game has so much potential and I can't wait to see the finished product when it comes out of ALPHA and into BETA and then finally into full release!

								New update. Time to change the review right?! It looks better, the camera follows your team. The world looks less like sand in your eyes and more like a setting. Sweet right. Nope. Still the same stupid thing happens everytime I start a game. I have a bunch of useless units who can't fight. I bump into a mob of trained killers, 30 units strong. How hard is it to set mob spawns to a game timer. Time < 40 minutes, Mob = 5. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. IT DOESN'T WORK. IT JUST KILLS YOU OVER AND OVER AGAIN. It's not like dark souls. It's not fun, or rewarding. Your units don't get stronger. They get robbed, the get kidnapped, they get killed. There is no way to progress your units. Again. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Level 0 villager ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is still real. There is still no way to prevent this. You can now pick from a bunch of races, even one with a warrior caste. Guess what. They get cut down like trash bags in the wind by 30 bandits with sticks just like your humans. While your breast size has a slider, there is still no slider for fighting skills. Long time player same stupid flustrations.I like the concept of this game. I can take a group of people into a hostile desert and make a civilization. What I don't like is watching dogs eat it. I don't like random groups of 30 guys with sticks knocking everyone out and walking off with them. I'm not sure what the developers play for games, maybe the sims? The group of starting colonists the game gives you all start out as level 0 village meat shields with one slightly less useless guard. Mobs are huge. The game suggests that you train all your little people in a town first, by attacking the dummies. This is a 15 minute process. Why not let me mod stats? Why not set those stats higher and skip wasting my life? Time invested versus reward is terrible. Whatever my graphic setting are at I can never see the enemy mobs coming. So suddenly 30 guys are beating my villagers to death. If they go down they need a med kit to get back up. Which you get very few of, and cost more than an arm and a leg. I wouldn't reccomend this. The play testers must all be used to doing all these stupid chores just to play or have some cheat codes. That or starting a colony got lost in the developer shuffle.			"

								Early access experimentalPros- the game has tons of potential.  Where it's heading looks to be a fully sandbox solo play any way you want mode.       - lots of progress has been made and continues to be made at a slow pace but with huge updates.       - be a wanderer, be a trader, be a builder, you decide or be all of them at once when you have 30 characters in your faction.        - it looks decent, and gets better with most updates.  Cons- Failure is the norm.  You can get wiped out in under 2 minutes of starting and have to restart.  You can also get wiped out after dozens of hours.  It can get frustrating for most players.        - Learning curve is extremely steep with nothing in-game to point you in the right direction or even give you goals.        - Character progression in skills is hellishly slow.  You can play upwards of 20 hours and not see much stat increases higher than level 15, which is incredibly low.        - Gets boring when all you do is dig ore, make weapons to sell to npcs, repeat repeat repeat repeat.....nothing much else to do at this stage.        - You can't seem to progress combat characters skills enough to survive enemy encounters.  Most bandits will outnumber and easily wipe out all your characters so you need to have one or two hiding far enough away that they can revive the rest of your party when it is beaten.  Even so, combat skills only go up with use and using them is decidely not in your favor.  Perhaps this is going to be addressed at some point, but for now, be a coward and run away.        - Looting used to be the way to make money early in the game....now it gets you killed even if you loot bandits, because you're a lousy stinking thief! and the guards will come kill you when you try to sell that stolen junk from a dust bandit that would have gotten you 7 coins before....        - Been in alpha for several years already and looks to be at least another couple more before beta.  It's a small team, and therein lies the problem.  They sell the game, but don't invest the money back into it to get a larger team to work on the game.  The result, a very long development time.WHEN the game gets further developed, storylines and reasons to play will be added in.  As it is right now, it's something to keep an eye on and pick it up on a sale.  There's just not enough content to bother with and what is in game isn't balanced out.  Perhaps in a couple more years it will be at the point where it might be enjoyable enough.			"

								Honestly, I would not buy this game for full price as it stands. It's highly unfinished, and many things are broken. If you want to have fun while the game gets updated, by all means buy this. But if you're looking for a game that's probably going to get finished soon, you should look away. This game will probably not get done for 2 years, and it's a huge ripoff to get it at this state. Maybe I'll be able to change the review in the future, but otherwise, not a good buy at all at full price.			"

								I bought this game ages ago and keep hoping to find noticeable improvements when I come back.I WANT to like this game. It has an amazing concept. Id love to build up my own little trade town and go from there.The REALITY of the gameplay so far is that I start the town up and then for the next hour continually get beaten down by bandits and waiting to no longer have my squad be unconcious before making some more minor progress.Even that would be ok if at the end of the hour the game wouldnt concistently crash and thus you lose all of your slow, dragging progress.The game needs boat loads of more work before it deserves any kind of recommendation.  Like others have said. The potential is there, but the progress on the game is so slow that I doubt it will ever even reach beta.			"

								Well, its nearly everything I could have wanted in a game. The RPG elements, the gradual skill increases as you perform various actions, the ""exploration,"" hell, even being a character that has a backstory that suits your playstyle. The game is great with a bit of a rocky start, but after you recruit a good amount of people (at least 6-7), you can finally get things rolling with the crafting and settling of your own town- that is, if you don't choose to live in a pre-made town. The possibilities are truly endless, and no playthrough will be the same- unless you play narrow-mindedly and safe. While I am mildly unsure as to what changes have been made to the world, the playability even through its alpha stage is marginally better than when I first bought the game. I, in fact, created my own world and recently finished it in liue of Dark Souls. The modability is there and given to you on a silver platter. All it takes is a bit of understanding, some programs, and the already there construction set and you're good to go.Overall, I'd give Kenshi an 8/10.Die well.			"

								Kenshi is an open world squad based RPG -- it feels like those ""choose your story"" books.  I play many different genres in games, but I've really struggled to find some sort of city builder that gives you freeroam over your city, free choice on how to build, lots of customization, and a city defense aspect.  I've also struggled to find a good squad based game.  The good squad based games I do find, like Company of Heroes 2, are not open world.  I feel like this is the game I've been searching for, as cheesy as it sounds.This game has been in development for 4 years now, ouch! - but just because it is considered an early access game doesn't mean it isn't polished.  What you'll find while playing this is fantastic gameplay (better than a lot of AAA games), fantastic soundtracks, fantastic building, fantastic customization, fantastic environment, great AI, confusing UI, and a medium amount of bugs.  It's really cool that the devs also created a modding kit for the game. This game is a gem that not many people know about.  To give you and idea on what it is, watch these:

 -- The Power of Moddinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1eIujt8lBw -- Combat and AtmosphereI do want to address some negative reviews to enlighten people on the negative parts of the game, and some flat out lies.  The fact that this game has been in development for 4 years is not a good thing.  Although the studio has less than 10 people working on the game.  I remember about 3 or so years ago they wanted people to email them atmospheric music for the game with royalties.  It does feel like a good game in the end, but it isn't quite there yet to be considered the game they promised.This game has trivial updates.  This is true in some aspects, but not completely.  The amount of updates put out is a large number and each update adds something that they have promised.  Compared to some other small studios, the amount of updates isn't impressive.This game is not immersive.  Pffffft.  I bet you would say that The Walking Dead (game) isn't immersive too.  Some reviews are blatant lies.Crashes and bugs out 70% of the time.  In the 20 hours I have played, I havent crashed at all or witnessed any game breaking bugs.  If you do decide to use some experimental tools, like the freebuilding (different than the standard building) mode, you're going to get bugs.  I tried out the freebuilding mode, which lets you place buildings without any cost, and my squad decided to turn on each other.  There is no reason not to play on a faster timescale, it's like watching simulator 2015.  What would you expect in a city builder?  Have you played Banished, Cities Skylines, or Dawn of Discovery?  Actually, have you ever played a city builder?  The game is about progression, not having everything handed to you in the first hour.  Whoever said this also doesn't understand there are other aspects to the game than just building.  I hope this helped anyone wanting to buy the game.Thanks for reading!			"

								Hello people, this will be a straight up review no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or anything like that, so here goes.I personally like the game, it has everything that I personally want. It's time conusming, if you want a challenge here it is, it will take you time to play and become good so you have to be willing to put it in. Great features and there are more features put into the game nearly every update. The difficulty, believe it or not, is fair but they implimented new features to make it harder or easier if you want more/less of a challenge. Your crew members will eventually die one way or another so you really do need to strategise and make sure you, yourself are 110 % convinced they will live, but that's not always the case. It used to be no sound, 1 squad max of 9 or 10, and only a certain amount you could achieve. Now, however, it is bustling with more squads, more research, tech, buildings, even mounted crossbows on walls to great giant walls. Now like I said it will take you time to achieve the perfect citadel or city but it really is worth the effort. Back bout 2 years ago I wouldn't recommend this game because it just didn't have enough in it to call it, in my opinion, alpha version. But now I really think that this version, the alpha at the moment is worth gettiing. There is a very long play time and at the moment near endless possibilities in the game, whether just making a base, or setting impossible goals, you can achieve it. However there are downfalls, (1st) the dev team is still relatively small making big updates slower to come out (however they are covering everything when an update does coe out), (2nd) there are very much so, alot of glitches and the AI path system is alittle stupid and annoying sometimes and the game itself can sometimes crash unexpectedly (3rd) some of the features aren't out yet which really really bugs me because they sound really cool, so there has to be a wait.Other than that, it really is a brilliant version at the moment and I can't wait for the final release!Happy Gaming and I hope this review was helpful and pointed you to a good purchase!

								For every frustrating buggy moment I have (understandably as it's alpha) I have 100 great ones. Hyperbole maybe but my purpose is to illustrate the difference between the amazing immersion of those great unscripted moments this game supplies you with so often VS. the insignificance of the frustrating ones that occur quite rarely.  It is currently an imperfect game that is full of perfect moments. The music is right, the vibe is absolutely right, the stripped down no guidance on how to accomplish anything, while perhaps not intended for future builds, feels totally right.  You are dropped in a desolate landscape with bands of wandering thugs and brigands and tasked with figuring out how to survive. Crazy loner in a hut? Start a town with tons of followers? Just wander the waste and scavenge corpses then sell junk to NPCs? Build an armor and weapon crafting factory? Produce and sell weed and rum? All possible and you'll probably do a bit or tons of each.The skill system is great as far as im concerned. The more you do something the better you get at said skill. Makes sense. Want to be tougher? Get beat to hell often (and recover hopefully). Want to be quicker? Run around with low encumberance. Stronger? Swing a heavy sword and wear heavy armor. Same system goes for crafting obviously.There is zero pre generated story to be had here. If you need Bioware levels of explanation for why you're playing your game then stay away. It's 110% no direction sandbox. If you have a creative mind and sense of adventure and find creating your own backstory and narrative enjoyable then buy it. It's that simple.Death will happen but it always feels like my fault when it does. Overconfidince or negligence is usually to blame. That being said, SAVE OFTEN. No ""respawns"" here. You reload the last save.Perfect blend of Samurai disciplines and the chaos of Mad Max (sans vehicles). Slow development and occasionally glitchy but I could not care less. I really hope the tiny dev team (couple people I think?) sticks with it. One of my favorite games in recent years.			"

								It's been about a year or so and I figure I should edit this review. The game is extremely challenging. You are NOT meant to be the chosen one, nor the best of a rag-tag bunch of guys. You are a person. You will get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked. A lot. That said, your character learns from each mistake. So long as they don't die. Enemies don't really go for the kill (well... cannibals are a different story). Eventually, you and your squad might take on the world. That's the fun part. Watching them grow.Want a hard game? Unforgiving? Kenshi is the squad RPG/RTS for you.			"

								Overall I was suprised I enjoyed this game. Even though it is early access and a lot to be done, even though I still got addicted. I love games that allow you choose your own path and essentially start from the bottom and rise to the top. This game will become amazing once they add more features and implement a few things here and there. So if you are willing to look past bugs and limited features at the moment then this game is a lot of fun and will get you pumped to see how they make the game grow.If you like challenging/unforgiving games (similar to Blade & Mount) then this is the game for you. Here I was lone wanderer who got attacked by a very large pack of dogs. Luckily next to a city so once I was unconcious in like 2.5 secs the guards dispatched them like chump change. I layed there (after the guards healed me) for 2 days in a recovery coma. While I figured I could reload the game I was like ""eh what the heck"" and waited it out. This game will be challenging in the beginning. You definitely don't start out like a power house.Graphic wise its okay. Nothing great nor terrible.Character leveling, skills, building, and the like are fun but limited at this point in time. I can only imagine as the game gets better and adds more how it will be. You can even customize your companions once they are recruited. Fighting is a lot like MMO's minus all the special abilities. Its point and they fight kind of thing.As of now there are no quests but I am sure through time some will be added. As of now its just roam, get money, build, and get companions.			"

								The best way to describe the Kenshi game world would be to think tattoine crossed with asian culture. Kenshi is a totally unique genre of game, it's a mix of RTS, RPG and Simulation but has the ability to make you feel invested in your own characters due to the random nature of the world. It's still got a while to go before the finish line but with additional content, alot of bug fixes + optimisations and more of the same passion and attention to detail that the Dev has shown so far, i have no doubt that Kenshi could wind up being one of the greatest games ever made. It's a labour of love and it truly shows. In it's current state Kenshi already has enough content to make the purchase worth the money so i whole heartedly recommend picking this game up if you want to support a Dev who's creative direction is a breath of fresh air.Some suggestions for the Dev in the event he reads this :- Add the ability for the camera to aim upwards not just eye level (It would be nice to be able to see up hills and see more of the stars).- Add Bo Staffs to the Blunt weapon list when you add it in.- The Martial arts skills in the future should be about disarming and disabling your opponents.- Animals that act as pack mules for the travelling merchant playstyle would be great.- Shields would be a nice addition. Much lower damage output but much higher survivability against groups swarming you.-  Bows not just crossbows. Ranged weapons should do low damage but be more likely to cripple limbs and cause bloodloss.- Even more weapons, armor for crafting/purchasing ect.Anyway keep up all the great work and best of luck for the future of Kenshi!

								This game is the defintion of a perfect idea in route to a perfect game.  I have always wanted an in depth strategy game where you can forge a connection to the people in your squad and watch them grow into the certain player you need them to be.  Kenshi is a game that words cannot describe, even in its early stages it is so immense that I cannot begin to fathom trying to cram all of it into one review.  In short, kenshi is definitly a work in progress, but its also one of the most captivating, aggrivationg, emotionally taxing, in depth, fun, and addicting games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.

 *** THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY, ESPECIALLY IN ITS CURRENT STATE *** The early access boilerplate aside, if you're used to early access, this is one of steam's current gems. It is probably one of my favorite sandbox games, and my overall favorite city builder. What you get is worth your money, as long as you're willing to trudge through a few issues.Cons - * Not very optimized (early access)* Rather buggy (many temporary fixes, usually nothing major)* Occasional crashing (just remember to save)* Some balance issues (harpoon turrets as a prime example)* Certain starting paths don't feel full enough* Slow updates (this is what will likely make or break for most people)Pros - * Very open ended sandbox* Innovative health and damage system* Pick, choose, and change paths* Great city builder* Craft virtually anything* Plethora of different skills to train* Still living early access game after many years in development* (Usually) speedy bug fixing* Very involved character creation* Put your enemies (or friends, I don't judge) into jail cells* Many, many more things not mentioned here.If you enjoy sandbox, can deal with bugs and occasional crashing, don't mind being patient for updates, didn't plan on using the $20 for your next meal, and are willing to take a risk on early access, this is one of the best purchases you can make. Like I said, it isn't for everybody -- with this game, patience is key.If it sounds like something you'd like and can tolerate, I can't recommend this enough.			"

								This game is amazing, A LOT of potential. Really fun squad based tactics and base building involved. I've played since .40 version before the game even had any sound effects (now it does) and it was really fun. It does get updated somewhat frequently, i say once every 2 weeks to a month. Keep in mind it's an early release game, still needs a lot of work done, but as far as bugs go, they are slim so it's very playable. Not a WHOLE lot of content at this very moment, but it's still in good condition to be played in.			"

								This game is amazing, A LOT of potential. Really fun squad based tactics and base building involved. I've played since .40 version before the game even had any sound effects (now it does) and it was really fun. It does get updated somewhat frequently, i say once every 2 weeks to a month. Keep in mind it's an early release game, still needs a lot of work done, but as far as bugs go, they are slim so it's very playable. Not a WHOLE lot of content at this very moment, but it's still in good condition to be played in.			"

								The controls are a bit busting in the knee, but this game reminds me a lot of Runscapes GAMEPLAY (Not story line), So i'm getting used to the controls rather quickly. However, It runs very slow on mine. No worries though. :) Still needs some tweaks though to make it better. :) I wish you could have the option to move your character (Ex. WSAD) AND or Click your character to move. So it's even, and fair. Maybe a storyline at the beginning of the game? To spark things up a bit? Good, good game. I applaud you for this works.(HAVE ONLY PLAYED FOR ABOUT 10 MIN. XD TELL ME IF THIS IS ALREADY IN THE GAME PLEASE. )If you really wanted to spark people's attention, You should add MASSIVE Immersion RPG into the game. Such as, Stealing from an NPC, NPC Talk to Talk words. Meaning, You could choose over more than one or two answers for every single conversation, almost like in a Visual Novel.NEW UPDATE***Alright, I am at a complete loss. However, I have gotten used to the controls 100%. I am confused because if i leave the town and run towards the nearest town, I get attacked, and murdered in seconds. I am a trader. I sold all my stuff, to get good clothing.. Can someone tell me where the weaponry is in there? I might just have to spend it on finding 5 guys with a Katana. I can hardly make it through. By God the deaths. 60000 hrs later your guySSSS come back alive. Well, I suppose I could go towards another town... But, eh. Maybe if it's my last resort. Am I doing something wrong? Are there any jobs at the beginning of the game that you can do? I went to the police station for a bounty quest thing, and the only thing he said was for me to go kill a leader or a bandit for something. I can't even fight 1. My character won't fight until after it (Yes, i know how to turn it off) , but once he gets hit, it's like he can't hit others. Umm... Not judging, but when can I do research so i can earn better stuff? What do i need to do (As a merchant) before I go and fight the bandits on the nearest town? Lastly, are there any questions in the newb town that I will MOST LIKELY be able to do? Yes, I realized the game is a little bit different for everyone, but please help!~Thanks.P.s Review and Conversation? xDP.s.s Very good game so far for a Beta!			"

								Kenshi brings in a lot of innovative mechanics that make it interesting and fun to play, most notably the way combat and health works. That combined with the cool setting and also-innovative body customization sold me on the game. I've played many more offline hours than are on record; it's a slow-building game but it sucks you in until you realize that your six-person squad probably doesn't need seven buildings for their outpost, especially since four of them are almost always outside...

								An amazing game of epic proportions.This game is not without flaws, first of all. If you have a slow computer or laptop you should expect frequent freeze-ups and even crashing. If you have a decent driver and a decent computer then you should be fine.Onto the good things, this game is incredibly difficult, you'll die or lose several times before you develop a gameplan to make it. Not to mention when you step into this game you'll be surprised to find yourself in an alien land both familiar and mysterious, you'll probably explore far enough to realize the inevitable nature of oneself. You are mortal, you are weak, and you are nothing compared to the beasts and residents of this land. You can be captured, imprisoned, enslaved, and you can break away from slavery and wander until you find a method of removing the binds.There is a silver lining though, being taken down isn't always the end, many roaming guards and factions will patch you up if they see you, other times your wounds may heal themselves and the more you get beat, the tougher you get. So being a legendary ninja or samurai is still possible.			"

(Although i loved the normal map jussssttt a little bit more).  Would recomend this game to anybody that enjoys a similar genre of game that i like.P.S.

								This game is just so absolutely amazing. Its quite an open sandbox, and has plenty of gameplay, presently, but is also heavily in development. I actually got in much, much earlier than the steam release, and it was an awesome game even then. I look forward to the improvements in the future. This is very, very much the sort of game I was hoping would be made. More and more games now get released with a pretty limited scope with some polish. This game goes with a huge scope, expanding as development progresses, and polishes as it goes. The graphical differences from the early release to now are already rather dramatic.Seriously, I can't say how stoked I am to play the final product, feature complete.If you are on the fence at all about getting this game, jump that fence and buy this game yesterday. Totally worth it. Easily, easily among my top 50 games, and its still in development!			"

As its in early alpha, there are bound to be some bugs and glitches...and crashes! ( and trust me, it CRASHES at the worst moments lol) But for all its flaws it has the makings of a magnificent rpg, and to my knowledge is a new type of rpg! All in all, I give Kenshi a 8/10, its good, but still needs work! work that im sure will get done by the time its fully released! Definitlly recommended!			"

								A Pro review-no cons I bought this game a good couple months back, i held my breath as time went on and these guys have been really consistant with thier updates ! they are pretty responsive in terms of development and theres a particular moderater hanging around here in steam and on thier website forum who's been dedicating thier time to Q & A. I run a 32 bit system and was worried people who runs like me have been forgotten but recently they released an update for the 32 ! huzar now i can eat my piece of the cake :D, first time i jumped in i play as a retired captain went out immediately to fight some bandits there are some major noticeable changes since i last played last year and its now become more Hard, funny and enjoyable. now after encountering bandits i bit off more than i could chew i battled with a boss bandit and defeated him but his lackeys popped round to save him, i ran back to town (micro managing the chase, quite the engaging affair if i do say so myself) but i made one wrong move and got knocked out...which then the bandits proceeded to steal my clothes the odd but funny part is that aside from the fact he took my medkit he also took my pants XD ! End conclusion these guys are consistant with most things and the game at times can be engaging almost getting the balance between rpg/rts ! i have high hopes and looking forward to the changes being made including the new races !

								Kenshi is a game with potental that only needs to fix that one bug they say is trying to e fixed by the engine users.However, due to this game having the option of multible races with their own cultures I realised what this game needs the most: Fur... I MEAN, anthropomorphic beings with animal-like characteristics. Mostly because if your going to ad a race of stone/hammerhead/rock people you might as well have anthropomorphic beings with animal-like characteristics.Also it would be awsome to add crazy hassan to the game. You never know when you need slightly used camels at crazy low prices.			"

								I have played this game for 58 hours as of the writing of this review.  The game is a work in progress, but a pretty good one.  I will say that the developer, Chris Hunt (a.k.a. Captain Deathbeard) has been constantly improving this game over the past couple of years.  Do you like Post-apocolyptic, Ninja, crafting, RTS, RPG, sandbox games or never tried any of those?  You will like this game.  It's wierd, but wierd can be pretty fun.  A few bugs, but the team is cleansing the game of them with each update.  Generally speaking, this game is just plain fun.  And that's really why we play games, right?			"

								This is a hard one. The game is amazing, it's alot of fun and has heaps of content already. The biggest problem this game has however is it's bugs. The bugs are literally everywhere, one example: i enter the game i get into character creation and i crash because my graphics settings were too high, which brings me to another problem, this game has no optimization for any graphics card, my gtx 780 ti runs overlcoked at 1150mhz in this game for some reason it only reaches 650mhz, as if the game is trying to limit my gpus potential, neverthless i still get decent framerates, which leades me to another problem, the random lag spikes which drop frame rates to 5, which leads me to tell you that you will be playing for an hour, then bug solving for the next. At least this is my current situation. I just spent 3 hours trying to get my characters to another town, because all the merchants in the town i was in bugged out and the trade screen would not show up. That's 3 hours of constant re-loads etc due to bandit attaacks killing everyone in my squad, due to lag spikes, and no matter how many reloads the merchants did not sell me anything. I now have to restart the entire game. Do not buy this bugfest until i can go from City A to City B without restarting my game at least 3 or 4 times. But those few hours of gaming that you manage to sneak in as the bugs gather reinforcements are truly magnificent, and because i want more money going to these devs, meaning more bug fixes i am reccommending this game. There are people complaining that the devs are focusing too much on bug fixes, they need to spend the next year fixing bugs in my opinion, the content here is good enough as it is, i merely want to enjoy the content not look at new bug-filled content if you know what i mean.Take this review as u will, a 10/10 game, but has more bugs than the amazon.

								This is my first review for a game so I'll try to keep it brief, lol I've put many hours into this game, and do enjoy it, though currently there is no story line, none of your actions in any way influence the world around you except when maybe the reputation system is working, which is definitely hit and miss. The pathing system still has bugs, and often times you will find people with assigned jobs stuck against something, or trying to interact with an object inside a building from the outside. I have had the game for well over a year and while updates do come out more often now (usually once every month or every two months), they still have yet to resolve really important game play issues.I do however encourage you to purchase the game, as a fun way to pass the time inbetween games with actual story content and substance (this game currently lacks any), as the base building is fun and watching your people mow down starving bandits with turrets, who just want to attack and not steal your food, which totally refutes their name of ""starving bandits"".To sum it all up, they have some really lofty goals for the game, and if they come through with them, it will be an amazing purchase. If not you will at least have a base building game where you randomly get zerged by bandit/creature patrol, so if you are into being punished with no reward, it is definitely for you.			"

								While the game, as far as I know, is not finished yet, it shows promises.It is long and slow for your character to get better (and I avoid saying good in purpose).At the moment, the game does not look great, but I'm assuming all the eye candy things will make their way in eventually.The game is unforgiving if you make mistakes (like trying to take on opponents too strong or too many of them). You might end up dying, very very very slowly, with no options to get better :).			"

								There is something endearing about this game. I purchased this game far before it was on Steam and have loved watching its continued growth. It is truly one of the handful of games I am interested in and has a charm that I find hard to describe. I suppose I am attracted to the game because the developer made it so you are not a special snowflake in this game, you are a normal person or group of people with no special powers or abilities with the only difference from your characters and the games NPCs being your drive for success in whatever path you chose.Any skills have to be earned and only through trial and error. You will be beaten down, your goods and clothing stolen, you will limp back with broken bones to whatever you consider safety, and then try again only to fail. With each failure you gain experiance though and eventually you will be able to eke out a living on scraps and eventually maybe even make an outpost that could blossum into a metropolis you run, another city on the ever growing map with a whole new diplomatic game to consider. Or just be a lone wanderer trying to survive, making your own story among the sand dunes.Possibly a true sandbox game when it eventually finishes... + Developer is not only active but also has an interesting personality/beard.+ Constant updates+ Fresh kind of gameplay+ Future plans look bright and, more importantly, actually going to happen.- Very Glitchy, many crashes, texture issues, shadow problems, characters getting stuck, etc (Alpha problems)- Slow to add new content but understandable as they are focusing on getting the game more stable. - General ""Alpha""ness that will go away with timeI highly recommend this game even on its current merits. The future for this game looks to be an amazing one and I can not wait to see how well it comes together.			"

								This is my favorite squad based rpg that i have played.  I have always been looking for a game that had squad based, or like some sort of 'ultimate commander' type game.  I stumbbled on this game while searching the sugested strategy games on steam and got almost instantly drawn in.  I still love the game even after the experimental new map update.  (Although i loved the normal map jussssttt a little bit more).  Would recomend this game to anybody that enjoys a similar genre of game that i like.P.S. It is a really hard start, dont give up thought because it gets much better "

								At the moment its not even a  game, a gaem requires constant stability in any operating systemn so the purchasers of said game can get enjoyment out of , this game if we are not being lied to will be a very good game but at themoment 3 minutes of gameplay before crashing just does not allow any one to give it a thumbs up,early access or not you do not make major cjanges to game with out first stabalising			"

								This Game has a fascinating concept, its playable actually and you can probably extract a lot of ""Fun"" out of this, The only issue I have with this game has to do with 2 things, one would be the constant delays and excuses to release an upcoming patch, now I get it, coming out with updates can be pretty hard, lots of coding involved and the fact that the game is in Ogre3D makes it even worse, the other issue is the time that this game has been in development, now i'm extremely patient with this kind of thing but I would expect more content, instead over the years, the only thing I got was constant bug fixes, Sound for this game, and a prettier UI, as for the contents over the years the only thing I can pinpoint would be the harpoon which you can't even bring it around with you, you have to build the thing on a certain spot/area, a few wearable items and a new weapon type which to my knowledge you can easily copy and paste existing assets from things that already exist in this game and sort of change the values up a bit, Honestly a modder can do this in his free time, An overhaul for the character as well as a new race which I almost forgot it even existed because everything as it is right now seems to be a bit out of context and forgetable, and of course prison stuff and a few more dialogues, I mean what else did I forget? does it really matter at this point? thats not much for a game thats been in developement for years.Now of course, the review (I wouldn't call it a review) has to do with me recommending the game for you, that does not mean I hate the game, in fact, I actually enjoy it, but the developers need to step it up, be a little faster with progression, add more content to the game instead of just bugfixes, Give your modelers a job to do, get them to rig more heavy armor which is also something that lacks in the game, just keep adding misc stuff so people won't feel frusterated over the constant waiting, Anyways I truly hope I can change this review in the future, but as it stands right now, I don't think I can trust the idea of this game ever finishing, I could be wrong though and hopefully I am, And for the developers that reads this, Please make your mod community more accessible, some folks i've seen on the forums aren't even capable of rigging a custom armor properly without messing up the bones, that needs more clarification.

Recently they updated whole engine and graphics looks very nice, the game is nearly finished - all that is left is bug polishing and some features implementation. Amount of content is insane - base building, farming etc, when the full game world will be done - nearly 870 km2 with diffrent blending biomeses and factions, locations and lore -  all of this is a steal for this price.

								Be a loner, part of a small team, make an army, make a village, or a town. Or an outpost for trading. Become farmers, miners, a lot of things. You make your story and its all non-linear. Perma-death for all characters. The only way to lose is all your characters die not just the main one you start with. Or team. You can start the game with multiple characters who you can all customize to your liking. And the customization options for this game are incredible. I mean really incredible! You can change the way your characters look at any time when you hire new ones and as long as you find a plastic surgeon in a tavern in villages or cities you find and go to for the older ones. Hire as many people as you want. Right now the current stable version you can only have 20 but the final release you can have insane amounts. Train, learn, capture people, take down people with samurai swords, die from wounds loose limbs, get eaten by cannibals. Save people, help others, lay waste to towns, become bandits. Really the choice is yours. The end game of what it may look like is close to the game series Zeno Clash. The Animals they are putting in the game resemble much of the animal life that is in those games and I love it! Currently the game is still buggy and needs more optimization but the current stable version is really good to play. If you want to try it you won't be displeased. This game is amazing!			"

								The game is very different from anything else I have played, it's a mix of a Squad RPG and a city builder.  The concepts of the game are really new and orginal, however the implementation leaves something to be desired.  The game is riddled with bugs (even though it is early access) to the point where it's pretty much impossbile to play for more than 30 minutes without experiencing a crash.  Building placement needs a fair amount of work, and character collision, pathing, stuck areas all caused me to have to reload the game to a previously saved state ever 10-20 minutes.  Overall, it's an incredible game, it's just not even close to being finished.			"

								One of the FEW greatest games i've played in AWHILE> Its mildly buggy but THATS okay. If you like RTS, Squad based tactics (up to 20 unless theirs more than that), and full scale research and development alongside building/raiding nearby enemies four resources in the beginning, this is your game. It is what you make of it.Their are PENALTIES with your actions though, attack a friendly you can ignite a war. Anyway a few tips.. if your like me and like automation make a ""auto"" town. Heres a link to help describe it more.. took me about 10 hours before i figured it out thanks to google search.'http://steamcommunity.com/app/233860/discussions/0/846959876015153093/I rate this game a 9/10 solely because it caters to my lazyness enabling me to do micro management if i want and expand outside of that, alongside going the extra mile and letting me command up to 20 people at the same given time (or micro managing them) whatever comes first.Check it out, it will be the best $20 you've ever spent EVER			"

								First and formost this is an alpha review. This game is not done by a long shot so I have had glitches and errors playing this game. Also there are several aspects that I hope will be added later to make this game better. So if you will just find fault in a game that is not done I would wait and buy when it is closer to completion.That being said I think this game is fun an different from a lot of other games out there. It does have a steep learning curve because it does not have an in game tutorial so you have to either look online or fiddle around in the game your self. This game is also not a fast pace game. It takes a long time to make your character powerful. I have seen youtube videos of people sending a solo character into a cannibal camp with about 30 or 40 cannicals and winning. I can only guess at how many hours that took them or what tricks they found to power build. starting off you cannot even fight one guy alone it seems. you will hug the cities and bring bandits to the city guards to fight and help them out. if you are willing to put in a bit of time this can be a very fun game.

								bought this game on the daily deal sale and i have to say i like it! it looks like it has alot of potential as im playing it in the alpha state there are a few bugs sure and the map is huge with not much way to travel and lots of sand. but watching your squad of people slug it out is sort of fun! the base building is pretty good as well i cant wait to see more option and things there and maybe some siege or attacks on the players. so for this review i would say 3/5 giving it room for improvement :)some pro's:the squad based fighting is cool!the base building feature is nice fun to place a mark in the worldthe fact the your units take damage to certain body parts and can bleed to death is interesting.the cons:the map is huge! even with the speed feature your running alot! <maybe add horses or camels to ride around?>there is alot of sand and not much changes to it! <maybe add some weather features? it rains in the desert sometimes>the slug fest does get bland but the game is early <i heard you may be adding some limb loss features that would be neat!>all in all the concept behind this game is great and i cant wait to see it progress :) GL!

								Love this game, Open world sandbox, make your own faction/town and obliterate the compitition, roam around by yourself as a bodyguard for hire or hire your own bodyguards to creat an army of your own. Research and build equipment or building to make your army self sustained or make a shop in your town so that traders come and buy from it, the amount of ways you can play this game is unreal!			"

								I love this game! I have built a small base inbeteen fisher and the other two citys close to it. So far i havent done much, but built a house and a work bench. but i have died once and ran a ton. Pros-~lots of room to run!~easy to understand controls.~lots of cool stuff to build.~lots of ways to play-example: i can be a trader or just go kill bandits.( not so great at ether yet lol.)Cons-~quite a lot of lag when i move from town to town.~i cant zoom to first person, its always third person view. (Or at least a setting that allows me to lock on my camra, would be nice.)~not alot of wildlife or plants preatty plain landscape.Hope this helps! I will update it as i play more.			"

								This is a very fun game to mimic a steam punk sword-play world with a feeling of being on the baren planet of Tatooine. Add in the Hutts, vibroblades, dewbacks and maybe a geriatric Jedi, and you have yourself Star Wars. The creators should add some similar music when entering cantinas as a joke. The game has a fatalistic feel where civilization is tattered. You will struggle to get a foot hold but attention to detail will help you a great deal. I love this game and it is only in alpha stage. Taking this into consideration, when finished, i feel this game could be one of the greats in terms of unique setting and customization options. It may have a lot to accomplish still, but if you think you may like it, you should get on board with supporting its creation. The more people that get involved, the better the game will be in the long run. Enjoy!			"

								荒廃した世界でサバイバルしていくゲーム。現在30人までキャラクター操作可能。キャラは酒場で3,000capから雇える。時々無料で仲間になってくれる人もいるのでお金がなくても安心。初期は街の人が倒してくれた犬の皮を剥いで売ったり、鉄を採掘して売ったりしてコツコツお金を貯める。仲間が増えてくるといよいよ拠点づくりを始めよう！拠点には城壁、門、家、井戸、石切り場、畑、鍛冶場等、色々な施設を作ることができる。また、キャラクターに仕事を割り振る事が出来、自動で働かせることも出来るので便利。採掘した鉄を精錬して武器を作ったり、皮をなめして防具を作ったりもできる。鍛冶スキルが低いうちは弱い武器しか作れないが、たくさん作ってスキルが上がれば状態の良い（強い）武器が作れるようになる。農場で牛と牛専用バックパック（大容量で便利！）を買えば交易もはかどる！技術ツリーを開放するのに必要なアイテムには「本」と「古代の本」等があり、より高度な技術開発に必要な「古代の本」はレアなので、遠くまで旅したり、古代遺跡をあさって手に入れる必要があるらしく、拠点作りが安定してからもやることがあっていい感じ。初期キャラ作りでの注意としては、種族「スケルトン」を選ぶと、一部の勢力からは見つけ次第攻撃されてしまう（その場合も人間を仲間にして人間だけで近付けば攻撃されないので、ロールプレイのためにスケルトンを選びたい人でも大丈夫。スケルトンは治療コストが高いので初期につらいという欠点もあるが……）。マップは十分広く、バリエーションに富んでいる（砂漠、平原、山岳地帯、古代遺跡群等）。しかも現在行くことのできる地域の数倍の広さの未開放地域があるので、将来的にはかなり広いものになるだろう。現状でもかなり面白いので、おすすめです！			"

								This game is fun! Why not recommend it then, right? Well its because its not quite ready for general playing. After building a town you realize none of it really has a purpose yet. Thats fine, but it gets super boring. Economy isnt fully functional yet either, 10 minutes is enough time to abuse trade for a fortune, THEN build a city. Im too sad after playing it to explain anymore, dont forget this game, just dont buy it yet.EDIT- The time has come to re-review this game and it has made huge leaps into being what it claims- an open world sandbox squad based RPG. So many new options for building. Still have a rough a tumble problem, were just starting out you get rocked for a good while. Then suddenly youre the butt kicker. The base building is so much bigger now, after not playing for like 8 months. The game seems so much better. Its time to finally check it out!			"

								Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is amazing, and has sooo much potential. Get your bases raided by bandit, slavers and all the above. or play with a single character (or group, or even get 2 characters and pretend one of them is you and your stupid brother) and go roam around only to get your asses handed to you and spend hours bleeding out unconcious until someone happens to walk by and give you a hand. ( or until you wake up lol) You can even set up shop and live a boring life selling the same godamn sword lmao. (Even that♥♥♥♥♥♥is fun in this game)Even though its still in Early Access (and has been for QUITE some time) i think it only leaves room for much much more improvement. Even as early as the first day it came out i enjoyed the few hours spent building up my bases, getting my people stronger, acquiring more people to add to my little clan, and also working hard (literally slaving away manufacturing items to sell) just to make a decent living for my group and get them the best gear i could.Though i've only played for a bit, every moment was enjoyable.If you guys like atmospheric, open world, RTS/RPG? (plays like a age of empires sorta thing) As well as a full on management on every single unit/character you got. THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!!!!			"

								The vast majority of PC games out there follow tried and true- but cliched and tired- rules that are based on making money.  For every interesting and original concept, there are 1000 copycats who bore the living bejesus out of me, copying Warcraft or Skyrim, or some other AAA lawyer approved crud. The beancounters control what gets made, which is sad.KENSHI is not like that. It's concepts are bold and daring, and the game is for the creative player who truly wants a sandbox without rules or carrots or narrow path pretending to be free choice.What makes KENSHI so interesting is it's complete freedom to choose whatever role you want, whatever cardinal direction you wish to explore, and it's emphasis on a more realistic combat/character. There is no being superman or a supreme hero in KENSHI. Expect to have your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you, and often, The game requires both patience and brains, which, frankly, is liable to hurt sales and frustrate the less gifted gamers out there who are accustomed to the likes of SKYRIM's mindless carrot following uber-viking nonsense. If you want to actually succeed in KENSHI, man, you GOTTA EARN IT.The game is tough and uncompromising, and the life of a swordsman is a brutal lesson in picking your fights, knowing when to run, and being smart enough to not succumb to greed and carry too much goods on you at once.You need to save your money, invest in comrades in arms, and constantly, slowly, train yourself to kick♥♥♥♥♥ That is what this game is all about, and it is almost umatchable in rewarding the player who works hard- you really feel like you earned the bad♥♥♥♥♥skills, once you acquire them. Whle the game is still unpolished in looks, the basic ideas are here, and I love this game.Things I would like to see added-1. Formations. It's too hard to keep your tough fighters out front and your workers behind you. I'm sure it's coming, but the need for good strategic preperation before a battle in marching orders needs to be a priority.2. More ""home"" decorations/furniture, etc. Home is as inportant as adventuring and exploring. Few games remember and acknowledge this. The more home feels like home in Kenshi,  the more real the characters we play will seem. 3. More variety in city shops. Currently most towns feel all about the same. Each town needs one focus that makes it seem unique, in my opinion.4. More combat variety to add some uniqueness to our characters styles- dual wielding, sneaking and backstabbing, missle weapons and maybe some shields and polearms would go a long way towards turning Kenshi into a good game with fantastic concepts into a fantastic game.But, really, KENSHI is the best new game I have played this year, mostly due to it's approach- it allows that true sandbox freedom so many other games asprie towards, but fail to achieve, and it keeps the difficulty bar set on high- making success all the more challenging and wonderful when you get there!I'd give this an 8 of 10, with 10 being well within range of achievement, with more polish and details.

								This is by far one of the best games I've ever played and I've made the circut a couple of times. Well worth the $20 and hard to believe it's still in development. This game has depth and scope that I've been hard pressed to find in even high budget games I've played. The only down side that I've found thus far, which I'm sure will be addressed, is the lack of animals. I personaly would love to see this game advance to adopt additional climates and/or some sort of additional vegatation to be used in building, landscaping, w/e... I played the 'experimental mode' or whatever it's called and only encountered crashes in open desert. I honestly forgot I opted for the testing! This is some great work and a must for anyone looking to take their rpg/rts gaming to a whole new level of freedom of play.			"

								This is by far the best game I've spent money on in the last few years.  With all the options for playability, it allows for you to really get your hands dirty. If Linux support had been a thing I probably would have thousands of hours put into the game, even if it was just running it idlely and allowing my characters to do their own thing. I've wandered, I've built myself a city, I ran with a party and I ran by myself and no matter how I played it, I was always enjoying myself.It's very rare to find a game that has such an open field to putz around with, and even more rare that 1 person could come up with an idea for a game like this.  Yes, there have been people added over time, but we mustn't forget that this game started with one developer and was phenomenal even back then.I'm itching to get back into playing and once I do, my hope is that I can keep my real life going forward as well as the game life moving forward.  It's one of those games I could very easily sink my entire attention into and probably never look back -- thankfully, like any game the allure should wear thin... the problem is that this game has so many options to mess with that it'll probably take an eternity to find a reason to set it down and play something else... so my almost year long break from being able to play (one of the updates completely broke my ability to play on Linux) has been pleasant because I haven't been able to sink myself into the game for that time....however, that time is starting to grow short and it will not be long before my little army of ninjas/samurai take over my life once again.Thank you to the devs for making and continuing such an amazing piece of work.  Keep it up.			"

								This game is still constantly in development, so you might want to wait an awfully long time before there's a finished version. But, for what it is right now there's a lot to do as you manage a squad of people in a sandbox world becoming whatever you want. Whether you are a feared thief or the ruler of great town that produces only alcohol. At the start life is very hard with only a few towns as safe havens and lots of danger in the wild. It doesn't help that you're just a normal person that can't take on a group of many alone. That's the charm of the game, which is that you are not special in this unique world amongst all these NPCs in their factions.There's a neat damage system that goes off of limbs and other things like bleeding. You can improve your people's skills. You can be a merchant. You can build things. It's really fun if you like management and a sandbox. If you don't like having no direction, then you're better off not getting this game right now.			"

Despite a few graphical glitches like people and buildings burying themselves in the terrain the game is a very versatile squaddy type game with pl;enty of scope for building fighting and trading. the movement controls are good, with groups known as parties being controled seperately giving you the option to keep your nedic out of the way of any combat.

In conclusion great game, lots of freedom, but I would wait and follow the updates and see if they fix the concerns mentioned above before you purchase unless you don't mind the low frame rate during congested areas and also save often.I give it a 7/10.

								Kenshi is a very interesting game.  Its very fun.  It has great RPG elements.  Survival-like mechanics.  You can build up an army.  Become a trader.  The game is a blast.  The game is not very face paced just to make that known.  Its about taking your time and making a real faction/nation.  When i first got the game i loved it.  But it was a very long time ago and it was in very early access, so it lacked in content and got boring.  But now with all of its updates and with the workshop, this game really feels like a game.  I rate it a 8/10.  It drops the two points because its still early access of course and its controls can be difficult at times.  But overall this is a great and fun game!			"

								I picked this game up a year ago and while there were a few annoying bugs(now fixed) it was an enjoyable game that was exactly as stated a free world squad based rpg... where you're not somehow special without working at it, and when trying to take on a bandit... they have friends.   I started playing again this year and the bugs had all been fixed.  The game had made actual progress unlike so many early access and it plays and feels like a complete game already.  This is the first early access game i've played where full price or more seems justified, rather than waiting for a sale.  The obvious interest and tangible updates by the developers is encouraging and I can't even imagine what else they will add to make it a finished product.  There is even the option for different difficulty levels by altering the world dynamics, and different optional starting squad compositions, anything from a small team with the materials to start a base, to the lone scavenger trying to survive the wasteland and find a few friends. (one note is that i'd recommend taking a look at some of the mods after the first few hours of experience to potentially reduce grind)			"

								First off... EARLY ACCESS!   This has has A LOT of promise.   I've had it for about 2 days now and there is stuff to do but the UI and bugs make me want to wait until they get updated.  I can really see this game going far if the devs keep updating.  If it's true about how this game has been in development since 2009, I think by now it should be a lot further in development than what it is now.  Anyways, game is playable and is kind of fun.			"

								Crash Simulator 2015error/10I've been with this game for... a few years, and it is absolutely amazing. My favorite thing to do is build a fortress, abduct bandits, and use them as slave training to make powerful soldiers. But the mere idea that you can capture people, toss them in a cage, and use them gladiator style, can help explain the amount of random things you Can do.RecommendedUpdate 2017, It is still a great game			"

								April 2016: Amazing game but it is still early access with bugs and crashes. I played 40+ hours so far on the 9.1 beta and will be keeping an eye out for updates. I love the slow levelling and brutal world. I made an outpost too early and got butchered. Then I explored the jungle and dragged a horde of wildlife into a village and watched, while they went on an all-out rampage. I'm really looking forward to exploring more of the world!			"

								Had i wrote this review about 1 year ago when i played it for the first time on my friends computer i would of put the worst review ever. It seemed so unorganized at the time and i just felt like the game was just a mess. But i always thought about this game alot when i would scroll past it because i noticed later on that i really just.. didn't understand kenshi. I finally decided to buy it after i burned out on RUST and find out if i could grasp it. Let me tell you. When i grasped it. I didn't put it down. Kenshi is a Sandbox game that literally takes you into a world that no one cares if you live or die. There are many entities that will kill you and barely anyone to help you. Food is such a pain but i love the struggle to survive. Mining ore for a whole day (In game"" to make ends meet to put food in my stomach. My skills go up from mining. I get faster... better at it.. i mine more and keep working until i'm making enough money to pay for 2 days worth... then i get building supplies... i make a shack... grind more and more and more. I finally hire a helper after and it changes the game dramaticly. Kenshi is not a game that you will just dive straight in and kill groups of enemies in your first fight. As a matter of fact your are supposed to lose. I won my first battle in kenshi on around day 70. I took my squad of barely trained lowlives and turned them into hardened masters of the sword. Its an amazing game. One that if you pick it up and actually try it and don't give up because you can't take the time to learn it will give you a lot of satisfaction when you finally make that small little farm town you always wanted.

I have always wanted to design a game like this and just wanted to encourage you to keep going.  Do a gofundme or something I will support.  BTW, Robotics and Animal Taming are two features I'm looking forward to.  ;-)  KEEP GOING!!!!			"

								This has been in early-access for quite some time, and sometimes it just bugs out to a pretty minor hell, but when everything works (I'd say a good 4/5 times for me) DAMN does it work. If you wanna be the 1v5+ Hero, you have two options. Either train long and hard or cheat. But doing it legitimately has a sense of accomplishment, you can watch the skill of your character grow.And the best part? The devs are still hard at work on this, even when patches sometimes seem few and far between. So, its a good game. For now, I give it a 7.5, but this has more than enough potential to hit a solid 10/10. Is some gud♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

Early Access Review
								This is a game I've been following and playing for a VERY long time.  One of my first GL games, I loved the idea, the setting, and the core mechanics.  And while development seems to have been taking FOREVER (seriously, it's been in my library for over 2 years or so) it's actually been progressing very quickly, I'm just impatient.TL;DRVery realistic approach to an RPG game.  Nice open sandbox elements (done well so far), good combat elements that are in need of some slight refining but are otherwise well thoughtout and implemented, and the possibility to build your own bases/towns to form your own ""faction"" is great.Pros:+Everything?  Seriously, there are so many elements to this game it would be impossible to list them in the limit that Steam puts on reviews.+Music is good, not great, but immersive enough that it doesn't distract+Graphics are good, nothing AAA here, but the rest is so well done who the hell cares?+Gameplay: so without being able to go into too much detail because there's not enough room, they've done a great job with the entire concept of ""play how you want"" within the confines of the game and it's world.  Theivery, trading, combat, research and technology (which goes along with), base building, and the FIGHTING!!!!+Combat is good, since it's still in beta, I'm hoping they refine a few things that are buggy/problematic (Yes, stagger, I mean you, you annoying ♥♥♥♥♥!).Cons:-Still buggy, lots of crashing issues (still a beta so this is hardly a complaint, just a problem that in it's current state may detract from some people's enjoyment-UI is a little odd, in that it doesn't fit the game's aesthetics, but it's far from awful-Load times! But they're still working on optimising the game, so another item that will hopefully fall off the list (but needs to be stated for anyone currently looking at the title)-Some combat elements (staggering is a HUGE problem IMO), though this is purely an OPINION on the current balance they have for the game that I feel doesn't fit to wellIn-Depth:So I can't fit it all in here, there's so many good things to say about this game, but it's a great title.  They really took the whole sandbox combat RPG thing and just created something so spectacular.  You can almost literally do whatever you want.  Seriously.  The way things are done is super realistic (as much as you can in a game like this, anyways), from combat, to research and base building, to farming and trading, right down to the injuries people sustain and how it affects their movements!  You'll limp with a busted up leg, or cradle that beaten up arm, or hold your head so your brains don't fall out from that gaping hole you just got!  Ok, not THAT detailed, but you hold your head when it's injured!  That level of detail is downright impressive from even a AAA title!This team has done some really amazing work, and they deserve some major props, praise and a whole lot of cats... er, I mean cash!  I can't wait to see this game finished, polished, and then what they come up with next!			"

Early Access Review
								In an earlier state of the game when I first bought it, I wanted to build a base really bad. I chose to build it somewhat close to a dogs den on a hill, next to the mountain because it looked like a defensible location. I thought it was far enough from the dog's aggro range.I was wrong. Day after day, dogs practically rushed up the hill and murdered my squad in their sleep. Sometimes, it rained dogs on top of my squad member's heads. One @#$%ing dog could completely destroy my whole squad, even with some  members clad in heavy plate armor. Just to build a well, they even had to go on stealth mode for fear of alerting the dogs.After constant fighting and brushes with death, my squad members survived and grew stronger. There were times when I had them running up the hill with huge backpacks packed with heavy ores, concrete bricks and water buckets just to train their strength.Eventually, I had at least 3 warriors on par with a samurai lord, and could solo sweep the entire murderous dog's den on their own. I was unrivalled across much of the land of Kenshi, and even won a battle with an entire city's worth of ""policemen"". Good times.Based on past experiences, I recommend building your base next to a monster spawn.			"

								Absoutly love the Idea, Love the Path it's Taken, owned it now for 2 years, still cannot play long term!The game is fantastic with the survival aspect of gaining followers and base building that I love, It's a slow paced building, which is nice and relaxing.  The updates over the past 2 years have been a definate upgrade and well done.Now the game still has bugs, And the bugs are what stop me from playing long term.  I get about 5 hours into a game and system gets buggier and buggier, which I am Absoutly confidiant that they will get that fixed.  Their responces on their forums are Fast and Fantastic.Buy this game if you enjoy watching a game evolve and develop.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOUR WANTING A PERFECT GAME OUT THE GATE! still got my money worth out of the game, 28.8 hours as of this review and i paid 20$, so under 1$/hr still well worth it and enjoyed almost all of it till the buggyness starts.

Early Access Review
								-->>I would suggest turing down mouse sensitivity and scroll speeds to aid in performance.<<--TL:DR Buy Kenshi if you're into this sort of epic Post Apocalypitic Survial RTS RPG. I say epic because to truly become a master or rule the world of Kenshi, you will have invested likely a thousand hours; provided you don't cheat, or use the variuous mods which change the typical way you train your fighting skills.I played Kenshi years ago when the extremly early alpha was free on the now bought out Desura. I can tell you the game has really pulled through on that initial vision, and I can't be happier for the developer. Kenshi has come to life.You can literally go from a broke, naked, and incredibly weak; to a mighty warrior wrecking groups of foes and ruler of all the lands. You can build an empire / trade / steal / fight cannibals and other exotic creatures. You can participate in the slave trade or be captured as a slave yourself.The post apocalyptic world is vast (F'ing HUGE) and beautiful. It makes you wonder about the past fallen civilizations and what took place to cause the fall. I think the less you know about Kenshi when you start, the more awe struck you will be upon discovering the world of Kenshi. Don't watch let's plays, just go in blind and you'll be happy that you did. Easily hundreds of hours of gameplay await you. Surviving is difficult and managing a large settlement is also difficult, as it should be.			"

								This Is a really amazing game that I love playing! From being able to start out completelty hopeless in a extremely dangerous desert where you can die within contact of any hostile NPC's. To the awesome level up system for your people. However the game needs work. I haven't played more than 10 hours of this game yet and already notice many things wrong with the game. I will help out by making a list of problems.1) After closing hours of shops your person can get trapped in stores over night2) Game crashes constantly  3) Random spawning of NPC's (litterally had a beaked giraffe or whatever it is spawn right in front of me)4) The pathfinding is slightly broken and causes your people to loop around building before they acctually go into the one you want)5) Textures could use a lot more work! (And I mean A LOT)6) When youn reload the game the squad hotkey at the bottom screen does not display your characters and makes you restart the game to see it again.7) There is no home menu option when you pause the game, WTF!8) Characters and NPC's can walk strait through furniture9) When your on the ground bleeding out in the middle of a town, none of the NPC's help you (This isn't really a bug or anything but come on you know it needs to be part of the game) 10) Help menu seems to be very outdatedI will update this if I run into anymore problems. But I highly recomend this game it has crazy potential to it!			"

But i always thought about this game alot when i would scroll past it because i noticed later on that i really just.. didn't understand kenshi. I finally decided to buy it after i burned out on RUST and find out if i could grasp it. Let me tell you. When i grasped it. I didn't put it down. Kenshi is a Sandbox game that literally takes you into a world that no one cares if you live or die. There are many entities that will kill you and barely anyone to help you. Food is such a pain but i love the struggle to survive. Mining ore for a whole day (In game"" to make ends meet to put food in my stomach. My skills go up from mining. I get faster... better at it.. i mine more and keep working until i'm making enough money to pay for 2 days worth... then i get building supplies... i make a shack... grind more and more and more. I finally hire a helper after and it changes the game dramaticly. Kenshi is not a game that you will just dive straight in and kill groups of enemies in your first fight. As a matter of fact your are supposed to lose. I won my first battle in kenshi on around day 70. I took my squad of barely trained lowlives and turned them into hardened masters of the sword. Its an amazing game. One that if you pick it up and actually try it and don't give up because you can't take the time to learn it will give you a lot of satisfaction when you finally make that small little farm town you always wanted.

								April 2016: Amazing game but it is still early access with bugs and crashes. I played 40+ hours so far on the 9.1 beta and will be keeping an eye out for updates. I love the slow levelling and brutal world. I made an outpost too early and got butchered. Then I explored the jungle and dragged a horde of wildlife into a village and watched, while they went on an all-out rampage. I'm really looking forward to exploring more of the world!			"

								this thoroughly challenging wasteland wandering RPG, though unfinished, is immensely fun! I've never played a game where I had my character minding his own business, brewing rum, when all of a sudden... BAM! cannibals raid my town and knock me out. When I wake up I was in their camp and I was on the menu. This was obviously unacceptable, so I had to pick the lock, break out of the cannibal camp, and make it home safely! It's like the game makes it's own story as you play it! The more you throw youself into, the more the game gives back!although between moments like these, such as power leveling and scraping up some extra cash the ""safe"" way, may not be as intense, They are also fun in their own right. the game can switch back and fourth from city simulation, to an adventure/combat game, then back to a shop simulator in a few in-game days. It really keeps you on your toes and blends together seamlessly.I highly recommend to anyone who has some free time and likes some hard-won battles with whatever comes their way!			"

The ability to disappear into the roles of trader, warrior, town mayor or even just sightseer is the best part because you can do them all at once!

								Kenshi is easily my favourite game so far this year and a very promising early access game. I have had unbelievable amounts of fun playing the game and have tried a few of the many ways you can play through the game, first I was a farmer, then a bandits, and now I command a small elite group of bounty hunters. The leveling system is beautiful and the range of weapons and fighting compliment each other amazingly. I simply can't wait for further updates and the hopefully soon release of bows! :)			"

Early Access Review
								This is the only pre-release game I've ever bought, and it was totally worth the purchase. I've already recruited a group and built an outpost. We make weapons and armor, which I sell in my outpost or take to other towns to trade. I've slowly built up my group to be adept in combat, so now we can fight off the bandits that attempt to raid our settlement rather than running to the nearest city guard for help. I usually can't get into pure sandbox games...without a story telling me what to do I tend to feel overwhelmed and lost. Kenshi offers more gameplay options than anything else I've ever played, but there's plenty that you can do to progress the game, even though there isn't a story driving you to do X for Y. I've built my own outpost and fortified it. I mine my own resources, make my own food, and craft my own clothing, weapons, and armor. I struggled to survive at first, but now my faction is thriving. It's a tough game at first. You aren't special. You're not a hero. Any lowly bandit could easily murder you when you start the game. But you learn to survive until you become skilled enough to defend yourself. The initial difficulty may be a turn-off for some, but it makes everything about the game so much more rewarding.			"

It can be annoying to learn rules, controls, and to find a decent way to start building, but when you get into a rythm and play for a decent amount of time the game is really fun and enjoyable, if not slightly annoying at times due to waiting for a few necessary resousces or dust bandit attacks.9/10 would definetly gift to a freind if i had money			"

								This game can also be referred to as ""Running away from bandits simulator: the game""It pulls no punches and for a long time you will be outclassed by everyone you meet. You will run away a lot. But it has a very addictive quality because of it and when you eventually come out on top you will feel all the better for it.It is however very buggy and prone to things going wrong on long playthroughs.

								Kenshi is a game where you can do almost anything you want more freedom than most games can offer though it still has much progress the little time i played ive had loads of fun their are many pros and cons thoughPROS:-Many chracter beginnings many ones such as freedom seekers,cannibal hunters,nobodies,old soldier and a few more-Character creation is nice needs more in depth creation hopefully another race such as mutants or something cool if there will be deserts and oceans(there is only human male and female)-Good fighting,excellent animation with connection of blades and armor-Challeging,this game requires much though on what you should do with a specific person and how to defeat a bandit party without having everyone becoming injured-Graphics are nice -Ability to stop time and look at surroundings is nice-Good weapons and armor designs-you get to build a base CONS:-Frequent crashes like i said its still in alpha so give it time and report problems-Not enough weapon/armor choices,there should be more i reccomend no guns though could add bows too not just crossbows and dual blades and hopefully shields-Base resources take forever(do not recommend starting out building base at all unless you pick one of the starting choices which have info on it)-watch for your charcters being stuck-weird trading system or merchants dont travel into outpost or leave the shop or outpostOverrall rating is a 8.5/10 very good game nice structure,gameplay,nice graphics,good rts style gameplay if wanted and need be. DO NOT FORGET!!!!!!!!>>> Its still in alpha so give it time and try it its definatly worth the money			"

There is glitches and bugs to be worked out, That is expected in Alpha state tho, but as this game stands right now Its a awesome game, I have built a small outpost out grew my space and made it bigger to a small city! now I am thinking about invading the city next to me.

								this thoroughly challenging wasteland wandering RPG, though unfinished, is immensely fun! I've never played a game where I had my character minding his own business, brewing rum, when all of a sudden... BAM! cannibals raid my town and knock me out. When I wake up I was in their camp and I was on the menu. This was obviously unacceptable, so I had to pick the lock, break out of the cannibal camp, and make it home safely! It's like the game makes it's own story as you play it! The more you throw youself into, the more the game gives back!although between moments like these, such as power leveling and scraping up some extra cash the ""safe"" way, may not be as intense, They are also fun in their own right. the game can switch back and fourth from city simulation, to an adventure/combat game, then back to a shop simulator in a few in-game days. It really keeps you on your toes and blends together seamlessly.I highly recommend to anyone who has some free time and likes some hard-won battles with whatever comes their way!			"

								Amazing game, I know I lack play time but from what I have played so far, it is amazing what you can do in it, from picking up fallen team mates and carrying them to a town, to being able to construct your own. Looking forward to future updates.			"

								Yes there are still some kinks to work out and the overall setup is a little ruff around the edges but you can see the potiential in this game to become truly epic. The ability to disappear into the roles of trader, warrior, town mayor or even just sightseer is the best part because you can do them all at once! A few bugs here and there but overall it was probably one of the most interesting betas I've gotten my hands on.			"

								Amazing little sandbox adventure! It's always being updated and the game is taking a very cool direction. This is certainly one to watch for the long haul as its comes together. It's not a completely finished game and many areas are still lacking, but what is there..... is hours of fun! It reminds me of MadMax and the thunderdome as you go treking across the wasteland slaughtering dust bandits and saving your people from cannibal raids!			"

								Kenshi is easily my favourite game so far this year and a very promising early access game. I have had unbelievable amounts of fun playing the game and have tried a few of the many ways you can play through the game, first I was a farmer, then a bandits, and now I command a small elite group of bounty hunters. The leveling system is beautiful and the range of weapons and fighting compliment each other amazingly. I simply can't wait for further updates and the hopefully soon release of bows! :)			"

								This game is fun! Why not recommend it then, right? Well its because its not quite ready for general playing. After building a town you realize none of it really has a purpose yet. Thats fine, but it gets super boring. Economy isnt fully functional yet either, 10 minutes is enough time to abuse trade for a fortune, THEN build a city. Im too sad after playing it to explain anymore, dont forget this game, just dont buy it yet.EDIT- The time has come to re-review this game and it has made huge leaps into being what it claims- an open world sandbox squad based RPG. So many new options for building. Still have a rough a tumble problem, were just starting out you get rocked for a good while. Then suddenly youre the butt kicker. The base building is so much bigger now, after not playing for like 8 months. The game seems so much better. Its time to finally check it out!			"

								荒廃した世界でサバイバルしていくゲーム。現在30人までキャラクター操作可能。キャラは酒場で3,000capから雇える。時々無料で仲間になってくれる人もいるのでお金がなくても安心。初期は街の人が倒してくれた犬の皮を剥いで売ったり、鉄を採掘して売ったりしてコツコツお金を貯める。仲間が増えてくるといよいよ拠点づくりを始めよう！拠点には城壁、門、家、井戸、石切り場、畑、鍛冶場等、色々な施設を作ることができる。また、キャラクターに仕事を割り振る事が出来、自動で働かせることも出来るので便利。採掘した鉄を精錬して武器を作ったり、皮をなめして防具を作ったりもできる。鍛冶スキルが低いうちは弱い武器しか作れないが、たくさん作ってスキルが上がれば状態の良い（強い）武器が作れるようになる。農場で牛と牛専用バックパック（大容量で便利！）を買えば交易もはかどる！技術ツリーを開放するのに必要なアイテムには「本」と「古代の本」等があり、より高度な技術開発に必要な「古代の本」はレアなので、遠くまで旅したり、古代遺跡をあさって手に入れる必要があるらしく、拠点作りが安定してからもやることがあっていい感じ。初期キャラ作りでの注意としては、種族「スケルトン」を選ぶと、一部の勢力からは見つけ次第攻撃されてしまう（その場合も人間を仲間にして人間だけで近付けば攻撃されないので、ロールプレイのためにスケルトンを選びたい人でも大丈夫。スケルトンは治療コストが高いので初期につらいという欠点もあるが……）。マップは十分広く、バリエーションに富んでいる（砂漠、平原、山岳地帯、古代遺跡群等）。しかも現在行くことのできる地域の数倍の広さの未開放地域があるので、将来的にはかなり広いものになるだろう。現状でもかなり面白いので、おすすめです！			"

								It really has a great potential. But, i couldn't figure out the patches yet. There are lots of serious bugs, crashes and unfinished zillions of stuff screaming out there, still patching cosmetics. If you have a great imagination about what this game will be after, at least get a beta stage, and also if you have patience about crashes occuring in every 15-20 minutes; yes it's fun. But it looks and smells like a side project of some accountants and hobbiests whom patches the game nearly two months row. If you survive crashes and bugs with lots of saves, the point of ""everything is done and what to do next"" comes really quickly BECAUSE it's not finished fundementaly yet. And, they announce a new race while characters couldnt run/climb/fight/enter a building/exit a building/talk to NPCs etc. Maybe gets beta in 5 years.			"

								Kenshi is shaping up to be one of the best games on Steam and maybe one of the best games out. Period.A very ambitious design, Kenshi is real time and looks like these game makers are trying to succeed at giving players squad based combat, base building, base defense, factions warfare and relations, character development and excellent customization, rescource management, serious exploration, rich atmosphere, and in depth game play mechanics like stealth and lockpicking. Thats just to name a few game play elements Kenshi is aiming to offer players. Ambitious or what.Kenshi's story is weak at the moment and there are a few bugs but the updates are rapid, like once or twice a week. Alot is unfinished and buggy, but its in alpha. This is a game that I expect the price to rise when it is launched.Check it out for sure. Theres a free demo even. This could potentially be a 10/10 game some day. Really. As it is now, in alpha, with so much unfinished its easily a 7/10. I expect pro reviews will be just as flattering.			"

								Alright time to update finaly got sound, cannibals, and females in game. Isn't even to .7 yet is playable to a large degree. There are still some bugs running around but it is not a finished game if you don't expect bugs well you haven't played games in the last 10 years. I still remember plain xbox games that had bugs and you were stuck with them, the first time my xbox 360 patched a game I was in awe of the tech, then a year latter I wass annoyed at having to wait 2 mins for bug fixes, that use to be stuck with for life.You can't go solo some bandits for exp instead your running like coward dragging bandits into gaurds, and looting other peoples kills. Or my fave trying to gather enough to kill a trade caravan or at least just the weaker traders, so you can loot their backpacks full of goodies, and once their guards clean up, you look for a bandit leader, strip him naked, heal him pick up and collect his bounty at the nearest town lol.You can now start a outpost early and work on your own little prodution empire, but beware doing so means a lot of running since the start that lets you do so doesn't have any real armor, weapons, or skilled fighters so you will get chased out of your outpost on accasion. Much better to assemble your own team and train in the desert while buying goods low, and selling high between towns. That way you are attached to your men/women there not just worker 1-6 you know them by name. Of course you do end up hireing worker 1-6 still but they are just production fodder, the crew you trained from scratch are their gaurdians and masters, who can work along side them in time of peace. To me it isn't just about making my own outpost and sitting in it waiting for traders to come and buy my goods, its about the adventure, going out of the outpost taking on the cannibals, and bandits. Using the base to research a means to craft high quality gear, and train old worker bees into soliders to assit my core team in picking fights with people who use to mop the floor with me.And next up on the roadmap diplomacy, making it so factions interact with you. Especialy nice for the people who turtle up in the outpost and never leave, they will have to deal with demmands, raids and the nicer things that goes with faction interaction			"

								Lots of pottential for this game, there are some crashes and some minor or game breaking bugs but this is still a early access game, the game mechanics are easily adaptable to and easy to figure out.RTS/RPG/Survival/OpenWorld/CityBuid is basicly all the tags for this game if you wanted to see what its like.Graphics are decent for a game like this, The amount of characters you can have(30 Max.) is very useful if you want to have a Trading Caravan. Bandit/ninja party, Small Town, Doctors, or anything you wish, there is different roles and scenarios you are able to play like, a lone wanderer who has nothing, a hungover ninja who got into a bad situation, or a lucky scavenger who found a OP sword but has people out to get him. Survival is constant as there are animals everywhere trying to devour you, slavers trying to capture you or canibals trying to eat you and bandits of all sorts trying to rob you and kill you or the ninjas that have no real reason to kill you but theyll just try to do it anyways. There are many Factions throughout the lad of Kenshi including your own faction, you can improve or worsen relations with different factions, make freinds, enemies, have new members join, hire medics, engineers, nobodies or experienced fighters to join your faction. there are many jobs within kenshi like bounty hunting, farming, mining, crafting, water gathering,hauling,and just so much more to come....i do really recommend this game but you should probably wait until a few more patches and updates to come beacsue the crashes are really crazy and it usually crashes after a autosave or when you load the game the squad system is broken...but i do reccomend this game because it hasnt given me that much trouble other than lag and crashes.

								This game is fun! Why not recommend it then, right? Well its because its not quite ready for general playing. After building a town you realize none of it really has a purpose yet. Thats fine, but it gets super boring. Economy isnt fully functional yet either, 10 minutes is enough time to abuse trade for a fortune, THEN build a city. Im too sad after playing it to explain anymore, dont forget this game, just dont buy it yet.EDIT- The time has come to re-review this game and it has made huge leaps into being what it claims- an open world sandbox squad based RPG. So many new options for building. Still have a rough a tumble problem, were just starting out you get rocked for a good while. Then suddenly youre the butt kicker. The base building is so much bigger now, after not playing for like 8 months. The game seems so much better. Its time to finally check it out!			"

								First things first, this game is a gem. It's a squad based sandbox building game with a cool world and lots of rewarding levelling and progression. Even with minimal dialogue you will feel attached toe ach and every one of your squad members more and more as you go along. Now for the downside, this game is a long time coming, and is being developed LITERALLY by one guy. Progress is slow but it's always making progress. This game is well done, and while there are some bugs it's potential is limitless. If you like independent game development, and this sounds even mildly entertaining to you, buy this game. It's cheap and it supports original, independent game development.			"

								This is one of those games I go back to every couple of months.  Every time it's a different experience, but that core aspect is still there: ""Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""  I laugh sometimes at the strategies I come up with.  ""perhaps getting my butt kicked daily as a slave will be a good endurance grind...""  I keep a special post-disaster savegame named Whatthehelljusthappened for when I get suprised and I use it often.The developers are very ambitious.  They had a great base game going, then they threw out the map with the experimental version, and replaced it with a huge continent.  Only about 1/8th of the new map is available for play right now and I'm simply amazed at the detail that was put into it.  They added animals and creatures out of nightmare.  Different humaniods, religious motivations, pets, crime and punishment.  There are still lots of bugs to get ironed out.  CTD is common, but with a decent autosave, it hasn't ruined the game for me.			"

								I've put many hours into this game.  Though it's still in it's early alpha stage, the game is coming along nicely for what it is currently.The concept is fresh, and is executed very well.  The detail puts many AAA games to shame, even in it's current state.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone that loves RPG's, strategy games, and squad based combat in a real-time setting with pause mechanic.There are flaws with the game, that are unfortunately due to the engine used but it's being updated and as of writing this review, 0.72.1 is really buggy and crashes.  I have set it to experimental which means it's the unstable variant of the game and as I stated it is buggy.  There currently is a limitation in the engine that causes a specific crash that tends to happen often, unfortunatly though they haven't pinpointed it yet but I have faith they will soon.  Other flaws, which are very minor, are glitches with pathing and AI mainly.  It's not optimized so it's very slow at times even on high end machines.  Aside from these flaws the game is very much playable and extremely fun despite missing many of the mechanics the developers have in store for the game.They have many additions in store for the game, new races, new biomes, a HUGE map, lots of buildings to build, and many more we have yet to hear about.Again I recommend this to anyone that loves chaotic fast paced battles.  I'm looking very much forward to the finished product.			"

								This game has a lot of potential, however I am not sure they will take it on. Early game: Early game last a very long time, partially because it is difficult to get skilled out of early game.This part of the game is boring, repitition and grants no sense of doing anything.  You go find a group of baddies, lead them to town, help the guards fight (if you call it help), loot and sell, buy guys and gear, repeat for hours.Mid game: After you have enough guys, lets say 20 to be safe, you can buy up a bunch of building material, find a spot and start your own town.  Hopefully you can win about 20-30% of the fights by now.  This is where the game starts to get interesting finally.  Unfortunately I started this too soon, unable to actually win most fights makes my 12 guys unable to hold up my base.Short of it:  The game is as grindy as an MMO, but makes winning more difficult at first.  Based on the description, I believe it will become too easy late in game, if I could get to that point.  Thus I believe the mid-game is about the only part with any play value, considering how long it takes to get to that point I would not suggest starting again with a new goal unless you like watching guards grind.  With the description by the Developer the world will not change, hense long game you'll be so tough it will be boring from the lack of challenge.  This is why I don't believe the game will ever reach it's potential, and why I cannot recommend it.			"

								I like early access, getting involved, helping the dev... and true, I've made some purchases that I regret but this game is up there on my list of disapointment. I was taken by the concept's idea and potential this game has but... it's so early in alpha that it's barely stands on it's legs. It's so buggy and unattractive, even the UI is horrible. Looking at the main menu, it's just as bad as something I did awhile back, and I'm an amateur with no formal training. Development is taking forever with few major improvements to show for it, which is expected from a small team but regretable. The dev should perhaps focus on fixing (and perhaps overhaul) the UI to be more user-friendly, making sure everything is simple and smooth before making additions and balancing. I can't reccomend this at this time given how slow development is aswell which is a shame because the concept is quiet good.			"

I think the potential is definitely there and if you buy games on potential, than it is definitely something you should consider spending your money on, especially if you think the idea of open world games without forced narratives is something large companies should be looking into at least once.  If you like things that you can play, and are optimized, and work well - I would completely pass on this as it stands today.  "

								I really wanted to like this game. I liked the concept to it all, however the game falls short due to a distinct lack of well... having anything to really do. The game simply feels incomplete.Pros:Building CitiesRecruiting CompanionsCharacter CustomizationVariety of items, armor, etc...ConsNot much to do: build a city out post, whatever. But there's no real point beyond that. Its like Minecraft in that regards.Combat can be a tad bit tedious.No-story.			"

								Devoid of Features, this Game lacks a lot of what I take for granted in todays releases (even EarlyAccess). It wouldn't be worth a Downvote because of it's Early Access status, but considering how minimal the development progress is and how many years of development this game still needs, i cannot recommend to pick it up. It's a prototype on it's way to Alpha.When you buy it now and see no real improvement when coming back after one year you see that the game was clearly not ready for any kind of release.The Developers should have started with a smaller project with better chances of finishing it in a decent time in order to get their funding for a bigger project.

								I think this game deserves all the support it can get.  In it's current form, there's not too much to do.  It's glitchy.  Sometimes you start off the game and NPCs are sky high and weapons slowly bury themselves into the desert just to make the game even harder.  And dead ally NPCs never disappear from your HUD.  Sometimes you put down an injured ally and suddenly they fly 10,000 meters northwest.  Yet this review isn't supposed to dissuade you from purchasing Kenshi.  These bugs are being thoroughly adressed, ableit slowly, and the creator really seems to have a passion and committment to his game.My opinion is that Greenlight is the worst thing to ever happen to Steam, it's flooded my beloved platform with CRAP.  I'm thankful that Kenshi made it through Greenlight and is one of the few redeeming releases in the sea of turds released from Greenshit.  It looks to be a great RPG, though I have my doubts whether the all the auspiciously planned features will be available, I have full confidence that Kenshi will be a fully fledged, fully fleshed out, vast and enjoyable game.Please buy it, try it, and support the dev team with crash logs.  They seem to really care and try.			"

Early Access Review
								To begin, i know there has been some critical negative reviews, and i would like to explain them.The game has been in development for a long time, but when it was on indiegogo in 2012, it raised $2,315 dollars, when they wanted $40,000. So development is not going to be quick until their revenue.Since then, ive seen a vast improvement in the game, the development has really sped up in the last 12 months, as there is now a larger dev team and they can afford to focus on different aspects of the game.Now onto the game itself:Pros:-Game is definitely playable now, with alot to do, and a variety of things to aim for.-Can be modded easily (if so inclined), to increase the content and improve the game, although it doesnt need to be if you dont want to.-Immensely enjoyable, you can start in nearly any situation, as a single guy with a broken arm and a iron club,as a dedicated group of people ready to build a dream city, and plenty of other options.-The dev team regularly react to forum suggestions, and you can often see a direct impact of uploading crash reports.-Only £13-Alot of options of how to play, and there is something to do at the early, middle and late stages of the game. Starting an outpost, building up a core group of fighters, and then maybe even starting a war of sorts with some of the cities.-Everyone can level up in the game, the NPCS will get stronger if they fight, you can get stronger by winning (and sometimes losing) fights. -Nothing is guaranteed. There is a chance, albeit a slim one, that you can beat someone much stronger than you, as long as you get a lucky shot in. But that works in reverse, you could be KO'd by a hobo bandit when you can usually take on 10 of them, if they get a lucky shot.-However, my favourite feature is this: You are not special. You are not unique. If you fight someone stronger like you, you are not going to win very often. When you start, everyone, even the hobo bandits with rags and iron clubs, will easily beat you in a fight. But because of how some character stats work, this isnt neccesarily a bad thing, as by being beaten up, you improve, you build up a defence, and become harder to beat up next time. Fast forward abit, and you can easily kill a hobo bandit.In the view of being unbias:Cons:-Alpha game, so expect bugs, expect the game to lag and glitch out occasionally, and sometimes to crash completely. But by making use of the Autosave function, i've managed to make it so i rarely lose much progress. (I also sometimes use the crashes as a cue to stop playing, since you can get sucked into played for along time.)-Potentially long waits if you are beaten up in a fight, on max speed, i sometimes have to wait a minute or two for my guys to wake up after a knock out, which can get a little annoying, but i guess its a motivator to become stronger and not get beaten up.-Sometimes slow development. As i explained earlier, the development was slow for the first few years, but now due to a big dev team, it has sped up significantly. However, when new features are added, new bugs arise, sometimes making the game unplayable. This is usually resolved within a few days, and is sped up by uploading your crash reports to the forum.I cant think of any more cons. It seems bias, but thats because there are more pros than cons.I hope this has helped you make a decision, and just think: If you're worried about slow development, buy the game, and your money will help to fund it, causing development to speed up.Thanks for your time.

Early Access Review
								Gave this game a fair shot aannndddd....A vast open and overall EMPTY world, just played a little after giving the dev team over a year to put in the long awaited content which is being labeled as 'potential'seem to recall that the team was working on the communication system over a year ago but for now 99% of NPC's are mute ghost who add nothing of value to the game.Oh there are 'dogs' and they're new since the last time i played. They're hard to kill but don't worry about that because when there are 2 dozen attacking you that doesn't matter anyway. Thats about the most threatening thing in the game right now because the only other enemy to engage are bandits, most of them are stuck on the cliffs around the terrain...not moving.To sum up;Potential= Lots (the reason we all decided to support this Alpha in the first place)Bugs= LotsLag= LotsUnbalanced gameplay= LotsContent= VERY lowProgress= VERY SLOWThis development team really needs to put in some work before this game is even close to enjoyable, at the moment this is the only early access game (Of many) which i've bought on steam were i feel ripped off. :-(			"

								Do not get this game until they come out with an overhauling update, it is not worth it at this time. The content is very limited and quite hard to get a good start. Pretty much at the moment the only way to begin is to get people to kill the bandits and then loot what is left. There is much do to other than wander around, trade, and build a town. It is pretty fun to build a town but very hard to get to that point unless you pick the trader group start. The game has a lot of potential but glitches, diffiulcty, and not having much to do really doesn't make it worth the buy at this point in time. I will change this review once a decent update comes out.			"

								It's quite a fun game, and worth the price. Sure its still being made...and sure enemies will sometimes walk over your walls...and your characters have a phobia of keeping the gate closed and will open it when your not looking...but...Despite the bugs its still an awesome game to play. and its team is definitely deserving of more support they've been working on the game 4,or more  years before it hit Steams EA program. and 2 or more years since then . They're dedicated to making the game their 'dream' game so the team is somewhat small. so progress doesn't happen as fast as we'd like but its a quality game.You take on the role of a down an out swordsmen...or sword post really cause..you'll spend the first 60mins getting beaten to death . an if you manage to survive >.> you'll be eaten by a pack of dogs who didn't like you building a house in the middle of nowhere.11/23/2016 : After 300+ hours , i still think its worth getting. It has improved a lot since i originally made this review.it also has had a workshop for a little while now so there are a lot of mods to keep it interesting and make it harder....or easier if you desire. You still get beaten down , an potentially eaten by a giant ostriche but..........thats life!			"

Early Access Review
								I purchased this game over a year ago, and it's been fun to see how the game has progressed. Kenshi has a special place in my heart as it was my first Early Access game, and it gave way to a horrible EA addiction; My personal views on the game: -Being Early Access there are a number of bugs, but the majority of them are so minor as to not be noticed and tend to be fixed quickly. Overall I've only come across one bug that caused me to quit playing, but it caused me to quit for a number of months. Recently however I decided to give it another try, and I'm very happy I did, the work that the Devs have done have been amazing, and the bug had been fixed. -The Gameplay is quite fun, albeit can be slow to get into at the start of a game, and the premise is unique, which I appriciate. -Once the initial slow start was over I found the game to be fairly immersive, creating seperate squads, each with its own purpose, town building, guards, labor, craftsmen, bounty hunters etc.-The Graphic are pretty good, and have improved significantly in the year I've had the game.-Updates can come slowly, but so far have always been worth the wait.Overall, aside from the Early Access bugs, and the occasional crash Kenshi is one of my favorite games, and I highly recommend it, however, as with all Early Access games, if you're looking for a finished game, this isn't it.

								TL;DR: The game hasn't changed much over several years, and is full of game breaking bugs with a UI that leaves the user confused. I cannot recommend the game at this point, and from what I have obversed over the years, I will most likely never recommend it.Bought the game in 2013. I played it a little bit but grew bored of it very quick. The UI was confusing to say the least. The game itself was full of many bugs. Animations didn't look good at all, often looking robotic. Shoot forward to end of 2015, a few days away from 2016. The meat of the game hasnt changed at all. The gameplay gets stale very quickly, I havent even been able to do much due to the game constantly crashing and having so many freezes and bugs that it quickly deters me from even trying to play the game. The UI is very cluttered and not user friendly at all. Animations dont look different. While the game has improved slightly in some areas, I still find it to be incredibly unfinished, which is a shame because the premise of the game is very good, and I would love to play a user friendly, finished version of this, but at this current rate I dont think the game will ever be in a finished state.

								Number 1, I happen to really like this game.  I purchased this game in Oct. 2014 and have spent over 318 hours trying to play it.  The constant crashes are the biggest complaint I have.  This game used to be semi playable and would stay operational for a couple of hours.  Sure it has been buggy with people sticking in walls and getting stuck inside buildings, etc., but it was playable.I do not know why the crashing problem has not been addressed but has been constantly ignored and instead other content of the game keeps getting added.    I stopped playing for a couple of months and waited patiently hoping that this problem would be taken care of in one of the patches.I have deleted all content and have reinstalled this game at least 2 dozen times.  Two days ago I decided to try and play again.  I reinstalled the game AGAIN so that all content would be new.  It allowed me to play a couple of hours then the crashes started once again.  On one crash it deleted all saved games and even the autosave game.I don't even mind my characters running backwards, I actually find it amusing and it doesn't stop them from operating machines or doing other duties assigned to them.   I check the integrity of the files and I seem to be losing 1-4 files every time after each crash.  Today my average game play time is 22 seconds before the game crashes.I really want to play this game, but 22 seconds between crashes is very infuriating even for someone with as much patience as I have shown towards this game.

								I love this game , put many hours in the game and its not even near done!Pro- You dont have to build a city, you can make a band of bounty hunters and just go around hunting people.-Its a real sandbox game! -Build your own town or buy a few buildings in a city!- The music!!!!Cons--The only things I don't like is the adding of of non- real non-human race. And all the weird space looking animals. It makes it feel as if this game is going on a non-realish more fantasy direction. -Also on how long the updates take, I know its a small team but it seems like it is taking forever =(As my personal opinion...I would give this game a 8/10 for as it stands right now =)			"

								This, is a game with great potential, I believe it could have been made better.Here are my ideas.Thirdperson view & firstperson like skyrimDayZ control schemeWhy my idea's should come true.The thirdperson view would be a great idea instead off runescape bird's eye view, I hate that idea, along with anyone who came up with it.The control scheme from DayZ would also be amazing for searching and sprinting.Oh, I also forgot.

								This game is absolutely obsurd. It promises sandbox game play? yea freaking right.  You are relegated to what amounts to be a 1 hit point character that get mobbed by 8-10 bandits if even think of leaving the city, you have no way to reliably defend yourself, training weapons takes forever! Seriously put your guy on auto attack ona dummy and go to sleep NOT FUN all skills are like that. The camera angles are wonky to say the least numerous buggs are still in effect for example I was returning a bandit leader to the police for a nice reward but they wouldnt take him so I put the bandit leader out and he immediately jumped up spawned some bad♥♥♥♥♥sword and took out the ENTIRE EFFING MILITIA apparently he was unkillable he then spawn camped me and any time i would wake up he would drive his sword through my skull. YAYA SO MUCH FUN! I managed to scrape together some materials and find a nice spot to set up camp but as soon as i did the bandits cam eout and demanded ransom which i couldnt pay and slaughtered my  one tiny shack. I bought this game on sale and its not worth it AT ALL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE even the origianl X-com wasnt this brutal. all your stats start at level 1 and any recruit you get also starts at level 1 so it will take you roughly a week to get any momentum up if you can survive the first 2-3 hours that is if your going to make yoru characters one shot kills to everything you need to have them advnace a lot faster than they currently are or SOMEWAY to buy a mercenary that can take on 12 bandits at a time since all you do at the beggining is run out find bandits run back in train the town guard ont hem then loot thier corpses then walk at a snails pace back with the little gear you CAN CARRY and hope the gear doesnt despawn when you go back or hope the bandits dont wake up and run away.Weapons are worhtless seriously you made a ninja/samurai game WITHOUT ♥♥♥♥ING BOWS??? READ A BOOK YOU IMBICILE!!!! THe game world is to large for how fast you can travel on foot. Desperatley need horses since you know samurai tended to be MOUNTED ARCHERS YOU JACK♥♥♥♥♥ Finding your way around town is difficult some towns dont have every shop and when you cant buy a backpack your well and truly screwed. theres no minimap no directional heading so you cant find your way around easily, shops are incongruously marked, I've yet to survive more than 3 hours without the game bugging out and forcing a restart, so i can't even comment on the whole ""Sand box building mode"" Weapon damage and armor are the most INANE system i've ever seen WTF do these damn numbers EVEN MEAN???!!! THAC0 was ten times easier to figure out than this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥combat ystem.  Guys if you want a city builder go get banished its way better than this. I wanted to liek this game so much....I REALLY WANT TOLIKE YOU KENSHI BUT JESUS EFFING CHRIST ALL MIGHTY YOUR A BIGGER TURD THAN JABBA THE HUT!!!!so reasons NOT to bu this game via bullet point1. Character advancement monotonous, slow, underpowered, and to complex to easily understand2. Slow travel times bog a slow game down even more have fun crawling to town with your loot only to get jumped by bandits and killed.3. A single starting character VS 12 bandits right  off the bat run or die. YOu need to have a party of 8-10 chars starting to even try and survive.4. Unstable gameplay can screw over all your hard work and set you back several HOURS.5. awful camera controls.6. Tooltips?? LMAO WTF ARE THOSE7.NO ranged combat all melee seriously give me a godamn bow go read some japanese/chinese hostory8. ugly ugly ugly graphics characters hover about 2 feet off the ground such lazy programming. Character models are very unrefined and buggy. Often times when using a bed my character sleeps upside pwn with his feet sticking up under the pillow and his head poking into the ground.9. Sand box! you'll never make it there and even if you do you get overrun by bandits so unless you ahve hired 50 recruits dont even think about it. I'm sure it would be just as bad a grind fest as getting your character up to that point. Hmm let me research for 5 hours real time how to craft a SPOON!!!10. Absurd combat system crafted by some demented lovecraftian spawn of cthulu locked in a extra dimensional pocket of agony.11. absolute BARREN landscape you will spend most your time zoomed out to max range watching a monotone brown desert, looking for tiny pixes that resemble bandits so you can run your name close to them and then run away to town having the town guard do your dirty work loot as many things as you can and hope beyond hope you can make it to town again without getting jumped by another 20 fuggin bandits. this game isnt worth 5$ if this was a 2.17$ i'd still be more entertained by wiping my♥♥♥♥♥with the code this game dares to present. If you are looking for a sandbox game go elsewhere. if however you are looking for an INSANE CHALLENGE to both your wits, and patience as a human being then get this game as each bug and each death and each set back will make you tear your hair out asking why the EFF DO I PLAY THIS!!!! The only potential this game has is how far the well of dissapointment goes down. YOu have a choice...YOu can take the red pill or the blue pill......take the blue pill			"

								This was one of the very first games I ever bought in Early Access.  This game is part of the reason I avoid early access games like the corporatist plague they are. Raise Money! Fund Raising! Pump the Hype! Delivery at Minimal Cost! PROFITS!!!!!I am really sorry to see that this is becoming the norm for retail video games as it has become the norm in so many other aspects of our lives. Kenshi (and countless early access games now), is result of this system... The owners have no technical or legal mechanism to force them to complete the game in a quality or timely manner, and they have already had their money grab thanks to to Early Access and Steam. This game looks almost identical to what it looked like years ago when I bought it. Very little has changed in development. The question of whether or not is has ""potential"" is an excercise in futility when something has been around as long as Kenshi has.  The world is empty, there are no quests or missions, every NPC is identical with the exception that a few of them start the game hostile to each other. There really just isn't anything here, and until the game is released and the reviews start to change, iI would avoid this like a waste of money it is.You will probably get 10-15 hours of playability out of it in its current state. This is about how much time it takes to run through the research tree, level some characters, and get some production going.  Over the years as it has been updated modestly i have done a few play throughs (I refuse to not get my money out of it).			"

I've had alot of fun with it, while the content is not much, and the gameplay requires getting used to, you get a feel of apocalyptic bad assery.Update : 3/31/2016 - Beta ReleasedIts pretty good still, the new map is huge and has great variety between the biomes.

								this game looks super cool and to tell the truth it is but its not finished hardly even playable needs alot of work and it crashes more then you can even save. alot of ai and skills are broken. takes way tolong to even be able to kill anything should atleast make it so you can level fighting up faster or anything.right now if you get this game you will probaly be doing nothing but watching the screen while trying to build skills hopeing it dont crash or hopeing the random ai doesnt attack you for doing nothing like the police thats so boring. i understand its in early delv but its been out for years wtf. i feel they started out with a really good idea but when the cashflow came rolling in this game has been on pause and noone has cracked down on it in a while.if you notice ive played 27 hours of this game.and i havenot even done more then try to keep it on with out it crashing and my people are not even strong enough to take on a random unarmed person in town. wait and buy this when they finish well if they finish the game unless you like to waste your time. be ready to not be able to kill anything and get knocked out for real life hours waiting for things toimprove but i have not seen any improvementsince ive been playing good luck			"

								I bought this game shortly after it was released. Please for the love of your sanity do not buy this game, at least not yet. Ignore these positive reviews. Anyone that posts a positive review starting with some lame story is doing nothing but building the hype at thats all it is. You'll spend weeks just trying to get leveled up to be able to fight something and even then you'll still get pummeled. Right out of the gate you can't do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥to anything. All you can do is run through the desert and build your strength or running speed so you can lure enemys to the gates of a town so you can steal their armor and weapons. You can sell it or wear it but it still won't make a difference. You'll have to do this a hundred times before you can afford to even start building anything. Even after all of this you'll still not be able to kill anything, even with a group of hired hands. Moving around is ridiculous. I haven't seen such an awkward movement system since the alpha for ultima online and even they had something better than this. You'll right click to move and nothing will happen and you'll do this several times and still not go where you want your character to go. No W A S D controls whatsoever. The GUI is horrible, the character models and textures are disgusting. I've been back and forth with this game over the years hoping for some improvements but they've done very little. I cannot fathom how such little progress can be made in 3 years. If I look back at what it was then and what it is now I cannot see a bit of difference.			"

								This game has more potential than anything I have seen on Greenlight/Early Access yet. The premise is interesting, the combat is great fun, it gives a real feeling of freedom. It is stoic, bad♥♥♥♥♥ hilarious; anything you want it to be. The game's only story is the story of your character, and what a tale it can be. Long and arduous; full of victories and defeats. The game is not near completion, so if you are looking for a fleshed out experience right now, I might advise against picking it up now but my heart goes out to the developers. This is the type of game many people have been waiting years for. If all goes well it will be a milestone in indie gaming; a truly unique experience.			"

								this game looks super cool and to tell the truth it is but its not finished hardly even playable needs alot of work and it crashes more then you can even save. alot of ai and skills are broken. takes way tolong to even be able to kill anything should atleast make it so you can level fighting up faster or anything.right now if you get this game you will probaly be doing nothing but watching the screen while trying to build skills hopeing it dont crash or hopeing the random ai doesnt attack you for doing nothing like the police thats so boring. i understand its in early delv but its been out for years wtf. i feel they started out with a really good idea but when the cashflow came rolling in this game has been on pause and noone has cracked down on it in a while.if you notice ive played 27 hours of this game.and i havenot even done more then try to keep it on with out it crashing and my people are not even strong enough to take on a random unarmed person in town. wait and buy this when they finish well if they finish the game unless you like to waste your time. be ready to not be able to kill anything and get knocked out for real life hours waiting for things toimprove but i have not seen any improvementsince ive been playing good luck			"

								I got the demo for this a few months back and it was buggy to say the least. Also felt like a game from 1998.... however I liked the idea for the game and thought id give it a go... Well the full game looked worse than the demo for me.. still the same bugs ( shadows all over the place, glitchy character etc) the controls and camera movement are awful, point and click would seem straight forward but after playing this.....half the time the character doesnt move when you click...some of the textures looked rubbish...(and yes settings are maxed out) all the buildings in main town look the same ..graphics is as i said from a 1998 game...i know graphics aint everything but they could be improved..I also felt the game was boring...no incentive to do anything...wondered about wastelands for ages only encountering the odd sand ninja (and i died lol) ... I know i didnt give the game much time on here.. but i did play the demo for a few hours ...It maybe an early access game but its been worked on for over 2 years and should be much better in my opinion (smooth moveme...especially when theyre charging £12.99 for it! Anyways thats my opinion. Dont buy it, plenty better deals out there that are way more fun			"

Its all three with the options at start you can chose to build a base, go around the world by your self or have a crew and fight down gangs. Its like a mad max game with a mount and blade twist on it. Its a lot of fun that takes a lot of micro managing so you can put people with the right stats to do that job and improve at it. I give Kenshi a 7.25/10.			"

								Not recommended unless you like copious heaps of trial and error and save scumming. You start out unable to kill a puppy. Haven't tried the other modes yet, but the experience marketed as the default experience should not have you be so helpless. You shouldn't start out 6 levels lower than a peasant if your backstory is that you've been wandering around for a while.			"

								I bought this game in the Steam Summersale 2013. I played it for a while and discovered that it was an unplayable mess, even for an alpha. 18 months later I tried again, thinking that maybe some of the bugs have been fixed and that the game would have some interesting content instead of just an empty desert. I don't know what the developer(s?) did between those months time, but actually trying to make a game was not one of them. Virtually no progress had been made and I am convinced that this junkheap of a game will never ever actually be anywhere near finished.			"

Its a strange Mad Max version of Samurai style wild-west sandbox single player party play with the possibility of building your own ""base.""

Build a city using blocks or run around and get killed by groups of enemies. I know this game is in alpha, but games like this make me never want to buy early access again. The updates are so slow that it feels like the dev said thank you for your money now♥♥♥♥♥♥off. I do not recommend this game at its current state, and even when its complete at this rate I would not even recommend it then either. Save your money, buy something else.			"

								This game reminds me of a skit I once saw from a television show on IFC. I believe the show is called Portlandia, and the sketch was Bicycle Movers. A lady calls movers to get her moved into her new house, so that she can sell the old one, and two people show up on a tandem bicycle pulling a toy red wagon. The lady grows increasingly frustrated as she continues to pay both mortgages, her items get broken, and they even move her things to the wrong house. All the while,they keep giving the excuse that they are bicycle movers and trying to sell her on the concept that they are somehow  the best choice. The are hip, independant, and cutting edge alternative.This game does precisely the same thing. It sells you on the idea that it is ""Hip, Indie, and Cutting edge"" It says its a squad based RPG, and in early access. When it arrives, you realize it isn't even playable, and things continue to get worse. All the while, nothing ever changes and when you ask why it is still in alpha after two years, people keep telling you how this is a, ""One man dev crew..."" and ""it will be everything you ever dreamed once its finished"". The problem is that both the experimental and main versions are essentially unplayable most of the time, and even when they are, there is nothing to do but wander around aimlessly getting in fights. Fights which by the way, you have little to no control over. The excuse of this being a one man Dev team is absurd. If that is the reason for this being in perpetual alpha, why isn't there a warning about that in big bold letters above the game page? No such warning existed when I purchased it! I don't care how great a craftsman someone is, I don't want one person building me a house by himself. Life is too short for such nonsense. Besides, from what I have seen, this game doesn't come anywhere near delivering what it promised it would. I hate to break it to the developer, but he is not a great craftsman, and this game is begining to border on being a scam. If this were something that no one but a great visionary could achieve, I could at least understand going it alone, but it doesn't look like the vision is much more than an occoasional passing interest on the part of the developer. I for one think refunds need to be issued to all who purchased the game. At this rate, the developer, and the rest of us, will be dead from old age before the game is completed.  Or better yet, try to sell the idea to a company who can get it finished. Either way, it is clear this game is taking to long to develop. By the time it gets anywhere, technology will have changed so much that it will look siilly and cartoonish. Of course it already looks silly and cartoonish.			"

Early Access Review
								Admittedly I only played about an hour of the game, but hear me out.Kenshi's early game is extremely painful. I understand the game is supposed to be bleak and hopeless, and it's post apocalyptic, but the early game is boring and long. Every guide I've found to this game revolves around one theme: ""DON'T GO FIGHT THINGS. LITERALLY ANY ENEMY IN THE GAME CAN KILL YOU 1v1."" I gave it a shot though, and died horribly. Then I played the way the game told me to: Wait for a patrol, tag along, find lewt, sell lewt, buy better gear. It was half an hour for the patrol to finish on the fastest speed, and I had a slightly (.1 better damage) better sword, and half of the requisite money needed to hire a new guard. Enemies are hard to find, the map is difficult to navigate, and the early game is uneventful. Eventually I'll give this game more time, but honestly it doesn't catch me as early as a game should. I'm not super motivated to find more content. I hear the game is ""Deep"", and that the crafting is rich, and you can build your own town. Just how much of the boring roaming through featureless monotonous landscape hoping to find corpses do I have to endure before I get to the fun stuff? If you want a squad based game, I hear good things about Banner Saga. If you want strategy, look at Starcraft II, or Novus Aeterno on the horizon. So near as I can tell, this game isn't worth the twenty dollars.			"

The camera is the most annoying part, since it neither follows nor travels particularly well, and the mouse implementation can be very confusing.  The set up is not bad, but I would vary the textures a bit more and add considerably more content before I put it out, even as Early access.Congrats on a lovely idea, and getting this far, but as far as buying it is concerned I would wait for another six to twelve months.OH, and please deal with the UI it is really small and hard to read due to colour.Good luck			"

								Well, people, don't buy the game.I like the game and if you think that paying about 20 something euros or dollars or whatever currency you have for playing about 50-100 hours or maybe some more is worth it then go ahead and buy it.BUT. The game crashes all the time, the pathfinding is terrible  especially with those walls. You really can't just enclose a place with walls and expect to be safe inside. Most things will find a way to get in somehow.And finally, I bought this game some years ago with the expectation and the promise that it would be finished a year or max 2 years later.Well, that didn't work out so well for the devs now did it.So, seeing as it will never be finished and that it can get annoying as ....

								Still waiting for a game in this somewhere. It's not a bad program, as it stands - looks kinda cool, the dudes can do interesting things in a potentially interesting setting. Just, beneath the desert garb there's a skinny undernourished engine.The sum of all there is to do, aside from (alpha level, and expected) crash, glitch, bug and loading, is run around a bland, have my group perform a ninja dance and run on to the next dance performance with limps and loot, hopefully with the shoddy path-finding not dropping someone from the running.Trade? Minimal, and tiny profits, with a static supply/demand - this town will always be a place to stock up on armour plates cheaply, and offload steel bars at a profit .City building? Dull slog, with little to do aside from wait for more resources to be mined. Exploration? Empty desert, becomes empty swamp, becomes empty grasslands.IMO, combat the area that Kenshi is pretty good at making visually appealing (even if combat is largely moving towards the enemy, and letting a hands off free-for-all happen) is a means to an end - to produce opportunities and increase what I can do in the game. Being able to take on tougher groups of bandits just makes the ninja dance more difficult, not more interesting. A tough group can take on a town, and receive little opportunity or satisfaction.There's a lot of promise in the game, there's a lot of interesting things that need some work to become engaging. But there's not a game worth playing. Yet. So, I see why people are burnt/have been burnt out by Early Access, because even when the game is finished in however long, I've played the demo and rarely enjoyed it.Refund? No way. Well worth the price of it on sale, or for someone absolutely okay with a gamble on it clicking with them, despite the flaws mentioned. But with the reason of  'supporting the developer' or expecting to play an enjoyable, engaging game? Best find something else.			"

								Save your money. There is absolutely no gameplay in this game. Combat is right clicking, sitting back and watching, there is no challenge or skill, just grind.It's advertised like a samurai mount&blade with base building. What it really is, is a barrel landscape with nothing to do.99% of the map is a barren mountainous desert with no features besides towns you can visit. You start out with a weak guy, and then you decide what to do from there. Maybe appropriate for people that play D&D or minecraft, happy to pay money for a blank slate for you to paint your own picture. But if you've paid to be entertained, you would get more value out of a chocolate bar.I promised myself never to buy into alpha games, after getting ripped off buying towns, now I remember why. This game is the next abandonware project I've mistakenly paid into thanks to an impulse frontpage 40% off sale.			"

								Ugly as sin. Buggy with many crashes. The control system is not intuitive. It seems like you spend 97% of the game clicking the right mouse button. You need to search the internet for help with figuring out the most basic things. It feels like the game's developers had never actually played a computer game made since the year 2000 or seen a modern user interface.I suspect that if you are willing to fight your way through it is probably an interesting building / squad game. Frankly I just don't have the time to go back to the old days of gaming where figuring out how to play the game was half the battle. If you want to play this game be prepared to put in 100 hours.

								Had this before it came to Steam - was buggy then, and buggy now.  There is a lot to like about this title, especially some of the ideas being implemented, but after several years of dev time, seeing how difficult it is just to do basic things, it simply isn't reassuring:Just entering buildings can be hit or miss - the interiors won't load sometimes and once that happens, you'll have to reload the save/game just to get it to function right again.Mining - well, this may not be a simulation, but in real life a person can swing a pickaxe about three times in the amount of time it takes for one swing in this game.Crafting - why have crafting when you can't gather basic resources - I can mine iron right from the get-go, but can't gather any other resources...?!?The map - why advertise a huge map only to find that most of it isn't accessible - not sure if it is unlocked in the experimental branch, but the game is already experimental to begin with (EA).Optimization - not just loading lag, but pretty much every other type of lag there is too.I'll put it on the back burner once again, pull it out in another year or so, and see what the progress is.  I'd like to see some real progress on it and hope people support it, but I can't actually recommend it right now.			"

								This is proof that early access needs regulation. In the several years since I paid for this game, updates have change very little beyond textures, crafting mechanics, or bugfixing . I won't claim to know what the devs intentions are, or what the hell has them too busy, but the point is that Steam shouldn't allow projects like this to be sold on their market. It's a dying and wheezing animal, and theyre never going to finish it. The two things you see most people bring up are that it's in alpha ( as if that were an excuse), or that it has some great potential. Both of these statements mask what people are really feeling. Buyer's RemorseIf I ever meet Gabe Newell, I will motorboat him until he shuts this project down.			"

								I do not recommend anyone buy this game as it is now. I will say the concept of the game is great but I see little action going in manifesting these concepts into a great game. UPDATESIts been half a year now since there was an actual update. April 14th was the last true update there was one or two more that are in the experimental version only, but the game has so many bugs in the ""stable version"" that I would be hard pressed to attempt to play it any other way. I dont believe another update will ever come, but when they do they are normally small and feel much more like a fix patch than an actual update. My belief is that this game is going to go down the road of many starter games and the developer will stop altogether and move on. You may feel you got your money worth, but personally I expect more from a developer. I will say just recently the developer talked of some plans, but being that I have seen nothing since April come from these plans makes it nothing more than talk. In summary, if you like the concept and think it will eventually pan out then pull the trigger. However before you do, ensure your ready to wait a very long time before its completed.			"

								I bought the game not that long ago and I'm getting fatal crashes every 10 minutes or so and I've tried all of the tips that everyone has said in all of the forums. It is a huge pain, but it's the only thing stopping me from telling everyone I know about how awesome Kenshi is. On that note, the game is still in alpha and I understand that I should expect some glitches or bugs, but for the money I spent on the game, I would expect at least some more support on solving this issue as the content of the game is quite sound and there's more than enough to keep up tied over until the developers fix the fatal crashes.At it's current stage (APLHA) this is my review;Audio: 7/10 - Ambient sounds are good, with the wind speed increasing when you increase game speed.Visual: 6/10 - For what the game is and how well it ran on my machine, the graphic content was sound. There are a few bugs and randomly whilst running your path may take you through a rock throwing you up into the sky.Content 8/10 - The content is great, there is enough in the game to have me spend hundreds of hours playing it. The dev's are focusing a lot of their time on new conent however this is a problem as per my gameplay review.Gameplay 3/10 - The problem exists with the majority of players that the game crashes between 2 minutes of game play through to 1 hour before it's inevitable fatal crash. This is the only problem that I have found with the game, as there are new concepts of AI and strategy bringing a very fresh new idea into the market.Replayability: 8/10 - Even with the game crashing every 10 minutes and without saving your progress you may have just wasted a lot of time, I have found myself putting more and more time into the game only to be pleased with the accomplishments (and a little let down by the crashes).So we have this amazing game right here, with fantastic content and new ideas but the major fatal crashes every few minutes is a huge problem. The game is in alpha, and if you are to purchase the game, keep that in mind. The dev's need to focus more on fixing the issues that are stopping the people from playing their game before moving onto making new content, at this stage, it's like the worlds best coffee being poured into a broken mug. You're unable to enjoy the coffee because the mug needs to be repaired.Final verdict: Kenshi is an amazing game with some brilliant ideas. I can see this game being played by all different types of gamers and possibly bringing in people don't generally play games. The only problem with buying it now, is that it crashes constantly and reducing your quality of game time. At this stage, I'm not going to recommend buying it for the simple fact that it is marginally unplayable. Once this is corrected or the final version is released, you'd be stupid not to buy it, just hold off for now :)			"

								English/Italian review:(First of all, look to other reviewers time played, thinks about it, kenshi is a game you can play max from 5 to 40 hours before you close it and wait for an update)After months and months of waiting, even if the game idea was great, the programmers aren't so great, they aren't able to program the game and this can be confirmed from last update where the game was downgraded with more bugs and crash than the old version even the experimental one. The problem about this game ""for me"" are the laziness of the devs, they work on the game not so much and at losing time and even they haven't the competence to concretize this project who will fail for sure after all this time. I suggest to not buy the game now if you don't like to trash your cash, the only things work good in the game are the bugs and the crashes, even the complaints on the forum community as this one(review) aren't well accepted and can be resolved in a permanent life ban from kenshi community as the one i recived.Dopo mesi e mesi di attesa, nonostante l'idea di gioco è ottima, i programmatori non lo sono altrettanto, non sono capaci a programmare e questo si può constatare che l'unico update rilasciato dopo più di mezzo anno, ha solo peggiorato il gioco rendendolo ancora più instabile di quanto gia lo fosse. Il problema di questo gioco è che i devs a mio avviso personale sono pigri, ci lavorano poco e a tempo perso e in più non hanno le capacità per concretizzare un progetto che ormai dopo tutto questo tempo sta ovviamente fallendo. Sconsiglio vivamente di comprarlo per ora, sarebbero soldi buttati via in quanto l'unica cosa a funzionare bene nel gioco sono i bug con i crash e le lamentele in forum non sono ben accette e può accadere che, dicendo o esprimendo pensieri come questo che ho appena espresso ci si può guadagnare solamente un ban a vita dalla community di steam.Edit: After 2 years.... the game is more buggy, lost 32bit support, continue crash, more bugs are added with new (1/8) map.I start play again 2 days ago(experimental) and now, new bugs was released with a patch who make my game wasted, all builded things disapered on load game. As for 2 years ago, the game seems to be convulted and not evolved. Sigh! Ah, and im yet banned from steam kenshi discussion for the 2 years ago ""ironic example of no sense answer"" given to one fanboy who provoke me. So i think the moderator here ban all those who make complain about kenshi to make the board open only to the fans and not to the ""customers"".----*UPDATE*Game became updated more often, pheraps i start changing my mind if the things continue to evolve this way.

								I've really enjoyed playing this game, I like the concept and style it has. I've had a lot of fun building up a squad, taking on some bandits, carrying half my unconsious squad back to safety and building a small town. The problem is that the game has very little polish, you will run into bugs (including crashes) and incomplete features often. Its clear that the development process is more like rolling a snowball than working through a feature list.I'm sure the final version of this game would be great, and have a lot of replay value. I doubt that I'll ever play it, because I don't think this game will ever be finished. I love supporting start-up games, but in my opinion this game is abusing the trust of it's supporters.I would not recommend this game because of the very infrequent updates, long development time and no timeline for a final release even after years of development. Its a great idea for a game, but how could I recommend it when it's been in this state for so long with no indication it will ever be finished?			"

								I just cannot in good faith recommend putting down any money on what, essentially, feels like someone's experiment/learning experience in game development. There are some nice ideas for sure, but the development cycle is slow, the basic functions are horribly clunky, and it neither feels indie nor professional - just bad.			"

								Whilst I truly want this game to reach its potential, I cannot recommend it in the current state. There is a problem that makes Kenshi unplayable for me, and from what I've seen others as well, and that is no bandits spawning and cities having no population, and not even appearing on the map. With trade and combat effectively removed, there is nothing else.			"

								I tried. But.. Unresponsive followers, lifeless boring towns, unintelligable stat systems, and shattered hope is all that you'll find here. 1. I would say diversify your map, but at this point it'd be better to just slice it in half and add the extra land mass later on. 2. Overhaul every aspect of combat, save animations. Combat is fun to watch, but 9 times out of 10 you will lose. Also, if your last person conks over, just give us that new game option immediately.3. Remove the gunky character creation system; it is a novel idea, but you are rarely zoomed in enough to care what your zerglings look like. 4. Make the x2 building and resource gathering settings the default. Waiting simulators are fun and all, but no.You either wait for a long time, and hope you can get something started, or you travel around like an ambulance chaser, shamefully following overpowered protectors as they aimlessly search the empty desert. I'll keep trying, but this game looks exactly the same as the day I bought it. Did they post anything about giving up on this game, or something?			"

								I have had this game for 3 years and I keep hoping they will un♥♥♥♥ it. but as of yet they still have not.  Let me give you a rundown of how the gameplay goes for the freedom seekers for example.  you start out with a group of settlers with the supplys to start your own settlement.  you venture out into a mars like desert and are quickly attacked by bandits. they kill everyone in your group. if you are lucky enough to have someone regain consousness they are unable to help the others without beds to put them in. being as you were slaughtered moments after leaving town you have no beds or a settelment for your people to heal in. game over. Ive started 15+ games  in the last 3 years and the same thing happens EVERY time!!!! you cant even take a lone bandit with your entire crew. this game is so unbalenced it is unplayable. unless you enjoy starting over and over again to watch how worthless the gameplay is.

								The game is currently unplayable in its current state. Streamers with high end computers have stopped doing videos on the game because they are getting 1 to 5 count frame rates, Excuses are made for the game telling players to use previous patches instead of the current one but the bottum line is this is still not a beta game but an Alpha game that is unplayable due to lack of optimization. If your thinking about buying this game, wait another 3 to 6 months and see if the developers can get their act together then.			"

								I'll just start off by stating my personal truth: I LIKE THIS GAME! I REALLY DO! But as for why I'm putting this as a Negative Post, read below.This game is something else! I mean that in a good way. I'm sure finally reaching my post anything I say you'll have already read, but the truth is the truth no matter how many times you hear it.My experience has shown me that this game is really not that bad, in fact I'll admit that its down right addicting (check the play time on some of the posts and alot of them are well into the triple digits ((mine's no different)) ). But I gotta be honest the number of minor glitches (which I gotta admit are relatively small in terms of quantity in my opinion) that are biting at this game are the biggest pain of all. I realise that the game is early release and all but I honestly think if the development team focused their COLLECTIVE attention on ironing out ONE OR TWO BUG(S) AT A TIME and improved the stability of the game rather then trying to broaden the gameplay by adding new 'creatures' or 'bigger, better walls' then Kenshi would become one of those games you'll start playing after breakfast (or during in my case) and then when you get up to go to the bathroom (because you've literally reached you're limit) you realise you've been playing for almost 18 hours straight. I can admit that my statement above may not actually be productive, but when you've reached the point that you've spent more time trying to actually BUILD the perimeter of your outpost rather than enjoying the other characteristics of Kenshi, you find you're self thinking about not playing the game for a few weeks in the hopes that these particular kinks get taken care of when you come back.I won't tell you not to buy the game, but I will warn you, if you buy this game you're in for a few headaches and more than a few bouts of frustration. I, like many of the other posts, will advise you to WAIT on purchasing Kenshi for the time being.At least until there are a few less posts (both positive and negative ones) that are warning you about the bugs and stability issues. If you still decide to buy Kenshi, I can only hope the developer's have ironed out a few more kinks then there are now while i'm writing this post.			"

								The game has quite a learning curve to get used to, and is currently single player only (for those curious). Basically when you first start out you can't kill anything, anything at all because your character is so weak. You can also recruit an infinite number of people into your facton or party which is basically how you start your own town and build your own army.The reason why I do not recommend this game, is that the controls feel quite clunky to me, and that this game is extremely time consuming. You need to devote A LOT of time and, most importantly, patience when playing this. I have devoted a lot of time to many other games, but Kenshi does not feel quite as enjoyable to me, and I dont get that feeling of satisfaction from accomplishing something because quite frankly, I neither have the patience nor the willingness to put in hours of work into this game.Notice how I haven't really put that much time into playing Kenshi. But by reading guides, looking at other reviews, and looking at the game mechanics myself, it was pretty easy to conclude that yes, this game is extremely time consuming.The game also seems to be a bit buggy, a lot of the time doors will not open or close, your character and/or party members clip through walls, and bandits (or people who just want to kill you) will literally follow you FOREVER until they are killed. And good luck killing ANYTHING at all. The only way to kill even a couple of wandering banidts is to find a friendly faction or run to a town and let the guards kill the bandits for you. But be careful, because if the town's faction is friendly to the group trying to kill you, the town guards will simply ignore them and watch as they slaughter you and your party.From reading other reviews from players that have put in much more time than i have (30+ hours), the game hasn't changed all that much. When Steam early access first started, I remember Kenshi as being one of the first games to join Early Access. Since then, very little updates have been made. Check out their changelog, it's a jumbled mess of adding insignificant content (more cities, more armor, etc) when there are other bugs/balance changes that should be addressed.This is simply my take on this game that i honestly haven't invested that much time into nor plan to. You certainly have the right to agree or disagree with my statements, or justify any crude remarks with ""Oh, you just haven't played the game enough"", or ""You're basing your reviews off of other's gameplay expirience rather than your own"". I just can't recommend this game to anyone.			"

								I downloaded Kenshi because it boasts an open world, a free roaming ""squad based"" game. Well, it is, BUT..What his game COULD be is amazing, sadly, the controls and camera ruined it. I spent my whole time moving around by right clicking too far off in the distance, losing my character, panning over a field to find him, only to find that I lost my dog.Well, you could double click their icons, but that separates you and if you double click your main hero, you're now separated from the group and it just feels clunky to find your way back.I didn't like how the camera was stuck, how you you are fixed at a certain crappy angle, and as you pan through the scale to find your team, you just fly through buildings and hills, and overall, it feels crowded and in my opinion, the camera/controls made it unbearable.I requested a refund, I felt it was THAT bad, and I'm typically a pretty forgiving person.I want to recommend this game, as everything else about it seems absolutely wonderful, but until they change the camera/control combination, I can't.

								So I start the game up, the character creation is cool and adds a lot of customization I spend some time making my character and finally have her they way I like. I spawn next to a house with two fields and two farmers and no tutorial or anything. I think to myself it's nice that they'll let me learn on my own and go in the house to look around, all I find is stuff I have the option to steal. I figure the farmers aren't really my friends because I have to steal to take stuff from the house. I went outside of the house and tried to cut down some trees, can't, go walking away a bit and find a bush which I want to interact with, can't, walk away a little farther away and find different trees to try and cut down, can't. I think to myself maybe I have to craft an axe but the crafting menu is empty... ok so I have to build something first maybe? I try to build a small shack but it requires 3 ""Building Material"". I go to look for something I can interact with to get building material, after wandering for like 5 minutes I find a rock I can mine, the magical pickaxe I can pull out of my♥♥♥♥♥appears and I mine the rock wondering the whole time why I can't cut a tree. I have some iron at this point and I figure ""This must be a building material."" I then try to build a shack again, can't. I realized that there is a tech research at this point for ""Building material"" but it requires I have a research bench which requires ""Building Material"" and must be placed in a small shack! I give up and look up a guide, you have to trade for ""Building Material"" this is the only way early game and I tried a few times to earn the money by mining rocks but they made me too heavy and bandits or animals would kill me everytime. The only way to really start the game is to aggro a bandit group and drag them into a town so gaurds fight them.This game lacks any direction, has no real goals, is beyond confusing to start, and extremely slow. I would highly advise NOT to buy this game.			"

								Kenshi would be a fun game if there were actually guides or something to help you find a direction to get started. Unfortunately the only way people suggest you start out is by luring bandits to towns, and looting whatever the guards kill, even the devs themselves suggest doing this. The problem with this is that it is not creative and not immersive. When guards kill something and you loot it and that's literally the ONLY way to make money from the start, it really is unrewarding and limiting. That alone should tell you that there are very few aveneus to take when it comes to starting out and making money. There are no jobs, no other skills you can use to make money like crafting, or anything like that. No, you can only do one thing at the start, that's it, and it's not even realistic or rewarding. I have had this game for years and have come back to it a handful of times to see if it has gotten any better, unfortunately it has not gotten better.			"

Early Access Review
								EDIT:The game is playable. It's buggy but playable. It's interesting for a while and then you start to wish it was finished. The time between updates is long and hasn't added anything of significance that would let me launch the game again. Would I recommend you buying the game? I'd go for not really, waging more towards the no, due to me not really having faith in the game ever reaching a state that does homage to the idea.Kudo's to the solo developer whom develops everything in this game apart from the audio, but I'm thinking it's another 3 years before this game is finished, and it is clear to me that the developer took on more than what he can deliver within a realistic timespan.

Early Access Review
								The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 18, 1812 to February 18, 1815, fought by the United States of America against Great Britain, its North American colonies, and its North American Indian allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but Europeans sometimes see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars, as it was caused by issues related to that war (especially the Continental System). By the war's end in early 1815 the key issues had been resolved and peace came with no boundary changes.The United States declared war for several reasons, including trade restrictions brought about by the British war with France, the impressment of as many as 10,000 American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy,[5] British support for Native American tribes fighting American settlers on the frontier, outrage over insults to national honor during the Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, and possible American interest in annexing British territory.[6] The primary British war goal was to defend their North American colonies, although they also hoped to set up a neutral Indian buffer state in the Midwest.The war was fought in three theatres. First, at sea, warships and privateers of each side attacked the other's merchant ships, while the British blockaded the Atlantic coast of the United States and mounted large raids in the later stages of the war. Second, land and naval battles were fought on the U.S.–Canadian frontier. Third, large-scale battles were fought in the Southern United States and Gulf Coast. At the end of the war, both sides signed and ratified the Treaty of Ghent and, in accordance with the treaty, returned occupied land, prisoners of war and captured ships (though neither side returned the other's warships due to frequent re-commissioning upon capture) to its pre-war owner and resumed friendly trade relations without restriction.With the majority of its land and naval forces tied down in Europe fighting the Napoleonic Wars, the British used a predominantly defensive strategy in the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada. Early victories over poorly-led U.S. armies, such as in the Battle of Queenston Heights, demonstrated that the conquest of the Canadas would prove more difficult than anticipated. Despite this, the U.S. was able to inflict serious defeats on Britain's Native American allies, ending the prospect of an Indian confederacy and an independent Native American state in the Midwest under British sponsorship. U.S. forces were also able to make several gains and score victories on the Canadian frontier; taking control of Lake Erie in 1813, seizing western parts of Upper Canada. However, a large-scale U.S. attempt to capture Montreal was repulsed in November 1813. Despite the major U.S. victory at Chippawa on July 5, 1814, serious U.S. attempts to fully conquer Upper Canada were ultimately abandoned following the bloody Battle of Lundy's Lane on July 25, 1814. The U.S. then fell back roughly 30 km (19 mi) from Lundy's Lane to Fort Erie, where they withstood a siege for several months. The British eventually withdrew, but as winter set in, the Americans demolished the fort and fell back across the Niagara.In April 1814, with the defeat of Napoleon, the British adopted a more aggressive strategy, sending larger invasion armies and tightening their naval blockade. However, with the end of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, both governments were eager for a return to normality and peace negotiations began in Ghent in August 1814. In the Deep South, General Andrew Jackson destroyed the military strength of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. In September 1814, the British won the Battle of Hampden, allowing them to occupy eastern Maine, and the British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg in August 1814 allowed them to capture and burn Washington, D.C. They were repulsed, however, in an attempt to take Baltimore and Fort Bowyer, and during their assault at Fayal. An American victory in September 1814 at the Battle of Plattsburgh repulsed the British invasions of New York, which, along with pressure from merchants on the British government, prompted British diplomats to drop their demands at Ghent for an independent native buffer state and territorial claims that London previously sought. Given that it took six weeks for ships to cross the Atlantic, news of the peace treaty did not arrive before the British suffered a major defeat at New Orleans in January 1815.[7]In the United States, late victories over invading British armies at the battles of Plattsburg, Baltimore (inspiring the United States national anthem, ""The Star-Spangled Banner"") and New Orleans produced a sense of euphoria over a ""second war of independence"" against Britain.[8][9] The war ended on a high note for Americans, winning the final engagements of the war and bringing an ""Era of Good Feelings"" in which partisan animosity nearly vanished in the face of strengthened American nationalism. The war was also a major turning point in the development of the U.S. military. The poor performance of several U.S. militia units, particularly during the 1812–13 invasions of Canada and the 1814 defence of Washington, convinced the U.S. government of the need to move away from its Revolutionary-era reliance on militia and focus on creating a more professional regular force. Spain was involved in fighting in Florida but was not an official belligerent; some Spanish forces fought alongside the British during the Occupation of Pensacola. The U.S. took permanent ownership of Spain's Mobile District.In Upper and Lower Canada, British and local Canadian militia victories over invading U.S. armies became iconic and promoted the development of a distinct Canadian identity, which included strong loyalty to Britain. Today, particularly in Ontario, memory of the war retains its significance, because the defeat of the invasions ensured that the Canadas would remain part of the British Empire, rather than be annexed by the United States. In Canada, numerous ceremonies took place in 2012 to commemorate the war, offer historical lessons and celebrate 200 years of peace across the border.[10] The conflict has not been commemorated on nearly the same level in the modern-day United States, though it is still taught as an important part of early American history,[11] and Dolley Madison's and Andrew Jackson's respective roles in the war are especially emphasized.[12][13] The war is scarcely remembered in Britain, being heavily overshadowed by the much larger Napoleonic Wars occurring in Europe.

Early Access Review
								Update: 08/04/2017Wait until the release!The game gets pached on regular basis. The patches may not campatible with save game. There is option to import your save, but it is bugged (at least for me), where I lost my progress (e.g research even tho I ticked transfer research box)).Old review:-------------------------Kenshi is a brilliant idea with poor execution.The main reason I am leaving negative review is the game performance and bugs. I will get back to this later.Kenshi is an open world, RPG, city builder, squad manager, craft and survival with great mod support. I wish there were more games of this genre (RPG city builder, minus the survival). It would bring some higher standards and higher quality of the games of that genre.The first things first. Loading time is veeeery loooong (bad).The game has a number of different scenario starts (good). Character customisation is acceptable, there are a few classes available (ok).The first few moments in game were tedious, I was grinding my time just to eat and survive, even tho I used the lowest hunger settings. Then I discovered mods. So, I used no hunger mod, which would eventually introduce a bug when you find a hungry NPC that you want to recruit into your squad. After the hunger was sorted, I started grinding stuff for money and research accompanied by poor performance. I recruited a few squad members and started grinding stuff for more research and I eventually started building my outpost (city). Unfortunately, my attempt to grow or produce anything would be ruined by either hungry beasts or bandits. OK, I managed beasts and bandits well, but then a faction that was non hostile to me attacked me. All this was accompanied by a poor performance.If your outpost or squad members get attacked, there is no pause / notification and if you are in fast forward time mode, you are screwed. But hey, you can always reload your last save... that would take forever to load.Uh...Aesthetically, the game is not that appealing. The game world reminds me of Morrowind (that was the Year of 2002).Please do not get me wrong, there are so many things to do in the game that are fun (exploring, looting, fighting), but they are accompanied by poor performance and bugs.I really feel bad for discrediting the developers, because they put a lot of effort into this game. Maybe if they fix performance, I will be back.Did I mention poor performance and bugs?Maybe the fact that the game has been developed since 2009?Specsi7-4710HQ16 GB RAMGTX-980M			"

								Epic disappointment. I wandered the wasteland for an hour before I found anybody. And when I finally did encounter some bandits, there were 15 of them. THIS is the reason the Steam community has so many hours invested into this game. Not because it's fun, but because it takes forever to do anything.			"

								I'm sure if you have the time to put many many hours into this game then its great. From what i experinced in the short time i played, was bad camera movement and just a lack of any clue of what to do. Perhaps my copy was just bugged but the lack of tutorial that i got made the game almost unplayable and thus ended up spending a good days worth of just trying to find good guides and video tutorials and dont even get me started on the clunky and crowded UI. I fully suggest waiting till this game is fully released before trying it. However if you enjoy the exprimenting aspect of trying to find out what the hell to do then you will enjoy it! The idea of the game is great, It's just not pulled off in such a great way. "

Now i am banned on oficial forum and developers try to cenzored my opinion and story on steam too. I was banned since I started criticizing the slow and illogical development. I was banned for evaluating the game I'm talking about here (it was banned many other critics)DONT TRUST TO DEVELOPERS:dont believe for progression update:All updates which they are adding to the game are only cosmetic changes. Important bugs which make the game unplayable (path finding, stuck NPC, disordered structures (stuck npc During production) and still doesnt removed and doesnt fixed, these bugs were in alpha which started few years ago and still exist in the game. = ZERO PROGRESSION, JUST COSMETIC CHANGES AND STRONG WORDS BY DEVELOPER ABOUT FUTURE PROGRESS... Do not believe what the graphic looks on pictures and arts:I have GTX 970 and the graphic is really bad and ugly!! Nothing change. But go on oficial website you will se perfect graphic, but its lie!Dont believe to promises:They many times said: game crash fixed(UNTRUTH), memory leaks fixed(UNTRUTH), performance improvments(UNTRUTH), UPDATES COMING(UNTRUTH = NEW BUGS COMING).THE GAME IS AT THE SAME STAGE AS FOUR YEARS AGO << TOTALY EPIC TRUTH! NOTHING CHANGES just adding useless updates which never fixed bugs > THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE. QUOTATIONS FROM OTHERS OBJECTIVE REVIEWS: "" I have only had it for the last year or so, and must say little work has been done in that time. Sure, a patch comes up every month or two, but only to add a new useless model, or a non working one. Something trivial that really adds too little to this beautiful broken sandbox.

""Flappy""""This is an alpha game that CAN be fun if you ignore all of it's flaws and are dedicated. But my impression after testing it off and on for about two years it has changed very little since I first played it. More towns have been added. The character textures/models have changed as well as the clothing, stuff like that. But in terms of pure content addition, this is a game that has made absurdly slow unnaceptable progress. It's directionless. This is a game on steam. Why? It obviously makes money. So where is the money going? It sure isn't making true progress.""                                                                                                              ""Saphirum""and more, more others....			"

								Bort this game 2 years ago and I enjoyed it more then. It had bugs but it was enjoyable to play. I was able to survice long enough to start and maintain a health community that could survive a bandit attack. So after not playing for 2 years, I thought that would be enough time for the game to be finished. However in all that time the new features added are so broken that the game is unplayable (if fun is the goal). Lately gameplay is start new game, first town guard that sees me attacks me. Why? See a fight go to it to see if you can loot some dead body. What now it is stealing to loot a corpse it you didn't attack. In the early game looting corpses is the may occupation, however just standing near a fight will cause the guards to attack you. Why? my weapon is not drawn. This is all in the first town in the first 10 mins. Talk to someone town guard attacks you. Be a multi racial group town guards attack you. If you manage to get past the town guard and find a bandit, hopefully you don't starve to death first. Now bandit are rare thing to find. 2 years ago there was a bandit attack every 10 mins. Kill the bandit loot his corpse. Finally I have something to cover my naked chest. Go to town to sell loot. Town guard see me and kills me. I guess because I was wearing the bandits clothing I was a bandit. Makes no sense in any RPG game out there.There seem to be a complicated system for factions that is broken. As I said 2 years ago I thought that if they fixed the bugs and finished the crafting trees. All the game needed was some direction. There are no quest marker or any aid as where to go. There is not even a quest system. So if you get a quest go to the temple, that is it. No more info as to where this temple is. Needless to say I never found the temple. Even after running into every building in the town. A simple marker on the map and a icon above the build. How difficult would that be compared to trying to fix broken systems like slavery, factions etc. At this point that would be to much to ask for. I would be happy if I could play the game without getting attacked by the town guard for no apparent reason and at least know why in the starting town am I attacked on sight.This game had massive potential but I don't think the devs have the skills needed to manifest that potential. In 2 years the game is more broken than what it was. That is why I give this a thumbs down.			"

								The next is from my first around 5-10 minutes of attempting to play this game. Spoiler alert - after such initial reactions I doubt I'll play this before it stops being Earyl Access and since it was in development for like 2+ years and still... well... these. I doubt it'll ever will. I'm sorry developers, but if you make game about Japan or something with honor - you kinda has to have something similar yourself.1. My name (Alexander) doesn't fit into damn name box under character portrait2. His head doesn't fit into hairs and goes through them3. It just... crashed when I first go to character creation4. Hint for hold middle mouse to rotate camera doesn't work5. When it first starts - that area in launcer which looks like big text box... I thought it's text box. Apparently it's options. U click on a line and can change option. Very intuitive.6. By default it's not full screen and u can't scroll to full screen options in settings7. In windowed default mode main menu buttons just... drops somewhere to the right...8. There are no < or > texts on buttons on character selection...9. Apparently this was in development for around 2+ years (as of 2/3/2014)I just... what the hell did I pay for... as of February 3rd this game doesn't worth a single dollar.			"

								This is a good game, however the moderators and the devs need a reality check. In other words they want your money and not a comment on how to make the game better.After submitting even more bugs and getting told that this is the way the game is going to be, and they are not going to fix that as it is what the way they want it. I am again inclined to state that the devs only want your money and to shut the hell up!Bugs found, include but are not limited to:Characters litereally being chased across the map.. exploit. Needs fixed.Not knowing what buildings to and not to walk into as only half have signs up that indicate a vendor or non-faction usuable area. Exploitable...Terrain issues, including but not limited to : Misplaced rocks/ores Pathing breakage due to above.Roaming horeds above 20 characters in a group (LAZY PROGRAMMING HERE) to fix simply do (set initial group size 5 + (random (1-25) ) ) but they are too lazy to do this they just want your money.There are several more however the moderators and devs just dont care that there are issues with thier game that would make the game exceptional instead of just fair. Dont buy save your money.8-2-16Again I have attempted to play this game and again i notice these VERY same glitches and not impimented or broken mechanics. They are pandering to the public modding communty way too much and this is not only making the game Fecal matter, but is bogging the game down. have to stick w the same Dont buy ...			"

								Please remember this is early access.Right now the game is poor at best. The optimization is really bad. I have a high end machine and the frame rate is just terrible even with the settings turned down.Gameplay is in my opinion the worst part of the game. Starting out, your weak, poor, and frankly, you cant do anything about it. If you read disscussions on starting tips, youll find everyone says to hang around cities and let guards kill bad guys and then loot the dead. This is great advice as you are completely unable to do any fighting yourself and survive. So the game from the begenning is based on you playing a weakling coward who scavenges the leavings of other fighters. This just doesnt sit good with me. I would rather grind or do fetch quests to raise skill enough to do my own fighting. I find it insulting that a developer would make the game this way. No reccomendation untill they actually make a game instead of a buzzard simulator.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is probably the single worst entertainment purchase I have ever made and I saw Crossroads - the Britney Spears movie in theaters. I bought it during the early access craze based on it's potential 2 years ago. I bought Kerbal Space Program around the same time. KSP had its issues, but clearly had changes being made and steadily got better and has reached full release. Every so often I popped in this game and tried to play thinking it would be better in any way and it simply wasn't. I saw reviews stating essentially that you have to get 3-5 hours in before my complaints with the game are no longer valid (boring world, looks like garbage, clunky interface, shattered hopes and dreams) and while that may be true, it seems like Stockholm Syndrome to me. The fact that this game has been in ""Alpha"" since 2009 is just more proof that it shouldn't even be for sale.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game until it gets a full release. Don't be fooled by people who put in a ton of time and tell you it is great as long as you get over X, Y, and Z- it is just justification for wasting their own time and money. This is an incomplete, likely never to be complete, dumpster fire of a game. Value yourself and your time more - don't buy this game. I expect that this ""game"" will be a fully playable and complete game for its value around the time of the heat death of the universe.			"

								A lot of promise, but so little in execution.  Find a group and give the command to attack and hope for the best.   Finding a target is hard enough with the zoom being so restrictive. Its overly repeatative for the large expanse it covers.  Days can be had just exploring it all if your willing to deal with the constant loading and resetting of the game speed.  I'll give it a try a year from now, as it stands now I would not reccomend it due to the fact the amount of disapointment this game has generated will not fit in my inventory.			"

								Well...here's my 38 minute review:Had fun creating my character, jumped into the world (literally: my dude was floating in the beyond realm for 20 seconds before I hit the ground) surroundings looked lackluster (i know, it's in alpha status, graphics dont matter) but it was also extremely empty and interactions with my surrounding were limited. I went to pan the camera and the game dropped to single-digit FPS. Since movement is point n click, I went to click my way up a hill/up some steps into a house and my character kept running around until it got stuck on the steps.Then I took a deep breath, and got a refund.TL;DR: Left a bad first impression, hella buggy, rather buy a pepperoni pizza.

								Potentially interesting at release, but virtually unplayable as a game (even one in alpha) at this time. Its more a collection of cool features/tools than a coherent game.  The customization options avalible in game are nice, as well as construction is quite realistic (you have to carry heavy stone to build a building, potentially for miles). Combat is frustrating, even with the ability to pause at any point and change camera angles. But, the nail in the coffin is lack of instuctions on how to use some of the things that are implemented. Need to give it a few more months, unless your really into the development part of Early Access Games.			"

								I regret buying this game. This really burned me. I thought the concept was really amazing, I thought the graphics were decent for what we were looking at in terms of supposed game play. Let me tell you now why I would never recommend this game or ever suggest buying it.1. It is unplayable. Truly it is. It is so bad, incredibly glitchy, and it is insanely hard. There is no objective so you are left to wander about with nothing to do, you literally just try to survive. Which is damn near impossible. EVERY faction will hate you, and you cannot join a faction to gain allies.2. The build system is a joke. Like honestly I have nothing good to say about it. You will not survive long enough to dig far enough into. Once you reach a certain point a wandering group of 30ish bandits will just wander around your camp and kill everything. 3. There is no gameplay. There is no point like I said before, but needs to be said again. Like its just survive, which is cool in all, and it WOULD be fulfilling if it were not for the fact there is ZERO NPC or story interaction.In a nutshell I would desribe this game in the following way: basically it is a kid playing in a sand box, byhimself, with zero imagnination. You are alone, by yourself with nothing to do, you got two plastic army men and thats it. Oh and it is raining and squirlles are terrorizing you.  "

								The description of the game excited me. I found the execution of the game (at time of writing) did not meet with the excitement and expectation. The controls are very awkward. There is little indication in the game world of what you are supposed to do.When mining an iron resource, my character was actually severl in-game feet away from the rock. His pickaxe was actually digging into turf. After several minutes of mining the turf, there was nothing in my inventory.My character had a hunger attribute. None of my activities seemed reduce it (this may be an unfinished feature). My starting point was near some domestic beasts, but my character was not able to do anything with them.After running around the game world for about 20 minutes, trying different things, and getting lost, I refunded the game. That was a disappointment to me. Maybe as the game progresses in development I'll pick it up again.			"

								Really bad. It has really big ambitions but upon doing some research, its like 1 guy trying to do all of this. He might be able to, but Im not subscribing to a 10yr EA (well, I already have). But that was 2014, a year which showed (and burned) a lot of consumers that EA is full of mainly garbage and here's why:Most of these EA games have H U G E ambitious goals. You read them and totally want to get on board. Dont. Research first, everything. Most of the EAs have to do so because they lackfunds (or manpower) to get the project done in any real / acceptable timeframe, so no real publisher is going to pick them, cause they are not ready for primetime, so to speak.REMEMBER this before you sign up for any EA - this one being the 1st I ever bought, I actually believed all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in the game description.

								I did not really find this game fun. Early access game and to me rather boring. Updates to the stable branch are lacking. The game itself is rather just boring. (Edited again for the turd buckets)Edit... 53 or something...Trying the game again.... I figure enough time has passed once again... This time, I will give it at LEAST a full hour... IF I can even manage that long. The last time I played this game was SOOOO damn boring. We shall see...Final Edit... I tried. I really did. I wanted the game to be better. I wanted it to be more fun for me. To me, this game is just so boring it hurts. I am sure plenty of people find this game fun. It seems pretty well made. The concept even sounds interesting... Maybe its the seeming total lack of any story that kills it for me. I feel no grand purpose for being. Maybe that comes later on... but the game has so many directions... literally any direction so it seems to have NO real direction... if that makes any sense. Its almost like a pure sandbox game it seems in what you can become... it can be fun for some, but you really have to be into that kind of game. I am not...			"

This game got updated and you are confined to a small square on the f&ck1ng map!This GAME is not what it says it self to be. If you want to be restricted to one part of the map and when you try and leave a grid it reads ""Beta Error under construction"" And you can't adventure anywhere just stuck! Don't buy you will waste funds. Trust me I went throught this. Damn should have bught cossacks3 instead now I have to wait until next pay day. UGH! AGH! F@CK!Also loading it takes hours.

								i have high expectations for this game, i loved it from the beginning and its something i have been waiting for as far as the type of game. its not for everyone, the game is a big part in survival and strategy because of the elements the game has, such as being 3rd person voerview and all squad being able to die if you get in over your head as they can be incapacitated and bleed out if no one can offer medical attention to them in time, you sometimes have to pick your fights especially at first as you are weak and alone. the start is slow but once you get a good foundation the fun begins, you can build your own settlement from scratch and lead a smal squad of warriors/traders/craftsmen ora combination ofa ll 3 like me, if intetested i would say hit up youtube first to see gameplay, this game has HUGE potential and in its current state there are quite a few bugs but there are things the crator has but in to help with most that cause game play to suffer such as being about to rebuild the nav mesh after prolonged play has caused several npcs to wander off from there designated areas and if a world has become so FUBAR you can import your game and take all your squad and tech and even buildings (labled as buggy so i left it be and just decided to rebuild, heck more enginnering skill for me) to start fresh on a new game world without losing any training for research, BLACKBEARD if you read this please get in touch with me i would llove to assist with helping find bugs to help you prioritize the games development			"

								This game... Has the potentiel to be one of the best games of all time.  It is a lot of fun and hours will fly faster dollar bills at a strip club.  You will love Kenshi, but I wouldn't recommend getting in now in its current state.The only reason I say this is because it will torture you for waiting.You will play the game, and you will learn everything and thrive.  After awhile you'll realize that its all pointless.  It's all pointless because you will cap out early and everything willl go away whenever the next update comes out.  Because it's still in eary access.My problem is that you could create the greatest character, but it's pointless because it'll all be gone whenever the next update comes out.  Every update adds great rich content to the game; although, the game updates slower than dial-up.The game has been in developement for about three or so years I believe, and it will probably be at least another year before its completion.  I'm still technically recommending the game because I can't bring myself to actually not recommend it.  It truly is an amazing game that everyone should get.  If you've read this article hopefully you take this advice: wait till it officially releases to buy it, or if its on sale buy it and wait till its actual release or later builds.  It will save you many hours and heartache.			"

								I was kind of worried I might have bought the game and wasted 20 bucks on it, turns out to be really amazing once you get into it. It has its ups and downs, for example: some buildings are buggy, sometimes pathing isn't the best, some characters will stay stuck in a rock. But, since it is alpha state, I guess you can give it a little of a blind eye, the updates aren't as frequent, don't expect one every week or so. The game starts out slow, and is a really slow pace game, however, once you understand everything you will get so into it. For example: you will won't go into a bandit fight and hope to win, with just three characters with you, unless you plan how to distract some, and move around to flank. Maybe you want to be a loner, well, you start at the bottom and make your way to the top. Slowly, but surely, you will make it. Want to build the best town in the whole map? Go ahead, but prepare yourself for some random battles with the bandits. Want to be a merchant? Then you must travel the whole land to might the best prices to buy and then sell. The best thing about the game, is simply put, this is how you make your story. You aren't unique, just a regular guy. Good luck.			"

Mad MAX meets Samurai epic.Considering this is an alpha still, there is alot to do, I have only ever played 1 character and his followers but between base building, getting rich, training stats and skills and eventually assaulting NPC towns (Holy Nation was my target a while back) there is alot to do.I can see this being a game that appeals to a certain type of player, but those players will love it with a passion.

								What can i say that no one else can? It's an alpha so its buggy as al hel, the Dev is how can i put this? The dev is like a kid who wants something then tries it and realizes it takes a lot more effort than he thought. The idea behind this game is revolutionary, the mechanics and ai are astounding for an alpha, the content is huge for an alpha, The amount of smiles i have playing this game however, far exxceed the amount of crashes i have had or the amounf ot bugs i have encountered. The game is♥♥♥♥♥♥at its present stage, but that doesn't change the fact that its a bloody fun masterpiece. You have multiple ways to start this game giving you a potential of hundreds of hours of play, each way has its own stregnths and weaknesses such as a starting with more of a party but they focus on building. Or starting with a groud of seasoned fighters surrounded by enemies. NO matter what you pick the begginging of ane playthrough will be agonizing, you will feel as though you will not make it another day. But once you understand what it takes to survive this game is insanely rewarding, Building an entire village city or town and having it defeat waves of bandits is one of the most proud acchomplishemts i have discovered in the game. So what else can i say, it has tons of bugs and glitches that make the game frustrating but i think once the dev gets the bug fixes rolling this will become one of the finest games ever made.			"

								Kenshi, even in its early stage, provides an enjoyable experience for anyone wishing to explore a post-apocalyptic world in the form of an RTS/RPG mixture.With mechanics similar to the Dungeon Siege games, this squad-based strategy game allows you to control a large group all at once, or sticking with one character if you desire a more solo experience. What is interesting about this game is that it resembles the early Fallout games in its adventuring elements, while also providing a fun atmosphere for building a town from scratch. You can either loot fallen enemies (or friendlies heh heh) and sell their gear to a merchant, or keep it for yourself if it is better than what you currently have. You can gather materials to build a settlement, or buy goods from one town to sell for a higher profit in another.The wasteland at this point in the development is comprised of roving groups of bandits, patrolling troops from the larger towns, and emptiness. The landscapes are desolate, a theme often attributed to the post-apocalyptic genre. The towns provide safe havens from bandits and cannibals, but those players who are more adventurous have the option to strike out on their own, find a suitable site, and build their own town. If you do create a town, beware, you will be attacked by bandits! Something that is both challenging and engaging about this game is the combat system. Much like games such as Mount&Blade, your characters improve with experience. The more they fight, the better fighters they will be. This adds a nice feeling of realism to the game that guarantees that your characters won't be ""special"" with ridiculous skills, and actually work to improve their abilities over time. The characters are also customizable, which is nice for those of us who are picky about appearances and cosmetics.However, there are still some drawbacks as it is still only in the alpha stage. Characters often glitch (I had a character glitch onto a wall that had no ramp, the only way I got him down was to command him to follow an npc who also somehow got up there), and the building parameters, while mostly freeform, can cause you a lot of frustration due to your characters being unable to reach certain locations. The game also crashes often, so you have to save consistently or you may lose your progress. What is nice is that the developers are often updating the game, so these problems will only improve with time while new elements are added to the game.Regardless, even with the occasional frustrations of the glitches, the gameplay is fun and the combined experience of the post-apocalyptic world with travelling, exploring, adventuring, trading, and building can easily draw you into an addicting (and satisfying) way to spend your time.

								There are so many good things I have to say about this game - so many in fact that I'm not going to bother listing them. All I'm going to say is that if you like strategy, customization, deep gameplay, end-of-world/survival scenarios, beautiful music, or just enjoy challenging games that don't hold your hand every step of the way, then kenshi is certainly a game for you. This game is so huge and has so much to it (with much more on the way) that it is a shining example of what every big game aspires to. The fact that it is still in developmentserves only to amaze me as I imagine what will come next. Even as I write this review the few complaints and issues I have for this game are being worked out and many of those have already been fixed. Updates are regular and comprehensive with the community enjoying contact with developmers in a way that only an indie can provide.In short this game is amazing with a huge amount of potential, and something I would definately recomend.Also the music is so good that I sometimes sit at the menu screen just to listen to hear it :D			"

								Kenshi, this game is a beautifull mess. That's the best way I can describe it. As much as it seems worth buying it also is not in its current state. I personally do not regret buying this game as I enjoyed my time and I look foward to the upcomming updates. Therefor I will recomend this game in its current state, but buy it at your own risk because only curtain types of players will be able to enjoy something as buggy and as content lacking as this.I would like people to know though that Kenshi has a lot of potential to become one of the best games of all time in the future, but that's what I think anyways...

								Where to start off with Kenshi, I bought this near the start of it's development and I was wary and almost even regretting my purchase before I played it. As soon as I booted up the game I was confronted with a primitive menu so I decided to take the plunge and start a new game. The character creator was very limited and you could barely customise the base model at all and so I just decided to leave my character as default and get into the game. Oh boy, desert as far as the eye can see. I really was not enjoying my first half hour on Kenshi but I stuck to it and eventually when I got used to the gameplay and mechanics I was oddly enjoying myself. I didn't mind that there was no sound at the time, I didnt mind that it was nothing but desert, I didn't mind the skeleton menu and character creator. I was building my own village, smithing weapons and mining resources. Bandits would come once in a while only to be beaten by my assorted cohort of slave labourers all armed with massive two handed weapons. The combat in this game is satisfying, limbs can be disabled and you will need to have medkits handy when your peons are♥♥♥♥♥♥at fighting. There's a lot to be completed before Kenshi should be released, new biomes is what I want to see first. Music has been added and sounds great. Graphics have been improving over time and even the character creator is more fleshed out now. Overall, I'd reccomend Kenshi if you're willing to support an early access game, if not wait till it's released. It's flawed, but it's fun.			"

Early Access Review
								""7/10. Ugly but cool. A possible 10/10 when it's finished."" According to My Own Rating. The game is on EA, but make sure you check the update notes to see if you're confortable with the development speed. Also, ignore the store page's screenshots and videos. Look for real gameplay videos and screenshots instead.The trailers and the screenshots have nothing to do with the game I've been playing. Not sure if it's the ugliest cool game or the coolest disturbingly hideous looking game I've played. Either way, it will crash very often, your characters will be possessed by demons, The Exorcist style. Sometimes you'll find half buried npcs, other times you won't because they're completely buried. You'll find more disturbing glitches than you can count. And you'll still keep on playing. And will have fun.Really... the game looks nightmare terrible. But it's fun. The gameplay is very rich in details, allowing you to rise from the guy with a stick that hides until the battle is over and comes along to loot the corpses to the founder of your own city or a bandit leader. And you actually get to work your way into it however you like. You don't pick a merchant profession with a merchant quest.. you spend the coins you got to buy trade goods and run your way into another town to sell. Until you're rich enough to buy a backpack or hire more people to carry more stuff. You don't pick bounty hunter class... you roam around the world and find people with bounties, beat the crap out of them without killing, carry them while they're unconcious and deliver to the police. You don't pick a quest that leads you to rule a city.... you gather up people, grab construction materials, find a good spot and build your city there.TL;DR: Awesome game buried under hideous graphics. Very interesting and fun, but nightmare ugly. I usually don't mind about graphics and found it to be disturbing. To make it easier to understand the situation: http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/577897729358389123/559D45F6E77FF6B29A61B5C8700962CD628AD27B/If you can cope with demon possessed workers, impossible to click npcs, walls that only stop your characters etc, along with having to use the quicksave every few minutes to avoid wasting too much time, this game will be awesome.

								Need of a good RPG, Strategy, Crowd Control Game? This is one of them. Graphics is well below average, but it's pretty good enough. Gameplay is quite standard. Sound? I won't comment on that. Overall, I give this game a 7/10. It's quite interesting if you want to create your own clan of superwarriors, or a clan of supermerchants producing extreme quality of weapons. It's a great game if I say so myself. Although if you compare it to other games it's a 7/10.			"

								Amazing open world RPG or RTS, depending on your playstyle. Huge ammount of depth so far, and easy to lose yourself in. Tons of bugs though that must be said, but there is an auto-save feature aswell as quick-save/quick-load to negate this (somewhat). Keep in mind, this is an early access game.Very unique art style to say the least. Imagine some sort of post-apocolyptic desert world filled with bandits and people trying to uphold some sort of law, and sprinkle this with some heavily inspired steampunk and oriental saumrai design. Interesting gaming mechanics all over the place with forging of clans, building of villages and starting a trading society.All in all, I strongly suggest you check it out. Atleast see some YouTube videos of it's gameplay. 9/10			"

								This is a really great game. it is unique and it offers something really great for RPG Lovers. You can have a whole group of worthless peasants and turn them into the ultimate fighting force to just go out and kick♥♥♥♥♥and on top of that you can build your own little outpost or even a whole village if you wantedThe game is still heavilly in development but seeing the game was created by just 1 guy its really impressive. At first the game took ages to see updates but from what i know the dev employed some skilled helpers to bring the game up to speed and updates are more frequent now.The main thing I love about this game is that you play it at your pace. If you just want to chill and build a base you can however you have to haul materials or create a mine and processor and fabricate your own materials or you can just go out and live off the land and loot all the dead bodies you leave in your wake. :) If you like rpgs and like games where you can build and research I would def say this game is a must buy. Just keep in mind it is an early access game and bugs are expected :)			"

								Kenshi isn't a bad game once you get the hang of it. Its early in the Alpha stages so expect bugs, glitches, crashes, and frustration. Kenshi takes place in another world primarly in the desert although other biomes are being promised. You are able to build towns, but make sure all of your squad is at a decent level other wise, your pretty little base will be over run by wave after wave of screaming bandits. The game dosen't currently have a story line or really advance diolouge. I expect big things from Kenshi, I look foward to see where this game goes.			"

								This game is awesome, it combines solid fun base building with RPG group gameplay in an open world environment. The graphics aren't stellar but that will change as it's developed. I can't wait for the future adventures this game holds! Currently your primary source of entertainment is traveling around, fighting, trading and base building. All of which are made rather difficult roving bands of bandits but after you learn the basics they are easy to hold off. The fun in this game for me is the combination of open world fun and the base building aspect. You build anywhere and just start creating your own little town with the help of (up to 19 or so - i think this can be increased with a mod) followers. If this game were to ever work with Mout & Blade I may never return to the real world. :)			"

								For as early in development as Kenshi is, I have a blast playing it. Be a drifter, roaming village to village fighting bandits. Start your own village and protect it from invaders. Get you legs broken and be carried away by cannibals. Wake up from a coma and kill the cannibals. Run for your life as sand ninjas chase you to the ends of the earth, catch you and leave you for dead. Pray cannibals don't find you before you regain conciousness. You aren't special, you taste just like everyone else.			"

								Hard to start out, but once you get a hang of things and find or build yourself some training dummies to give your combat skills a kick in the♥♥♥♥♥ it's still hard but managable.Very, very feature light at current. (build .40) Many stats/skills still unimplemented, town building and research doesn't advance too far yet, squadmates can get caught in buildings during construction. Despite my frustrations with the game at the start, I now think it's pretty okay. Nothing amazing, $16 is still a bit higher than I'd say I'd pay for it at this stage, but for that price with the potential this game does have, I'm good with it.Very eager to see how this game develops going forward.

								Having only recently discovered Kenshi thanks to a friend I immediately dove right in. My first impression of the game is an overall positive, Kenshi is something I have wanted for a while, a freeroam RTS style squad game with no set story path, allowing you to use your imagination. The game is however unfortunately plagued with bugs, such as characters getting stuck on walls and tends to crash after about an hour or two ( admittedly that could just be my computer). My advice before buying is to ensure you understand that while this game is a gem it is also in alpha and appears to be staying in alpha for quite some time to come. But if you have patience and want to support the developer may I be the first to welcome you to the wastelands of Kenshi!			"

It is a early access game, but the dev is constantly updating the game, I have owned it before it was even on the greenlight page of steam so I have seen it from the beginning to where it is now. The game has lots and lots of mechanics to it and a steep learning curve. You never run out of things to do and it will require a large chunk of time to even get things going which is a good thing.If you are looking for a game that will consume large amounts of time where you start with nothing and work your way up to the biggest military/city and a game that will be constantly updated this is for you			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi is a very flexible open-world game, with a game engine which consist of neatly balanced mechanisms such as damage/death system, economy system, base building group commanding systems as well. As for now there is no victory condition like a story ending- you need to choose what do you want to achieve yourself. You can be a fighter, trader, bandit or even a commander of a whole bunch of your folks equipped with whatever you gave them, each one with his own abilities and skills. Every man in your party can be trained in a different way starting from a slave/worker to a thief or even a turret operator. I like this game, because of the number of posibillities of what you could be from the start of the game to the ending.However, in my honest opinion, I think that the game still lacks a few things that could make the game 4267356345 times better than now. Things like: rideable horses (<3), archery (planned in future), long weapon group, such as spears or sth and a finishing move to kill the bad guys that fell on the ground wounded (yep, you cannot finish him, unless he is to much shredded that he will bleed to death).In sum of all I can give it a 9/10 grade, because of the missing content I already mentioned :)Cheers,Woodman			"

								,,,a constantly-improving desert world similar to earth on a baser level, Kenshi is the upper crust of open-ended gameplay, independent control and detail to each character while maintaing a squad-based role play game. Build towns, mercenary outposts, roam as a trading band or be at war with anything that moves, and maintain every detail of the particular operation. Great Early Release and Worth the $20 bucks, with a plethora of information, and an active community. Recent to the alpha release, I find my idle time returning for more Kenshi.			"

								Having been disappointed in early access many a time before, I was apprehensive about picking up this title. On top of that, I'm not really a fan of the RTS genre. Well I'll have you know that this is the best early access I have ever played. The game itself is still quite buggy and far from complete. However, what exists now is a fantastic foundation showing an immense amount of promise. Even the devs and admins are fantastic. Posting a problem on the community hub often yields a trouble shoot session with one of them. They are as nice and helpful as can be. I really hope to see the company go far in the future. Will be 10/10 when complete			"

It's a single player RPG focusing on open-ended gameplay and is labelled as a sort of squad-based Oblivion mixed with X-Com Apocalypse.Control the ♥♥♥♥ out of them ninja's  and run around the desert trying to kill dust bandits and trying to avoid getting stabbed in the process. This game has a ridiculous amount of potential. Voting on it's current state I'd give it a 6/10.** Note this game is in ALPHA.			"

								I was sitting in a tavern trying to push my wares freshly looted from the unconcious bandits that threw themselves on the trained samurai at the front of town when suddenly a half naked man runs into the shop.  The man doesn't seem to notice or care about the four heavily armed asailants chasing him.I paused the game and started to sweat a bit as I moved my cursor over the armed men to check if they were going to kill me next.  After a quick click it looks like they're friendly and only one person is dying here today.  I am relieved.  That's when the naked dude springs into action.Like a flash he jumps the counter, grabs a hat (pretty sweet one too), and then stands up to the four men as they chop him down mercilessly.  I tried to get a stab in myself just to show the armed men I was always on the right side.  I think I stabbed him in the gut.  Well enough of us stabbed him in the gut that he was truly going to die while lying on the floor of the shop.  The brave man sacrificed his life just to steal a hat from that merchant.  I did the only thing I could think of to honor that sacrifice.  I took that fresh new hat and his pants while he lay unconcious.  Money baby!10/10.			"

I think this game has a lot of pottential, but at this point unless you want to be part of the alpha and help them along don't get it. There's a lot of this that this game needs to fix, add, buff, nerf, and everything else you can think of. So if want a complete game, don't get it cause it's not quite there yet.			"

								This game... Has the potentiel to be one of the best games of all time.  It is a lot of fun and hours will fly faster dollar bills at a strip club.  You will love Kenshi, but I wouldn't recommend getting in now in its current state.The only reason I say this is because it will torture you for waiting.You will play the game, and you will learn everything and thrive.  After awhile you'll realize that its all pointless.  It's all pointless because you will cap out early and everything willl go away whenever the next update comes out.  Because it's still in eary access.My problem is that you could create the greatest character, but it's pointless because it'll all be gone whenever the next update comes out.  Every update adds great rich content to the game; although, the game updates slower than dial-up.The game has been in developement for about three or so years I believe, and it will probably be at least another year before its completion.  I'm still technically recommending the game because I can't bring myself to actually not recommend it.  It truly is an amazing game that everyone should get.  If you've read this article hopefully you take this advice: wait till it officially releases to buy it, or if its on sale buy it and wait till its actual release or later builds.  It will save you many hours and heartache.			"

								I was kind of worried I might have bought the game and wasted 20 bucks on it, turns out to be really amazing once you get into it. It has its ups and downs, for example: some buildings are buggy, sometimes pathing isn't the best, some characters will stay stuck in a rock. But, since it is alpha state, I guess you can give it a little of a blind eye, the updates aren't as frequent, don't expect one every week or so. The game starts out slow, and is a really slow pace game, however, once you understand everything you will get so into it. For example: you will won't go into a bandit fight and hope to win, with just three characters with you, unless you plan how to distract some, and move around to flank. Maybe you want to be a loner, well, you start at the bottom and make your way to the top. Slowly, but surely, you will make it. Want to build the best town in the whole map? Go ahead, but prepare yourself for some random battles with the bandits. Want to be a merchant? Then you must travel the whole land to might the best prices to buy and then sell. The best thing about the game, is simply put, this is how you make your story. You aren't unique, just a regular guy. Good luck.			"

								I may not have sunk that much time into this game, but i absolutely love it. This is the type of game i wish i could play more often. Realistic, no superpowers or anything that makes your character(s) better than the rest of the npcs. You all start out on equal territory and have to 'lvl' your skills from the ground up. (I say level because while your skills do have levels that directly effect you and your effectivness your character does not level up in the sense of going from being Level 1 to Level 2). The game pretty much starts you off with the shirt on your back and says good luck. However it does have different beginnings for you to choose from ranging from a simple wanderer to a wounded military man, hell even to a group of disgruntelled villagers setting out on their own! Simply put this game gives you not set story to follow, it lets you write your own.			"

								tl;dr This game isn't for everyone but if you love open world sand box games you can easily mod yourself and play anyway you want you should get a kick out of this game.Kenshi is an open world sandbox for you to create your own goals and achieve them any way you want. It can be played as a solo character (lone samurai) type, or you can control a whole suad and build a town, researching and gathering your resources along the way, or you can even play as a trader by hiring your own in-town characters to manage your local business management (This is my favourite as it allows for powerful growth and you can learn the trading trends).Unfortunately there is not a ton of optimization going on here. The way I play, I have my squad dispersed across the whole (GIANT) map and I have to jump between them regularily, although there is no loading screen, it takes a couple seconds each time, and when you are doing things like just checking prices or looting multiple towns at once, it can be a little annoying.The $20 price may seem like a lot for the performance you have to deal with but by no means should that scare you away from this. There is only one guy making this game so the progress isn't terribly fast but he has been working hard on better game performance and addressing the needs and wants of the community.			"

								Okay when I first downloaded the kenshi it was something 0.40. Man it was ugly. BUT dont you dare to judge the cookie on its looks rather than taste. No Seriously. My first encounter with Kenshi was from tag ""RPG"" I was like uh okay why not give it a try. Graphic ugly but it hardly matters in rpg games its just an extra. I had a ton of fun with it bulding things, going to town to town trying to get supplies and recruits trainig even capturing cannibals as traning bags to be released in full power on one on one match to raise block skill. The game is in early access please keep it in mind when you're deciding to buy. It has lot of features starting as an retired capitan for example boosts your starting stats in fights but leaves your pockets empty and one faction seriously♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that they want you dead. Very good solution for starters are to loot weapons from bandits when they attacking the town OR you lure them but be warned you're not superhero you're just an human with barely any special traits at all. If you want to outrun bandits first learn how to scram really fast or they'll catch up and probably kill you. But exacly that it is about a struggle to survive to build first outpost to gather resources and money for them. Though theres no quest lines yet theres still plenty to do max up technology gather as much resources as you can and better equipment whenever its possible buy blueprints that dont comes cheap and most important harden your main character as well your team mates. And for god sake think. Dont fight with 2 hostile parties that already is fighting with each other. Wait a bit till battle end and finish them off looting as much as you can. You dont want to get caught in battle versus 3 other hostile to you squads. Trust me			"

I really like building games like this in a 3d world since most of the time its God mode looking down on his tiny ant creation. It is a very tough game and you have to dedicate a decent amount of time in order to have solid footing, but its very satisfying once you have that foothold to then expand and take over.			"

								i have high expectations for this game, i loved it from the beginning and its something i have been waiting for as far as the type of game. its not for everyone, the game is a big part in survival and strategy because of the elements the game has, such as being 3rd person voerview and all squad being able to die if you get in over your head as they can be incapacitated and bleed out if no one can offer medical attention to them in time, you sometimes have to pick your fights especially at first as you are weak and alone. the start is slow but once you get a good foundation the fun begins, you can build your own settlement from scratch and lead a smal squad of warriors/traders/craftsmen ora combination ofa ll 3 like me, if intetested i would say hit up youtube first to see gameplay, this game has HUGE potential and in its current state there are quite a few bugs but there are things the crator has but in to help with most that cause game play to suffer such as being about to rebuild the nav mesh after prolonged play has caused several npcs to wander off from there designated areas and if a world has become so FUBAR you can import your game and take all your squad and tech and even buildings (labled as buggy so i left it be and just decided to rebuild, heck more enginnering skill for me) to start fresh on a new game world without losing any training for research, BLACKBEARD if you read this please get in touch with me i would llove to assist with helping find bugs to help you prioritize the games development			"

								Its okay. The beginning is brutal, but once you get the hang of it, you can have some fun. Honestly, I'm not sure what else to say. It is still (obviously) an Alpha, and bugs are galore. It hangs, lags, and is constantly loading... But what do you expect for an indie game that large? Its a good game, and I look forwards to playing it more.			"

Early Access Review
								Let me start saying this. This game has an amazing atmosphere and the steampunk desert samurai vibe is probably worth it's own HBO series. The first two or three hours of this game gave me a feeling I barely ever have had while playing a game. It felt like I was playing that game I wanted all my childhood, but simply nobody created.But that's exactly the problem with this game. It's unpolished to the point of looking antique. With all it's amazing potential and fun possibilities, it's infested with bugs of both graphic and gameplay nature. It's extremely fun to play, addictingly so, but you soon realize how the outer shell of this game is just that, an empty husk.That would be completely fine for an alpha in development for maybe half a year or so, but this game is simply not gonna be finished anytime soon (I give it 3 to 4 years, if I had to guess-.-  Atleast at the speed it's been going). I hope steam kicks out this game from their early release line so that the guy(/s) creating this beauty can join a bigger studio and use their clearly brilliant talent on some more realistic project. Final words:If you have a very strong masochistic tendency towards unique games. Buy this and get a psychiatric eval done, there's something really wrong with you.			"

								Feels like ""Banished"" but with fighting.At the moments its a fairly featureless sandbox - there is little motive to do anything. But there is trading to be done, and plenty of random encounters with bandits that will get your character levelling nicely.I am most impressed though by the vision of the game, the setting and atmosphere are very original and the gamplay so far has also been hinting towards a world that, once complete/better developed, could contain an enourmous variety of gameplay styles, the bones for plenty of lore, things to discover and explore.Out of the many sandbox games that are around at the moment, this one has me most intrigued by its potential...so long as the updates keep coming in.

								Amazing open world RPG or RTS, depending on your playstyle. Huge ammount of depth so far, and easy to lose yourself in. Tons of bugs though that must be said, but there is an auto-save feature aswell as quick-save/quick-load to negate this (somewhat). Keep in mind, this is an early access game.Very unique art style to say the least. Imagine some sort of post-apocolyptic desert world filled with bandits and people trying to uphold some sort of law, and sprinkle this with some heavily inspired steampunk and oriental saumrai design. Interesting gaming mechanics all over the place with forging of clans, building of villages and starting a trading society.All in all, I strongly suggest you check it out. Atleast see some YouTube videos of it's gameplay. 9/10			"

								Wonderfull game, feels ""real"", i mean when i make a mistake,  i'm not willing to reload, i sufffer happilly the consequences, as the game allows mistakes even if it has a cost, and beeing hit hard by bandits can happen ! even if a character send searching leather is in coma, and 100miles away from my medic, i'd rather send him help before slavers take him, otherwise i'll have to practise lockpicking to get him back ..so i get ready to bodyguard my tiny medic woman , i leave heavy guards before my fortress, and go ! Feels real, lively, human sized, huge, very handy to have pple do what i need, :my steelbars crafter goes mining when the miners didnt provide enough ore (so do the smith when he lacks steelbars ), then goes back to the steelbars making machine, then if i want to build something nearby, he goes building it automagically (taking needed furmiture in the store , itself autofilled by other crafters)) before going back to his secondary work, beause his first is engineer, and he is in charge of building !of course, he wasnt so efficient in his early days here...I absolutely love the desert, the mountains, the cities...though they dont show nowadays netgen graphics, i love the characters, (the portrait panel auto updates when anything happens to them, clothing/armour change, coma, slavery...I love to have spent my day seaching the perfect spot , with water, ore, stone, and a wonderfull view on the sunset above the next town (handily close enough for me to send a character to said city in a clic, to buy/sell whatever i want there, when he'll be there, a window will pop up and i'll be watching him in a right clic on his portrait in the panel...only thing i personnaly disliked WAS the UI, looked too ""fallout"" for me (though i loved fallouts games), but i edited a few textures and now its ok !And all this is MODDABLE .i created myself a magical backpack with low chances to find it, found it and the, had the opportunity to pack all my stocks of resources to reload (import) my game in a brand new world as i had learnt so much i wanted to rebuild my home base completely, and destroying it would have been too time consuming.Bugs ?well i got a fair computer, maybe it helps, and now i know what can cause (the very few ) errors, (like loading a save after having played one without quitting the game..( never a good idea in most complex games) my save is 100 hours old, and i had really few errors, nothing gamebreaking or that couldnt be repared. So Kenshi is absolutely playable, if you've played any 4X, like samurais, strat games, and are not afraid to get involved in your teams life, buy and play, so the dev will ""finish"" his game faster, and make a second with plenty enough of money to give us the best game ever !hem, did i say it was moddable ?i forgot, spent too many hours aday these last weeks since i (finally) bought this game, and feel a bit tired.. but i must find that perfect spot for them, they are still waiting in the high city...there were too many bandits in the last one i had found...the dev team said:“Kenshi is currently in alpha state. The game is still in development and is missing many features.""there is yet so much to do ! ofc, such a game can never be completed, one can always add features, new buildings, a new appearance for Ciry.. hem maybe not for Ciry..the point is that they have a roadmap, and want to achieve it before feeling the game can stop beeing in ""early"" access, but it IS accessible now, and absolutely playable.So get it, now !

Early Access Review
								One of my favorite Steam games so far.  The recent updates seem to have made starting a new game a bit more difficult, as instead of my character simply getting the crap beat out of him/her for the first few encounters and waiting for them to recover in a coma, they simply bleed to death.  I've also had recent issues constructing a base in newer games, no matter how far from an established town/outpost I choose to construct my base, it is still 'too close to a town'.  That said, this is one of the most enjoyable and challenging games in my library.  Character customization is extensive, and there are many weapon styles to pick from.  As of this review, the various factions don't influence much of the gameplay, aside from the bandit groups, the exception being the slavers.  After stumbling into their outpost looking for a place to offload some weapons my blacksmith had manufactured, my two characters were quickly incapacitated, healed, and dragged off to work in the mines deeper in the slaver compound.  As these were my two strongest fighters, I had to reload a previous save.  After 44 hours, I have a decent base and a means to generate income.  It also keeps most of the bandit hordes at bay and serves as a means to explore the rest of the game world.  Recruits in the outlying towns are providing replacement laborers for my more experienced fighters, and I am slowly building an expeditionary fighting force to attempt to conquer a town.  It's been an enjoyable experience, and the only complaint I have thus far is that there isn't a great deal of direction, which may be frustrating for more casual players.  Those who enjoy learning harsh lessons through trial and error will be richly rewarded.  I would recommend starting a game with more than one character in your party, otherwise be prepared to dodge bandit groups and shuffle between cities trading goods for profit until you can afford to buy the building materials you need to construct a base.  A larger party allows you to stand a chance in combat and salvage equipment from your fallen foes, which is a quicker way to earn the required cash and initially outfit yourself with better gear.  I look forward to the finished product.			"

								The Developers are making great strides in tthe progress of the game, Im impatient, but I always enjoy the new updates.It is squad based RPG. Every character in your squad can be upgraded in many different ways. It takes a lot of work to get your guys strong. You can build your own little town. I would suggest going to the website and read about what will be included in the game. It is definitely Early access, but it is playable. I backed this game a year ago but I am proud to say that the devs havn't dropped the ball, they are still working hard on it.Ive played through glithces and some bad AI problems that they had but it improves with time. You can adjust the difficulty in the game sliders, adjusting the number of enemies in a squad.Keep up the good work Lo-Fi Games.			"

								I've only played Kenshi 22 hours as of now and have found many bugs. it's especially buggy once you have over 20 people in your clan, lol.. I'm at 28 and half the time my people just sit there after i tell em to do something(lazy asses) and I have noticed in many ways how the screne shots above look nothing like in game.. for example the Map is a bit rough and hard to interpret but issues are to be expected in an Alfa. note though, even with the many bugs and various other gameplay issues this game is definitly worth the grab. as bad♥♥♥♥♥as the game and its buggs already are there is so much potential to be even more. i'd buy it again if i had to and I've already refered it to 3 of my friends one of wich bought it what whaaaat!.

								I'll leave this update up here. They have recently released a giant update which is really nice but more importantly it also solved a lot of the performance issues. So while the progress is still super slow, the giant patch they released is good and the performance is fixed so I'll leave my complaint filled review below still even if some of the problems are improved. Games still not perfect but its sloooooowly getting there.Super slow progress, and although its an amazing idea for a game and actually is pretty fun when it works. It's also a bug ridden mess that crashes a lot and will have game breaking bugs requiring restarts.I figured I would elaborate a bit on this as I really feel dissapointed and don't want to let it seem like I am just flaming the game itself. The game itself is pretty amazing in premise and at times kind of works. I have a group of people that I started with, and I go around recruiting more, they are weak as dirt and the game is challenging working them up the ladder of strength but the difficulty isnt a problem, I like the challenge. Skills and stats work in a way that the more you use them they will develop and become better, so use a sword, get better at using the sword type of thing. Many skills are available including movement speed, crafting, fighting, and stealth, all are of course raised through use. Now the game is a lot of fun if it would work, I get a set of about 15 people ready to go with 10 of them intending to fight. Still weak as dirt but with equipment I scavenge like a vulture from battlefields of other soldiers I decide to start fighting small groups of bandits to raise their skills and prepare for the future. Exciting stuff, scavenge battlefields for an hour or two and roam around to different taverns looking for people interested in joining for about 1-2 hours. Takes time, and its difficult to stay alive and uninjured, but its fun in its sandbox skill based system way.Here is where the problem comes in. In those 1-2 hours I've already had the game crash dozens of times, as well as had to manually restart the game as bugs pop up such as being unable to move my units or textures failing to load. In addition to this, with a PC that can run the Witcher 3 on max settings and other great high quality games on high settings, this game stutters horribly. I lower all my settings to as low as they can go besides view distance being just nearly the lowest in an attempt to not have the game constantly stutter. So the engine lags and crashes a lot, sounds rough but it can't be that game breaking if you save a lot right? Plus its early access so it's reasonable to think bugs would be here. Unfortunately this game has been in ""early access"" state for about 6 years now, of which I've owned it for about 5 on Desura and later here on steam. The game seemed like it had so much potential back then, and about 2 years ago I picked it up again played it a lot (even dealing with the mass crashes because the dream was alive that someday this would be capable of actually playing and enjoying). Now then this review rolls around, because I decided to see what progress they made and I came to conclude that they came to very little, and the game runs worse than I even remembered. After 6 years of alpha I can't recomend this game to anyone. With the progress being made I would say check the game out again in another 6 years and maybe it will be in a playable state, as the games concept itself is amazing however the playability of the game it self is completely unacceptable for a game people pay for .

								For this game beig slow coming it continues to blow many indy games AWAY everyone want to copy MINECRAFT((The only game worse the CoD(Hate for all I care), Destiny, and Halo(people these buy these game solely for the franchise name and tha is it)) Though Kenshi is fresh and new it slight seem to have a M&B sandbox feel is minor ways yet with minor hints only And with aq fesh new world to explore unlike ANY enviortment for a game I have seenThe empty desert of Kenshi is a challenge that is its own; the empty feelingt makes it feel that much more desprate to survive, and every char having human stats as well So you caqn expoit town but they still can kill you The onlly missing is a bit more lore to the worldd not much but a little start  otherwise...This is 1000000/10 I give it Big studios have spoon feeding bs games like CoD all that crap...hope you all wake and realize what crap is a loaad of♥♥♥♥♥♥and stop buying it but you probably won't			"

								         Well as much as I want to rant about the bugs in the game and they are many.. I find myself really enjoying the randomness of the game, which at times can be very unfair with the new patches. For exmple: the  .75 patch they implenmented the thief with the police recongnition of stolen goods, and found myself in a battle with some anrgy officers over some boots i picked of  bandits lol.  i guess  i can say for  myself that i like the feeling not knowing whats next. in all kenshi fulfills the need of this for the most part. SOoo. is it worth it? yes!!... for $20 nah get when its on discount. =P			"

								Infinite Wingwang will end it all, Infinite Wingwang is infinite! I've played countless hours of this, i've played it since when it was first introduced on Desura and that's one of the few early early access games that's not a total robbery. It's been in developpement for so long but it's been more and more ambitious. This game is a fine example of what early access should be about, not a fk-ing crowdfunding bs to avoid paying money for actual developpment like most indie devs do! If you want a crowdfunding there's a place for that nowaday! Im hetero but i'd suck Lo-fi Games dev team's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥anytime for this epic badassery game. This game is about how harsh survival can be, you♥♥♥♥♥♥on the wrong neighborhood you'll get buttseked hardcore. Don't♥♥♥♥♥♥anyone off at the beginning unless you know what you're doing. This is NOT Skyrim where you can kill anyone from the very beginning. If you wanna pillage and jail some people you'll have to gather a team of badass characters or just become Saitama > https://49.media.tumblr.com/d8af8cdf58ad64a7e8d5ab2d36365276/tumblr_nxj6wlrMfq1r7sijxo1_500.gif < (this is Saitama, he one shot anything alive). In this game, you grind your stats like you're actually training, wich makes it look like a fine example of a good RPG. For example, i wanna train strength, i fill a backpack with iron ores, wear a heavy armor (cuz yeah, don't expect to wear a heavy armor while being a spaghetti weak little♥♥♥♥♥♥ you'll get extremely disadvantaged in your stats) and weapon and pick someone up and walk around like that for days.If you wanna become tough, you get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked. You actually EARN your stats! This is a unique feeling. The game is meant to always have a challenge but i've trained Infinite Wingwang like no tomorrow and now he LITTERALY one-shot kill anyone and god knows how hard it is to kill someone in this game. You usually end up unconscious and then die but INFINITE WINGWANG ONE-SHOTS YOU! That's all.			"

								In my short amount of time with the game so far, I already have stories for days. This is a squad based, open world RPG snadbox. How many of those do you see? None. There are multiple starts to the game, ranging from waking up drunk, with a broken arm, and no gear, to starting with a party of 5. The game is pretty realistic, as in no magic or far fetched creatures. There are species native to the huge desert world that don't exist IRL, but these beings are so artistically crafted, it amazes me.The game is a sandbox RPG, which means it is extremely open ended. You can be a doctor, scientist, bandit, soldier, police officer, anything you want really. The game is perfect for those who like to roleplay as well.There are a few bugs here and there, and the occasional crash, so please save often.The devs are currently working on a whole new world map and multiple biomes, so updates may be few and far between for awhile, but it'll be worth it.If you want a RP heavy, open ended RPG, and don't mind a few bugs, Kenshi is your game.Kenshi is a solid 9/10 from me.Also, ♥♥♥♥ the sand ninjas			"

I have put quite a few hours in just building my lush oasis and I have barely got into the crafting system or building up an unstoppable death squad. Not saying it takes a long time to do... it's just I have taken the time to explore and get bandit loot. What I want you to know is, BUY this game. It is a great game. The devs are very involved and patch frequently. There is a massive update to the world map and they are adding a lot more features soon.Go to their website and look at their roadmap and the patches and expected updates. It is growing at an accelerated rate now and I can't wait for the future of this game. It will definitely be one of my favorites.Go to the website and try the demo.			"

								This game is really fun, lots to do and is actually a challenge. Takes time to build things and get anywhere but its fun, the small bits of progression is rewarding. You can fully make your own character, kinda like the creation from oblivon, and you can higher tons of other people to join you, that you get to not only name, but create what they look like too! seems like the only frustrating part that iv'e come across is that it takes forever to get from place to place. Wish you could fast travel or something but for what this game is, its worth the 20$. Love the game mechanics too, haha its funny to watch a giant battle go down and see the friends of the bandits come pick up their lifeless bodies. Can't wait to see more for this game!!  Updated however, I had numerous problems after an update came out. I had to report these things called crash dump files for about 3 months, but they never was able to fix the problem. looks like just after I bought the game they changed it to need a better graphics card, so I ended up only being able to play this for a short while. Haha it was more like a really exspensive rental that Ill never be able to play again. If you have everything you need to play it Im sure its still good. However its kinda lame that the spec for the game changed after I payed for it.			"

								For my first game review on Steam, I'll Keep this fairly short.This game has amazing features, and though it's early access, with a lot of bugs, There is nearly endless replay value. The way this game is played won't be for everyone, which is fine. Although, if you're a fan of squad based survival RPG's, this game is one of a kind.Be warned, this game can be very unforgiving. I'd bet there's a good 80% chance you'll die, so be prepared to experience many different means of ""RETREAT!"".This is an Amazing game, Dev's. Thank you to all who support this game as well.11/10 - Would get murdered by endless Sand Ninja again.			"

								First impressions? Buggy design, terrible UI, embarassingly empty gameplay and some of the most unintuitive controls I've ever encountered. I realize this is still in alpha, but I'm really not excited by anything I'm seeing here.Is there something interesting to do in Kenshi? Maybe, but it's hiding itself pretty well thus far. I really like the idea of a post-apocalyptic, open-world RPG where you can do more-or-less what you like, but give me something to work with here.It really doesn't feel like anything close to a finished game. I bought it on sale, thankfully. I'd be furious if I had paid full price for this.			"

								Had a rough start with this game, crashed several times before I'd even gotten past the menus, crashed once or twice since then when I tried to build walls, usually some bug or glitch around the corner, and the current 'stable' steam version really through a curve at me when I neared the end of the tech tree only to discover the pathfinding doesnt work at all for some late game tech.Finally I found out that the latest version 0.72.1 can be played on steam via the beta settings, and its a lot better than the stable release (0.69.2 or something), not perfect by any means, but definately an improvement, so despite the continuing pathfinding problems, the odd ragdoll physics, and the missing features, I still really like this game and I've just gotten started with the 'forgotten construction set.exe', so;all-in-all its not a good game yet, though it is actually quite fun.

								I have been following Kenshi for a long time now and have loved the game from it's first almost featureless and buggy Alpha release to it's current state. This is an ambitious project to create a game that should hopefully become a classic. This game will never have multiplayer. Nor should it. A coop mode would be great, however a large part of this game is the atmosphere from playing this single player.All of that aside even the Alpha version has a charm to it and I have spent hundreds of hours wandering around a silent desert with my little band, fighting bandits and training up my characters. I find the game very relaxing and peaceful. I am almost aprehensive about the updates. Even if Kenshi winds up dying a slow development hell death, the engine and the work that has already been done would be fascinating to build on. I will be keeping an eye on Kenshi for a long time to come yet. :)			"

								A very different take on post-apocalyptic survival. The squad based tactics and the slow grinding to get,well anything, was both frusterating and rewarding. Of course with every game there are bugs, but the constant update schedule will make taking the bugs easier. Since you are'nt the chosen one, or any super special character, there are no real burdens of resposibility thrown at you. For the first hour I played, I killed a guy and was carrying the body, just to drop it toff a cliff. Marvelous.Overall its a good game that keeps getting better.			"

								When I first got the game it was around the time it was first released and I was heavily interested in the concept. The concept being that the game is alike to a post Apocalypse Japan in turn alike to the anime desert punk or Trigun being closer to the former. One of the shining features in my view is the customization and changeability the players can make to the world. There is though a lack of stuff in the world of interest to explore however, before said players make the changes.  The game is still progressing and is fun to sink hours of play into but its con is that its development time is slow compared to other games that have been greenlighted. The game still has the potential and ability to progress further and is most likely going to do so however, as said keep in mind it will be slow.			"

								I haven't bought many early access games, and luckily the ones I did buy are still being developed.Top of this list is still Kenshi, It's the one game where I'll opt for the (sometimes very unstable) unstable releases just to see some of the new content. I'm impatient to, and I'd like nothing more then to play the final game, but patience is a virtue. And the risk remains that the end result will be a game you don't really enjoy, but if you bought a couple games over the years it's no different then buying a full game you don't enjoy.Kenshi to me is the game that proves early access can be done right, even if the pace is slow. It doesn't try to please everyone, but it does it's own thing, and will most likely become a strong IP in years to come. I highly recommend this one as it will most likely become a classic.As for the game itself, check the Lofi games website or other resources before you buy the game. If I had to describe it, it's a bit like a real time fallout rpg with katanas where you can build your own town in the wastes.			"

Mad MAX meets Samurai epic.Considering this is an alpha still, there is alot to do, I have only ever played 1 character and his followers but between base building, getting rich, training stats and skills and eventually assaulting NPC towns (Holy Nation was my target a while back) there is alot to do.I can see this being a game that appeals to a certain type of player, but those players will love it with a passion.

								After much skepticism and debating whether or not I should purchase this game, I finally did (obviously). Good god, was it worth it! I've put nearly 10 hours into the game up to this point and I haven't even touched building yet. I've been obsessing with making each merc I hire as unique and 'real' as possible. Maybe a medic won't focus so much on their strength, so they won't have as big of muscles as their heavy armor-clad samurai companion would. You get the point. All in all, for what the game currently is, and claims to become, $20 is a meager price to pay. Remember, the game is still in early access, there will probably be bugs/glitches/crashes/etc (still worth it, in my opinion.). I give it a 7.5/10 at the moment ONLY because it is incomplete. I give the concept an absolute 11/10.			"

								Okay so its an alpha build which plays better then some games that  i have seen and follow that proclaim beta, it comes with its own modding tools for those who ""cant wait"" . the combat system is beautiful and your lead character is NOT a god unit it can die. this actual engine could be resjinned for several types of hanes on the same dynamic from space mariens on a bug ridden world s to mystic warriors with majiks and stuff .. it can get wierd with ai pathing / haveing to leave your gates open when tradeing or the dude walking back to opening them , or strange scatttering and getting stuck on nothingness .. also travleing above a certain threshhold sems to force your guys  to get stuck to the point of haveing them picked up and put down just to make them move again , doing this to an unconsious person fires them across the map and sometimes 5k up. but after all that ... waiting for 50 grade 5 katanas so you can seelem , fearing you will get jumped on trade route and loose 100k worth of merchendise amd even worse the trader himself bleeding out while you rush to his aid  .. awsome game played it non stop 4 days , still worried about bandit raids cannot leave them unattended must watchem or i might losem it took 4 days to get  bims weapon smith skill this high i will cry if hes dies.

								Having been with Kenshi since it's first apperance sometime in 2012, I've seen the game change.This is my first review of any game but for me Kenshi is a great game and with whats to come I'm excited so I wanted to give a piece of my mind on Kenshi, where it is now and what's to look out for in the future.Bear in mind I play using the experimental build, you'll have to activate this on steam in the ""BETA"" tab when in the games properties.Kenshi now.....As the game stands today you can build up and entire town, make walls and defences (crossbow & harpoon guns). You can farm wheat and hemp, make rum, bread, fabrics, steel, chainmail, armor plates, medkits, splint kits, a good selection of clothes and armor and a fair round of weapons.You can manage your men and women into squads and each of your characters that you control has his/her own stats that can be leveled up through doing all sorts of things. Doing combat improves combat skills and getting beaten and hurt in combat improves your characters defense skills making them tougher.Researching unlocks more stuff todo and there are some things you'd need to buy the blueprint first and then you'll be bale to research it and then build/craft it.There is much to do but as some others has mentioned, some of these features lack depth and content, true.But having been following the game since the developer Lo-Fi, was a 1 man studio to what it is now, I'm confident we'll be seeing more things to come.So what is lacking....The reputation system still needs some work, so far I've only been able to decrease my standing with the other NPC factions (bear in mind I might actually not know how to improve it) but simply keeping to fighting bandits and sand ninjas will keep your range of towns/cities you can visit wide open.Crafting can be fleshed out more and I've heard and read that there is more to come so I'm not too worried.The world gets quite small after you've played a good few days solid but again, I've heard a new world is on its way.Wildlife is a big challenge early on and even with a small group (I've been hunted down by a pack of 8 dogs once or twice) and generally I'd like to see some variety in NPC squad sizes.Pathfinding is quite a problem now but with the ""CTRL+SHIFT+F12"" command you can usually clear that up and remembering to quicksave also saves you from the ""not too often anymore"" crash that comes with using the command or just loading in zones if you're traveling a lot.End note....All in all kenshi has come a long way and it's had it's ups and downs, but it is currently very stable and lots of fun if you can remind your self that it is still in development so don't expect a polished fully working game and there is more to come.Learn to live with hiccups :)			"

								When I first got the game it was around the time it was first released and I was heavily interested in the concept. The concept being that the game is alike to a post Apocalypse Japan in turn alike to the anime desert punk or Trigun being closer to the former. One of the shining features in my view is the customization and changeability the players can make to the world. There is though a lack of stuff in the world of interest to explore however, before said players make the changes.  The game is still progressing and is fun to sink hours of play into but its con is that its development time is slow compared to other games that have been greenlighted. The game still has the potential and ability to progress further and is most likely going to do so however, as said keep in mind it will be slow.			"

								The potential this game has is seeminly limitless, however so too is the length of time development on this ambitious project seemingly takes. Many game features remain unavailable a long time into alpha and others seem to be clunky or clumsy. Part simulator, part rpg, can be a lot of fun.Purchase this if you:-Like swords-Like to struggle-Enjoy complex game play with a moderate learning curveAvoid this game if you:-Don't like swords (Why wouldn't you!?)-Want a finished product-Are easily frustrated or have little paitance6/10 Worth some time			"

								I've been playing since about .4 I believe (before sound at least) and I have to say this game is very awesome for what I was looking for. If you have ever wanted to build a town and actually be the one who is calling all the shots and not some AI in the background then this is it. I really like building games like this in a 3d world since most of the time its God mode looking down on his tiny ant creation. It is a very tough game and you have to dedicate a decent amount of time in order to have solid footing, but its very satisfying once you have that foothold to then expand and take over.			"

								""7/10. Ugly but cool. A possible 10/10 when it's finished."" According to My Own Rating. The game is on EA, but make sure you check the update notes to see if you're confortable with the development speed. Also, ignore the store page's screenshots and videos. Look for real gameplay videos and screenshots instead.The trailers and the screenshots have nothing to do with the game I've been playing. Not sure if it's the ugliest cool game or the coolest disturbingly hideous looking game I've played. Either way, it will crash very often, your characters will be possessed by demons, The Exorcist style. Sometimes you'll find half buried npcs, other times you won't because they're completely buried. You'll find more disturbing glitches than you can count. And you'll still keep on playing. And will have fun.Really... the game looks nightmare terrible. But it's fun. The gameplay is very rich in details, allowing you to rise from the guy with a stick that hides until the battle is over and comes along to loot the corpses to the founder of your own city or a bandit leader. And you actually get to work your way into it however you like. You don't pick a merchant profession with a merchant quest.. you spend the coins you got to buy trade goods and run your way into another town to sell. Until you're rich enough to buy a backpack or hire more people to carry more stuff. You don't pick bounty hunter class... you roam around the world and find people with bounties, beat the crap out of them without killing, carry them while they're unconcious and deliver to the police. You don't pick a quest that leads you to rule a city.... you gather up people, grab construction materials, find a good spot and build your city there.TL;DR: Awesome game buried under hideous graphics. Very interesting and fun, but nightmare ugly. I usually don't mind about graphics and found it to be disturbing. To make it easier to understand the situation: http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/577897729358389123/559D45F6E77FF6B29A61B5C8700962CD628AD27B/If you can cope with demon possessed workers, impossible to click npcs, walls that only stop your characters etc, along with having to use the quicksave every few minutes to avoid wasting too much time, this game will be awesome.

I think this game has a lot of pottential, but at this point unless you want to be part of the alpha and help them along don't get it. There's a lot of this that this game needs to fix, add, buff, nerf, and everything else you can think of. So if want a complete game, don't get it cause it's not quite there yet.			"

								I was sitting in a tavern trying to push my wares freshly looted from the unconcious bandits that threw themselves on the trained samurai at the front of town when suddenly a half naked man runs into the shop.  The man doesn't seem to notice or care about the four heavily armed asailants chasing him.I paused the game and started to sweat a bit as I moved my cursor over the armed men to check if they were going to kill me next.  After a quick click it looks like they're friendly and only one person is dying here today.  I am relieved.  That's when the naked dude springs into action.Like a flash he jumps the counter, grabs a hat (pretty sweet one too), and then stands up to the four men as they chop him down mercilessly.  I tried to get a stab in myself just to show the armed men I was always on the right side.  I think I stabbed him in the gut.  Well enough of us stabbed him in the gut that he was truly going to die while lying on the floor of the shop.  The brave man sacrificed his life just to steal a hat from that merchant.  I did the only thing I could think of to honor that sacrifice.  I took that fresh new hat and his pants while he lay unconcious.  Money baby!10/10.			"

								Awesome game, Really love it.Combines Group management, RPG factors and Strategy into an atmospheric world full of dynamic NPC's and plenty of open space to explore. Fitting and well constructed soundtrack adds to the atmosphere and the game itself isn't even complete yet.Have been playing the game on and off for about a year now and it's been great to see it developing into a standalone game, set high above most others.The AI is still buggy at times, but is seeing steady improvement with abilities to bribe and talk to raiders in order to stop them from attacking you.Starving bandits now go for your food and supplies which they then appear to sell which increases their factions funds (not seen them attempt to spend any of it yet though)Research and development has seen an overhaul recently too, with lots of new features such as blueprints and research costing money which creates motive for trade.Furthermore, lots of new buildings and crafting tables have been added, along with devensive structures such as large walls and mouted turrets to aid in defense.The skilltree is slowly being fleshed out with the new theivery skills which allow your squadmembers to pick locks and escape from capture, be it by the law or from bandits/cannibals.Lots of new armor, clothing and weapons types with multiple levels of research for each allows for a great customization of characters and you'll find yourself giving your squadmates nicknames as you slowly get more attached to the higher skilled ones.Overall a fantastic game and I really can't wait for further updates.

								Wow. Just bought this on sale. Should have read the most recent reviews about the development of it -- or lack thereof.So the game for me so far has been ""Let's try to get past character creation without a crash."", five times now.3/10 - Stability issues. Can't even rate the game yet, and don't think I will be able to any time soon due to lack of interest in trying. Maybe if I throw it on an old square LCD I can get this to display and not crash, but as it stands this is probably the most crash prone game I've seen yet at resolution 1680x1050. At the price, it's not even worth troubleshooting. Moving on...Granted my specs are not the most current but: AMD Phenom II X4 3.4, 16GB Crucial 1666, Samsung 840 EVO 250GB, GTS 450 4049 -- runs anything from Saints Row 4 to Dragon Age: Inquisitor and in between without a hitch.EDIT: I dropped the settings to the bare minimum -- yes bare minimum including resolution. Able to get it to work. First impression, character creation rich, somewhat enjoyable. Entered the game, opened a chest -- nothing. Opened another chest, nothing. Opened another chest, nothing. Opened another chest, nothing. Apparently chests aren't for storage -- ok, I get it. Post apoc setting. Looked at a straw hat on top of a buried bit of sand, went to pick it up. Nope. That's an NPC and he's static, but he's placed in a buggy spot underneath the terrain. Looked around a bit. Wandered (as my option for starting suggested)...wandered some more, wandered some more. Absolutely NO life or interaction. Put down game. Wasted money. Moving on.Save your money. Or better yet get a Fallout, Wasteland or any other game than this one.Open world with empty content -- worst combination ever.			"

								I have been following Kenshi for a long time now and have loved the game from it's first almost featureless and buggy Alpha release to it's current state. This is an ambitious project to create a game that should hopefully become a classic. This game will never have multiplayer. Nor should it. A coop mode would be great, however a large part of this game is the atmosphere from playing this single player.All of that aside even the Alpha version has a charm to it and I have spent hundreds of hours wandering around a silent desert with my little band, fighting bandits and training up my characters. I find the game very relaxing and peaceful. I am almost aprehensive about the updates. Even if Kenshi winds up dying a slow development hell death, the engine and the work that has already been done would be fascinating to build on. I will be keeping an eye on Kenshi for a long time to come yet. :)			"

								Now Kenshi is a hard game to review as I do not know if I want too recommend it or not. The game is getting updates about every 2-4 months so its coming along slow. But the base of a good game is there buts its just that a 'base'. So it comes back to do I recommend it or not ?  If you want to help the devs by giving money do it , but just be warned that you can do most things in the game within a few hours. So you maybe 'sat on' this game maybe for maybe a year at most before it is released. I have high hopes for this game and with the mods being made for it.So I will recommend this game, just go some research about it and think about it.But I hope that you fund the game as I believe it will be worth the wait.

								This is game actually quite fun, but it is balls hard at the start. Infact, a good 90% of you will most likely stop playing and forget the game ever existed because of it. I enjoy a game that doesn't hold my hand, but I think they devs went a little too far with it, because like I said, it's almost impossible to do much of anything at the start of the game and later on everything's a Cake-walk. Spawned in a small town 19 times and was ripped apart by sand-bandits every time. Bug? Perhaps, but none the less a huge turn-off. In case this review was implying it's impossible to do anything in this game, you can, but it's more a matter of luck than anything. (Bandits not spawning on your♥♥♥♥♥hole, or the local towns folk actually bothering to patch you up even though you saved the prick from a right thrashing moments ago..) In short, It's hard as all hell in the start and insanely simple later on. In it's current state it's fairly unbalanced, but i do see it being a great game later on. Before anyone says you can tone it down via mods, I am aware of this, But i feel it cheap that devs put so much stock in mods *Cough*Bethedsa *Cough* *Cough*Mojang*Cough*			"

								First impressions? Buggy design, terrible UI, embarassingly empty gameplay and some of the most unintuitive controls I've ever encountered. I realize this is still in alpha, but I'm really not excited by anything I'm seeing here.Is there something interesting to do in Kenshi? Maybe, but it's hiding itself pretty well thus far. I really like the idea of a post-apocalyptic, open-world RPG where you can do more-or-less what you like, but give me something to work with here.It really doesn't feel like anything close to a finished game. I bought it on sale, thankfully. I'd be furious if I had paid full price for this.			"

When this game comes to full i belive it will be one of the more magnificent gamestyles to date. Lo-Fi Games, you know how to make a good game10/10			"

								Had a rough start with this game, crashed several times before I'd even gotten past the menus, crashed once or twice since then when I tried to build walls, usually some bug or glitch around the corner, and the current 'stable' steam version really through a curve at me when I neared the end of the tech tree only to discover the pathfinding doesnt work at all for some late game tech.Finally I found out that the latest version 0.72.1 can be played on steam via the beta settings, and its a lot better than the stable release (0.69.2 or something), not perfect by any means, but definately an improvement, so despite the continuing pathfinding problems, the odd ragdoll physics, and the missing features, I still really like this game and I've just gotten started with the 'forgotten construction set.exe', so;all-in-all its not a good game yet, though it is actually quite fun.

								I have been following Kenshi for a long time now and have loved the game from it's first almost featureless and buggy Alpha release to it's current state. This is an ambitious project to create a game that should hopefully become a classic. This game will never have multiplayer. Nor should it. A coop mode would be great, however a large part of this game is the atmosphere from playing this single player.All of that aside even the Alpha version has a charm to it and I have spent hundreds of hours wandering around a silent desert with my little band, fighting bandits and training up my characters. I find the game very relaxing and peaceful. I am almost aprehensive about the updates. Even if Kenshi winds up dying a slow development hell death, the engine and the work that has already been done would be fascinating to build on. I will be keeping an eye on Kenshi for a long time to come yet. :)			"

								A very different take on post-apocalyptic survival. The squad based tactics and the slow grinding to get,well anything, was both frusterating and rewarding. Of course with every game there are bugs, but the constant update schedule will make taking the bugs easier. Since you are'nt the chosen one, or any super special character, there are no real burdens of resposibility thrown at you. For the first hour I played, I killed a guy and was carrying the body, just to drop it toff a cliff. Marvelous.Overall its a good game that keeps getting better.			"

								tl;dr This game isn't for everyone but if you love open world sand box games you can easily mod yourself and play anyway you want you should get a kick out of this game.Kenshi is an open world sandbox for you to create your own goals and achieve them any way you want. It can be played as a solo character (lone samurai) type, or you can control a whole suad and build a town, researching and gathering your resources along the way, or you can even play as a trader by hiring your own in-town characters to manage your local business management (This is my favourite as it allows for powerful growth and you can learn the trading trends).Unfortunately there is not a ton of optimization going on here. The way I play, I have my squad dispersed across the whole (GIANT) map and I have to jump between them regularily, although there is no loading screen, it takes a couple seconds each time, and when you are doing things like just checking prices or looting multiple towns at once, it can be a little annoying.The $20 price may seem like a lot for the performance you have to deal with but by no means should that scare you away from this. There is only one guy making this game so the progress isn't terribly fast but he has been working hard on better game performance and addressing the needs and wants of the community.			"

								After playing this game for a few hours. I have to say that this game has a HUGE potiential to be a great game like mount&blade warband. This game is like when u combine the sims 3 with fluid fighting animations.There is no lvl up system only skills learn, death for everyone even ur character, building ur own base and a fight for survival from the other factions.This game is definitely worth checking out despite it's numerous amount of bugs.It is a early access game so dont expect a bug free experience. 7/10 with bugs 9/10 without bugs. It would be better if the game had a quest system,Dialogues, factions u can join which i read it would be implemented,more in depth to the characters and ranks in the army of the faction u are in like you starting from a recruit and rising through the ranks of the army and your squad which u join.Would recommend to everyone I know :)			"

								Okay when I first downloaded the kenshi it was something 0.40. Man it was ugly. BUT dont you dare to judge the cookie on its looks rather than taste. No Seriously. My first encounter with Kenshi was from tag ""RPG"" I was like uh okay why not give it a try. Graphic ugly but it hardly matters in rpg games its just an extra. I had a ton of fun with it bulding things, going to town to town trying to get supplies and recruits trainig even capturing cannibals as traning bags to be released in full power on one on one match to raise block skill. The game is in early access please keep it in mind when you're deciding to buy. It has lot of features starting as an retired capitan for example boosts your starting stats in fights but leaves your pockets empty and one faction seriously♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that they want you dead. Very good solution for starters are to loot weapons from bandits when they attacking the town OR you lure them but be warned you're not superhero you're just an human with barely any special traits at all. If you want to outrun bandits first learn how to scram really fast or they'll catch up and probably kill you. But exacly that it is about a struggle to survive to build first outpost to gather resources and money for them. Though theres no quest lines yet theres still plenty to do max up technology gather as much resources as you can and better equipment whenever its possible buy blueprints that dont comes cheap and most important harden your main character as well your team mates. And for god sake think. Dont fight with 2 hostile parties that already is fighting with each other. Wait a bit till battle end and finish them off looting as much as you can. You dont want to get caught in battle versus 3 other hostile to you squads. Trust me			"

Early Access Review
A small note, my time spent on Steam is incorrect as I've spent most of my time playing off Steam and I originally started playing Kenshi with the release of 0.23.1.Quick and Easy    Kenshi is both easy and hard to define. What is it right now? A sandbox game set in an apocalyptic wasteland where technology is scarce and life might as well not be lived. It is filled with the quirks of an alpha, bugs galore, crashes, poor optimization, and unfinished content. Now don't take that the wrong way, as it is now, this game is definetly worth playing. It may take a while to understand what to do as the game forces you to make your own objectives, but once you do know what this game has to offer, you'll be spending countless hours fiddling around trying to build your own towns, trade, train troops, slaughter bandits, raze cities, declare war on the Holy Empire or even do a 1 man army playthrough as I am now. Oh, and Kenshi has the ability to be modded easily to fit your needs and provide custom content, so I expect some amazing stuff from you guys! One thing I do I have to mention though is starting out a new save is fairly slow and tedious You can avoid this by using a start that has boosted stats like ""The Retired Captain.""as you have to train your first few characters to reasonable stats, and I often find myself just letting it take care of the first 15 points in each stat by itself while I watch videos. Despite all the fun you can have now the real reason to buy Kenshi isn't what it already offers, but the depth and features it CAN offer. Like most of the Steam Early Access titles, it has an extensive list of features it would like to include some day. However unlike most of the other S.E.A. titles it is actually adding these features! You can find the roadmap on the lofigames webite. Kenshi is very much a niche game which can fufill alot of our wishes even with the limited content it has. An observation some of us Kenshi players have made is that even though Mount & Blade is very different, people that have enjoyed Mount & Blade often enjoy Kenshi. So hey, if you enjoyed M&B, you may want to grab the money in your wallet you had sitting there for pizza and just start tossing it at your monitor. If you have any questions or want me to elaborate on something or even give tips, feel free to add me and ask away.			"

								The game is still in alpha, but the amount of content being added is great. It recieves regular updates, and more than just simple bug fixes. Most updates include new features such as the recent addition to harpoon turrets to defend your base. Current version is 0.69.0. The game has music and sound now. Many improvements have been made to the stability of the game.My original statement of the game was that it had more than enough content to keep you busy for hours upon end. This is still true, even more so now. The combat system is great, for a squad based RTS. I really love the health and damage system. Still needs a little work, and he still needs to make the troops hold their weapons with a closed hand, but it works for now :pHaving an individual health bar for multiple body parts is interesting and brilliant. If the health for your guys arm goes too low, his arm becomes useless and just flops around. For the legs, he begins to limp heavily. Its fun to have a great big fight, then see the casualties stumbling onwards showing signs of their beating.Most importantly, this game does not hold your hand or treat you like a child. You will lose fights. You will be horribly beaten to a pulp. But you will get up, and fight harder. No magical being is going to swoop down and save you when you are moments from death. Only your allies or your own training can save your life.This game is now going for $19.99 ($17.99 if you get it during the current summer sale) and is worth every penny. I have no regrets about buying into this early access, as this developer actually earns our hard earned money by releasing high quality content. Try it out.			"

								There are so many good things I have to say about this game - so many in fact that I'm not going to bother listing them. All I'm going to say is that if you like strategy, customization, deep gameplay, end-of-world/survival scenarios, beautiful music, or just enjoy challenging games that don't hold your hand every step of the way, then kenshi is certainly a game for you. This game is so huge and has so much to it (with much more on the way) that it is a shining example of what every big game aspires to. The fact that it is still in developmentserves only to amaze me as I imagine what will come next. Even as I write this review the few complaints and issues I have for this game are being worked out and many of those have already been fixed. Updates are regular and comprehensive with the community enjoying contact with developmers in a way that only an indie can provide.In short this game is amazing with a huge amount of potential, and something I would definately recomend.Also the music is so good that I sometimes sit at the menu screen just to listen to hear it :D			"

For anybody who remembers Battle Realms for the PC, Kenshi strikes some similar chords, on a much bigger instrument. The game, if finished, promises to be an epic.			"

								This game is showing promise of being a really great game. I have owned it for almost a a year now and well it has not let me down. Even is its current unfinished and highly unpolshied state I find my self always coming back after each update. The developers have also shown great dedication by keeping us posted via there website, facebook, and on steam. Any fan of this game style I would highly recommend to I know I have gotten it for a few friends as a gift.My only dislike of this game.....its not finished but as you can tell so far it seem like it will be well worth the wait.

								Okay when I first downloaded the kenshi it was something 0.40. Man it was ugly. BUT dont you dare to judge the cookie on its looks rather than taste. No Seriously. My first encounter with Kenshi was from tag ""RPG"" I was like uh okay why not give it a try. Graphic ugly but it hardly matters in rpg games its just an extra. I had a ton of fun with it bulding things, going to town to town trying to get supplies and recruits trainig even capturing cannibals as traning bags to be released in full power on one on one match to raise block skill. The game is in early access please keep it in mind when you're deciding to buy. It has lot of features starting as an retired capitan for example boosts your starting stats in fights but leaves your pockets empty and one faction seriously♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that they want you dead. Very good solution for starters are to loot weapons from bandits when they attacking the town OR you lure them but be warned you're not superhero you're just an human with barely any special traits at all. If you want to outrun bandits first learn how to scram really fast or they'll catch up and probably kill you. But exacly that it is about a struggle to survive to build first outpost to gather resources and money for them. Though theres no quest lines yet theres still plenty to do max up technology gather as much resources as you can and better equipment whenever its possible buy blueprints that dont comes cheap and most important harden your main character as well your team mates. And for god sake think. Dont fight with 2 hostile parties that already is fighting with each other. Wait a bit till battle end and finish them off looting as much as you can. You dont want to get caught in battle versus 3 other hostile to you squads. Trust me			"

								Kenshi in a word is"" Rare"". Ive not had much interest in this odd themed games of post technology future esk genre but this one is by far the most enjoyable game that has been in my library. That is not to say there are not any faults with this game but rather then break the entire experience they only feel minor. I cannot recommend this enough to anyone since all the time things are being dicussed with the dev team which has grown and been very interactive with its community. Note though this game is difficult sometimes to understand and to be honest the pacing could be a bit off but that adds to the game rather then retract it. Enough of the fan writing, lets get down into a more focused view. What is Kenshi? to me it is a sandbox rpg with tactical aspectas finely blended in with management of a town you can build according to your own visions, this by far is the most fun but due to the (sometimes) brutal power of the enemy. The controls are solid if a bit complex in that you have to take time to learn which tab goes where but in most games that is a norm.The character creation is well endowed but not too overly difficult to use which can allow for some hilarious creations. Finally the combat, which is quite refreshing as you cant overly control your party or singular character and when ppl die, they stay dead which to me is a +. overall id say take this game for a spin if there is a demo and if you believe this is a game for you then id say go for it!P.S. there are creatures and not just the same human enemies, however the animals... They are terrifying :(			"

								This game is very fun and very in depth. But a word of warning :If you are trying to jump into this don't expect a full immersion immediatley. You really do have to earn it in this. You start off with the bare minimum depending on what class you choose and you evolve from there. You an literally build a town from scratch. And this is not Sim CIty. You have to mine for raw ore then process it and then you may use the resource ot construct your city. It's a very rewarding game. It is also very challenging at times with multiple different clans or what ever you wish to call them attcking you out of random. It's still iin development so give it a break. It does have its bugs and crashes. But I love it.			"

								Day 1: I woke up in the middle of the desert with no memory of the fight before hand. I lay in a land of dead bodies and blood stained sand. I look to my left and see my best friend in bad condition, He needs medical attention soon or else he isnt going to pull through.Day 2: After one day of wandering the arid wasteland I spot a city in the distance, A rusty, metal beacon of hope in the distance. A surge of energy surges through me as I still drag my un-consious friend through the sand and into the city. As I reach the gates I find the town in havoc. Guards and civilians fighting off bandits and even a few sand ninja`s. I place my friend in a safe place and jump into the frey, hardly stoping to think about my deep wounds.Day 3: The battle was long and painful. I broke my arm and badly hurt my leg during the enormous fight that took place in the town`s bar. The sun was rising and as its rays kissed my bloodied skin I stood to look around the massacre that had taken place. My best friend still clinging onto life I left him in the hands of a inn-keeper who saw to his wounds. I noticed no-one decided to scavenge what was left of the bandits so I took my chance and made a decent amount of money selling the gear, Even lucky enough to find a sand ninja`s gear who was caught in the fight. Day 8: After a few days of baiting bandits into towns and watching them get slaughtered, I soon made a good amount of cats from the gear no-one ever seemed to take. I returned to the inn to check upon my friend to find him in fighting condition. On his feet and consious once more I embraced him as relief overtook my body. Using the cats I had earnt over the past week I geared my friend and I in military gear and set off on an adventure to avenge our lost brother`s on a journy that would be filled with loss, pain and bloodshed.Kenshi is truely a game where each decision you make can effect the world around you. Will you become a bounty hunter? A warlord? or even a thrill seaking farmer? Each decsion should always  be thought through and accesed based on how it can help you and your band of merry men. if you are looking for an modern RPG, give the game time. NPC interaction isnt a big thing yet, however if you are looking for a classic RPG where you simply go after power and wealth this is definatly up your alley.			"

								A squad surival and base building game set in a desert apocalypse.In other words a game you should be playing already.The big pros right now are a dynamic combat system centred around team work and modular base building. Essentially you can build any base you want (almost anywhere) you want it. It is also continously being improved and updates. Whilst slow the updates usually add significant amount of content.The cons are a rather shallow world with not allot happening in it. The combat gets boring. The base serves no real purpose. There is no goal. Even survival gets assured at some point so surviving the post-apocalypse stops being a problem after you build a self reliant impregnable settlement.There also some bugs but really the enjoyment of the game outweighs it and a few bumps are to be suspected in an WIP game. The game runs smoothly and is playable.			"

								Kenshi is the game that I think other games can learn from. The freedom that Kenshi gives you is probably the most I've ever had in a video game. Be it trading for riches, starting a colony, or trying to solo everything, Kenshi lets you try. I say try because the game is !@$#ing hard. It takes time to get used to it and is slightly unforgiving, but in the end it's all worth it.			"

The most interesting RPG everI didnt know much about Kenshi untill it was recommended to my by steam. Browsing trough the trailers and steam store page i was immidietly hooked as it looked like ""real time strategy"" with build elements and multiple characters to play at once with its unique EXP and skill system that lets you make everyone custom to certain tasks (Soldier, Builder, Farmer...)The game also offers a wast open world that keeps getting bigger within the updates as the developer keeps on building more to it wich offers an interesting ""Lets go on an adventure"" kind of aspect.Good: RTS/RPG (The game is a mix of real time strategy and role playing game that gives it a really unique style) Freedom (Ability to be who you want or do what you will as well as letting you setup a camp where you want is so pleasing) Difficult (Kenshi feels quite hard at times wich makes you want to keep pushing that one extra mile to achieve something great like the new upgrades for your settlements)Bad: Graphics (Kenshi seems to suffer from its early access nature where the graphics havent been polished yet so they feel quite outdated or plain broken at times) Framerate (Sometimes the game keeps freezing for few seconds while doing long travels and time to time the framerate can drop to unplayable rates) Bugs (Several crashes have occured occasionally)Kenshi is a solid game even on its early access state and i can only recommend that anyone whos interested would give it a try as its a really unique experience that can only get better with future updates.

								Honestly one of the most unique games I've ever seen out there. Its not just a game you pick up and play, you learn so much and its extremely hard to be successful. You have to be tough to face the challenges the world presents and have a good team assembled. The Combat is incredible because units dont have 1 lifebar, but 6 or 7, for every part of their body. Your characters can die if they lose too much blood, the work their doing on the new biomes is amazing. Theyve created their own creatures, designed a new style of wolf-like creatures, their own races. Its like post apocalyptic samurais and ninjas. Seriously suggest this game, you will thoroughly enjoy its bitter lifestyle. Budkai has a good series which shows the most recent patches! Check it out!

								I noticed that some people claimed the developer has abbandoned the project. What I'm going to tell you is that this shouldn't be of the least concern because as it is right now it's already worth the price, if you're willing to take a few bugs. I will not bore you with the implications of an early access title. You all should know it by now, I won't state the obvious, but what I experienced. I can only say that Kenshi's dev team handles things more responsible than a lot of those which went down the drain. Still, they are bound by resource constraints. So, now for the 'fun'(?) part.Does this game deserve your money and time? Short answer: Yes.Long answer (even though nobody will ever go through this):LEGGIT (or face inevitable death)!You are no one; Broke, with equipment that causes every starving bandit to burst into laughter. It is a steep path to 'King of the Desert' (subject to change once new biomes are added). You will run, you will be knocked unconscious, you will be wounded. The secret to success in Kenshi: What doesn't kill you makes you stronger (but what does kill you... well, kills you). But eventually, once you've looted gear off dead bandits you lured to some city guards, your own story begins. Recruit fellow guys and girls (and give them tremendously oversized... uhm, yeah, you get it) and build a squad of awesomeness that gradually becomes what most RPG heroes are in the first place: Da boss. Roam the desert and basically do whatever pops up in your mind. Turn up squad size to see how many bad guys your pawns (and your PC) can handle, build an economic powerhouse that produces top-notch booze (just kidding, weapons... but you can do that, too). At this point it becomes kind of a RPSG (Role-playing strategy game). If you like bori... uhm, peaceful stuff, you can trade, too, but damn, combat just makes more fun with the animations and very decently made combat system and AI. You don't control your mob directly but through tactical decisions.The path is long, but extremely rewarding (as illustrated by my playtime). Reaching the peak takes some times, but offers many milestones on the way. And the peak is being pushed out further with every update. It has been a while since the last update, but the next one that apparently is supposed to be released soon while feature some stuff that further polishes and expands the gameplay and world. Every update makes me cheer as much as new episode of my favourite series because they are significant. The possibility for modding also exists.Concluding, at the price of ~20$/€, it offers a magnificient bargain for the time it keeps you entertained. Still not convinced? Bummer, put it on your wishlist and grab it on sale like I did.			"

This quickly became one of my favorite games, I've bought it for friends just so they could experience it too.If you like open ended extremely customizable worlds I would recomend this game. No two playthroughs are ever the same, and there are many different play styles.I would give it a 9/10, which I'll change to a 10/10 when the game is complete.I would also praise the Dev team who has relatively frequent patches, and keep players up to date.

I guess I was just disapointed that I had not seen any progress for a while :).The game itself shows a lot of promise, the idea behind the game is quite unique, the combat system interesting and the squad system pretty basic. They have developed a technological tree and base construction, great sandbox elements. They have an interesting market system with active trade routs, wandering bandits and several differant factions.			"

Therefor I will recomend this game in its current state, but buy it at your own risk because only curtain types of players will be able to enjoy something as buggy and as content lacking as this.I would like people to know though that Kenshi has a lot of potential to become one of the best games of all time in the future, but that's what I think anyways...

								Where to start off with Kenshi, I bought this near the start of it's development and I was wary and almost even regretting my purchase before I played it. As soon as I booted up the game I was confronted with a primitive menu so I decided to take the plunge and start a new game. The character creator was very limited and you could barely customise the base model at all and so I just decided to leave my character as default and get into the game. Oh boy, desert as far as the eye can see. I really was not enjoying my first half hour on Kenshi but I stuck to it and eventually when I got used to the gameplay and mechanics I was oddly enjoying myself. I didn't mind that there was no sound at the time, I didnt mind that it was nothing but desert, I didn't mind the skeleton menu and character creator. I was building my own village, smithing weapons and mining resources. Bandits would come once in a while only to be beaten by my assorted cohort of slave labourers all armed with massive two handed weapons. The combat in this game is satisfying, limbs can be disabled and you will need to have medkits handy when your peons are♥♥♥♥♥♥at fighting. There's a lot to be completed before Kenshi should be released, new biomes is what I want to see first. Music has been added and sounds great. Graphics have been improving over time and even the character creator is more fleshed out now. Overall, I'd reccomend Kenshi if you're willing to support an early access game, if not wait till it's released. It's flawed, but it's fun.			"

Run for your life as sand ninjas chase you to the ends of the earth, catch you and leave you for dead. Pray cannibals don't find you before you regain conciousness.

If i'm wasting this much time with the alpha (+experimental beta at the time of writing this review). then i can't even imagine how much the game will suck me in with its full release.Kenshi is ROUGH, very punishing, but at the same time rewards your hardships. As long as something doesn't kill you, you will come back stronger. I honestly don't know any other games that rewards you for getting kicked in the face.			"

								This game has a lot of potential I am having fun with it right now though I do experience many crashes. This is sometimes a bummer but it does teach you to save your progress more often. I also run into some problems like the other day I had to start a new game as over half of my people got stuck on a wall with no way off. Stuff like this happens from time to time but you can still enjoy the game as they create it while your playing.Dig Deep!			"

								Hands down favorite game of all time.This game is amazing for hardcore gamers! You start as a nothing, a nobody, you AREN'T SPECIAL! You run and run away alot in the begining but eventually if you play it smart you will train yourself and hopefully your party/clan of random rejects into a force to be reckoned with. This is coded by one or two guys so updates are slow but their vision has unlimited potential and is still fantastic being in such an early stage. Highly suggest this game for anyone who likes a challenge of starting with nothing and working hard so your character can become something. And don't hesitate to run away from everything in the begining!			"

Early Access Review
								This game. Just wow. As soon as i hopped in the game, i felt immersed in the world; Being thrown into a desolate, vast, empty desert, and with the old-west style music low in the background, makes me feel as though im really out wandering a dangerous wasteland alone.I started off with the default starting choice ( there are multiple choices: default guy at a town, group founding their own settlement, trader, etc). I found myself at Shark, and i was eager to head out in the world. The desert is a very dangerous place however, with dangers from roving bandit groups that will tear you apart if they see you. I spent my early days training on dummies and scavenging loot from the aftermath of battles between rival bandits and the occasional guard patrol. Pretty soon i gathered up a few companions and headed out into the unforgiving land.This game is seriously beautiful. But not in the way other games do it, but by the beautiful vast empiteness of the desert. Seeing how small and insignificant you are really adds to the feel. The landscape and building textures are great, the battles are friggin' awesome, and I cant wait until more updates come out.			"

								,,,a constantly-improving desert world similar to earth on a baser level, Kenshi is the upper crust of open-ended gameplay, independent control and detail to each character while maintaing a squad-based role play game. Build towns, mercenary outposts, roam as a trading band or be at war with anything that moves, and maintain every detail of the particular operation. Great Early Release and Worth the $20 bucks, with a plethora of information, and an active community. Recent to the alpha release, I find my idle time returning for more Kenshi.			"

								Having been disappointed in early access many a time before, I was apprehensive about picking up this title. On top of that, I'm not really a fan of the RTS genre. Well I'll have you know that this is the best early access I have ever played. The game itself is still quite buggy and far from complete. However, what exists now is a fantastic foundation showing an immense amount of promise. Even the devs and admins are fantastic. Posting a problem on the community hub often yields a trouble shoot session with one of them. They are as nice and helpful as can be. I really hope to see the company go far in the future. Will be 10/10 when complete			"

								This game is very fun and very in depth. But a word of warning :If you are trying to jump into this don't expect a full immersion immediatley. You really do have to earn it in this. You start off with the bare minimum depending on what class you choose and you evolve from there. You an literally build a town from scratch. And this is not Sim CIty. You have to mine for raw ore then process it and then you may use the resource ot construct your city. It's a very rewarding game. It is also very challenging at times with multiple different clans or what ever you wish to call them attcking you out of random. It's still iin development so give it a break. It does have its bugs and crashes. But I love it.			"

Early Access Review
								To whom my review may concern (that even means you gamers, whom found pleasure in this game.) So lets cut the chase, so what did you think this game was gonna be? A RTS, A RPG? Why not a combination of both, and ya know what ladies, gents. It did pretty damn good for being beta, it has done well with the system it has set up, and you know what. I'm contempt with spending my twenty bucks. Now, lets boil this game down, like we can do salt to water. Let's start with...hmmm...I don't know. Graphics. I give them a 78%. A good, decent grade from where I come from. I'll go ahead, and state something right now. To all who complain that the graphics are buggy, or that it lags when trying to do the graphics. Congratulations, you now know what a BETA is. If you say the graphics suck, then you'd be wrong...very wrong. Graphics inside of gaming have been radically improved, and some old (Powerful) engines have begun to become free to the public. Needlessly saying, Kenshi is using a good grapic engine. A solid one at that. So when people I see complain about the grapics on this game, I see some fair points. The buildings have, on occusaion, had sand dunes in them. The cities would not come into the world, when you started a new game, when you got mad at your last one. So yeah, fair points, but Graphic code. By term of use, is very hard, and complicated. In fact, the simple desert world in Kenshi, is stunningly atmosphereic. I say, in all good faith, that this is just the beginning of a long list of improvements. Now, to the fair points, I would like diversity. Forests, plains, rivers, maybe oceans. I don't know, but I am content with a desert for now. Cause I understand that it takes a lot to make a game on your own, and develope it. Cause many forget, it takes BIG companies three years to even pump a next gen game. This guy is trying his best in the graphic department. So if he decides to hire on extra coders, then so be it. If he does not, then I hope he can improve the theme of the atmosphere. But, I would also like to note. That graphics don't make a game good. Let's talk about...GAME PLAY!Kenshi is a hybird, a rareity. Which is a masterpiece, or absoulte failure. There really is not a single in-between. In this catagory, Kenshi is actually very good. I give it a 89%. I love the functions, I love how (Sometimes) smooth your orders are carried. Hell the resource system, and how you not held to bounty hunting is a relieve. Though, lets be honest, the big money is in big game hunting (tis a fail joke, no?) I love it, I love it, don't backtrack. Just keep moving forward on this catagory. I would only make one suggestion...If it's in anyway possible, try to employ a class system. Though not a locked one, like when you create your character. Do you want him to have a better strength in weapon use, or do you want him to build like an adept. Gives him more survivablity in the harsh world. Now, with that said, I'd love moble archer units. Like a class unit, it'd be nice. But, I can only get, what they can make. So I am contempt. Now, moving forward, how about we...spice things up a bit. NPC, NPC developement, VARIETY and AI action. Kenshi, for all insentive, is very scarce in the form of animal life. But, it's set in a desert, so it fits the theme (until you make a forest, I am impressed) However, that being said, the opposite is for human life. Mainly, those who'd like to chope your head off. Or, seek shelter from the hostile waste, maybe looking for...a bite...with you. Needless to say, I don't give a immidiate grade, because I am going to explain it, very detailed. (Warning total nerd alert ahoy, ye wish to keep a sense of normality, please skip!) NPC, I love the illusion of variety, and amount. The illusion is the names of some of them. Like Samurai lords, to Paladins. They function the same, and you know what, they should. They're elite warriros, and they should act the same accordingly. Though I want to point out something. There is a problem with that statement, in that problem, can cause...a death of a good game. VARIETY! That's right, VARIETY. I want to say, that it has it, because you can create new followers from an existing models. I respect that simple, and easy appoarch. Because, it gets the job done. It gives a sense of immersion. But, with that said, the NPC should have a lot more dialouge. I mean, it's all okay right now, since it's in BETA. But, if the game should ever hit full fledge release, and hit the same issues. I am going to be mildly disappointed.I know your team works hard, but I might suggest focusing on character development for NPC. Like have a relationship system, where if you save someone with a character, they get a status as a friend. Perhaps as lovers, I don't know. Then they'd get a bonus for being near them in combat. Similar to star ocean series. Which is a good game series.So why would I bunch this all up? Because, they're interwoven. That also reminds me, why not impliment child NPC's? It would add a unique element to the gameplay, where the player may feel a need to keep some people more safe than others. Have the feeling of making the hard choices, that come with the desert living?Also, on the creation tab for your character creation module. I noticed a blacked out selection for HUMAN, and I wonder. Are you planning to add more to this world, than just human characters? (if so, I love this game enough, but jesus...I may be addicted) Also, let's talk AI. They are, and I repeat, they are running good. Why? Says the seventh game, just right before this review, I got beaten bad. They are competent, they are mean killing machines. They also do what they are made to do, and CIVILIANS will run. So that's good to see. (not everyone will fight.) So, lets go through the list (I got one more to go, but lets get a recount, and count. Graphics-78%^ (note this could change in later updates) Gameplay-89%VARIETY-68%^(note this could change in later reviews, and updates)NPC-77% Story (note I can't talk about it, because it lacks one, only evidence of factions. So I'll rate through lore)-74%RTS component-88%RPG component-73%AI (screw the freaking dust bandits!)-84%So lets talk about more of the future, and I got one thing to say...it's lookin good!Average rating: 78.875 (or...) 79%A solid C rank (Naruto...fan...shut...up...ya know.) WARNING WARNING, this is only BETA grade, flame shield is one, repeat flame shield is on! "

Early Access Review
								Definitely a sweet freeflow RPG game, believe it was one of the first games (or at least first 3) to get greenlit, although I had purchased the game before that. Lately the dev has been overhauling the game, finally implementing long promised things and getting near to completion. The game is extremely fun, with very meaty updates improving the game constantly. Definitely one of the best indie games i have ever played. The game basically has freeform gameplay, there is no story, it basically currently consists of factions and you create your own story and gameplay. you can be a psycho bandit, a cowardly merchant, a warlord for your favorite faction. Its extremely addicting and has become far better the last month, with new realistic 3D models, with brand new textures for items and upcoming audio and massive terrain updates, the game will be amazing. Definitely check it out, lofigames.com, along with surviving the apocalypse in  Project Zomboid, at  projectzomboid.com. Both with increasing prices as they near completion currently as it stands  - 9/10 overallEDIT: The dev is really hauling♥♥♥♥♥last year or so to finish the game. I didn't realize how outdated my review was. There is audio in the game consisting of a soundtrack and sound effects (has been for awhile), theres a wide variety wildlife, a new map (Although only about half or so is implemented as of right now, it is still amazing. There's trees, grass, mountains, rocks, water... the old map was a sandy desert in africa with like 1 broken tree every 600 miles) tons and tons and tons of new features (thievery, prisoners, the AI management in construction, researching, start scenarios, medical system overhaul, major graphical updates, an entirely redone UI, a tutorial window with text and images, new players models and character customization (there is like 5 races now, it used ot be Tribal or Human and they were identical, now its Human, a weird buglike alien, a ""skeleton"" which is actually like a ghetto C3PO droid, and one or two others). The game is still amazing and it's nice to see it nearing completion. I honestly never thought this would outpace Project Zomboid, as this was primarily developed by one crazy awesome guy with outsourcing until about the last year. The only thing, which in my opinion doesn't matter as the story is told through your gameplay, like Rimworld, is there is no story and I don't think there ever will be. You story is your starting scenario, are you a disgruntled War Veteran wandering the wastes for work? Religious pioneers looking to build their own city, A dirty thief that stole a powerful Holy sword from a body in a battle? It affects your startign relations, gear, and funds and allows you to roleplay the game, or jsut start with what you want. The whole point is it is highly interactive and realistic. You can do WHAT you want. Be a bandit, setup a thriving trade city producing fantastic weapons and armor, or sell crops and luxuries. Start your own faction and go to war. Live as a hermit. The AI react to you so through a reputation and morale system. If you execute a band of Holy empire soldiers you will receive a bounty and they will know you and attack you. Your base might be raided by bandits. Or a town might be raided and you can choose to save it, or join in the looting. You really can do so much and I feel like this is a vastly underappreciated entrance to the RPG genre. EDIT2: Lately the developer has also posted an announcement that features are being cut from the game that were initially promised, and while he plans to implement most eventually (maybe), I think that is kind of unfortunate for a game thats been in an alpha/beta development for like 7 years. The biggest ones that were a selling point that initially the developer seemed VERY keen on implementing were robotic limbs and being able to replace them with prosthetics or even high quality robotics. I do feel the game is more than worth getting, but it is unfortunate that the developer is now stating the audience potentially misread many of his long standing commits, such as a dynamic campaign. Developer states it is dynamic basically because some things are random, like you choose to attack the bandits, or build the town, the game no longer reacts to the depth that was hoped for initially, such as impressions, memory, revenge. Kind of a crappy explanation, but basically his definition of dynamic does not match mine. When I think dynamic, i think Arma 3 like DUWS, a randomly generated campaign with random missions/order and random placement, lots of random/procedural generation. Hopefully these get in the game post release in a timely manner, as this has been a game that I've used as a demonstration on how to do Early Access, even if a little slow, and it would be a shame to have things cut out.

								i bought the game on sale. the game is still in development. If you like city building, a little mix of Mad Max and samurai action this is the game for you. All the content and bugs are not out yet  but the game has potential. I cant say its a bad buy because its not. I give this game an entertaining stamp of approval.BOY COULD I EVER BE WRONG! I gave this an excellent review because the game has POTENTIAL but you have to look at the the entire picture. I do believe the story that their is one guy doing everything possibly milking the game, yes i do. When you look at how far the updates are and just dribble nothing major has been done to this game since its release.  If you just want to spend your money on something that most likely will never be completed this is it.They have made some big improvement since the last review the game is coming along slowly but i like what they are doing. Optimization is still lacking and you should not play this game on a lower end computer because demands are great. Once the tech portion is done the game will be awesome. My computer cost more than most peoples cars and the demands are great.			"

								Please do not be turned off by the iffy trailers and wierd looking animations/graphics! This is one of the most immersive, engrossing & deep games I have played since the good old days when sanbox MMOs (SWG, EvE online) were still in vogue. If you like any of those games or if you like freeform sandbox RPGs like Mount & Blade, Elder Scrolls, Dwarf Fortress etc., then this is an absolute must buy. The freedom Kenshi grants you is unrivaled; you can play as anything from a slave to a merchant to leader of a ruthless bandit clan. It features deep settlement building mechanics, complex combat systems, classic stat-based character building, emergent story-telling where no two playthroughs will be the same & it has some light survival elements. What more could you possibly want from a game? The setting is super weird and compelling too. Kinda reminds me of Morrowind with the general alien-ness of the fauna/flora and the palpable cultural differences between each faction.,This is probably the most underrated title on steam; incredibly ambitious and it's already come such a long way for an early access title.

I'm literally enjoying it and it's super fun to play. Lo-Fi Games, keep doing what you do.

								I bought this game ages ago, when the entire map was one big desert, and even in that limited state, I had plenty of fun with it. The dimple fact that you can build your own base is sure to entertain you for a good handfull of hours, since the resources are hard to come by, and you have to defend it against invaders and other nasty beasties. It's a pain at first, you're scrawny and barelly able to hold your own against even the weakest enemy, but eventually, you'll look down on your progress and it will be time to take your sweet sweet revenge.

								Ok so this is my first game review on Steam so I wanted to make sure that I had enough time into a game before reviewing it.  After 130+ hours in this game I can honestly say that I can't wait for more. This game has everything that I was looking for.  It's a sandbox, base building, crafting, combat, trading game all rollled into one.  You start at the bottom and if you don't do something about it you'll stay there.  You must get into combat where the odds are not in your favor, you must explore, you must do a lot of stuff but above all, you must try this game.			"

								For my first game review on Steam, I'll Keep this fairly short.This game has amazing features, and though it's early access, with a lot of bugs, There is nearly endless replay value. The way this game is played won't be for everyone, which is fine. Although, if you're a fan of squad based survival RPG's, this game is one of a kind.Be warned, this game can be very unforgiving. I'd bet there's a good 80% chance you'll die, so be prepared to experience many different means of ""RETREAT!"".This is an Amazing game, Dev's. Thank you to all who support this game as well.11/10 - Would get murdered by endless Sand Ninja again.			"

								Kenshi has a lot of potential but Is still in development, that said it's already very good for a work in progress.It takes time to build something up in this game (which can be good but is sometimes a little bit boring) and the enemys are pretty tought at the begining (I recomend gettting a katana to make the Character faster in combat and don't be ashamed to run away from danger (I ran A LOT!!) and avoid heavy armour at the begining It only makes you slow.AND FOR THE LOVE OF THE VARIOUS GODS, DO NOT PUT ON A METAL HELMET!!A good startegy is to lure enemy hordes to a town, have the guards kill them (hurray for Guards), loot the dead enemys,sell their stuff, buy good equipment and hire allys (you'll have to train them) the bigger your group the more enemys you can take on.But avoid canibals they come in VERY large munbers.All in all kenshi is very unique rpg/strategy/buildup/Simulator(kinda)/managment/indie-game.And aside from some rages against trolling canibals, I Really like the game.

								This game is really fun, lots to do and is actually a challenge. Takes time to build things and get anywhere but its fun, the small bits of progression is rewarding. You can fully make your own character, kinda like the creation from oblivon, and you can higher tons of other people to join you, that you get to not only name, but create what they look like too! seems like the only frustrating part that iv'e come across is that it takes forever to get from place to place. Wish you could fast travel or something but for what this game is, its worth the 20$. Love the game mechanics too, haha its funny to watch a giant battle go down and see the friends of the bandits come pick up their lifeless bodies. Can't wait to see more for this game!!  Updated however, I had numerous problems after an update came out. I had to report these things called crash dump files for about 3 months, but they never was able to fix the problem. looks like just after I bought the game they changed it to need a better graphics card, so I ended up only being able to play this for a short while. Haha it was more like a really exspensive rental that Ill never be able to play again. If you have everything you need to play it Im sure its still good. However its kinda lame that the spec for the game changed after I payed for it.			"

								Umm early access?  This has been in early access mode for FOREVER.  Do not buy until 100% complete.I am amending my above statement.  Buy this game.  Although this game has been production for a long time, it seeems they are finally going to finish this game and they are coming up with regular updates.  I have played enough of the game that it is already worth my money as well.  When the finished game comes out i will at the minimum play 100 hours.  I think I already spent around that time already.  This game has amazing replay value as well.			"

Haven't played much, but enjoy what little I've played.Only cons I see are it's taxing on your PC with max everything, and the graphics are very very poor. The horrible quality of graphics is expected from an Alpha state game as Graphics aren't all too important when you're designing the core gameplay.

								Even in its alpha state, the game has had me want to play it. One thing that it excels at is making me care about my characters which other open world sandboxes don't see me doing. For one, the aesthetics of the buildable buildings and turrets really gives a great wasteland/post-apoc feel. I also enjoy the fact that in order for my characters to get better they have to get beaten up and nearly die before they can turn the tables.			"

								         Well as much as I want to rant about the bugs in the game and they are many.. I find myself really enjoying the randomness of the game, which at times can be very unfair with the new patches. For exmple: the  .75 patch they implenmented the thief with the police recongnition of stolen goods, and found myself in a battle with some anrgy officers over some boots i picked of  bandits lol.  i guess  i can say for  myself that i like the feeling not knowing whats next. in all kenshi fulfills the need of this for the most part. SOoo. is it worth it? yes!!... for $20 nah get when its on discount. =P			"

								Role play to your hearts content in this sandbox. Beta hit not long ago and man its great. There are quite a few ways you can choose to play from base building to theivery. Make a 30 man squad or go solo or anywhere in between. Factions bring the world to life and make your choices of race and even gender count. Craft gear, weapons, food, medical items, building materials... prison cells... kidnap the inquisitor and use him for a target dummy.. or a way to train your assination skills.The game can be pretty unforgiving at times but once you learn the ropes.. or at least some then its pretty darn fun. Its currently having features and the rest of the map worked on but theres plenty of a game to have fun with. Its been in development for quite a long time but the team is small and was just one man to begin with. But its sort of the guys dream and all the hard work of the team and this guy has really shown in the game. Specially since the beta hit. 20$ is a pretty good price for the game as it is now... and its gonna just get bigger so i would grab it and watch it grow if i were you.			"

I hope the dev team can keep making improvments, as it is its a pretty cool game. still buggy and slow with some wonky mechanics but its still beta so thats cool. I will be sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for updates!Right now It runs its full course in about 15 hours, once u get best weapons and decent armor and a band of hard hitting honchos its pretty fun to just run around destroying everything but after that there is nothing left so I would like to see more to do, questing, random events ext, to keep me interested.

								I've only played Kenshi 22 hours as of now and have found many bugs. it's especially buggy once you have over 20 people in your clan, lol.. I'm at 28 and half the time my people just sit there after i tell em to do something(lazy asses) and I have noticed in many ways how the screne shots above look nothing like in game.. for example the Map is a bit rough and hard to interpret but issues are to be expected in an Alfa. note though, even with the many bugs and various other gameplay issues this game is definitly worth the grab. as bad♥♥♥♥♥as the game and its buggs already are there is so much potential to be even more. i'd buy it again if i had to and I've already refered it to 3 of my friends one of wich bought it what whaaaat!. I'll review it again once i put some more time in and hopefully by then they will have fixed a good many of the bugs.			"

My rig is way beyond kenshi's requirements its just that the game is, massive, and because of that theres still alot of issues.  Its a blast though, and if you're patient its absolutely worth it, Otherwise i don't recommend this game for you in its present state.			"

So if you are impatient, easily bored, or prefer instant gratification then this probably aint the game for you.---------------------Kenshi is a squad based sandbox game that allows you to build, craft, personalize umits, and modify the game. All units skill up by doing when raising their skills. Which means the more you do something the better you get at doing it. This can reduce production time or increase the quality of the item being produced.You can build almost anywhere in the game. If you can walk there you can build there (provided it is not within the no build areas of existing towns.) Keep in mind just because you can build at a location does not mean your neighbors approve (including wildlife.) If you are too afraid of frontier settling then you can always rent building sin town and build what you want indoors.Be advised - Units were beaten, killed, maimed, eaten, starved to death, and abandoned during the alpha and beta testing of this game.

								I have played Kenshi off and on a LOT and I must say that the game truly is amazing, but there a lot of things that can still be done to make Kenshi snag you EVEN harder. For example, things like trade caravans, hiring troops in bulk for expensive prices and most of all. The only thing that I must say that really kills this game and actually makes me stop playing it is the consistant crashes. Everything I do causes this game to crash. Sometimes my people glitch under the ground, troops walk inside eachother. I LOVE Kenshi, I love the idea behind Kenshi and I love the progress they have made, but I want a nice smooth gameplay and it seems that the game is always updated with new content, but it's always glitchy. Guys, I give you a 4/5, but I see potential to be a 6/5. Please take my word for it you beautiful game-making team.			"

My favorite thing to do in this game is be self proclaimed ronin of the people and develop a bad a@@ squad of 7 that can defeat 4 or 5 times more enemies in one fight, however that takes a while to do which is kind of nice because you can go from peasant to super warriors in the period of 2-3 months			"

								Still great potential;I bought this game over a year ago and is has came a long way.... i fist played when it was exremely buggy but now there isnt that many bugs... its a great game and theres so much that can be added to it... very time consuming though... once you learn how to play its really simple.     PROS: 1. Game that makes time pass fast,2. Lots of materials and weapons so the game has a lot to offer,3. Big map with many towns and cities4. You can build your own little base/town5. Theres more pros than I can list X3     CONS: 1. When I wrote this review this is what I found... There is a good number of different bugs that randomly occur2. There is somewhat of a slow development First time playing after a year I just chose to have my own character... I decided to travel to another town... while I left the current town I was in I noticed people walking in the desert... I thought ill go say hey... I walked up to the group and i thought to myself i was like hey but then they wanted to slice their swords into my stomach so I booked it back to the town... I almost made it but they caught up to me and... well lets just say my guy apparently likes to just stand there surrounded and get murdered by bandits... once they left me unconcious they decided to loot me and leave me to die... my guy bleed out and that was the end of his journey... I started another game and have a gigantic base full of people... I make a lot of bread to sell to the fort nearby.			"

								back when i first started the game, i got the demo from the main website. would get the 5 person start - build settlement - when things started to look like they where going well, i had to abandon my settlement due to constant bandit attacks.then i got fallout 3 and i put the demo on the shelf for a whilecame back and tried again but this time bought the game remembering how much i liked it. and was able to get a simmeler outcome but i was ready to defend myself. lost somone but was able to recover and push the starving bandits back.last month - solostart w/dog, wandering desert mining iron ore to be able to buy a friend. starving bandits seem to see me starving as well and dont attack me right away. i can get away with full invantory of iron and sell it in an overly religous town for a loaf of bread and some building stones. rinse repeat - build a house in middle of nowhere and a research bench. stil selling iron ore to the city when i need something. bought a secconed friend and things are looking up.friend invited me to play overwatch and only now am i about to restart my journey...

								Ok so this is my first game review on Steam so I wanted to make sure that I had enough time into a game before reviewing it.  After 130+ hours in this game I can honestly say that I can't wait for more. This game has everything that I was looking for.  It's a sandbox, base building, crafting, combat, trading game all rollled into one.  You start at the bottom and if you don't do something about it you'll stay there.  You must get into combat where the odds are not in your favor, you must explore, you must do a lot of stuff but above all, you must try this game.			"

								I bought this game ages ago, when the entire map was one big desert, and even in that limited state, I had plenty of fun with it. The dimple fact that you can build your own base is sure to entertain you for a good handfull of hours, since the resources are hard to come by, and you have to defend it against invaders and other nasty beasties. It's a pain at first, you're scrawny and barelly able to hold your own against even the weakest enemy, but eventually, you'll look down on your progress and it will be time to take your sweet sweet revenge.

								Kenshi is totally fantastic. An RTS/RPG/Survival hybrid that's absurdly ambitious, but is consistantly marching towards its goals. Buy it now or buy it when it releases a full release version, it's up to you. It's definitely worth sinking a few dozen hours into either way.			"

Early Access Review
								While still in development, Kenshi shows a ton of promise for those that are interested in games with emergent storytelling. Establishing a small trading-post among a vein of iron ore deep in uncivilized territory, my band of 5 quickly grew into a bustling town. They fought off groups of bandits and feral creatures as they established themselves as a fairly affluent frontier colony, using the ore to both forge weapons to defend themselves and to trade for valuable resources with travelers and nearby towns.Then, one day, the bandits organized themselves into nothing short of a war-band. The only one to survive was one of my runners, off on a trading expidition when the town fell. This lone trader wasn't some helpless pack-mule, however, having started as a bodyguard in the original group that founded the now-fallen outpost. She set out to find a new life for herself, far away from bandits and outcasts.She was killed by a beak-thing the next day.			"

								I decided to buy this game when it was on sale a few days ago... and to my surprise the game is actually pretty good they're many things to do in the video game games you can raid cities or join groups of people or you could just be a farmer. So far i still have no diea if the game even has a goal to it. My main issue with the game are the damn LOADING times like EVERY single time when you click a character from a certain area it laods and it gets kinda irrritating after a while. They should fix this. Also the tutorials are not good they don't really tell you that much about the game but the very basics. And after that they just throw you into the ame like you should know what you're suppose to do. At first it's extremely hard but if you give it some time you will find out that everything is pretty simple and not that hard. I enjoy the game and hope to see if improve over time. but like i said LOADING issues gotta go. Then i'll be happy with this game.			"

								simply, this game is a pure fun if you like chalanges and swords, martial arts fights. this is not a final version, so game need to be polished and optimized. 90% of ppl playing this game have graphic setup as minimal. but this game is something more than graphic. pure gem. you start as no-one, you can be beaten, killed, you can be slaved, or be eaten by cannibals... but also you can be someone who beats other, fight for his rights, gather team, settle and defend his new home, you can be conqueror or loser. you can be everything. thats what kenshi is. start is hard but with every hour you learn laws of kenshi, and you learn how to survive and at the end, it pays off.

								Poorly OptimizedBuggy at timesPathfinding is sometimes hilariousGraphics are horrendousSo why did I enjoy it so much? Starting characters are laughably so weak they'd die from cattle attacking them. You're not the hero, just another character just trying to get by. The world is harsh and humbling. However the character buildup and being able to assemble your own group and then eventually a settlement of your own was very compelling.Mechanics is simply enough just like everyone other RPG with some town building to it but the punishing gameplay drew me in. Treading lightly and realizing your characters are vulnerable wanderers and not conquering heroes like most games maeks you appreciate every single resource you can scrounge up. Then eventually seeing your characters being able to handle their own in a melee really makes it more satisfying to watch.Charming game with an interesting gameplay bogged down by performance issues.

								This game is absolutely astonishing. The gameplay available so far is amazing for its current in game state, Despite the bugs and crashes, Thanks to the quick developer responses to problems found in the game.Pro's: Amazing developer feedbackGood ammount of content for the current stage of gameHuge expansions taking place as of currentGood building system, Allbeit a little slow.Good race system, Allbeit a little low in aesthetic options for the newer races.Con's:A crap load of bugs. (Though, They tend to be fixed nearly as soon as they are reported.)MAJOR CPU/RAM hog.Slow paced. (Debateable as to weither or not this would be considered a con.)Somewhat frequent crashes. (As stated, These tend to be caused by bugs that are frequently fixed.)Lower-end graphics. (That being said, It's needed for such a large scale game.)All in all, I'd rate this game a near 8.5/10. While its still in alpha, There are content updates nearly every week from what i've seen, LEading me to beleive that the game itself is well worth the investment to help with the developer's, Er, Development.
