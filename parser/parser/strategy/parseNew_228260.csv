												Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is a unique game that tries to combine major elements from two of the biggest and best turn-based strategy series in history, namely Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic. Just like in Civilization, you start by founding a city, you improve it with new buildings, and then expand by founding other cities and/or conquering other factions. But taking a cue from Heroes of Might and Magic, you explore the fantasy world with your hero(es), the battles take place in a separate screen and you can do quests to earn loot for your hero.It’s a very interesting mix of two familiar concepts carefully designed into a surprisingly unique whole. For example, between dealing with other factions (whether you’re in war or not), you can scour the gameworld seeking out and completing various quests available to you whereas in Civilization there is not much to do in these moments except building your empire. On the flipside, it makes you miss certain elements from both Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic. For example, even though you get to research civics, military improvements and magic just like you would research technology in Civilization, Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes lacks the clear sense of progression. Or to use the city battles in this example, in Fallen Enchantress they are exactly the same as they are anywhere else on the map whereas Heroes of Might and Magic provides a compelling conquer/defend mechanic in its city battles.It is perhaps unfair to compare this game so intensely to other games, but at the same time, there is no escaping the fact that these were very important and clear influences. The similarities aside, it needs to be pointed out that Fallen Enchantress totally nails the depth, scope and addictive nature that the genre absolutely requires. However, it does seem to favor the aggressive approach over the diplomatic one.The production values are modest. The graphics are rather outdated, but this is offset to a point thanks to the truly wonderful and distinctive art-style. Unfortunately, there are no excuses for the sound design. The soundtrack consists of a scant few derivative fantasy melodies whereas the sound effects are just poor.Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is a deep and addictive turn-based strategy game which doesn’t quite reach the very top the genre has to offer and as such won’t keep you playing for years to come, but it does offer a surprisingly unique mix of gameplay elements that will definitely delight any fan of the genre.8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)			"

												i'm not typically a serious fan of city/army builder games like this, but Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is one of those games that is just what I was looking for at the time. If you're a fan of Sid Meier's Civilization series, this game MIGHT be up your alley. In my opinion, it is way better in many ways. A lot of people say differently... So here's a rundown of why I recommend this game:1) You get to have a 'main character', which you either pick from, or make your own through customization options. You can also make your own faction up, so to speak and pick your perks etc.2) There is an EXTREME PLETHORA of troop choices due to customization options to create the exact troop type you are looking for, You can even customize how they look, including gender. Seriously, this is an amazing thing that I haven't seen in too many other games of this type.3) The battle system is like a hybrid of regular turn-based strategy games of this nature, and something like a less-intricate version of games  like Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, and Agarest (tactical battle games). See your unique leader and troops battle across actual landscapes, with terrain that affects movement and line of sight in a much more  detailed way than typical builder games. Strategize your positions. Feel like you're actually battling!!There's really only one big problem I have with this game, and that would be the lack of multiplayer... I hear it crashes a lot, but I haven't really had much issue with this. Other than that however, I don't really see a whole lot wrong with it. I saw someone saying it's not a 'completed game' but I felt pretty content with it. I mean, I wouldn't go paying 40 dollars for it but I wouldn't pay that for almost any game, simply because that's a lot of money to me... I don't make that much...Should you buy this game...? It really depends on what you want in a game. If you're a high-fantasy fan who loves customization and city building, maybe. If you're a fan of grid-based tactical combat games, it just might be up your alley. If you like all of that stuff, you'll probably like this game. Should you spend 40 dollars on it? Ehhhh..... I wouldn't but if you have tons of money to blow, why not? I would honestly wait for a sale, or do some more research beyond my review... I hope i helped you out somehow in your decision however.

												This game... I was really excited to play Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes.  I'm a big fan of tactical and turn-based strategy games and I couldn't wait to dig in. On paper, this game has pretty much everything a strategy fan could ask for. Your developing kingdom or empire has a lengthy tech tree with three distinct branches. You can engage your armies in tactical combat, controlling each troops movements a la Tactics:Ogre or just let the battle play out automatically from the overworld. You can use your sovereign to cast tactical and strategic spells, decimate enemy armies, and tame dragons to fight alongside your army. You can even customize your avatar, kingdom history, racial traits, and design all of your units.The list of things to do in this game is just about inexhaustible... which is likely where everything went wrong.This game is an incredibly un-polished experience, so much so that I wonder if the devs even test-played it, as this very much feels like a game that is still in late beta stages.  In my opinion, this is because there's just so much going on, that the developers were incapable of playtesting everything thoroughly. I ran into more than a few save bugs and stability issues, and late game lag is incredibly common, even on a very high-end rig. While the environment art is pretty exceptional and overa-all enjoyable, I found the character models to be among the most hideous designs I've ever seen. They are amateur at best and downright ugly at worst. While not a core component, I did feel like something was lost in the customization when no matter which outfit I picked, my sovereign still turned out to be an eyesore.But, due to the insane levels of customization and depth of gameplay, all of these foibles could be easily overlooked if not for one glaring, inescapable issue.The AI in this game may be the worst artificial intelligence I've ever encountered in a game of any kind. There are extremely limited diplomacy options, which basically boil down to: pay money, or be paid money for peace, neither of which are very fun or exciting. While more are unlocked later in the game, you're unlikely to ever see them before going to war. The AI seems to have one goal and one goal only: to declare war. It might declare war in the first five minutes of meeting you, or it might wait for five hours, but you can be damned sure it's going to happen.The way that the AI decides friend from foe is a complete and utter mystery to me. More than once, the enemy AI went from being my best friend (green happy face) to being at war with me the next turn, which was completely baffling. Once at war, the AI will throw every platoon it has at you. It will send all of its troops straight to their death, over and over again, never adjusting its strategy, until it has completely exhausted all of its kingdoms resources and must surrender to you. At the end of the day, I want to recommend this game so badly, because there is just so much going on that begs to be explored. But no matter how great the rest of the game is, there is just no way around the AI.			"

												When I first saw what Stardock wanted to do with Fallen Enchantress, I became excited. All those video diaries about the lore of the world, the customization options, and the options for what you could do made me very excited for the game! Then I paid $40 for a complete mess of a game that, aside from being buggy, was very much a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥project that did not live up to my expectations. I gave up on that, but then I heard of the ""expansion"" to a bad game with a great concept: Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes! Although it looked like the exact same game for the exact same price, it couldn't be completely the same, right? They probably had to change EVERYTHING to fix it, essentially creating a new game, right? Nope. As far as I'm aware, there is no difference except for maybe a new faction and maybe a new map. As such, here are the reasons why not to give Stardock any more money ever.1). Tedious city building.    To me, this game looked very much like a customizable game of Civilization that, considering the modders of the popular Fall from Heaven mod for Civ IV were working on this, I expected it to play like Civilization. However, although some aspects of city building are similar to the Civ series, it falls considerably short of it. Settling of cities can only be on certain places, and those places start with a predetermined Food, Production, and Mana. Once you place your city, there is no way to work the surrounding land to enhance them. Instead, you gain more ""resources"" by building outposts next to resources (iron, crystal, and mana) and then build upgrades on those resources. Your cities do not take part in this process, instead being used solely for unit production. Although you can build buildings to ""improve"" your cities, they never really seem to improve them that much. The game decided to follow ""a lot of a little is a lot"" making city progression a very long and tedious task that does not factor in units or later buildings, meaning they take FOREVER to build.2). Pointless Unit customization.     In the game, you start off with a hero and a settler. You can explore and complete quests with your hero, and found a city with your settlers. Once your city is founded, you are allowed to customize units much like you can customize your hero. At first this sounds really cool; the possibilities are seemingly endless with the amount of equipment you can give your troops to improve them. But then you realize that equiping a troop with horses doesn't make them cavalry, or that equiping them with spears doesn't make them spearmen. Instead, the game simplifies combat to three basic unit types: Ranged, melee, magic. As you can guess, each type dictates how each unit attacks, either from range with a bow or magic, or up close with a variety of melee weapons. Although each weapon has a unique ""attribute"" that gives them additional functionality, these attributes hardly matter during battle. The only thing that matters is how hard each weapon hits, which leads me to my next point. 3). Simplistic, boring, unbalanced combat.    The game was trying to go for a hybrid between TurnBasedStrategy and TurnBasedTactics. In this case, combat takes place on a relatively small grid (reminiscent of chess) with environmental textures that add nothing to said grid. Both teams start on opposite sides of the grid and must kill each other. This is typically how combat works in TurnBasedStrategies(like Tactics Ogre or FFTactics), however, it is not handled well. The only variety of the combat grid involves the textures, so every battle will essentially play out the same way. Mix that with units that have no range limits, and early battles become a slogfest that is determined by how many ranged units you have/can kill quickly. The most complex tactic is which unit to focus fire on. There is no positioning/elevation advantage, useful abilities, unit variety advantage, or change in AI behavior. The AI have a suicidal mentality, and why wouldn't they? It doesn't matter if they die while targetting a single unit, they are only there to be a pawn in the great battle of attrition. If this sounds like the game is challenging, don't fall for it. This only affects early game, late game is a cake walk due to how OP troops become. Troops, unlike heroes, can be upgraded in SIZE, meaning that more soldiers will be in that troop. This increases the health and damage of the troop unit with each additional member. This means that troops will EASILY out perform any amount of heroes at any level with any equipment. These essentially godly units can only be countered by other godly units, which are...never made. Once you reach the max level of equipment, its smooth sailing.4). All around lack of variety.     Overall, there is very little variety in gameplay. All the possibilities of the game are quickly exhausted after a few hours. The only victory condition I am aware of is conquest, making the game easily beaten and done with. There is no point to unit variety, so unless you want to create a challenge for yourself, there is no reason to change it up. With no random map generation, Stardock has resorted to selling map pack DLC for maps that add no actual variety or unique experiences to the game. Aside from singleplayer random game, there is a ""story/campaign"" that apparently tells a lore driven story of...something. I have played the campaign and found it very similar to a random game with extra random scenarios. It is apparent that the developers wanted the antagonist faction to be an overwhelming superpower that the player had no chance of standing up against, but I felt no sense of ugency to complete the story objectives. The final objective is for you to bring your hero into a portal and fight demons as a final resort to stop the ""invasion""(or something), but I found myself conquering their unneccessarily large quanitity of cities with ease(once again, late game cakewalk). However, stepping into the portal is a completely different story. Apparently your hero forgots to bring his army, because its him against max level demons. As you would expect, he gets easily slaughtered. This HUGE difficulty spike is artificial and unfair, as there is no way of preparing for it. Apparently the only way to win is to use magic the scenario GIVES YOU, meaning there is no way to prepare or create a solution.In conclusion, if you like the premise of a customizable TBS/T game that is probably easily modded(?), then this game is right up your alley. It is VERY rough and definitely needs a modder's touch, but the core concepts are there and, in the end, that's all you can hope for...*cries*			"

												If you are old enough to remember Master of Magic from the glory days of pc gaming, and Age of Magic, you will know what this game is.  4X in a fantasy vein with great customization ability for factions and leaders.  Stardock has been doggedly working to improve the game since it's first incarnation as Elemental, so ignore reviews of earlier iterations and check out the more relevant (and very positive) critical reviews.If you pick up FE:LH, there is no need to buy any of the earlier games.  As for DLC, though I have everything and enjoy them, the Undead faction DLC is the only one that really adds some enjoyable toys to the mix, unless you're like me and enjoy monstrous maps, in which case the map pack is worth picking up.Like most Stardock products, the developers seem to honestly care about their creations and their fans, constantly tinkering with their games long after release, just like Microprose back in the day.  Never been disappointed with anything in their catalog.			"

												DRM Warning! You cannot use this game without creating a Stardock account.That means that to install the game 10 years from now on a new PC, you have to trust that Steam and the Stardock validation servers will both be functional. Given that Impulse which was once Stardock's baby is now slowly agonizing in the hands of a third-party, I'm not sure I would put my money on the latter.Personally Steam is enough DRM for me, thanks. I bought this in a bundle and wasn't exactly pleased to find out about the account requirement after the fact.Note that you can get a truly DRM-free copy of the ultimate edition on GOG.com. Personally I don't like the game enough to re-purchase it (still trying to figure out if it gets better in the long run), but I thought I'd let you know.			"

												Not impressed. This game hits you from the start with unwanted hassle. You must create an additional user account on the developers servers to play the game. I don't want that. If a game is on Steam, it shouldn't need anything extra. No additional DRM or more accounts or anything. They want you to have an account so they can sell you tiny-expansions, which are annoyingly advertised in-game.Then you start the game and find out it is unbalanced in a dozen ways.I have gone through the motions of playing the game, and It really just isn't fun. Maybe it's because I have played dozens of games like it (that are better or more interesting). The designers created a complicated lore/item system, but forgot to make the game mechanic interesting.I bought this on a steam sale. Still disappointed that I spent money on it. Still annoyed about having to create an extra account that I get emails for. Still annoyed at the publisher Stardock software.4/10. If I was on a hypothetical deserted island and this was my only game.. I would play it. I guess.			"

												Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is a single player 4X turn-based strategy game that takes place in the fantasy universe of Elemental. Following a magical apocalypse, civilization is trying to recover and reestablish itself in a world now filled with bandits, monsters, and rival factions. These are all just flavor details, of course — without a real “campaign” to play through, the setting and back story are largely irrelevant, but the effort is nonetheless appreciated.Players set out to found a fledgling kingdom, scout out the world for resources to gather, grow their empire, and ultimately eliminate any opposition — your standard 4X fare. What set this game apart from most in the 4X genre are the titular legendary heroes, the first of which is the sovereign of your nation. RPG-like mechanics allow you to embark on mini-quests, recruit new heroes, level them up, and find loot with which to equip them — an exciting addition to the base 4X gameplay.This breaks the game down into two main components: empire building and tactical combat. Building your empire involves founding new cities, researching technology, building city upgrades, and managing resources. Various “buff” spells can be cast on a city to boost it in some way, the research paths allow you to unlock numerous upgrades, and cities can be augmented into military fortresses, arcane research centers, or expansionist metropolises.The empire building aspect of the game is par for the course in the genre — no major flaws, but nothing exceptional either. After a few games, I realized that selecting upgrades and research paths will ultimately become repetitive, but thankfully there’s a lot more that Fallen Heroes has to offer to keep a player engaged.That’s where combat comes in, the basis of which is building units and, more importantly, recruiting heroes. This also happens to be where Legendary Heroes comes into its own. By expanding your towns and completing quests, you will gain “fame,” which will grant you access to new hero units. All units gain experience points and levels, but heroes can be upgraded into different classes such as Assassin or Defender, gain access to skill trees, and equip items much like an RPG character. The choices here are diverse and exciting, and even your base units can be upgraded with weapons and armor of your choosing as you unlock technologies.When your army clashes with an enemy’s, a neutral faction’s, or a wandering monster, you’ll enter a turn-based tactical combat phase. Units take turns moving around the combat grid, attacking, using abilities and items, and casting spells. Initiative, defense, attack, hit points and more all factor into how combat plays out, as well as the specific gear your units have equipped. Even base units have access to an ability or two, depending on their equipped weapon — a spear may grant a piercing strike that hits two enemies at once, while a club may grant a devastating power attack that costs the attacking unit its next turn. Combats themselves are strategic, diverse, and just plain fun. A “swarm” mechanic acts somewhat like the “flanking bonus” other game systems use, imparting a bonus to an attack made against a foe adjacent to one or more allied units. This makes tactical positioning and smart use of the battlefield an important part of the game, and using the right ability or spell at the right time can be crucial to victory.While there are multiple paths to victory, the end-game weakens significantly as you widen your lead over your opponents. At that point, the question is no longer if you will win, but how many more bloody turns will it take. Perhaps this is just the curse of the genre, but the later into a game I got, the more I found my excitement being replaced with tedium. Once victory was assured, I would simply start a new game.Thankfully, “replay value” would be the two words that best describe Legendary Heroes. The degree of randomness that goes into every game, coupled with the variety of options at your disposal and a high degree of customizability ensure that no two playthroughs will ever be the same. There are so many variables interacting with each other that you’ll want to come back again and again to see how a different setting, a different selection, or a different tactic will play out.While I haven’t played Elemental: Fallen Enchantress, I’m given to understand that Legendary Heroes includes upgraded graphics, which I can’t comment on. Other improvements over the base game consist of two new factions, larger map sizes, a new scenario, as well as new monsters, items, spells, and quests. There’s word that Legendary Heroes was also meant to introduce bug fixes and performance optimizations, but I encountered a few crashes and clunky slowdowns during my play experience.Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is the kind of 4X that brings my relationship with strategy games to a lofty peak. It is engaging and yet oddly meditative, almost relaxing to play rather than nerve-wracking and brain-frying. "

												This is not the best game i ever played, just decent. While it offers a large amount of content, there is still something missing.Well, what is good:Many different nations to play, and this is not orcs, dwarves and other elves we already seen in hundreds of other games. This is unique nations, mainly based on humans, with their own history.You can create your own nation and choose its strengths and weaknesses, i especially love this aspect of game.There is a constructor of units, you can create your own troops - arm soldiers with different weapons and armor, give them abilites and perks, this is quite complex system which offers a lot of tactics.Lot of different technologies to research, separated in three groups: economy, warfare and magic. You need to build cities carefully and specialise them, city focused on training troops is very different from city focused on research. Exploring of map is good too, there is different quests you may find as well as lot of treasures and monsters roaming around. Hiring heroes and developing them are important, in fact first part of the game, where you explore the map, hire heroes, locate resources and fight wildlife is the best part of the game. It is really good.Resource management is simple and logical. There is resource spots on map and you need to build cities or outposts to control this spots. For example, if you have an iron mine, it will provide some iron each turn and you can spend this iron on units with iron equipment. And so on.Well, it sounds like perfect game, but there is several moments that can not let me call Fallen Enchantress ""perfect"".First of all, there is very weak AI. Almost non-existent. AI nations are very passive, they can not offer a challenge. AI can not use all possibilities that game offers. And if you decide to increase difficulty level, AI will just have extra resources and bonuses. This is simply not interesting.You ask about balance? There is some issues with balance, it will take some time to explain this problems anyway... they exist, balance is not perfect at all.Diplomacy is plain and simple. If your nation are weak then AI will declare war on you. If your nation is strong then AI will not declare war on you. That is all. Of course, there is pacts, alliances and trade treaties, but i do not think there is much benefit from this.As for quests. In general, they all fit in simple formula ""go somewhere, find something and maybe kill someone in process"". But, to be honest, it is hard for me to invent something different so, well, quests are OK.Boss fights become disappointment for me. From very start, game told me a scary story about ""big, giant, enormously huge dragon that is extremely powerful"". Well, alright, i methodically gathered all my best troops and cautiously approached to boss domain, ready to retreat in any moment. There i saw a dragon and, well, my archers shot him and my pikemen poked him. Dragon died. That was all. It was not the epic battle i expected for...Pace of game is very slow. Really slow. You can find yourself not playing but just pressing one button - ""end turn"", waiting for something to happen. Yes, you can regulate the pace of game, but even on fast speed it seems slow for me.I did not finished any games i started in Fallen Enchantress. Because when you have a powerful army and strong economy, there is nothing that can stop you. It is simply not interesting. I can conquer all map and resistance is futile... preparations for war is much more interesting than war itself. And it was a huge disappointment for me because complex system of troop creation is really good and combat system are well designed.Last drop is multiplayer. I mean there is no multiplayer. You want to proof your friend that your strategy and tactics are superior? Not in this game, unfortunately.Well. Can i recommend this game? Yes and no. If you love to slowly and carefully build your Glorious Empire in fantastic world - this game is just about it. But if you want challenge from AI or want to play with friends - this is not good choice, try to check Dominions or Age of Wonders.For me game is good enough, i will play it from time to time.			"

												If you had me describe my ""dream game"" it would likely involve grand empire management Civ style and battles would be turn based ""tactics"" style. While no game has really encompassed the rest of the details of this dream, this game does get a lot of it right. I've enjoyed playing this game and seeing it evolve even since Elemental. I do not think it's a perfect game by any means, but it's a lot better than what it started from. The problems that it suffers from aren't anything major. It's just a lot of little stuff here and there that tends to add up to an experience that feels slightly flawed but not in the context of a flawed gem. It's rather difficult at times, and given my experience with the game I can't always say it's been my fault either. There is a strong ""rogue-like"" vibe with some of the monsters that roam the map and I'm certainly not complaining about this. You have to pick and choose your fights, but often this is a bit deceptive in that I'm sure I THINK I could beat this whole nest of spiders because they are close to my army's power. It doesn't mean however said spiders won't shoot webs all over the tactical map so my melee units can't even move, then pick everything off with poison. Then other times you just romp over them like sewer rats. I'm not 100% sure I love random in my strategy games, but I do love it in my RPG games. That's kinda where this game stands too. It's half strategy and half RPG. I don't feel like it does either amazingly well, but there's just not many games that put these things together and have it cohesive. There's times where I'm not even sure if I'm playing the game right and I still have no idea what I should be doing. The point is though: It's fun to try.  Any fan of Civilization that doesn't mind trying to defend their nation from literally being eaten by dragons should check it out. If you want a relaxed city-building experience, then look elsewhere as the game isn't catered towards pacifists and fighting is largely the entire point of the game with the empire building not quite in the background, but most certainly second stage.Another note: the developer has added a ton of content and balancing to the game on a regular timeframe. A larger ""2.0"" update is incoming as I write this as well as another expansion of sorts. I'd much rather see a company funded that has the idea that they will refine their game until they can justify paid content, over one that just sidecars new DLC every 3 months because they can. The DLC for this game is 100% not needed for a great experience and there's some rather large MODS that completly change the game's dimensions if you are into that kinda thing. This is a true PC gaming , strategy experience in my eyes with depth, customization, external support and so forth.			"

												So on reflection I don't know whether to recommend this game or not. Civilization + Heroes of Might & Magic is in general a great idea for a game. The problem is in the execution.The good:-Lots of customization of your empire and character before you even start a game, including the look of everything.-Battle mode is engaging with good use of terrain and a variety of available tactics, with much deeper spell tactics than the typical HoMM game in particular. -If a battle is going to be a waste of time to run or you are running a very simple army, auto-resolving a battle will not result in an unfair result for you, so you don't have to fear losing units because you don't want to waste time on a nothing battle.-Empire UI is not the best and clearly inferior to Civ 5, but when you end your turn, it does not take long for computer turns to resolve even if there are lots of them. The game progresses pretty rapidly.The bad:-This game starts slooow. Your empire is tiny and difficult to grow. It really needs a fast start option where you start with several cities and heroes to get things rolling.-Most of the units you control are uninteresting. Prepare for a lot of soldiers and archers, rather than actual cool fantasy monsters. Some factions have special units, though.-Questing is not well-balanced and can easily lead to an army wipe with little warning, followed by a monster rampaging across your territory until you can get rid of it many turns later.-Juggling a large army becomes progressively more time-consuming and I found myself just parking large stacks wherever or wasting them on supermobs just so I didn't have to pay for them.-It's a difficult chore to defend map tiles you control. Any monster or enemy player can come in at any time from any angle and you have no way to get rid of them without sending out an army to deal with it. A ranged attack from city (a la Civ 5) would do wonders. Enemies can take over large swaths of your territory if you don't have a city there simply by planting a guy on your outpost. No battle, that territory is now his.-You can easily get a start position that completely screws you over in a random map, almost regardless of what settings you pick for random generation.-The various research trees are not well-balanced and you can easily bork your early development.In the end:This game really illlustrates why it's hard to make a good empire-building game or combine two popular games into one. It's not an easy fit.			"

												There's a lot of promise here but ultimately, this is a bit of a disappointment.The biggest flaw is perhaps the UI, which is buggy, missing really basic features and seems generally poorly thought out.  Eg. trying to reorder building queues (in the cramped 5 items at a time icon list) will often select the wrong item.  The mouse isn't locked to the window, so on multiple monitors, you can't hit the screen edge to scroll right.  There's no way to combine or rearrange armies occupying the same tile.  I frequently found some stray click when trying to cast a spell, or even in the loading screen inadvertently ordering armies in the wrong direction.  And a bunch more minor, but frustrating issues.  It just makes the whole thing a pain to deal with.The game itself is decent, but it seems like it could have done with a lot more balancing and polish.  So far, I've only played through 2 games, but so far it seems like certain strategies and factions are OP, while others struggle.  The optimal strategy seems to be to cut taxes completely, pretty much ignoring gold altogether for the early game, since the unrest penalty isn't worth the tiny amount it gets you, meaning a third of the buildings are pretty much pointless.   It seems like there's the potential for a great game here, and maybe mods could help with this, but as it stands, it doesn't quite come together as well as it could.If it weren't for the UI issues, I'd definitely recommend giving this game a try, but as it is, I don't think it's worth the frustration.

												Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes  is the most played game I own in my library.  The game is beyond fun, it is everything a civilization builder should be and more.  The freedom to customize your kingdom from citys, to commanders (heroes) and army units is above and beyond anything I've seen in the gendre.  But were the game truly shines is it's hud system.  The hud gives you at a glance all the pertinent information you require in an unobtrusive way.  The game is beyond fantastic and I highly recomend it to everyone who wanted to rule a fantasy kingdom.			"

												Stardock was aiming to best Master of Magic with this title and I personally credit it with bringing ""cloth"" style strategic maps into vogue. Pros: Probably the 4x on the market with the most variety of customization options. Faction and World Customization are well done. Quests are nicely done, provide a mix of history and contemporary stories. Biggest Con: No Multi-player.The Middling: Graphics are good, but not great - everything meshes stylistically, but the game lacks Endless Legend or Age of Wonders level of detail. Hero/Troop Poses are either sad or hilarious depending on your perspective. The AI Empires are less of a threat (usually) than the wandering monsters.  (this may be due to my settings choices)Still, if I want to build an empire by pushing back the wilderness,  slaying elemental lords, dragons, and bears in the process, this is a great way to spend doing it.  The epic monster zones, hero levels, and the questing system on top of the huge research trees, and the city building/wonder game places Fallen Enchantress above Civ V in terms of replayability.			"

												Elemental: World of Magic was released in October 2012.  It's November 2012, and Legendary Heroes - the successor to the broken Fallen Enchantress, itself the successor to the unplayable Elemental - is still an unfinished game.  If you were foolish enough to buy Elemental, as I was, and then to pay for the Legendary Heroes ""expansion"", and the DLC - which scarcely qualifies for the name, as each pack contains content which should have been included in the base game - you've spent close to $100 on what remains a barely playable game, once you account for the frequent crashes, the terrible combat AI, and the half finished diplomacy options.If Stardock puts this game on sale for $10, give it a go.  It's frankly not worth more than that.  Take it from a sucker who paid way too much for a poorly made game.			"

												I really, really wanted to love this game. For a while, I could also ignore its glaring problems, because there's simply no other game out there that properly scratches my itch for a ""Master of Magic"" experience.On paper, all the right elements exist in Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes. However, the execution just doesn't cut it: from the lack of variety, uninteresting factions, and bland presentation - including unappealing looks AND poor perfromance at the same time - to the way the tech tree, hero progression, equipment price / gold production ratio (wtf 40 turns to buy one piece of leather armor?!), and available spells combine to create an experience that kept me dozing off most of the time - even when my entire army suddenly gets wiped out by a random encounter (wandering monsters tend to be much more powerful than all competing factions combined.)Sorry for not being more specific, as it would take too long. My advice - give it a chance if you're curious, but don't pay full price, and don't expect much. What a wasted opportunity by Stardock.			"

												Empire building like Civ 5 + RPG elements + extensive customization for your armyIt sounds like a winning combination, yes? Let's find out..First off, the ((tutorial)): videos and encyclopedia feature explains most of the basics very well, so the learning curve is pretty smooth. So even though it is clearly a complex game, it's not hard to learn and play with most of the features. You still have to experiment yourself to master the customization features, which is great cuz such features are usually up to experienced players to make use of them anyway.The ((campaigns)): were mostly boring. They emphasized the RPG aspect of the game (hero leveling and skill trees, magic casting and equipment etc..), but it also had some of the most repetitive quests ever, which is a shame cuz the story and lore are rather well-written. Unfortunately, you never feel attached to the characters in the campaign. They feel like robots, and you are playing with them only cuz you have NO OTHER CHOICE. Also the research tree is often reduced/butchered, even though it is one of the best features in this game... Ignore the campagin!The ((customization)): Here's where this game really shines! Where do I begin?First time playing, you might want to pick one of the standard races to play, so you can learn the basics and experience which type of gameplay you prefer >> science victory, diplomatic (almost pointless), Quest victory, or all-out DOMINATION.There is attention to detail in the factions. On their own, they are well-balanced. Their different abilites actually greatly impact their play-style, even MORE here than in Civilization 5 for example.Later on, when you enter the cauldron and make your own faction (better with the Leader Pack DLC), here's where you get to produce some game-breaking (and pretty fun!) factions, like giving them supreme unit bonuses for combat OR giving them several opened-up researches for a quicker science victory...Unit customization in-game is even MORE fun and you can make use of the resources at your desposal depending on what you have and how much you have of each... You can edit everything: cosmetics/facial features, colors, weapons, armor, magic trinkets and special perks.The research tree and city building: These are the second best features here. The research tree has geat impact, and you feel the difference with each upgrade almost immediately. In fact, factions with high research bonuses will most likely win easily if they are given enough time and space. You need to attack them ASAP if you're playing military style...Growing your city and gaining territory is actually addciting here, also with great immediate impact, depending on your decisions. You get bonus buildings with growth etc..I'm not gonna say much about combat: bacis tactical style. Nothing remarkable. Heroes are better playing in support function with abilities rather than tanking or dealing damage (unless you have exceptional items). They don't die permanently either. You will mostly rely on your melee units to deal damage and tank.. and pretty much do everything in combat... everything else is just support. It's all about making melee units PLUS upgrading them ASAP before the epic monsters show up at your doorstep and ruin your life...The biggest PROBLEMS with this game are:1) Unit models: despite all the customization, the unit models are remarkably UGLY! Whatever facial features you pick for your sovreign/hero you will rarely find him/her looking the way you want. The graphics, while sharp, are overall not appealing compared to other games in this genre.2) Diplomacy: many features BUT unclear! You have no idea why your rivals like you one minute and HATE you suddenly. You might be fighting a common enemy one minute, then 15 turns later they declare war one you even though you are clearly much stronger than them. No rhyme or reason to dimplomacy... and no point in the diplomatic victory mechanic. War is more frequent and more profitable.3) Starting locations: The main reason why some factions win is most likely gonna be affected by the abundance of resources and tile yileds on starting locations. City locations on Essence yields are more powerful than any other, especially when improved with city spells. And if you don't start with at least 2 crystal  and 2 iron near you... you are gonna have a hard time upgrading your units later on. It almost makes the customizations pointless cuz all of the advance items and equipment require these resources! The starting locations are IMBALANCED in the custom games... and the AI makes poor decisions when settling new cities.4) NO MULTIPLAYER!The DLC: depending on how you like to play>>If you want better customization and custom game variety: Leader Pack DLC + Map DLCIf you want an extra race with unusual mechanics: Dead World (for playing as undead)If you like to play around mainly with hero quests and epic equipment: Loot Pack + Quest PackBattlegrounds DLC: I don't own this one because it sounds pointless. Why would I want more map variety if there is NO MULTIPLAYER?They don't affect each other very much. Right now, I only recommend Leader Pack and Map pack (I like the customization), cuz the extra loot gets boring quickly and the Dead Nations have lots of bugs and/or poorly balanced. The extra quests can be fun, but I find them just distracting me from conquering other factions instead, or going for straight up science victory.Ultimately, it's a fun game, BUT I only recommend buying it on a big discount. It is NOT worth the full current price imo7/10This is my playthrough using a custom faction for Magic/Science Victory:

Middle market turn based 4X game meets RPG or in real world terms marriage between Civ IV and King's Bounty series. This is not pure 4X game as ""everybody"" claims because there is a heavy role playing. Pro+ it's turn based 4X and RPG game in one package+ 10 predetermined factions and souvereigns are pretty divers+ but you can create your own+ and you can design units which is my favourite part of game+ game is pretty imbalanced so there are various ways of winning+ like other Stardock's games, it's highly modable+ very high quality mini and total conversion mods+ epic music and it's available in mp3 for free+ super fast loading+ a lot of customization options+ I like Battle for Anthys scenarioNeutral+- both hilarious and semi-compentent AI – they are early pioneer spammers which leads to quick expanding and stealing resources under your nose, but that makes AI settlements to have huge unrest which means totally crippled production and research; some factions are great at quick doom stack spamming (looking at you V.erga) and some are outright terrible every game (those heavy oriented on magic or economy always fail); AI factions use spells mostly ok, and if they have Tornado it's very annoying+- victory conditions (they are standard for these type of games; unfortunately AI is incapable of winning via Dragon Lord quest)+- Stardock account (it's one time registration, it won't pop up ever again)+- diplomacy and trading (I really miss trading, gifting and liberating settlements; otherwise it's mostly good)Cons- cheating AI – neutrals almost completely ignore AI factions; above challenger difficulty, AI has economy script; AI dodges frequently your attacks and it's disgusting!; battle's outcomes sometimes don't have any sense: I can lose several units and win then reload and use auto-solve and lose nothing.- terrible lagging when fighting in jungle/forest map (come on, it's turn based!)- terrain doesn't matter in tactical mode (standing behind rock or trees doesn't matter)- settlements can't cross river (unless modded) - it doesn't make sense- there are huge water surfaces but there is no way to cross them- bugs, bugs and more bugs (always save max after 2 turns because of unexpected bugs and cheating AI)- crossbows are completely useless- Fallen Enchantress scenario is the huge waste of time- DLCs are mostly worthless or/and bugged (Map and Quest Pack are only worth)Final score: 8/10 and recommended for buying base game (no DLCs outside Quest and Map!).Mandatory mini mods: Parrottmatth mods (Snaking Mod, River City Bridge, Swamp Tiles, Armored Militia, Armor Attributes, Summoner Unit, Female Henchman), Black Market Bazaar, Level 6 and 7 Cities, Armor Visuals, AI Plus, Name Generator, More Visible Move Radius in Tactical, Dragon Taming for LH and Beast Mode.

												I read the reviews on this game and honestly, I don't know if can go by them or not anymore.  I ordered the ultimate package so I would have the add-ons, paid the full $40, and for that amount I will be replacing every other game I own.  Here is why...I love Civ series games, Heroes of M&M, Age of Wonders, Endless legends, GalCiv etc, those types of games, but they always had me looking for ways to make: decisions, resources, battles, buildings, etc to mean more and to be more meaningful, more important in the game while not sacrificing anything too much.  For me, Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes Ultimate pack is the game that finally did that in a satisfying way.The Civ aspect in FE:LH is that you will need to establish cities to expand and keep up with the game.  Now there is not unlimited city placement freedom, as in you cannot build just anywhere, but just pick a bigger map and there will be plenty of places.  Picking a location is much less complex since you base it on just one tile and then primarily its resources instead of mostly tiles.  From there, your city is a lot more about what you build in it and the path you take with your city.  There are many paths your city can take.  In fact, just to start it will become either a Fortress, a Conclave, or a Town, and what you want and in which order depends on your style and position your kingdom is in, because each of those choices branch into choices of their own set of choices.  So it isn't Civ, but it does what Civ does in a less technical, more obvious and transparent, yet sets up meaningful choices and decisions for developement, not resting on just placement and specialization.One thing to note is there are no airplanes are boats, that part of Civ is gone from FE:LH.  There is no underground like in AoW either, so there is only one dimension, but in this one dimension is actual multi dimensional exploration; the land is broke into areas that feel like their own and require more of your army to be able to explore.  Even when you reveal the whole map, the world just unfolds into a giant search for a bigger army, better loot, with the constant hope of finding something else awesome with the epic you just got until the map is cleared...basically, it is an epic waiting to unfold as you explore the world each time.Another big thing that is different in FE:LH is battle.  You can do battle like in Civ in this game and just let the computer throw dice for you... or you can actually control the field and make combos and plans that make losing numbers an invincible force.  It isn't always that way, sometimes you are just s.o.o.l. but that is how it goes.  This difference makes the whole feel of battle change, it feels meaningful and important.  Not only does it decide the fate of your army, but each battle can cost more or less depending on how much you pour in to it.  The battles are simple and fast, but require good use of characters to change the tide of victory.The fantasy thing isn't my real calling, but the fantasy nature is one that is both fitting and natural, to the point where the fantasy world seems believable.  The art is considered less than good by many, but when I play it I see detail and character, clean and easy to look at, I wouldn't change a thing about it.  The real draw for me though, besides the customization and how you can make your Civilization as many ways as you can think of, is that figuring them out in a game so full of characters that also have their own paths, that just exploring the map is fun each and every game, because it is so different and it is how you build your character.  Character building is now as important as empire building and for me, that is worth trading in underground, sea, air, and space tiles.If you want a spin on world building that includes character building and kingdom design and you don't mind having to get creative to get the full experience, say goodbye to Sid and your family and try out FE:LH Ultimate Edition.

												Unlike most people I liked Fallen Enchantress better so take my review with a grain of salt. The new hero trees are stale and boring. Yes you have more control over building the hero but I no longer find myself weighing the Pros and Cons of the random selections in FE. While the new prestige system removes the randomness of finding heroes it takes away some of the feeling of wonder I had previously. Eliminating the multitude of different damage & armor types for universal consistency & weapon specific special moves does slightly erode some tactical decisions. Heroes were massively nerfed in this addition and it feels like a bit too much. Overall, still a solid game and for me, this series lags only behind Civ 4 & 5 for hours invested in 4X games.			"

												Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heros is best explained as a Civilizations type genre where you build up an empire with cities and develop them while fielding troops to protect your piece of the world as the A.I. competes against you. You are given the freedom to choose from the individual races included or customize everything you want from your living avatar to the lowely footman securing your borders. In addition to maintaining your empire as it grows you use your avatar to search for new resources to conquer and complete quests to grow in wealth and power. The world also grows with you in power, monsters that litter the landscape will reposition and gain in levels if unchecked, becoming fearsome legends in time. Should you take care of them earlier on or risk everything and wait for a bigger payoff? It is a turn based game and large world games can stress lower end computers in the late game but smaller or medium worlds are stable. I would recommend having at least the higher end computer requirements if you wish to play the largest settings.			"

												Been playing this on and off for a while now. Appears to go through intermittent periods of stability current release (as of 03/08/2015) appears extremely stable. Personally I feel the DLC does not bring quite enough to the table. And although I had pointed out I wish it had a random map generator - Xerberus86 pointed out that there is indeed a random map generator - NFI how i missed this in the past. A quick google shows that this was introduced in a patch version - however I am more likely to believe I just never clicked the ""random"" button to get it working!Game feels really stable at the moment and although the AI leaves a little to be desired at times - the game itself is very enjoyable and for a $40 investment (if you enjoy this genre) it is unlikely to dissapoint.

												There's a lot to like about Fallen Enchantress with Legendary Heroes installed.  Stardock really did a great job in many respects to rebuild trust after this game's predecessor bombed so terribly [War of Magic].I have spent hundreds of hours playing this with no regrets, excepting with the 2.0 patch last year the game has been left to linger with serious bugs which made the game unplayable.   The implementation of the Stamina system also managed to break many of the previous player created Mods in the process.If you asked me a year ago if FE/LH was a great game I would have easily answered yes, but with the current state of the game [7/1/2016] I cannot recommend it until Stardock fixes what they broke in the 2.0 update.

												I won't repeat most of the points people were saying about the game, but I must point out one of the main strengths of this game: modality.  I know, many games are modable, but here is the game where almost all cons are addressed by the mods. And it is possible as  you can mod almost anything starting with graphics and going deep in to game play.  So, some reviews point out that AI is passive and not challenging?  Not so with the mods. It will be competent and agressive, expanding, building armies, using magic with right mods, particularly with xtradeconstruct.Not enough factions, a bit  dry lore - children of storm introduce new ones with new unique units and lots of lore described. Together  with some other mods I have about 30 factions, some of which like ice giants, centaurs,  spider people are very unique and all of them well thought through. Want more heroes with different skills,  from different races, then go with Champions Bonanza. Twice as  much as vanilla the number of new techs, specific for different factions - xtradeconstruct. With major mods, the game looks polished and complete. And that  way it absolutely gets where it wants to be - fairly balanced, civilization like fantasy game with great  amout of variety, strategy and tactics. I certainly recommend it to every person, who is looking for best 4x titles to play. Just don't forget to explore and install mods before you start!			"

												This game is pretty good, just for a while. Combination of Heroes of might&magic and Civilization is really great idea and works. In my opinion this game doesn't offer you many options for tactics, just go and crush everything on your way, and it gets unentertaining after few wins, you do not even have to bother about your cities or resources, you can win just like nothing with one army running around looting and getting xp. I played just for 2 factions and made 2 wins - by conquest and completing master quest, and there is no more this game can give me, but few more DLC's which are really overcharged. I'd like it give it another chance, maybe later.Good rating, still doesn't worth this price. 6/10EDIT: I see price got lower from 36e to 24e. Should be on 15 without sale at most.			"

												As mentioned in other comments Fallen Enchantress has been abandoned by its developers Stardock and they created another standalone that is nothing more than a modded version of Fallen Enchantress. But this isn't the worst part. Fallen Enchantress is just a modded version of Elemental War of Magic the first game that they also abandoned to create another full game to pull full price out of there costomers for nothing more than what should be a DLC. This isn't the only game Stardock has done this with. Every game they make that gets sequal are nothing more than the previous game with new features. lets take Sins of a solar empire for example game 1, then they made Sins of a solar empire deplomacy game 2, than they made Sins of a solar empire entrenchment game 3, 4 years later in 2012 they release Sins of a solar empire Rebellion Game 4 all of these games are nothing more than modded versions of Sins of a solar empire released in 2008 each of the 3 stand alone games cost $39.99 when they should have only been 9.99 DLC this is the way of Stardock.

												Hi everyone, this is my very first game review :)As a tactical and turn-based strategy game, this game has everything fans dream: characters with unique skills, 5 classes making different play-style, city-building and development. Also, a great fantasy-based mpa makes the game more challanging: it is not just the other kingdom nor the empire your enemies, but the A.I. monsters. Quests are also available in game to gain experience, fame( which gives champions at certain level ). It also provides different ways to win the game: solving some EPIC quests. When it goes to combat, the game has a wide range of spells, tyes of troops. Each provides customized style of tactical gaming. What would you be? A master in sword, a summoner or a assassin in shadow? It is YOUR choice.I played for more than 90 hours but still, a lot for me to explore. Like the escapist said, ""you can devote hours without even knowing it. ""			"

												This game is very similar to tactical strategy games like Heroes of Might and Magic and King's Bounty.What it adds is civilization elements such as choosing technological paths, civic production, and unit design.  What it loses is interesting combat, reasonable game lengths, software stability, and user interface.There are some flaws that are particularly aggravating.  The game decides on its own when a player has completed his turn and  automatically enters the AI cycle, often when the player isn't completely finished.  The spells seem to range from worthless to overpowered without managing to make the combat more interesting.  Above all, a lot of turns are just spent doing nothing while waiting for construction to complete.I'd suggest looking to King's Bounty: Armored princess or Heroes of Might and Magic III (or 4) before this game.

												The problem with Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is *not* simply that it lacks Artificial Intelligence, but that lacks any intelligence at all. The amount of noise simply overwhelms the information and that is a design flaw that permeates the game. The designers simply do not understand that communication is about *meaning*, and you cannot meaningfully communicate if everything that you say is interrupted by something else, which in turn has been interrupted . Or that you drown out what is important by endlessly repeating statements about the irrelevant. Granted that these half-spoken communications eventually unwind off the stack to finally speak the rest of what they were supposed to have said, but the connection between pieces has been lost.Stacked Modal dialogs that are half-statements of things interrupted is an idiotic paradigm beyond comprehension. Yet this is the paradigm that the designers of Fallen Enchantress have built into the control loop of the game.But the basic principles of communication are not just abused in this manner.Some guy will complain that you are intruding on his territory, but not tell you where. So that intrusion could be a transient event created by an automated scout or it could actually be a meaningful complaint about an army. But you don't know which because city boundaries are often not clear. All that you know is that something has happened someplace and maybe you should do something about it if you could.Some alert will announce that there are enemies in your territory, and it has announced it for dozens of turns. But the alert is not relevant because the beasts are holed-up in their cave and still remain too strong to take on. That information then should be check-boxed and excluded from the alert, but instead it is repeated turn after turn, to the point that it is eventually ignored. Yet *all* intrusions use the same alert and so ignoring that one can leave other, more serious intrusions, ready to pounce from the bushes.Tactical combat takes place in an arena that reflects the locale, and there are often building and trees in the area. This is a nice aesthetic touch and a sensible paradigm. But unfortunately, in Fallen Enchantress, those buildings and trees are fixed objects and do not become transparent when the space gains focus. That means that these objects can obscure armies and placements behind them, leaving you blind when you try to move into that space or attack enemies on it.Possible movement squares of armies are highlighted as are those of the opposing armies. Unfortunately, the base color is light blue, and the movement squares of friends is light green. Closely examined, the difference is clear, yet errors in placement are often made because those colors are transparent pastels and not easily differentiated with a quick glance. Again, clear communication was not the objective and so it doesn't take place.There are various other problems, and others have talked about them and the poor AI in the game, but the problem is deeper than any. The problem is that the developers do not understand what they are doing. They might be competent programmers but they do not understand design and the necessary flow of communication and execution that makes working within the world they've created a pleasure. This game works, but working within it is a pain because you have to fight with it to get what you want done.Behind the mess is a game worth playing, but you'll need a fair bit of patience to reach it.

												This is a 4X+ fantasy game that shows the years spent in its development and polish. Standout Features:- Huge game with a large technology tree, and many rules. - Easy to learn but difficult to master (I take this as a plus......)- Many ways to play, and many ways to win- A variety of maps- Resource Management - RTS Style for mana, iron, horses, etc- Abilities for units- DLC adds to the game and makes it much better- Customization for everything: factions, leaders, city upgrades, unit design (alpha centauri style)- Notably, good customisation for game start and in-game options. Really fine controls help you tweak things.Standard 4X features: - City building, unit creation, resources, unit leveling, maps, technology tree- Good graphics- Nice cloth map when you zoom out- ModdingFantasy features (not usually found in a 4X):- champions- faction attributes- sovereign (leader) attributes- magic: spells, mana, magic paths- quests- items- wounds to championsThe only cons are:- The AI is bad. This is typical, however, for the genre. Even Civ V AI was bad.- No multiplayer. In any case, games are usually too long for efficient multi-player- Help could have been more detailed for the more intricate aspects (and power players)- Tiny game-provided campaign (but the customization should be enough to keep you occupied)- Game balance could be slightly better			"

												Was mildly fun until it bugged, can't end the turn and im stuck. Game itself is pretty much Civ 5 with heroes, items and magic, but much less polished and deep. Worth a try if you get it cheap like me (from bundle), otherwise you are better off playing Civ 5 or Age of Wonders 3, both are much better in my opinion and most importantly, more polished and dont bug out.

												This game isn't perfect and many people will find fault with it for a number of reasons. With that being said I love it. With its deep lore and massive amount of customization this is one that keeps me coming back over and over. Toss in some of the mods out there and you have a great time sinker that's very enjoyable. I very much recommend the XtraDeconstruct: Legacy of Magic mod.			"

												This game was a lot of fun. At first it was a little hard and I didn't know what to do. I quickly lost my first scenario as I was overrun by both wild creatures and enemy forces, but I felt like I learned from that first atempt. I used my new knowldege to fire up the same scenario again. This time I got much further but eventually I lost again. With each defeat I learned more and used that knowledge to improve my game. I learned that when I make custom units if I want to be able to upgrade them to plate mail later I need to give them the plate mail ability even if my current armour is only leather.I also learned that once a unit is trained as a foot soldier of some type it can not be given a mount latter on (I don't like that rule but knowing it helps out). there are small differance between the factions but I don't really see that much of a differeance between how the factions play. The biggest differeance is the Sovierng you start with. I wish there was some form of multiplayer even if it was hot seat. I also wish there was naval units/war fare. Whenever you run into a body of water there is no way to hop on a boat and travel. Still I've had lots of fun playing this game. Especially when fighting dragons and other big optional bosses on each map.			"

												I gave FE:LH yes to reccommed because I felt it had some very nice gameplay features.  I like the idea champs level up and can use items.  The customization is awesome. To be able to design a unit type during play and start producing them is outstanding.  For the most part the game is fun and easy to use.  Now for some of the things that you should be aware of before you jump in.  Serious pathing issues on game. for example it will show that you can make it to the enemy in one move. showing a straight line.  when you click button your pawn is sent off on a zig zag course and does not make it there or leaves you in an enemy controlled zone even though your army and enemy army were in your zone. This sometimes leaves your army open to a spell attack that can seperate or decimate your army alowing the enemy to mop your army up.  unfortunately once movement has begun there is no way to stop. some operations require double click and other single.  This lends to accidental clicks and the auto end turn finishing turn before your done.  lastly the most frusting for me, but bare in mind i stlll like to play, is on larger maps when map is nearly all occupied.  The game starts crashing.  At first i thought memory issues or graphics or what not but, this is what i found.  when game crashes and i validate files one file fails.  Validation fixes it and when it crashes again same file fails.  I personally can continue on like this but when it happens every 4-5 turns it gets a little annoying.			"

												I found this game in the bargain bucket in a game store. It was buy three games for £10 and after ages of searching for three games i was interested in i bought them and i have to say it was one of the best purchases i have made in a while. (Especially after seeing it's price on here.)Now this game doesn't exactly look (graphics wise) that brilliant- especially when comparing it to some games these days, but i think that can be excused. As this game is excellent. I have only put in 9 or 10 hours so far, but those 9 or 10 hours have been both brilliant and frustrating.My first game (after the tutorial) was fantastic. I was against two easy opponents, but i walked all over them and i had so much fun doing so. My second game i picked a map that was way to small for all 5 of us and as such we soon ran out of room and were all arguing with each other and i probably would have got destroyed if i didn't sorta rage-quit. xD My third game has gone a bit better, but i am still not exactly ""Top of the food chain"" so to speak and i can totally forsee a long and exciting game ahead of me.The factions are interesting and quite varied and you can make your own too, which is pretty cool. The heroes are also cool and often amongst the most powerful units in the game and i rather enjoyed making my own hero too- though again they don't look brilliant. The monsters.....sometimes don't look great, but that's not too important really. And can often be excused when your getting destroyed by them or if your good and actually beating them. I love the quests that pop up on the map and give me fun things to do. I've got some seriously powerful units from some of these quests. And i really love the building aspect in the cities. It's simple, with a lot of choice (when it's all researched) though i do feel there could be a lot more base units in the game, but then you can also design your own too, so there could be if you had the time to make them. And i rather like the battle system as well.So i would totally recommend this game to everyone. :) (Though perhaps not at full price.)			"

												This is a really fun fantasy strategy game, it has a really nice feel to it, being able to master really powerful in game items like dragon acolytes, ogre lairs and mercenry camps bring a real sense of satisfaction to advanced gamplay. There is a really cool quest and treasure system you can use to get experience for your heros. There are even raid type areas you can go into for bonus loot and there are plenty of ledgendary items your heros can loot.now the negatives, if you play for lets say more than 5 hours in a game in total all the quests dissapere and all the special areas dry up and it hard to level your heros without declaring war which inevitably due to you having most probably 1 or more dragon and several troll and ogre units with heros geared and level beyond god status you will wipe out the enemy 1 city at a time every time very easily with no contest. The diplomatic element in the game is pretty much non existant. if you are more powerful than the enemy they will pay you to leave them alone and vice versa. there is no other end game plan as far a diplomatic ai is concerned. my gripe is end game play is a massive black hole that doesnt even seem to really exist, once you have power and massive arimie there is no reason to play the game you cant5 even quest for fun, if they had more diplomacy options the game whold have lasted longer.Some times a game will get bugged and crash to desktop every few turns no matter how much you reload it. that contributes to lack of desire to finish a game after a few hours of play. The roaming monster mechanics can be a real pain as a massive all powerful elemental torments your realm and is immune to damage until you get more powerful items, this is a flaw in the gamplay and should not happen as it is massivly unfair as the start of the game is a massive land grab even the very large maps are quite smalland there is no place to go except wrestle with a beast you cannot kill that keep rampaging through your settlements.having said all that it is still a fun and interesting game with colourful elements you cant find anywhere. its incredibly immersive and has a real D&D feel to it. If you bought it it would keep you interested for quite some time. But as i mentioned before it hasnt been built to reach a deffinitive apex and your advanced games will simply be logged out of and never played on again. so potentially it has lifespan on an epic scale but your games will nevrr achieve these levels and its sort of frustrating leaving epic loot and god heros simply because there is no more game left.

Posted: September 18, 2015
												Fallen Enchantress is a 4X fantasy turn-based strategy game that mixes in turn-based tactical combat. I can't recommend it because it uses DRM (Stardock one-time online activation and registration) and mentions nothing on the store page (unlike games like GTAIV and Earth 2160 which disclose it properly). The actual game is mostly fine, but there are several points I'd like to see improved:The game pacing setting that says ""a game with accelerated technology progress"" also affects turn limit. It should only affect how fast techs are researched and there should be a separate setting for game length.I found the initiative list to be somewhat annoying to use- when I hover over a unit portrait on the list I'd expect to see the unit highlighted on the battlefield. Unfortunately it only works the other way around so you have to search one-by-one if you want to target something high on the initiative list.Needs shortcuts to target multiple/all units in an army for strategic spells. Ctrl+click and Shift+click don't work so you have to cast separately for every unit.Movement isn't forgiving- you can't allocate unused movement points after you move once (you move and you're stuck there, even if you misclicked).You should be able to queue up research on the tech tree. Currently you can only set one tech as a goal.When researching end-game repeatable tech, you should be able to choose 'continue research' to research it againRecruitable heroes that aren't humanoid in either size or shape aren't able to wear armor even if you take the chainmail/plate hero skill when levelling up. There should be a trait that says they cannot wear armor and you shouldn't be able to spend a point on that hero skill.Neutral enemies are friendly to AI. I've had outposts and cities destroyed from neutral units and then watched as they ignored the AI cities built on the same location turns later and never be attacked while the threat waits outside.In battle if your ranged unit is too far away then it moves the camera to that unit. That's fine to identify the unit, but I would like the option to turn that off because it moves the camera away from the enemies and I need to scroll back to the action to attack.The orange pickaxe icon sometimes means that there's a resource on that spot. However, other times it shows only resources that can be improved/available which is a lot more useful. I have no idea why/how to trigger it.When you have two armies on the same tile it seems like you can't choose who will defend an attack. So if you want to safely protect a weak unit like a pioneer/noblewoman that has to pass by an enemy, it needs to be in the actual army (and you have to hope the enemies don't kill them).There's a quest where a hunter thought his dog was killed by wolves. You find that his dog joined the wolves but there's an item you can use to tame beasts. However, even if you get the dog to join you're forced to say he's dead.Crashes occasionally, more than Civ 5 and less than Eador: MotBW. There are random bugs that occur. Rarely the game wouldn't let me move directly onto the square with an enemy's outpost to capture it. I got to move onto the square by clicking another tile but it still wasn't captured. Once I couldn't finish a monster zone (Delin, Pyre of Man). I cleared all monsters (confirmed with world vision spell) but couldn't get treasure from 'Remnants of the Inferno' tile even when moving onto it with a hero.There are a few typos, incorrect grammar, incorrect quest descriptions.The first scenario has a few bugs. It says you get +1000(?) crystal and later +1000(?) metal as quest rewards but you don't really get it. Another quest says it gives 10000 metal but at least you receive 1000. Occasionally there are treasure tiles that don't give rewards and don't activate when you stand on them.The second scenario has a lot of unnecessary dialogue popups. As you get stronger you get the usual 'AI doesn't like you' dialogue but they didn't disable it for your permanent allies. You can also trade (but no treaties) with your enemies even you're you're in permanent war. The funny thing is that in my playthrough Resoln was the weakest of the enemies in score for the whole game when you'd expect better from the story. Difficulty seems hard-locked to Beginner/Easy AI. Kraxis never pushed into Capitar while I did my own thing for the first >265 seasons before bothering to move east.Sometimes the game doesn't exit properly and keeps running in the background.One of my bigger gripes is that there isn't a way to turn off time victory. You can't take it slowly and explore/build up everything before time runs out, so you are forced to go for a win condition. That might be fine for some people but I wanted to fully explore the game when I was learning the mechanics. It also means you don't have the time to on a power trip by building up everything and then taking over the world with maxed-out heroes and units. The 'Continue the Adventure!' button at the end of the game only links you to the Amazon page for their book series and doesn't let you continue the game past the time limit.Other random thoughts:In the second scenario, Resoln didn't even have a coastal city like in the first scenario.When you zoom out to see the full world map, it's funny that any land that touches the border extends infinitely instead of being rounded off with coast.

												This game seems to be somewhat controversial due to being a standalone expansion to a previous game. I bought it without having played the previous installments, and I find it awesome. I have tried several of the latest fantasy 4X games in the spirit of Master of Magic (Age of Wonders III, Warlock: Master of the Arcane) and this one is by far the best IMHO.The balance between strategy, city development, hero development, tactical combat and adventure/RPG events is just right. The magic is great. The tactical combat is good - not as deep as in AOW3, but more than enough in my book. Very similar to that in Master of Magic. The variety in sovereigns and the possibilities for roleplaying ensure replayability.But the best feature is that you can create your own units! Instead of having only a predefined range of units, you get some guys, give them a particular weapon, armor, mount, special boni and characteristics, art, etc. and you design your own kind of troop - of course the more powerful you make it, the more it will cost to actually build one. I spent hours fiddling with the unit builder alone.The AI has been criticized, maybe it's not the best but to be honest I don't see the difference with other complex 4X games. Even in an universally appraised franchise like Civ games, the AI is just not that intelligent and higher difficulty levels work by cheating, giving the AI boni and knowledge that the player doesn't have access to (those nuclears that always went to your only city without SDI in Civ 2, lol). I suppose adding extra elements like magic doesn't help with making human-like AIs - the AI in Master of Magic was notorious for doing really dumb things and cheating a lot, even more so than in Civ, and all of us that are old enough to have played that in its time had a great time with it. I'm having a great time with this one too, and to be honest the AI didn't catch my attention for being bad at all, I only learned people had a problem with it by reading reviews. Maybe it was worse in previous versions and they have improved it over time, as I bought the game when the latest version was already 1.7.My only gripe with this game is that it doesn't have a hall of fame: even though it gives you a score and a rank, it doesn't keep track of your best scores... it's a somewhat dumb thing to care about, I know, but I'm competitive and seeing my best scores and trying to beat them motivates me a lot. The developers said they are going to add this feature eventually, I hope they do.But in summary, great game, lots of good content and many hours of fun in it. I think it's very underrated and it's a pity that such a gem is not better known, that's why I have decided to write this.			"

												An unfinished, unbalanced, unresponsive game with a buggy GUI and a bad&buggy engine and no game-balance in sight. Even the old ""Master of Magic"" is better than this game and the AI is worse than the AI from ""Civilization 1"".Oh and external registration required... Don't forget to uncheck the 'spam e-mail' from them.It's just a bad attempt at their 'sequel' of ""Master of Magic"" that failed completely. But you can buy their fairly expensive DLC's that will vaguely remind you of the Tropico DLC's in terms of 'price to content ratio'.The music is extremely terrible, the sound effects seem like they are 20 years old. Ambient sounds are hardly present, if at all and the graphics are... barely doable.You can't start a city wherever you want, you must do so on predefined locations. That is a serious limitation for me.Moving units on the world map can be a bit slow (the game needs to calculate the pathing or something). Even with low settings and a fast PC, I can't get it improved at all even though all my cpu's and videocard and such are only running at like 20%. There is something really wrong with this engine.The GUI is very unresponsive and if you are too fast (like you return to the main menu while the game was about to show you a level-up menu or something) the game gets permanently stuck.The AI may randomly invade you with pioneers (settlers) that destroy your improvements.The AI may ignore neutral monsters and plays a different game than you. They won't be attacked as often (or not at all). According to the devs this is a bug that they are investigating... Pretty serious if you ask me.The AI is just stupid in general and can not even remotely be called 'intelligent'. It's artificial and that's it.And the AI just goes like all ICS (infinite city&outpost spam) on you:


The AI really had to settle there?? 
A Screenshot of Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes

Yeah they put a pioneer in every single spot they can get even if it's totally useless... Frustrating over 9000.Either go in perma war and kill their pioneers before they start a city/outpost, or fill all the gaps yourself. But unlike the AI, YOU have to defend your cities/outposts from neutral monsters, they don't.This company should at least have bought an existing engine if they can't create their own and those graphics and music and sfx... It seems as if they had no budget for this game at all.Oh and did I mention the random crashes? Even on streams and Youtube I often see people saving, not because they fear the battle but because they fear that the game might crash.I can't find a single reason to buy this game. Well, perhaps the first 5 minutes of the game can be fun but that's about it.			"

												Civilizations + Heroes of Might and Magic = Fallen Enchantress. Awesome game with a lot of backstory. I tried it during the free weekend, bough it and been playing since. I just wish they threw in a campaign mode like. Age of Wonders so you can bring your leader through it leveling all the time. Starting up new games on like my 4th I finally got the lvl 15 acheivement, but even there I'm only a quarter threw magi abilities. I wanna keep leveling the same character. Also the game sorely lacks anything to do with water.(I mean besides water magic) Are boats that hard? Couldn't the undead just walk? Why won't my dragon actually fly so he could go over mountains and such? Other than some minor quips here a crash or two there, I'd highly recommend this to fans of either civilizations, HOMM, or even Age of Wonders though this falls short of that game by a bit. Even they had catapults and giant spiders taking up like 2-4 slots; meanwhile, my 100x the size of me dragons take up one slot :pBest part is you can completely customize the factions and leaders to your liking.  I love customization.			"

												There are not enough 4x games placed in fantasy world, and that's a shame. I placed a lot of hope in Fallen Enchantress, as I saw many positive reviews on forums and gaming sites. The game itself is quite frankly...average. Or even below average. The system itself is good and fun, lot of items to loot, monsters to kill, researches to do, empires to dominate. When you add mods it is even better. The sad part, and what makes this game almost ""♥♥♥♥♥♥"" is that it is so bugged, that it makes it sometimes unplayable (for a lot of people, just check official forum support page). The games crashes a lot, there is some kind of problem with memory leaks. The grid on tactical map is almost invisible so it is hard to tell where your troops can move. Sometimes the turn doesn't want to end, and only way is to reset the whole game. What is shamefull, is that mods from players are much better than the ""Vanilla"" game itself. It pisses me off, to see ""another dlc"" every month, when they can't even fix basic problem with game (bugs, crashes and incredible bad game optimisation). In my opinion, the game itself is not worth the money. It can give a lot of fun, but at the same time the frustration is unbearable.			"

												Fantastic strategy game from Stardock the gods. They are responsible for maybe the greatest space strategy game of all time, Galaactic Civilization II. Things did not go as planned with Elemental, a game that had a ton of good ideas but in the end was to ambitious and way to many bugs. What does stardock do after that? well they give the fans the enxt 3 games FREE. Legendary Heroes is a awesome game and one of hte best strategy games of the last few years. Stardock listens to there fans and there fans love htem for it, if you want a  new strategy game with rpg elements pick this up! Stardock has also helped made and publish the wonderful SINS OF A SOLAR EMPIRE. Support great devs people!			"

												It took me a little while to decide whether or not I'd recommend this game. To be honest, I'm somewhere around the middle. I almost certainly wouldn't recommend it to someone who wants something of the depth of the Civilization games, but I would recommend it to someone who is new to the genre. I decided to go with a thumbs up rating as it's not really deserving of a thumbs down.This is a perfectly fine game, I just feel that there's not much to it after a few games. It's great fun for those few games, but I've found it doesn't really bring much to the table and doesn't feel as randomized as it should. I played a few games and found the same events cropping up in each game and it got monotonous. It's possible that the various DLC will provide a lot more customisation and randomisation, but on paper it doesn't seem to deliver so I haven't tried. If you're looking to recreate that Civilization or similar 4x feeling, this probably isn't the right game for it. Sure, it has elements of Civilization: build cities, explore, build armies, etc, but its lacking depth. The Fantasy setting is great and the addition of RPG elements is fine, but I found levelling and customising new heroes to be quite overwhelming on top of everything else. That, plus the research trees and hero skill trees leave a lot to be desired. It's fun to get stuck into a game or two on this, but after that I was done with the game. If you're desperate for a 4x game get this when it's on sale. It'll keep you occupied for a good few hours..			"

												Interesting game, and I like a lot of the ideas. The overall concept is solid, and it implements some brilliant improvements over similar games in places. I really want to like this game a lot more than I do.But... (and we all knew THAT was coming)The graphics are tolerable until you get to the hero units. Human models are Not Good. The clothing options feel like they must be at several inches thick in places.Depending on your chosen 'race', you will have resource shortfalls for a good long while. Also, heroes cost a fairly high amount of upkeep in gold... and when one is available to purchase, the game tends to not give you the option of NOT purchasing.The entire backstory and current story of the game setting feels a bit bland and unrefined.and the tech and skill trees are... how to put this... short. on. options.Overall, while the game is not strictly BAD, it is not nearly as good as the somewhat unfinished, glitchy Civilization 4 TCMod that came before it.I'm still likely to play this once in a while, but it's just going to send me scuttling back to Fall from Heaven 2. I'm recomending it though, since honestly, it's better than a lot of the alternatives OTHER than FfH2, which can be twitchy.			"

I love leveling up heroes and taking on some of the Lengendary Monsters that haunt various locations on the map.

												The game brings back memories of Master of Magic; the feeling of being a powerful wizard in a magical world. The ability to affect creatures, countryside and cities through magic. Ruling an empire where magic and mundane meet.The AI does not seem great (nor was it with Master of Magic) and some parts of the game seem unbalanced (e.g. a dragon does feel a bit like an 'I win' button) but the game is just an enjoyable escape to a magical land.Even for a single play through as I have done so far the game has been worth its money; In my case money I spent on the original Elemental which got upgraded to this game.Perhaps not the best 4x game out there but I certainly got several entertaining hours out of it and I'm just getting started.

												As a big fan of 4X games, Fallen Enchantress is in my top 5 along with Civilization, Endless Legend and Master of Magic. The great thing is that alongside great empire building and warmongering, you have armies and heroes that you can send forth on epic quests - even to conquer a series of fabled lands with monsters that can rock the very foundation of the land.More often than not the other players in the game become mere footnotes in the stories that your heroes bring back; no more than annoyances when they fight for dominion while you are called to much more important quests. All in all a tremendously fun, highly replayable quest-enhanced fantasy empire building RPG.Highly recommended indeed.			"

												This is a passable Fantasy themed 4x game, but the thing that keeps bringing me back to it is the Adventure RPG aspects. The RPG elements are simple, but you really feel like every level matters. Equipping your heroes is engaging as well. The combat is ok, but I end up auto-resolving most encounters that I can get away with. I'm just here for the levels and perks and the badass Hero-filled Army stack tearing around the countryside on horseback wiping out monsters and opposing players alike while completing quests from learning about hygene from a time traveler to taking over the world by controlling all Dragons.FE:LH is a less swingy and more balanced version than the previous Elemental series games, but that lack of vareity in other places really lets me focus on what I like about it, running around raising mountains and wiping out ancient elemental creatures so I can post their heads in my cities.

												WARNING: This game requires a Stardock account to activate!-That said, i THINK that I will enjoy the game. So far, I've only played the tutorial. I'll come back and do a more complete review later, after playing more, but I wanted to get the warning out to those who (like me) don't like to have to set up seperate accounts (and the resulting junk mail) in order to play the game. Other reviews have compared this to Master of Magic (MOM), the Civ games, and even to Heroes of M&M. It IS most like MOM and the early Civ games. There are cities to build, and stuff to research, and armies to send out to explore and conquer. Those armies can (as with MOM) include Champions. So that is similar to Heroes 4. And there are some ""quests"" the completion of which is important to increase your fame. Fame is important because (as in MOM) the more famous you are the more and better champions you attract.Combat is turn-based on square tiles, but the tiles only affect movement. Spells and arrows can be cast/shot in any direction. and you can attack on a 45 degree angle. (Unlike the rediculous combat on the new ""M&M"" 10. But don't get me going on that!)-In sumary, if you have played MOM, after a few controll adjustments, you will be able to play FE:LH. And if you miss the Halcyon days Of Microsoft (MOM, and Master of Orion 1 and 2) and 3DO (Might and Magic 1-9, and Heroes 1-4) they are available on Great old Games (GOG.com) and often go on sale for 2 or 3 bucks. They work through a DOS window so they will work on almost any modern computer.I think FE:LH will have some of that old magic to it. So, in spite of the whole Stardock account thing, I'm glad i bought it.Update: I've played through one game and it was enjoyable. And the game-play does fall somewhere between MOM and Civ II. It won't ever make  a list of MY Most Favorite Games. But it is one that I will go back to from time to time. A worthwhile addition to any Strategy Gamer's collection.			"

												TL/DR: Avoid the game, there are better ones of the same genre.I am a sucker for 4x fantasy games, and I really want to like the Fallen Enchantress.  It mixes strategy and RPG elements.  But the bugs and deal breakers really make this game not a good one.  A real shame. Border of influence will not show, need to restart game. Memory leaks, after loading games multiple times, it will lag then stops working.  Need to restart game after loading saves 2-3 times. Forces the camera to focus on a certain city, so if there is a message of some outpost is destroyed, then click show me, it wont, because it will focus on the city at the start of your turn. AI casted grip of winter to one of my city, it disables the build button on ALL of my cities.  I tried to restart the game, still the same.  I checked their in-game encyclopedia, the tooltip says, ""stops production to the target players cities"", so I think it is a global spell. Because it affected all of my cities.  Waited many turns, thinking it is not permanent, found out on my own it is a bug, that I need to remove the spell from my cities. Bad designs of buttons, click build here, click build here again.  Click somewhere else mistakenly, build screen will disappear. Mechanics are interesting, but in-game help is no help at all. Horrible implementation. You wont know what spells are casted againts you, unless the AI says so, the notification is sometimes hidden or not prevalent. "

												First of all, I have to stay that Stardock is great and fair company. I bought Elemental back in the day and that game wasn't too good. They acknoledged that and gave me first Fallen Enchantress and this game for free. I didn't expect or ask them to do that either.Now about this game. It has certainly improved somewhat from the previous iterations, but the core problems still remain. Basically, it's trying to be a Civ type strategy game and a some sort of light RPG at the same time and fails at both because of this. For the kingdom level strategy I feel the detail level is too high. You'll have to research everything from daggers and small shields to 2-h swords and plate mail one small step at the time. There is a choice of dozens of buildings to construct in the cities, many of which should be abstracted, IMO. It's fine to equip the heroes in detail, but same detail in regular unit building bogs it down. Of course one can just use the default units so it's not the biggest problem.Speaking of equipping heroes, how can I build a squad of longbowmen that doesn't cost money to build, but when I want to equip one of my heroes with a longbow, I have to pay for it... a lot. There's a disconnect between the startegy ""layer"" and RPG one there. Should be that conventional equipment for heroes is available for free as long as I have the tech for it, but enchanted equipment must be bought, found or crafted.Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm under impression that Stardock had bought the rights for Master of Magic, but decided to make Elemental instead. That's a shame because I think it would have been great success with but slight modernization. This game would be better if it was more like MOM. Still, I find myself playing in sessions of hour or two so it's not all bad.Getting better, but can't recommend it at least yet. Sorry Stardock.			"

												I enjoyed this game immensely, and I would recommend it to anyone that really enjoys a good strategy game with a heroic element to it.I got attached to my heroes, my cities, and my troops on my first play through.  So much so that I created an entire nation in the likeness of past roleplaying experiences and all of my heroes were a part of that nation, personalized colors, banners, and all.  This aspect of the game gives it extra replayability, since each nation can have its strengths and weaknesses, along with its heroes perfections and flaws.  Combine that with the ability to build a city however you see fit, be it a fortress on the bay, a river side village tilling gold, or a forest enclave where the wisest of the sages study the elements to provide your civilization with insurmountable power, the options are endless.When you're not at war, your heroes can adventure across the country side fighting bandits, banshees, giants and mystical creatures, all while uncovering secrets of ages past that make your empire even more powerful.  In time as your power grows, your heroes can lead their armies into epic battles against the fiercest of dragons in the depths of boneyards teeming with the souls of the tortured, fighting to control the worlds remaining population of dragons.The idea that you can make this game whatever you want makes it so worth while.  If you're in it for a quick match, go for it.  If you're like me and like to get in-depth with your games and truly take your time while enjoying every aspect the game has to offer, you're also in for a real treat.  You could easily sink hundreds of hours into this game, depending on the bounds of your imagination.Do I recommend this game?  Wholeheartedly.  If you enjoy gearing your heroes and your armies in an RPG fashion, a solid strategic experience, as well as a beautiful visual experience, I wouldn't wait any longer.			"

City founding and building is quite fun, especially when your challenges are not only economy and hunger, but also a horde of trolls wandering around.  Hire heroes, train armies, and send them off to slay the random (and not so random) monsters... just in time to negotiate with some foreign leaders.			"

												a lot of the reviews you are going to hear about this comes from the incredible disappointment felt in the previous iterations - Elemental: War of Magic was a game I liked a lot but was pretty  broken, and then it was remade to fallen enchantress, and finally legendary heroes. It has come a long way. One of my favorite games of all time is Sins of a Solar Empire so I am the kind of guy that gives Stardock the benefit of the doubt. This version of the game seems to be exactly what we were looking for. It's an RPG first, with strategy elements, and has really great combat. This is probably my last purchase for the Winter sale but I saved the best for last and look forward to dropping a couple hundred hours into this.			"

												Ok, outline review and then I'll get to my main complaints. -The tutorial was lacking. For example, it glossed over how yields work in this game and explained with concepts foreign to a first time player(what is essence?). Most of it was in video format which was a waste of time when I could've just read one or two lines to understand. -Graphics are not my style at all. Black outline around everything. Cartoony (which i dont mind) yet ugly. -Lots of unit customization which I've recently started enjoying from other games like Endless Legend and AoW3. Except I still usually prefer Civ style units that all fill a niche. If you like customization then you will love it in this game.-I heard multiplayer crashes alot. - Mostly combat based game. Diplomacy is lacking, rather than strategicly choosing city locations it's about getting lucky with finding good tile yields.-Combat is mostly simplistic. Think of heroes of might and magic or a japanese SRPG. Does not account for facing. melee units try to gang up on units, ranged stays away. includes a turn order bar. I prefer AoW3 for this. -The magic system is (again) comparable to the heroes series or age of wonders.  upkeeps, strategical map spells as well as combat spells. -You can make OP imba builds. AFAIK, the AI can't. -As usual the AI cheats at higher levels. Not complaining. How would you make a superhuman chess algorithm with a thousand more variables and with gameplay mechanics that were constantly adjusted through patches? As long as its passable. - Quests are randomly placed but chosen from a small pregenerated pool. These are a neat fluff to accompany the constant combat but you start seeing the same ones again really quickly. The writing isn't too shabby.The UI *SUCKS*. The load button is hidden behind 4 keystrokes. There are no screens showing data for all cities at once. want to see unrest? you have to open click them individually and hunt for the stat. Did you just level up or get a new hero? You're not allowed to minimize the selection screen to check what else you have. With auto end turn enabled, the game will execute commands  you queued on other armies even though you need to make an adjustment. Without auto end turn, the game lacks clear notifications. Oh, it has some but its certainly not clear. Where is the hotkeys list? Gotta look that up online. On that topic, this game actually has a convenient quick save button unlike a lot of other 4X games. In game manual lacks a search function but at least its alphabetically ordered. I want to say that the game isn't too shabby... except it is. It's not for me but I know there are people out there who would enjoy this. Recommended for people who want a customizable, combat based, fantasy themed 4X. Just check out the other games I mentioned in my review first ;-)			"

												An outstanding strategy game that gives you a world and lets you imagine. This game has a lot of imaginative features and it really feels like you're creating a new custom empire each time you play through a game. So if you're looking for replayability I can definitely say that this is something worth looking at. The combat for the game could be improved some. It can be challenging some games, but generally what happens is that you get enough momentum going with your army that you eventually steam roll everything, and if you manage to get a dragon you might as well stop playing because nothing is going to stop you after that, not even another dragon. Still, it can be a very challenging experience if you want it to be, and if you like games that let you imagine and create your own story then I cannot reccommend this enough.			"

												While the hex based tiles led me to think that the game mechanics might resemble Civ, I'd say FE: LH is a closer cousin to HOMM, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  The game gets you focused on leveling up and equiping the units in your party so that you can fight stronger enemies.  It's a fun game, but I can't help but think that perhaps it might have benefitted from having a campaign format like HOMM.  Dynamic maps seem better suited to games that focus more on territories and cities.It has an impressive tech tree, and I think this is where it really stands out.  Every technology looks meaningful and you really do get a sense of progression.  I do recommend on picking a slower progression setting because the normal setting seems too quick.			"

												Seems kind of decent but the clunky interface pushes me away. Customization optons seem broad but shallow, of the ""here are 50 different +1s"" style. The game is front-loaded with annoyances like learning an interface that is slightly off in every way, being offered city positions where you cannot build any buildings, and dealing with wandering monsters vastly stronger than your starting troops. Other reviews suggest that it blossoms in the mid/late game once you get used to all that, then becomes tedious in a drawn-out endgame or with trivial difficulty once you master the options, so I do not feel compelled to get over the initial hurdle.""Hard to learn, easy to master"" is not a good design goal.

												The game is enjoyable, but I can't in good conscience give a positive review to a game that crashes so much.  It's been out for over 3 years, how is this not a polished product by now?  Unforgiveable in my books.The game play is decent, the story is good (script is not, but that's ok), artwork is a bit rough but animations are ok - even if they are too zoomed out to enjoy fully.The game is fun enough, good mechanics, UI, etc, but this game freezes on me at least once every 2-3 days.  If it was a new game I could let it slide a bit, but this is a old game.  Get your sh!t together, Stardock.			"

												This is a nice game, if you like the old ""Master of Magic"" genre. The graphics is a little cartoonish at first sight, but then you get used to it, and it is not bad. When you succeed in assembling a deadly army and you start to slain your enemies and the many monsters you find in the map, it is very satisfactory. Thumbs up!			"

												After a few false starts and many patches this game is a pleasure to play, nicely balanced with the ""just one more turn"" factor.  Many things to customise, a lovely tech tree with different focuses depending upon your playing style.  Create your own units and equip them with things that make them a terror on the battlefield.I found the AI quite good and on higher difficulties it makes a truely challenging experience. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the 4X genre.			"

												An interesting, fun and at times difficult game, Fallen Enchantresses only downfall is it's lack of online mode. The campaign mode is solid if not limiting, white the freeplay is where this game really shines. The chance for customizing your faction and nation are plentiful and satisfying, with different races, selectable traits and customizable units. The game is open to modding, with a fairly active online modding community, although there is no steam workshop built in so you may have to be a little tech savvy.			"

(imagine that:)Possibly Steam in background seams to try to steal cpu occasionally.Overall I think it's great, well done.			"

												When it comes to turn-based strategy and empire-building, Fallen Enchantress really is a dream come true in some respects. It's a welcome change of pace from traditional worlds and strategy games that we've become all too familiar with. Sure, it's cool playing as Nobunaga in the next ""Conquer Japan"" strategy game... and it's fun playing around in the Civilization series. But what I love about Fallen Enchantress is that it's a fresh world with unique characters that we don't know anything about right off the bat. The game has it's own unique flavor and the ability to customize many aspects of the game to your liking. All of these are fantastic aspects to this game. However, it is not without some understandable criticism.While it appears simple, it is a game you can easily get frustrated with. Sometimes straight up bad luck can screw players from the get-go. This can even begin with just where you start on a map in a new scenario game. You can be blessed with starting in a very sound strategic location... or you can start in an area where expansion can be a total nightmare (for example, between an ocean, 20 tiles of barren wasteland and no resources and a bunch of monster bases that can easily crush starting players). This is a common criticism I have with other strategy games due to this common pitfall (from a design standpoint) is when too many things are influenced by luck (or sheer randomness, to be precise). Strategy games should be about tactics, placement and preparation. And Fallen Enchantress rewards it and punishes those that just blunder about randomly. Which is great. In that way, it's a strategy game. However, it can also feel like you are rewarded (or punished, more likely) on the roll of the dice. In *that* way, it's an unpredictable strategy game -- which can sometimes be fun and sometimes just be annoying.In the end, though... would I recommend Fallen Enchantress? Yes. It's a gem in its own right. I'd also recommend getting it on a deal, as I did.			"

												This is how every 4X strategy game should be. I have played way too many hours, playing and winning with every nation. The customizable units and warlord make the game interesting. I even created a few mega warlords to give myself more of a challenge. The DLC are all well worth the price. Having spent so many hours all I can say was this game is worth every penny. I only hope they make another installment, so I can spend what freetime I have on it.			"

												As a 4X fan, I liked Fallen Enchantress. Not the best out there but good enough to spend 160  hours apparently!I liked the world, the super monsters and how you get to run around and level up on random monsters before fighting the other factions. The wandering monsters give you more things to do early on rather than the typical ""wait X turns for the colonizer unit to be complete"" syndrome. Mid-game, there is a good variety of resources you can try to acquire to customize your troops to fight the other factions. End-game, the boss monsters provide a nice diversion from stomping cities.Couple reasons why this game is good and not great:1) not enough diversity - other than the Resoln, the other factions play quite similar; the units are also the same for everyone2) AI is lacking - not that rare of a problem, bu the presence of powerful monsters makes it so the computer needs to cheat more than often, it kills a lot of mobs and seems to never get ambushed by them3) some curious design choices - in particular I hate how you are limited to placing cities in certain spots; I don't understand the need for this			"

												Do you like Civilization? Do you like RPG's? This is basically Civ where you can level up your leader like an RPG character, give them gear and talents, and let them go forth and do your bidding. Also there's questing, recruiting magical creatures or other heroes.You control various cities with an area of influence around them, and deal with managing cities by building structures, focusing on what the city produces, and doing research, as well as controlling natural resources on the map. There are wandering monsters (Think Barbarians in Civ) that pop up from time to time and they may attack a city if they are close enough.You can build armies of general sorts of units, but even this has flavor because you're not just designing them and naming them, you pick the equipment and gear they use, and you do have the ability to auto-upgrade existing units to whatever the newest armor/weapons that your research has unlocked, provided you have the resources.The real fun comes from heroes, who either are recruited during certain quests or random events, or seek you out to join you when you have accomplished enough to gain enough fame. Your Sovreign (your faction's leader) is a hero with talent trees with plenty of choices, spells, and gear just like any good RPG. They can be skilled up to be good at managing a city, good at leading an army, or good fighters in and of themselves (or anything in between really). The same goes for other heroes you come across.There is diplomacy with other empires but for the most part you're flying solo and trying to win on your own. There are numerous victory options, and most mirror the ones you'd find in Civ.The random events and quests are varied and interesting, and the randomly generated maps lead to a lot of replayability.The weakest aspects of the game are the city building (which, while it has depth, is nowhere near what you'd find in a dedicated city building game), the RPG aspects (while there's a lot to do and the random events are good, eventually you'll get some repeats after you've played a bunch of games). They are both pretty well done but not great - it is better than average at both but exceptional at neither. Additionally, there's not really ANY story or campaign mode. You have scenarios, but this is largely a sandbox with a randomly generated map and any story is going to be what you personally make of it via the random events that happen.HOWEVER: This game supports mod tools and user-created races, maps, items, quests, etc. Any variety the game lacks out of the box goes away if you poke around the official forums for a bit and find something that changes things you dislike (or make your own).In sum, this game is quite enjoyable and I find myself equally drawn in by both the empire building and RPG aspects of it. Neither aspect is 100% perfect, but the games can be long (especially if you play on enormous maps with lots of AI as I tend to), and if I get bored with the RPG aspect for a bit, I'll spend time focusing on just my cities for a bit. The game lets me play it however I want and never forces me to do anything, and there's enough to do that I consistently go back to it.It's been out for awhile now and you can probably pick it up at a decent price. The DLC is fine - it's not must-have and it's not a waste of money. It's mostly small things - new heroes, new quests, new items, which all randomly pop up in your game. The game is fun with them, but nothing stands out as  absolute must-haves. Get the DLC if you get the game and enjoy it and want more of it, or if you get the game bundled with it at a decent price.			"

												Being perfectly honest I have no idea how I ended up getting this game. Not sure if it was a gift, part of a pack of games I got for free on a random page or whatever, but it’s an actually quite interesting game. However as usual, I will start with the negative parts of it:You know, this game let’s you create your own race, heroes and♥♥♥♥♥♥WHICH IS QUITE COOL, however something I totally HATE is not being able to edit that race. The first time you make your own, you'll have NO IDEA WHAT YOU’RE DOING, so being able to test it out and change what doesn’t work out should be a pretty normal thing to have. But no, the option isn’t there, which is disappointing.Something that I also don’t quite like is how passive the AI always seems to be. If you don’t play in really high difficulty matches, it always seems that it’s me the one being an #sshole and invading others, as they never seem to make a move. And when they finally do, it’s some sort of suicidal attack that’s as pointless as a submarine on Mars.Lastly, the game has a feature of not letting heroes die, but instead damaging them permanently. It’s a system I like, however if a hero gets killed by the last damn enemy, doesn’t matter how many heads he bashed into the ground, not only he doesn’t get ANY EXPERIENCE but he also gets injured for life. That’s bullsh#t. At least give him less XP, but not NO XP AT ALL!However, ignoring the negative stuff, what do we have left? A weird mix between Civilizations and Final Fantasy Tactics… Of all things. Yeah, it’s a weird f#cking mix but it actually works quite well.As I’ve said before, you create your own race and play against custom or default other races in open maps, what sets this game apart from other Civ clones however, is the RPG style it has. There are items, quests and monsters out there, and your heroes level up and get quite powerful as they grow.The game also has a unit creator tool, quite basic but it gives you the choice of setting your own troops by default, as expensive and game-breaking as you see fit. It’s quite fun… But since enemies won’t use it, their troops usually never catch on to you.Maps usually also have some story and mayor quests going on, something that I totally like. And since most players on the map will want to clear those out, it adds to the competitive nature of these kind of games.Is it a good game? Yeah, it is. However it seems to be kinda obscure and not well known. I would recommend it for any Civilizations fan who wants to try something new, although as usual, on a good sale.TL;DR Edition: Civilizations mixed with RPG and turn-based elements. A good mix, with a few problems that are easy to overlook. Good for fans of strategy games, and a solid purchase on a sale.			"

												I got this game a while back and found it decent enough.  It gets a little stale after a while in the scenarios but overall it was as described.  However, I started playing through the first campaign and ran into a game breaking bug; a mountain blocking the only path to move forward.  Turns out its a know issue for six months now...  Finally a few weeks ago the developers finally acknowledged the issue and promised a fix next patch.  It patched this week but they didn't borther to fix the game killing bug.

												This feels a LOT like Heroes of Might and Magic, but with more emphasis on the empire building aspect. I liked Stardock's Galactic Empires games, and I wished this had borrowed more basic features from them. If you like 4X games, you may enjoy this. That said, there are some basic things that are pretty broken - the inability to alter build queues once you've chosen them is particularly frustrating.I really want this game to be better. The basic idea is great, but it falls short on expectations. I would check out any sequels to see if they've fixed some of the basic issues. It feels like they're very close to an awesome game here, but it comes up short.Worthwhile for an evening or two if you want to try 4X in a realm of fantasy and magic, but make sure you get it on sale to minimize the financial impact of the disappointments.

That would be bearable, but every few times it crashes it locks up my system, forcing me to restart. Also, Stardock apparently has no plans to fix this well known and extremely common issue. They're to busy trying to sell their new game, and have abandoned this one like they did the two before it.Oh yeah, speaking of their new game, thay advertise it on the main menu of this one.

Thinking about your options yields benefits at both the strategic and tactical level, the random monsters provide a lot of spice that keeps things interesting, and on challenging and higher difficulty levels the AI is tough.Don't let the somewhat goofy graphics fool you, if you enjoy turn-based 4X strategy games, you will probably enjoy this one.

												Honestly, I don't know how to rate this game. So in this review I'm going to talk myself through formulating a rating, and maybe you'll see why I am so confused by how to rate this game.- To start lets point this out. This game is HORRIBLY optimized. I averaged 40 FPS as low as 20 and I have a beast rig. But I averaged these fps on EVERY graphical setting. Max, medium, and low. Did the devs even aim for 60fps? I guess not.+ These graphics are good enough for me, I enjoy them. But a lot of persons today may want something better. The game was released in 2012 though. We didn't have any Witcher 3 graphics back then, remember?+/- The sounds were decent, but nothing to write home about.+ The game has a story mode with two scenarios. One is essentially a ""Squad-based"" campaign where you mostly use ""hero"" units to accomplish quests. The second plays essentially like the main ""skirmish""-esque game mode plays (Which is called ""new game"" and that's it), except with some added story that keeps it far more interesting than the regular skirmish mode.- The repetition in the game is....ugh. Its the same quests over and over again. If you play ""new game"" first, you'll never enjoy the story mode because you've already done everything you can do in the story mode for 9 hours at least beforehand. If you do story mode first you'll never appreciate ""new game""due to its lacking of the main story content that kept the scenarios interesting. The game's formula grows old after 5 hours.+/- The turn based combat is something unique for this game in the 4X scene. It keeps the game very interesting, an even a little hard in the beginning. Eventually you learn the perfect strategy for each map because honestly, it doesn't have many. Then it just becomes a chore, and since auto-resolve tends to favor you anyway, you tend to skip the feature entirely. It's good...but becomes bad.So I still am lost about what to give this game. Honestly, the game has a very mediocre feel in every aspect of it. From the studio that made so many good RTS games, you'd think they'd be able to get a turn based game down pretty easily. But honestly, I'm going to have to give the game a 5/10. It was fun, eventually the repetition and lack of optimization got to me. (Eventually being 5 hours in. Its amazing that I made it to nearly 20 hours). It's a very AVERAGE game with some very poor design decisions. Mostly bug-free though.So do I recommend it? Well.....no. It was more of a chore than it was fun to play. So even if it was fun for a little bit. Well...It's really just not worth your money, ok? Please save yourself the  headache that this game induces and just avoid it.			"

												This game has some advantages and disadvantages to a similar title with a lot more polish: Endless Legends. I thought I'd compare the two.Advantages to Fallen Enchantress:+ You can rotate the map, which is nice in tactical mode (during battles).+ The quests you get have less variety compared to Endless Legends, but in Enchantress they invariably involve combat of some kind, which is good for people who like combat. Also, there are sometimes branching paths in quests, a concept pretty much unheard of in Endless.+ The fantasy setting is great if you like that kind of thing. I do, and it's the biggest reason to like this game imho. Endless Legends has this strange cyberpunk/fantasy hybrid thing going on which rarely makes sense.+ Huge customization. You can create your empire or kingdom from scratch, rather than the civ standby of picking from the list of pre-made leaders. You can pick and choose bonuses (and penalties) to fit your playstyle, as well as having full control over the color palette that will appear on your units and cities. While equipping units is done in Endless Legends as well as Fallen Enchantress, Enchantress has a tad more variety in the early game and also has the advantage that your units change their appearance with their gear, a feature Endless lacks.Disadvantages to Fallen Enchantress:- The maps. City placement is restricted to fixed locations, and battles play out in an instanced flat plane with no variety. In Endless Legends you can build wherever the hell you want like a normal civ game and when two stacks of units fight, the overall game pauses and the units spread out into the surrounding tiles, to duke it out for six rounds. This means that units are affected by terrain and elevation, and it also means battles can be stalemates or attrition fights rather than the forced fight to the death in Enchantress.- Diplomacy is wonkier than Civ. When I played, I regularly had enemy civs offer me money out of the blue. There's a demand tribute button on the diplomacy screen, but there's also a give tribute button which will automagically give the recieving player 10% of your gold income for 30 turns. If your arbitrary point total (if you played any recent Civ game you know what I mean) is above a certain point, your opponents will shower you in gifst in the hope that you attack them last. It's funny at first, until you realize that ten percent of their income is almost always nothing and it's a completely hollow gesture in the first place. If you accept tribute from them, it gives the other civ a negative diplomacy moodlet becaude 'you demanded tribute from them'. Which, ironically, makes them more afraid you'll attack them and more likely to give tribute in the future. Also worth noting is treaties and trade are separate options in this game and that treaties must be picked one at a time, so you can't do things like sign borders agreements or take cities in exchange for peace. You either mutually accept peace (with a possible bribe in gold if needed), or you surrender everything and quit the game. There is no other way to end a war prematurely.- No navy. The sea (and air) are sorely lacking in Fallen Enchantress. Any lakes you encounter (and you will) are impassible voids. This is a shame, because a heavy focus into earth magic (if you're lucky enough to randomly generate a champion unit that knows some) eventually nets you the ability to terraform the land around you. You can turn sea into land, land into settleable land or hills, hills to mountains and vice versa. The problem is that, as mentioned, terrain has no impact on combat and cities don't work neighboring tiles, so there's very little motivation to actually do this.- The minimalistic approach. Numbers in this game are very small. You'll spend ten turns on a building that nets you +1 science per turn. Every customization option in this game, from making units to leveling champions to constructing buildings to upgrading them to using spells in or out of combat to making your empire in the first place, all of them are minimalistic tweaks. Despite all the options you have, none of it actually does much of anything. You might see a building that generates double the science that your city already produced, until you realize you built every science building available and you're only producing seven, and that building replaces another one which already increased your science output by 75% so instead of netting +7 science for your twenty turns of production, you're actually only getting +1. Your units will get damage buffs of 10 to 20 percent at a time, but that translates into 1-2 extra damage on your attack, which won't make a difference to the vast majority of enemies. Whenther they had the buff or not it'll still take the same amout of attacks, same number of turns in combat, to kill anything. The result is that the game feels very hollow, where it looks on the surface like there's a lot of replay value but there actually isn't. Seeing as replay value is the ultimate goal for a 4x game, this is a serious shortcoming.Summary:If you just rewatched Game of Thrones and you REALLY want to play a Civ game that uses a fantasy setting and magic and whatnot, if you want to play dress-up with your units and if you really don't care if the game is actually any good, you might as well play Fallen Enchantress. But if what you're looking for is a 4x game with any level of depth, a game that will entertain you for more than a few hours and a game where your choices have a drastic impact on the flow of the game, go for Endless Legends.Oh, and Legends has multiplayer, for the people who care about that.

												Pros: Great PotentialEasy to ModNice Improvements over original Fallen EnchantressPretty visualsAllows for nearly likitless creativityCons: Extremely Buggy!!Versions 1.0-1.6 had game ending bugs if you leveled a character beyond available perk choicesVersion 1.8 is a game ending bug at start that prevents you from ever having more than one Fame point, effectively eliminating heroes from the entire gameDevs seem to have taken a nearly bugless game (Fallen Enchantress v1.32) and with only a few minor changes made it entirely unplayable for many of us.Devs remain entirely unresponsive to players who report these bugs, and seem to have no interest in fixing themHave been waiting for fixes for years now, sending report after report with god knows how much information, and all I've seen are some slight A.I improvements, a couple optimizations, and a bunch of expensive DLC's that could've been made by any of the more capable modders out there.Other thoughts:FE 1 was completely fixed as of 1.32, but LH is a train wreck after eight major overhauls, roughly 50 minor patches, and still the devs are focusing on increasingly derivative DLC's? No sale discount is enough to make this worth the money, even after a couple years of ""updates.""Fallen Enchantress was a great game. If Legendary Heroes looks fun to you, buy its predecessor instead; LH is just an endless pit for you to throw your money in.10/10 for potential-10/10 for bugs and greedy devs0/10 overall			"

												It's playable.If you still remember the disaster that was ""Elemental:War of Magic"" ... well, this isn't it.FE:LH is a reasonably competent 4x game with a lackluster story, uninspired lore, bland factions and a unique pastel colored art style. Standing on it's own, I can safely recommend it ... especially if you pay $1 for it as part of a Humble Bundle. :PWhen compared to other recent 4x fantasy games like Endless Legend, Age of Wonders III, or Warlock 2, then this game can hold it's own, but it doesn't really stand out.It's ok, and it's 100x times better than it's first iteration, but I'd prefer any of the above mentioned games to this. Heck, given a choice I'd prefer Civilization 4 with Fall From Heaven 2 to FELH.Also, considering that Stardock just released the sequel Sorceror King, there's really no reason to buy this unless it's part of a bundle.

												This is one of those games where the devs are on the right track but for whatever reason just didn't see it through to the end. The graphics are basic and the unit selection is extremely thin (though you can design your own) but otherwise the game is similar to Master of Magic with a few new elements like quests, city leveling, and hero ability trees.I think the game could have been a smash hit if Stardock had put the time into it but unfortunately it feels like a side project that accidentally got enough steam to get released. If you're looking for a fantasy 4x then unfortunately I can't recommend this as a first choice.			"

The degree of customization is nice but the combat is not up to par.  Graphically simple and not particularly charming when compared to Warlock, there's nothing that Fallen Enchantress does better or smarter than it's predecessors or competition.

												This game is a great combination of the playing style of Civilization games and turn-based combats. The chooseable factions are well balanced and the technology trees greatly developed. Even after 90+ hours am I still learning new things about how this game works and it's a strategy game well worth the money.Only ""not so good"" thing is the way diplomacy works. It seems like it's built that it's nearly impossible to be diplomatic, cause with increasing playing time during one round will the relationship to nearly all AI factions start falling down for no real reason - and as soon as you participate in one war are good relations to nearly all other factions gone for the rest of the game.But beside of the diplomacy is everything else working great together. The champions, quests and creeps, even the areas hold by creeps which are randomly choosen and split on the map are all fine. Great and addictive.			"

												I've been part of the Elemental odyssey since the early days of the paid beta for War of Magic.  As we all know by now, Elementa: War of Magic arrived in a pretty bad state and never recovered from its severe design deficiencies.  Stardock, being Stardock, refused to abandon their dream of a great new 4X fantasy game and released a stand-alone expansion, Fallen Enchantress, that tried to rectify what went wrong with the first game by cutting out lots of features of the original that just didn't work, and by enhancing what was left.  When all was said and done, while Fallen Enchantress was a marked improvement over EWoM, it still struck me as a mediocre game.When Legendary Heroes was added to my account (I was one of those who were 'comped' with two free expansions) , I was not in any rush to try it.  I mean, seeing how FE was still nothing that great, I figured LH was going to be just another incremental improvement on the base game.  I WAS WRONG!Legendary Heroes has completely amazed me with its gameplay (especially with the recent 1.4 patch).  Finally, we have an Elemental game that lives up to the hopes and dreams we all had when Elemental was first announced!  This is now a fantastic fantasy-based 4X experience with lots of faction/hero customization options that really adds a great RPG element, as well as a smart implementation of the core 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) gameplay dynamic.  The tactial battles, which were a bit bland before, are now fun and challenging endeavors (the tactical AI is very good!).  City building, which was also rather boring in the previous iterations of the series, has received a lot of love, amking it a quite enjoyable to watch your cities grow.  Questing has also received some nice attention, making for some interesting one-off battles.  Add in some ""game changing"" random events (something Stardock is known for), and you now have a very addictive, very polished experienced.Stardock has also just begun releasing DLC for the game.  While I have only purchased the Quest DLC so far - it seems to offer the most bang for the buck at the moment - I suspect we can expect a lot more that should really enhance the game even more.  Lastly, this being a proper PC game, there are some great mods already available.Long short: Legendary Heroes is a very good 4X fantasy game that is well worth your gaming dollar.  I don't think it is too much of a stretch to say that with some more DLC and/or an expansion, Legendary Heroes could well match the revered status of Stardock's sci-fi  magnum opus, Galactic Civilizations II.

The customizability, all the way down to what each of your units is geared with, is simply amazing.  The maps have so much variety to them, there are so many different enemies to encounter, no two games are the same.  Complete epic quests for amazing loot, raid enemy towns to strengthen your faction, even create your own faction leader, custom taylored to your style!  It also supposed mods, and there is a decent modding community behind it.  Several mods out there that add or change things so significantly, it's almost like playing another game!			"

												Ambitious game that was fairly fun and injured by unfulfilled promise. If you are really jonesing for a 4x fix, you might try it. It tries to be Master of Magic and does a fair job. Not as quite up to that bar, but mostly enjoyable. Otherwise, you probably want to give it a miss.Decent music; Remeniscent of Babylon 5. Graphics system is pretty nifty, but the assets are lackluster. Could have looked great, yet didn't.Gameplay had a bunch of neat ideas but felt unfinished. The characters level slowly (which is fine) but the benefits of a level accumulate slowly, as well. Not horrid, but not great. Cities have map-based assets, which was cool, but weird limits on how and where resources can be to use them.The biggest deficit was the engine's crazy slow loading for everything. Sometimes, that crashed it. Sometimes, you really did just need to wait a few minutes to see something. This became quite frustrating. I do not like waiting multiple minutes on a turn end and 15-20 seconds to get a response on a button press to open a menu. Felt like a memory leak somewhere was probably at fault, but certainly it slowed down by the end game. The game seems to assume you won't have more than ten or so cities, since the UI gets really cumbersome at that point.If the game was fast and responsive the whole time, the other deficits would probably be less detrimental to the effect.

												A true gem of a game.  Why is is great?  well it has a lot of things going for it, but there's one feature that really stands out: customizeable units.  Tired of generic knights in shining armor?  Put some ladies on giant wolves instead (Wargs are OP).  don't have enough iron to build more high tier units?  design a unit that uses the recources you do have.  It's the same kind of system stardoc used in the GalCiv games, but it works out much better here (mostly becasue your units come in stacks instead of individual ships).  I keep wishing other stratagy games would add in this sort of feature, because it turns an already solid game into a masterpeice.  The story is pretty underdevloped (not as bad as some other stardoc games, but it could be a lot better), but i barely even noticed.  Graphics are dated, but if that doesn't turn you off, you will love this game.			"

												This 4x (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) fantasy strategy game does many things right, but also has some bugs/issues.+ Highly customizable heroes and standart units. From their looks, to their weapons, armor and equipment. You can even change the background of their picture to your liking. This way even the most regular game units can look unique.+ Nice and interesting selection of units, each with their own traits and skills. From weak wolves to the almighty dragons, every one is made with passion for detail.+ Intelligent bulding queue. When you had your town producing currency for example and you decide to add an actual unit or building to the queue, the town will properly priorize the later and put it in front of the infinite currency production.+ Instead of just having you fight enemies for rewards the game uses well-written sidequests. In some of them you even get to make a desicion - which affects the outcome.- Unlike the sidequests, the main story mode barely has any story worth mentioning. One map, some general directions about where to go next every 20 hours or so and a few lines once you reach the goal. The end.- Loading times are surprisingly long, compared to most other games. Usually if you load or reload a game after a bad decision, you are back in a couple of seconds. Here it takes up to one minute.- Loading causes your units to continue on their planned way even if you hadn't hit the move button when you saved. Saving after you have selected to go to an enemy in the distance will have them run all the way to the enemy by themselves when you load, engaging him in a fight. Even if you found out that it was a poor decision. I mean, you can still cancel the fight. But you will have to walk back again, which leaves you exposed to the enemy.-  The game uses ""influence zones"" that show the area you and your allies/enemies control. Most of the time, that is. Sometimes it won't show the zones at all.Compared to similar other games like my favourite ""Age of Wonders"", Fallen Enchantress: Legendary heroes features less main story and less strategy options (no cover system from ranged attack units/spells, no option to engage an enemy army with multiple armies from different sides) while offering a better selection of side quests. I know that the later Age of Wonders games included repeatable ""missions"", but they didn't have much of a story.Fallen Enchantress equals even some full-fledged roleplaying games in that aspect. Collect spider webs, find lost stuff, save villages, hand-feed out of control monsters to tame them... just to name some of them.			"

												Verdict: This is the 4x game I always wanted. A grand turn-based strategy game, comparable to Civilization IV but in a gorgeous high-fantasy setting with tactical battles and RPG elements. Most significantly for me, it is fully customisable: design your own faction, leader and units to suit your personal playstyle and role-play. Longer games have stability issues, but I fixed mine by turning off anti-aliasing. 8/10Story: It may be misleading to speak of story in a game like this, and I have not yet played the campaign scenario. The premise of the world, elaborated here from previous Elemental games, is interesting enough. And the customisation allows you to create your own story as you please. 6/10Gameplay:  Despite some AI and balance issues, the gameplay is solid and very engaging. It’s not long before that classic Civilization “one more turn” syndrome sets in and takes over, and single games can easily steal away 20-30 hours. Though the fashion in 4x strategy is towards hexagons, square-based maps do the job here, and it is fun to explore rich landscapes dense with monsters, treasure and quests to fulfill. City and resource management are interesting, and it’s satisfying to see your metropolises grow and your empire expand. Research is broken into three tech trees (Civic, Warfare, Magic) you advance separately, making it a strategic choice of where your focus will be. Tactical battles are fun, if a bit on the simple side; tactics emerge solely from your unit design and the composition of your armies, without regard for other factors such as terrain. Auto-resolve can be a bit wonky, and can sometimes beat otherwise unwinnable battles, but it is not game-breaking. The UI is a masterpiece and provides all the information you need to manage your empire. Detailed faction and unit customisation are what tie all these factors together and make Fallen Enchantress a superior experience to similar 4x games.  9/10Graphics: The graphics will appear a bit dated to some, but the art style fits the unique setting nicely resulting in a somewhat cartoony, but still beautiful, dark and broken world. 7/10Sound/Music: The sound is not exceptional (ambiance is decent), but the music is great with some truly epic themes to conquer to.  7/10			"

												There was a previous incarnation or two of this game and this one plays in a similiar vein to the previous versions.  Set up a ""colonly"", build a few buildings and expland your territory.  There is a party adventure mode as well that lets you explore your world, upgrade your adventurers, and collect items to equip them with.  The campaign could use some work though... a bit more depth, cut scenese, voice overs, ect.  But really I bought this game for the map editor and sandbox mode.  After awhile (40 hours) it does tend to get repetative.  That said I was intrigued enough to play each sandbox custome game to see each individual ending related to that vicotry condition.  If there was a way to infuse ""more story"" into the game it'd be a real gem.  The only knock against this game is if you play the ""huge"" map setting.  I have an advanced gaming rig that starts to chug and eventually crash if the world is overly populated with cites.An 8 out of 10.  If the developers would add cutscences and some RPG elements it could easily climb to a 10 out 10.  The expansion packs seem focused towards ""new loot"" and different AI characters to play against.  They don't really add very much to the gaming experiance so only buy them if you have a couple extra bucks collecting dust.			"

												I feel FE:LH is extremely underrated and Stardock did one hell of a job here balancing and polishing FE, worth noting that it was done with the help of none other than Civ 4's lead designer.This is technically an expansion but it should really be treated as a standalone game. Replayability in this is amazing, customization options are infinite (that includes shaping the world to your liking, creating armor for your armies and pimping out your sovereign), fun combat and just tons of other cool♥♥♥♥♥♥I cannot bother listing here. Depth isn't something FE is lacking, either. Diplomacy sucks donkey balls however, but at least it ain't Warlock: MotA... *shudder*TL;DR: Very fun 4x strategy game, that is similar to MoM/AoW in terms of gameplay, with Civilization-esque building and RPG aspects like in HoMM. Don't buy the original FE, buy this instead. Also DLC's are a great addition, specifically the quest pack. Rest is OK if you're into smacking goblins with giant lollipops. "

												What a great game!It's like a mix of RPG, turnbased strategy and medieval fantasy.It is a civ5 look a like, but I think this one is better because of the RPG element in it.The variety makes it more fun for me.Also, you can create your own character and faction.This game has something not many games have.. It makes you forget the time completely.""Are you sure you want to exit? A few more turns couldn't hurt...""			"

												This game is super ugly. Like, irredeemably ugly. Nonetheless it is really really quite good.The empire management isn't the deepest in the world, but it's alright. I like the tech tree. Much better than other fantasy 4X in that department.The tactical combat is serviceable but never exciting. Partly because of how incredibly ugly the game is.Replay value is decently high as long as you force yourself to try new strategies each time.Overall I'd recommend it, but seriously it is butt-ugly. If graphics matter to you at all, maybe watch a video of this because it might break the experience for you.			"

												This is my favourite 4X game right now. Has so many awesome features. Design your own leader/sovereign, customise your cities even more then most 4X games. Pick abilities for champions, design your own units. Quests, monster lairs, loot. There are a few bugs that I have encountered while playing the game e.g. reloading a save game will hide territory borders with no way to get them back other then restarting the entire game afaik. Even with the bugs, the game is just too fun to me for it to be that much of a bother. Definitely recommended for any lover of 4X games. You will not be disappointed. It is worth your money.			"

												Fallen Enchantress is not a bad game, is actually quite competent, its just doesn't do anything exceptionaly well or in new, orginal way - if you are fan of genre and can get it cheap go for it, otherwise there are better games.On side note - units, creatures, buildings, map features, etc. look soo boring in this game -_-' I don't mind low graphic quality but for gods sake - find some better concept artists and create more interesting looking world next time.

Game is a lot of fun. 40 is harsh because it isnt nearly as replayable as civ IV or V. If you catch it on sale its a great buy.

												First, the tutorial videos is utterly useless (to build, click the build button, then the building wanted). What do all those numbers, statuts, data, do ? Just a tiny description. Nothing is told about long-term strategy... in a strategy game.What about the lore ? Since it's fantasy, it's must be important, right ? Not here. The story is so cliche, the factions are so cliches and nothing is really polished. Everything you find/read about lore will make you say ""meh, classic"". I'm not about what's typical, but it's not even linked in a good way. Just a bunch of random typical stuff. And nothing is really used in the game anyway. You can totally skip it and you will miss nothing of the game (for those who may ask, I consider lore in assassin's creed, total war or dark souls important, so you have my point of view).And here comes my main complain : this game has no identity at all. I felt like playing a mod where the creator just replaced everything with fantasy elements. If it were a mod, it would be good enough. But it's not a mod. There is a hole team behind it. If it were a film, it would be one of those stupid fantasy films pre-LotR made by people who understand nothing about fantasy, but did it anyway because ""it's fantasy. Kinds like it, we will attract them and make money"".			"

												I wouldn´t recommend the game after playing 36 hours with winning one reign and quitting the scenario due to boredom. Personally I don´t like the game, because I´m more a fan of tactical round based combat and the battles are not really tactical in my opinion: You can win all the battles with the same pattern, that´s just not versatile enough for me. If you like developing cities and your kingdom more than battles, I would suggest you go for it, if you prefer tactical battles then don´t. This was definately my last 4x game, since I highly prefer tactical combat over administration/research, which just bothers me.Countless crashes are not included in my review, since I don´t know if these crashes were caused by my machine or by a buggy game.

												Fun up to a point. I really like that the soldiers in your army and the heroes that join you are all customisable, including changing their name if you want to. Having chess pieces on the strategic map that resemble the hero leading that army is a nice touch too. Ultimately, the research and city building aspect of the game lets it down though. Also, the graphics for the turn-based combat were so dated I felt like I was playing Death Knights of Krynn or something! Fun concept, but Age of Wonders III does almost the same thing and looks like it belongs in the 21st century. If only they could merge the best aspects of each game?!?!			"

Posted: January 4, 2015
												As much as I love the game concepts in FE:LH, I simply cannot recommend it because the way the developers implemented these concepts is (to me, anyway) very shallow and frustrating. It does offer a little fun, but barely enough for even the sale price of $9.99 to feel worth it (and certainly not for full price). I'll elaborate in greater detail below. This review is based upon my time playing the game during this free-to-play weekend, though I previously played over 100 hours (not on steam) in Elemental and also tried out the free copy of the first FE Stardock gave me (but it didn't keep my interest very long at all). Here is a list of my main frustrations:-For a game called ""Legendary Heroes"", you barely get any heroes to play with;-Even worse, the leveling system for the heroes you do get doesn't do them any justice;-Creation of custom Sovereigns and Races sounds cool, but the choices are very few and really offer little strategic/tactical impact;-This is also true for creating custom troops - equipment choices in particular are painfully limited and mostly irrelevant;-Consequently, tactical battles lack any real depth - not to mention the many other issues with them (no troop placement phase, inconsistent battle map sizes, etc);-Overall, these frustrations result in a negative gameplay experience for me, to the point where even the interesting environments, quests to complete, and wild monsters to fight just cannot keep me invested in playing. I love the concepts so very much, but their implementation kills the potential fun. Read on for a more detailed look at these issues:Not Enough HeroesYou can only recruit a new hero when you reach certain levels of ""fame"", which you get from completing quests from random locations spawned on the map. Each new level requires even more fame, such that in my 12 hours of free playing I had only gotten a mere 2 heroes. This is simply unacceptable for a game called ""Legendary Heroes"" and it seriously undermines the RPG aspect of play. Furthermore, when you unlock a new hero you are only offered a choice between 2 candidates. The first time, both were at level 1, which meant I got to choose my first hero's class when she reached level 2 (I went with Defender, as my Sovereign was a Warlock); but when I finally unlocked my second choice of heroes, both candidates were past level 2, meaning that I was stuck with the classes already assigned to them (either another Defender or another Warlock...while I wanted to pick another class I didn't have yet). This was extremely frustrating and not at all fun. Hero Leveling is a DisappointmentEvery time a hero gains a level, they get 1 point to spend on a new perk (including passive buffs and active abilities). All heroes have a few General perks available, while the majority are based on their class (Defender, Assassin, etc). The first problem is that 1 skill point per level is not enough to give you a decent selection. Want them to unlock the next 3 spells in the type of magic they know? There goes your point. Want them to learn first aid? Their goes your point. And levels require a lot of fighting to get. Limited skill points wouldn't be so bad if the perks actually made a big difference, but most of them don't. For my Defender, some perks added only +5 HP (or the like), while a few offered new combat moves. Sadly, the layout of the skill tree meant I needed to pick many lame perks before reaching the ones that actually sounded useful, so in my 12 hours of play I never unlocked any cool ones for my heroes. I realize the devs may not want heroes to be overpowered (although there are so few of them in numbers that I feel they almost *should* be a bit OP), but you can do that by giving a level progression to the cool abilities so they start off weak and can be improved with further perks, not by making it very slow and frustrating to even unlock the abilities at all. Anyway, the leveling system is very frustrating and kills the fun for me. Custom Sovereign/Faction/Unit Creation is ShallowCustomization is one of my favorite aspects in a game, in both the practical and aesthetic senses (custom ship design from Gal Civ II is a great example). This game appears to offer these features, but once you dig in they are really very shallow. While there are nuances between the 3 types of custom creation, all three share the same flaws: too few deign points, too few design options (in particular for ""weaknesses"" that let you take a hit in one area to gain more design points to enhance another area), and the options they do have ultimately don't create a different feeling or play-style. This undermines not only the RPG aspect of the game, but also replayability (since no faction can really get that substantively different from another). I could go much more deeply into the details and nuances of/between types of customization, but in the end I still find each kind limiting and strategically/tactically unfulfilling. It's very disappointing and undercuts my motivation for playing the game. Poor Tactical BattlesEven by the most simple standards for a tactical battle system, the game comes up short. There are few weapons to choose from for your units (on top of their already shallow customization), and the attempt to make each class of weapon have more uniqueness fails. Giving some armor penetration to spears and a knockdown chance to hammers doesn't cut it. It makes designing units really boring, and tactical combat boring and repetitive as well. Ultimately, it just comes down to attack and defense values to decide the outcome, plus just not being stupid by letting the enemy gang up on your units (while you try to gang up on theirs). Also, having a maximum army size of just 9 units really limits not only the tactical possibilities (for example, I don't have enough units to, say, shield my custom Race's unmatched archers behind a line of heavy pikemen, nor does the customization system let me even make the Race of unmatched archers...), but also the sense of epic scale - you only ever fight skirmish-sized battles or send your small party against one super monster and its several minions. Anyway, the battles lose their appeal very quickly. ConclusionThe above frustrations are what ruin my playing experience for FE:LH; hence, I cannot recommend it. There are even other issues I didn't touch on (like the tech tree structure, etc) that I could maybe forgive on their own, but for a game called Legendary Heroes these key flaws regarding heroes/customization/battles are simply too much. Even though I will somewhat miss the match I sank 12 hours into during this free-to-play weekend, it's not even worth $9.99 to me to get the game and continue playing what I started. Sadly, I know that continuing it would entail more frustration with the game design than fun.If you care more about other aspects of the game, maybe you will still like it; but since many people (like me) might want to buy this because of the elements that are lacking (the promise of customization, RPG aspcets, battles), I want to call out those elements as I see them.

												At first glance, this looks like a pretty nifty cross of Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic. And the idea really has potential, especially with the option to customize one's starting hero/civilization for a freeform game a lot like in Galactic Civilizations.Unfortunately, a great idea alone does not a great game make. In fact, I can't help but feel the idea is exactly what turns this game into a bit of a mess, because rolling CIV and HoMM into one simply does not work. I mean, the early game in CIV is all super-slow city development and tech research, whereas HoMM is all about having your heroes go out and do stuff from day one. That's a pretty huge gap in concept and Fallen Enchantress completely fails to bridge it. City development and tech start at a CIV-like glacial pace, but you're left feeling you're supposed to do stuff with your hero like in HoMM (being basically told so if you play a campaign).Admittedly, it almost works. Usually, the first couple of easy fights and mini quests give you a sense of progress. And then, things go downhill in a hurry because you run into your first fight highlighting how poorly balanced combat in this game is. I kid you not, based solely on the random placement of units on the map and luck with initiative, I have been completely wiped out and won without a scratch in the very same fight. Strategy and tactics my♥♥♥♥♥I'm really disappointed because I love the idea, but I'll go back to CIV and HoMM. Even the worst installments of those franchises never managed to drain my enthusiasm the way this game did, mostly because no CIV was this unbalanced (that's saying something!) and no HoMM featured fights this impossible early in campaigns unless impossible difficulty was exactly what it said on the tin.

												I love this game! It still has a bug every now and then but nothing that hurts the experience for me. My favorite part about it is being able to create your own factions and heroes (backstories and all) and play them. There is definitely a bit of a learning curve, but it's a fun learning curve. I've put quite a few hours in and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of how many different strategic options there are. One of the major aspects that I love about this game is that it's not just a numbers game. Some games like this, for example Might and Magic VI, have a lot of strategic depth, but in the end it just becomes a numbers game as to who has the bigger army. This game does a really good job of balancing that out by limiting the size of each army, so you have to be more picky about what types of units make up your army, sort of like a mix between XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Might and Magic VI.

Only bad thing is the tactical battles are done on square tiles unlike hex tiles like most of titles. Still though it wast tooo hard on normal and it was balanced. Not too easy, not too hard.

												Fallen Enchantress is a great game for awhile. ProsGreat AI (very challenging.)Limitless creative abillities.Fun game overallReplayabillityWorth $$ for $$You can play as a created faction and then create MORE FACTIONS that you just played as to fight you with your own created units.It is possible to have more players in game but eventually it starts to lag..Again the AI.ConsAmount of enemies to fight there's like 200, and that's it. I wish there were more.(there are a lot and you can fight in game.) Randomly generated units tend to space out and only fight the player. Once you figure out the game it becomes really boring.Campaign is the weak point.			"

												A nice Civilization alternative in fantasy style. You choose a faction, each with its perks, and re-colonize your world by funding cities.- The number of buildings and units you can choose from is quite limited- the improvements you can build outside of cities are limited to resources- you do research technologies, but their impact on the game is not that impressive; you never have the feeling of the time passing and your people evolving.+ heroes with abilities and inventories lead your armies+ missions+ magicAll in all, it is fun and worth giving a try, even if it is not a masterpiece.

												Have you ever played any CiV game and thought something was missing? Or that the combat was boring? then you might give fallen enchantress a try where it lacks in historical contents it makes up for it in Customization in a high fantasy theme. The battles are turn based HoMM style, so you get to see those high priced unit in all their splendor. Also there are a couple of mods that do enrich the content in terms of units and playable Kingdoms/empires. CONS: NO multyplayer (personally not a fan of it anyway in this type of games) Graphics are hit and miss but again it makes easy for the modders to add a TON of content.Fullscreen is not fullscreen (its a borderless window regardless of setting).

												Fallen Enchantress is sort of a mixture of Disciples and Civilizations. You have the strategic combat and exploration of Disciples with the city, unit, and technology management of the Civilization series. Units and heroes gain experience and strength, and heroes have an inventory for equipment and mounts. You can also design your own units as you learn the various technologies.So far, my only complaint is that there are not more technologies to learn. It seems that I advance too quickly through the technology tree, but maybe I'm just being picky since I have played for over 10 hours and not researched every technology.All in all, it's a great game!

												So far the best fantasy 4x game I played  recently. I enjoyed the orginal and months playing with the expansion pack I dont think I played a fantasy 4x that can top it. I tried the new Eador  couldnt get into it. It felt stale.  Warlock 1 with all its expansion packs. Looked pretty but the economy was too simplistic for me. Age of Wonders 3 had flashy graphics and a cool turn based combat system but again the economy and city buidling was too simplistic. When it comes to Fallen Enchantress with Legendary Heroes it had the depthness I craved. I love the research tree, the magic system, the scarcity of resources, city management, and my favorite the turn based battles. The game is not pretty thats why I tried the flashier graphic games but I always came back to FE:LH. The mods you can download makes the game play even more vast. I enjoy the side quests, leveling your heroes, attracting heroes, and of course the variety of tactics with magic your heroes can issue forth. I love to upgrade my heroes with armor and mounts. The main game I almost bought that I wanted to try was Endlesss Legend. I was disapointed with Endlesss Space so it kind of burn me out from tryin Endlesss legends. Also I heard there was no tactical combat which is must for me in a fantasy 4x game. Makes it hard for me to go back to civ 5. I tried the classic turn based games like Heroes of Might and Magic 3 and Masters of Magic. The interfaces are probably too old for me now to fully appreciate its significants. From what I can tell this game is very comparable to what people loved about those games back then. I am not turn off by graphics cause my favorite games recently are Baldur's gate series, Alpha Centari, MOO2, and the orginal Fallout's but interface in older games can take awhile for me to get use too. Regardless I love this game and recommend it. I know some people hate it for variety of reasons but to me despite the graphics and generic story it is the Standard for Fantasy 4x right now. Hopefully they make a new one with better graphics, and a better story so the developers can get the respect they deserve.			"

												It's like Heroes of Might and Magic and Sid Meiers Civ series had a baby. I see some criticism in the reviews but frankly I find them unfounded.Unlike the Civ series, there is always something to do if you feel like it. The game encompasses exploring, RPG, strategy, empire building, tactical combat kin to the Age of Wonders game and much more.One of my favourite parts of the game is that you can design your own hero and in time design your own troop units. As always, as it is with any game, it takes some time to get a feel for how everything works, and usually when I've learned what I need I don't find the game so intruiging anymore. But this game has me going on and on. Do I recommend it? Oh Yeah!If you kinda liked Age of Wonders, Heroes of Might and Magic and Sid Meiers Civ, this game is for you.			"

												I haven't played the previous entries in this series so I went in with not many preconceived ideas about what to expect.I know there were some issues with the earlier games, but Legendary Heroes is a very solid 4x title.There is a lot of diversity in the game in terms of unit design choices, heroes and city developement.Each playable faction is unique, and even though the differences seem subtle at first, this uniqueness becomes more apparent as the game progresses. There is a LOT to learn.Like most 4x games, it is a bit overwhelming at first, but it quickly grows on you and you settle in to get your empire up and running.There is a lot of challenge to be found in both the early and later game stages. Monsters roam the land and they range very widely in power between pushovers and godlike. Especially so for your weak early armies and champions. Knowing when to leave a challnge or quest for later is critical in keeping your troops and heroes safe.The AI is also actually decently competent. I lost one of my cities easily early on and got routed in my bid to take over an enemy city a few times.The strategic battles are one of my favorite parts of the game. You can easily lose a battle even with an overwhelming force if you make bad choices. It is a much better system than the static system of games like Civ 5 and Warlock: Master of the Arcane. You actually fight battles on a tactical map where positioning and ability use are important.My only real gripe is that diplomacy is a lot less developed than some other 4x games. Hopefully the developers will improve on that in future updates.A solid and fun game overall if you are a fan of 4x games.			"

I randomize the maps and not once have I seen the entire thing.

On the plus side, combat is straightforward and EVERY unit is fully customizable.  want your archers to wear heavier armor?  modify em.  just takes a little longer for them to be produced.

												It's a cross between Civilization and a fantasy tactics game (e.g. Final Fantasy Tactics).  It's got all the makings of a classic tactics game.  You'll level up your main hero (or sovereign) and your individual champions, research new spells, complete quests, find new equipment with special abilities, etc.  All the while, you'll be expanding your empire/kingdom a la Civilization style.  If that sounds awesome, that's cause it is!On top of all of that, it has an extensive map/faction editor, and it even lets you design your own ""sovereign"", which is surprisingly detailed for a game like this.I've actually been sitting on this game since May of 2013, and I can't believe it's taken me this long to play the damn thing.  I'd strongly encourage everyone out there to give this a whirl.  I know the price tag is a bit daunting considering you've probably never heard of the game, but trust me when I say it's worth it.  If not now, wait until one of the holiday sales.  In any event, if you're a fan of Civ games, and fantasy games do yourself a favor and get into this.			"

												If you are a fan of Civiisation V, or any of the series fo CIV, then you will love this game.Take the city screen in Civ... in this game, you see the city straight out.Combat in Civ is quick combat... in this game, you play turn based on a grid... but have the option to do Quick Combat.Both Games have tech trees that are great.However this game shines with what you can do.  Firstly you start out with a hero.  This hero can choose from one of five tech trees, and each tech tree has around 3 paths, with only 1 you will be able to max out, so lots of deferent playthroughs  in the combat if you change your hero.In Civ you can get bored when you are building stuff, but in this world it has NPS, monsters that roam, quests, loot to find, epic monsters.  So you take your hero out to level up.So if I take my hero and 2 mages.  We all get xp if we survive a battle.  The mage can level up and also I can custom creat units which is epic.  With this you can make mages wear plate armour if you fancy it.  It really is epic.The more you do in the world your fame will increase and you'll get other hereos to help you.All in all... A BLAST... I played 24 hours straight, playing as the Necomancer Mage in a Large classic map.  Also dipped into the scenerio which is a story line verson of the game, teachign you about the npc and monsters you will find in classic mode.I'll give this 100% as it is such an iteration of CIV in a fantasy world.  If CIV VI takes this approach it would be great, but otherwise this game has it cooking and it tastes great.  Have FUN!			"

You can easily lose a battle even with an overwhelming force if you make bad choices. It is a much better system than the static system of games like Civ 5 and Warlock: Master of the Arcane. You actually fight battles on a tactical map where positioning and ability use are important.My only real gripe is that diplomacy is a lot less developed than some other 4x games. Hopefully the developers will improve on that in future updates.A solid and fun game overall if you are a fan of 4x games.			"

												Great game with huge replayability factor - it's one of those games that I keep returning to regularly for a session. Fun to play, pretty addictive and immersive - pity it isn't more popular, it should be.It's like a souped-up Heroes of Might and Magic - anyone who enjoyed that will LOVE Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes! 10/10 if you enjoy the genre.

												Legendary Heroes went a long toward addressing and fixing a lot of the problems and issues with their immediate predecessor. The heroes are more balanced in the early game compared to normal units, the gameplay is a lot smoother, and the balance has made the game much more addictive.			"

												Addicting, BEWARE! I didn't like the previous Elemental games, they were alpha to designing this game I belive. Stardock broke away from the space gener and into the gothic fantasy realm, I hope they can continue with designing great games like this for years to come!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Since this first review and many hours of playing, I have dicided that I can not recomend this game.It is buggy as hell! It wasn't that bad prior to the updates, just a bug here and there, but now it is not possible to even complete a game with out it crashing or just doing weird things. One example that really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off was that while I was being attacked in a city full of Elite units by a full army of the attacker, some of my units would not participate and were not present for the battle, maybe as many as half! And after, they were recorded as defeted, GONE...all my Elite units that were over the battle field unit limit! the cities I guess were not designed big enough to support large battles, so the game just kills them off at start of battle. This is a HUGH bug.Actually the game was fine till the last Heros expansion. It ruined this playable broke game.I had high expectations for this game after pre ordering Elemental, and finding out it wasn't even close to being complete. This game is not complete either it seems.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IN ITS PRESENT STATE (with the expansions anyway).I will not purchas another Stardock game...EVER.			"

												It's like Heroes of Might and Magic and Sid Meiers Civ series had a baby. I see some criticism in the reviews but frankly I find them unfounded.Unlike the Civ series, there is always something to do if you feel like it. The game encompasses exploring, RPG, strategy, empire building, tactical combat kin to the Age of Wonders game and much more.One of my favourite parts of the game is that you can design your own hero and in time design your own troop units. As always, as it is with any game, it takes some time to get a feel for how everything works, and usually when I've learned what I need I don't find the game so intruiging anymore. But this game has me going on and on. Do I recommend it? Oh Yeah!If you kinda liked Age of Wonders, Heroes of Might and Magic and Sid Meiers Civ, this game is for you.			"

												Have you ever played any CiV game and thought something was missing? Or that the combat was boring? then you might give fallen enchantress a try where it lacks in historical contents it makes up for it in Customization in a high fantasy theme. The battles are turn based HoMM style, so you get to see those high priced unit in all their splendor. Also there are a couple of mods that do enrich the content in terms of units and playable Kingdoms/empires. CONS: NO multyplayer (personally not a fan of it anyway in this type of games) Graphics are hit and miss but again it makes easy for the modders to add a TON of content.Fullscreen is not fullscreen (its a borderless window regardless of setting).

												A very fine strategy game. At first it seems somewhat complex, but after you get the hang of it, it gets pretty much simple. Basically your goal is very similar like space 4X games. and you have races each with their own strengths and weakneses. Only bad thing is the tactical battles are done on square tiles unlike hex tiles like most of titles. Still though it wast tooo hard on normal and it was balanced. Not too easy, not too hard. A very enjoyable game and worth playing. (especially if its one of those zillion hour lose sleep type games...lol!)			"

												This game is good, but nothing besides that. The history is fine, the game mechanics too, and it seens to give a lot of options for you to build your units, but it is confusing sometimes and lacks immersion. Besides, it is buggy sometimes and the gameplay is not smooth enough. They could have made a more complete tutorial and included more scenarios. But there is some intersting mods you can find, so it may worth a try. I would say: if you like games of this genre, it may worth a buy if it is on sale.			"

												Do you like the Civilization game series? How about Heroes of Might and Magic?  Think of this game as their 'not the sharpest knife in the drawer' child.  Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes tries to be a game of both City-Building and Turn-Based-Combat. Unfortunately it does both of these in wonderful mediocrity.  Neither aspect of the game is fleshed out fully and this leaves you somewhat unsatisfied in both arenas. That being said, the game is not without merit. While it's not as deep as other games, it's a decent way to scratch your TBS itch. The character models are decent and the inclusion of a fantasy setting makes the city-building interesting when starting out. The game isn't worth the asking price of $40, but if you see it on sale for $10 or less, it's probably worth your time if you're a fan of Civilization and TBS games.			"

Character Bonanaza adds a lot of new characters too.			"

												By far, the closest I have ever found to a remake of Masters of Magic (MOM).  It is kind of like Civ 3 or 4, but with heros, items, and turn-based tactical combat instead of a automatic random number generator.  The AI is pretty good for the start of middle of a game, but once you cross a certain power threshold (usually 2x to 3x as powerful as them) you can win just by declaring war and then asking for their surrender.  The only down side, is that when they surrender, you get their main guy as a hero, but the rest of the citys and outposts get destroyed.Overall, great game, but Eador might be a better verson of MOM, but this is the 100% spiritual reincarnation.

												The adventuring against monsters, bandits and other NPCs early in this game is a lot of fun, and the character classes and skills are interesting - especially when you add in those you can get in mods.Unfortunately the AI of the AI controlled kingdoms is pretty poor and the AI kingdoms' units mostly look and act pretty much the same as one another, which makes the later part of any game a bit dull.Add to this the lack of any multiplayer andwhat could have been a great game is just an ok one which usually tails off into being dull late in the game.Best mods i've tried are Demons and Wizards - which actually improves the AI a fair bit - and Legacy of Magic, which adds large amounts of technology to research, tonnes of items and NPCs, though the AI is still mostly poor in it. Character Bonanaza adds a lot of new characters too.			"

												The tutorial can now be played without forcing you to restart the program. This is about the only thing Legendary Heroes does better than the original Fallen Enchantress. The issue of the game not properly closing persists, the AI is if anything even more cheaty (thirty turns in I and most of the AI factions are in scores around the 10s and 20s except for one faction that had a score of 570, and one faction has the ability to instantly capture one city per turn without a fight with no way to avoid it). Given the age of the game and the fact that Stardock has moved on to Sorcerer King I doubt these issues will ever be resolved.Don't waste your money. Get Age of Wonders 3 or Endless Legend instead.

												Love this game. Build your own Soveriegn, choose a race, choose the  strengths and weaknesses of your Kingdom/Empire and then take on a world overun by monsters and other factions after a cataclysm. You can use the default unit designs they provide or make your own, name them what you want and rename them on the battlefield. ""Atlar Heavy Infantry to Jamie's Besiegers"" for example. This game can by as immersive as you want. The aim of this 4x game is to successfully manage your faction towards one of 5 victory conditions whilst fending off the awakened monsters of the world and other soveriegns. If you have played the civilation series you will feel right at home here. Diplomacy suffers alot compared to Civ but this game makes up for it in other ways. Customisable heroes and turn-based battles are examples.Would have liked to see more customisation options to really go to town with your factions own unique identity and it would have been nice to see some more 'Master Quests'			"

												Everything feels slow and awkward to control in this game. Moving your mouse around and clicking on things feels clunky and irritating. For example, it takes a second and a half of hovering your mouse on a tile for it to show you the move range of the group you're moving. The ui is small and generally poorly designed.			"

												First of all this game is awesome, can be played with and without mods, but preferable is with them. This game could achieve many things and could be said a next best game after the HoMM 3, as I like to create Hero which can be an outstanding character. This game allows this, and give many ways of achieving victory and playing is almost endless not like in HoMM 3 (Still game is perfect for playing with friends and campaign also nice :) ) where after wining game is over and here you can still go. For me this game is connecting HoMM 3 and Civilizations which give a birth to a good child but weak. Why is that? First of all it have a very good foundation to be the best but still need much more time to be ""trained"" and shows the results of being completed. What it needs to be done to be remembered and still be playable like HoMM? -Perfomance ! (This game on big maps takes time, not saying about time how long is to achieve the victory, but the time between turns! After 100-150 turns time to wait is about 1-2 min to get my turn. My computer isn't high-tech and is tweaked so much to hold this game on proper efficiency (Also everything changed for lowest settings to get the best results) as for me this game doesn't need much of graphics, I like this game because of mechanics and creativity. Graphics are only a nice addition. -Multiplayer like in HoMM3 or Worms then this game will rock much more, trying to take your friends towns or figthing againts friends forces on battleground, that would awesome.If you have a good computer then this game is one of the best, it's worth its money and even if this is still singleplayer you can have a nice package of fun for many months. That's All,Malach Out!			"

												An epic Civilization type game which has what I consider an unparalleled customization system for a Strategy game. You can choose the specific gear you want your units to wear, what you want them to look like, their traits, heck you can make your own unit from scratch. I love the whole injury aspect of it as well (When your ""Champions"" die in combat they just suffer a permanent injury unless you heal them with an item, I've yet to find many of the items though) I killed an enemy champion a bunch of times and I got bored so I wanted to see the damage I'd done to him, I'd basically scarred him for life mentally and physically, yet he was still fighting (I found this kind of hilarious xD.)10/10 Would scar again.

												Lots of cool options and custimization for both hero units and regular units. Factions have slightly different play styles, though it's nothing drastic. You can even create your own factions along with a main character for it.It has a bit of a learning curve, but not too steep. The action tends to slow down after you defeat all the lower level creatures in the area, and have to start venturing towards other players. Diplomacy was simple for me: I liked having clear answers and numerical values during trades instead of having to guess whether your diplomat is skilled enough to overcome the hatred between your nations, as seen in other 4X titles.If you like 4X games as well as RPGs, I strongly recommend this game. Doesn't seem to have a strong story line, but if you can invest in giving your own characters a voice, there's plenty to commit to.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. It's similar to games like Civilization or Warlocks: Master of the Arcane but the details are all heavily changed to create a very unique entry into the genre. Given how much there are to games like this, I'll just highlight things that stood out to me that I liked and didn't like.What I liked:+Each leader/faction felt significantly different from the other factions -- There's a lot of different units, spells and bonuses that each faction gets to make you get a different experience playing with each one. +The game's combat is really fun -- You can play in a top down view isometric grid type combat or auto-calc. The auto-calc is weird, so sometimes you suffer some bad losses and sometimes you win a battle you could have never won, however I found this feature to be more in my favor than ever against me and I normally only did it in situations where I would obviously win to save time. Additionally you can create very large armies with very powerful units so that a combat victory is much more feasible than in a game like Civilization.+The random stuff on the map is quite fun -- The game has a quest system which, while basic, is actually pretty fun in short bursts. Additionally there is the option to have a ton of monsters and animals to keep yourself busy with them. On top of all that there is a dedicated area on each map where a ludicrously over-powered monster reigns who you can fight for some sweet items.+The hero system is pretty fun -- At first heros seem awesome. Heroes can use spells, equip gear, have special properties that buff your army or a city they occupy. In combat they aren't useful later in game because their stats just don't scale well, but their spells/city/group buffs can be worth it. Each hero is very different so it's something to explore.+The city system is really good and has great progression -- Each city levels up and as they level you can choose a specialization for them, offering bonuses to that particular city. This is really cool and offers you a new level of customization. I found myself regularly creating 1 resource heavy city and then making several combat cities to amass a horde of overpowered soldiers.What I didn't like:-The game isn't technically perfect -- Sometimes you try to click something on the map and the game has it's own mind. Sometimes walking to a particular place is a real pain. These were fairly minimal interruptions, but over the course of 50 hours it was enough to make me complain about it. Also as mentioned earlier the auto-calcuation battles can be wonky. Sometimes I would start a fight manually, then once I realized I couldn't win, I'd auto-calc to end my suffering. However, I'd end up winning a fair amount of those battles somehow. It didn't bother me because it was a nice surprise, but it may be a break in realism for others.-There is a steep learning curve -- The game has a lot of stuff to it, much like civ. The difference is that in this game the combat is more present, so you do need to be more up to snuff. I found myself being demolished in about 3 (...practice) games before I could finally conquer others, even on easier settings. The monsters can be a real threat, which is nice later on, but at the start it can be overwhelming.If you like any sort of strategy, please try this game. I was sad I was so hesistant in buying it (I didn't buy it until it hit $10, easily worth $40). Please note this review is based on the game without any of the DLC.			"

												This game is obscure, even for a 4X. We all know our Civilizations or Dominions or Alpha Centauris, but I barely know anyone who's heard of this, let alone played it. That being said, this game could be described a rough diamond. The game has some glaring balance issues, and it's a good bit glitchy at times, but the gameplay is solid and rewarding.Every game begins like any Civilization game, where you found your capital city and then start to explore the world. However, instead of your standard units like Civilization has, you have customized units that you can design yourself. You also have heroes, which are specialty one-man armies that will join your cause from time to time. If you've played Age of Wonders III, the combat is remarkably similar. When you enter battle, both factions are placed on the opposite side of the battlefield, and you move them into play until they're in range to strike. The world itself is incredibly detailed. On almost every playthrough, I'll run into a quest or monster that I've never seen before, and every game spawns one of four special areas of the map where you can fight boss-type monsters and aquire extremely rare treasure. Every game brings something new.PROS:- Incredibly varied worlds- Good combat system- Lots of ""fluff"" - Wide variety of artifacts and weapons- Useful character creatorCONS:- Some factions just plain suck- Game can be glitchy, particularly when loading saves- Soundtrack's rather forgettable FINAL VERDICTFirst off, buying this game with all the DLC will leave you homeless. When our Lord and Savior Gaben blesses this software with the glorious green of a sale, snatch it up as soon as you can. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Every time I play this, I feel like I am wasting my time. WRITING this feels like a waste of time. The devs haven't gotten it yet after three iterations, do I honestly think telling them again will make them change their tack? No, I don't. But at least I can warn other people away.Spells are sparse and universally uninteresting. The races are cookie-cutter clones of each other with stat changes and nothing else. Building or researching things will give you a ""+x to whatever"" bonus ninety percent of the time. The pace of the game is beyond glacial. The interface is a chore to struggle through. But, above everything else, it isn't fun. It's the most boring 4X I've ever played, as were its predecessors. Dominions 4 is literally just 2D sprites and spreadsheets fighting each other and I'm still having more fun.I don't know why I thought this would be worth the money.			"

												I was skeptical about this title, given the first two iterations brought forth following the Kickstarter campaign were severely lacking in polish and promised features. Now I find myself saying ""just one more turn"" hours later after I already said it.This is the game that was promised in the Kickstarter. I feel it has fulfilled the vision of the creators and the fans. I highly recommend Fallen Enchantress for any strategy game fan, or anybody looking for a way to take up space in their day. It's turn based, so you can walk away at any time.The level of detail present in the world is unlike any other game of this type, barring perhaps Galactic Civilizations, also by Stardock. The world of Elemental comes to life as you zoom into your town, deploy on the battlefield, hunt relics, or zoom out to the cloth map (they did it first). I highly recommend this title.			"

												Tried the demo. A hybrid between Heroes of Might and Magic and Civilizations.PROS1. Story looks interestingBut I couldn't grasp anything interesting from the introductory video beyond ""you must tame the land"". So, I got pretty bored but I'm sure there is a lot of backstory.2. A lot of stuffA lot of tech which happens to resemble the Civilization tech tree for easy recognition. CONS1. Same problems as HOMMYou're going to have problems with scaling up. Automating battles may cause your units to suffer damage which you try to avoid, thus causing you to play every tactical battle to min-max and prevent troop loss.2. Actions that could be passivesHave to be next to your town to cast ""Inspiration"" (adds 1 research) for 0 mana is something that should be a passive. Getting additional techpoints are quite important in 4X games e.g. helping to wonder rush. It would be quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to have a hero stand around to cast some sort of ""bless thine city"" spell.If you want to have to make a choice of which spell to cast, force a choice between 2 passives.3. Redundant spellsYou have to play a tactical battle with a spellcaster that begins with up to 9 spells and only 1 move, 1 action per turn. A lot of pretty redundant spells. Lots of choice but not able to execute everything. Spells/abilities cooldown in about 5 turns, so unless you want to play an ultra draggy battle that will be a game by itself, I would not suggest this. I do not see the fun of dragging out ""click and attack"" battles.4. Tactical combat - Direction of AttackCan't see which direction I'm going to attack my enemy from.There might be direction arrows in the game but I couldn't easily find them.5. Tactical combat - EndingThe battles end like HOMM, one winner one loser, which is a problem. There is no tactical retreat or running away. Auto-resolve just ends with one side dead. No kiting, hit-and-run or guerilla tactics, just a ringed match.6. Tactical Comabt - No of turnsDrags the game on for a longer period of time. In the strategic map, only 1 season (day) would have passed.7. Extreme similarity to CivSettler is a pioneer, Scout is a Scout, Library is a Library, etc, etc.I was hoping for uniqueness from Fallen Enchantress, not a portover from Civilization.			"

												The game degrades memorywise the longer you play. So first it gets slower, then the waterlevel disappears, then wrong colors and missing parts happen all over the game. If this isn´t already annoying, the most encountered bug in the game (trying to go to the main menue and reloading a gamesave makes the game crash entirely) completes it. The game is like a kid, that tries to ram too much sweets(data) down his throat and almost suffocates trying it. If they would fix this single problem and you ignore the other bugs, the game could go as a computergame. But for now it is what it is...unstable. Now just my taste:Comparing Fallen Enchantres with Master of Magic is a little bit bold. MoM had better suited spells in the line from weak to powerful, even many of them not the usual fireball stuff we have in this game. And I used most of them in the game, not like here, where I only use few and the rest never or rare. Plus the computer ai loves to use inferior spells more in combat like useful spells: for example giant grow instead of healing an almost dead unit (seen often enough). MoM had buildings, that brought new features, not new (and always same) boni. MoM had units and creatures, that aren´t effect catchers with the appearance of Sauron and oversized, absolutly stupid designed weapons. And erm....MoM had alot less platitudes in it´s game texts. I always roll my eyes, when I have to read the subtexts of most characters.... :) It is like a 6 year old trying to produce somekind of epic zitate.			"

												I've never heard of this game before but I saw it at a 'free weekend' and, remembering my fond feelings for turn-based strategies, decided to give it a try. Well, after playing through the night and finishing one random game, one thing is for sure: I'm not going to buy it after the time runs out.This game is tedious. I started with the tutorial and, boy, were the introductory videos long and unnecessary! I got to the end of only one of them, skipping all the others, and didn't feel like I was missing something. Then there was the main game. For me it went like this: settle down, start expanding - ooh, it's getting interesting - die trying to explore, meet neighboors, avoid their units and wandering monsters while trying to explore and expand, upgrade your cities and lose your units on the way to join main guy's army - repeat for many turns until you know the map - start negotiating, get into a war, sign a peace treaty - rinse and repeat, that's where I lost the last of my interest for this game, during those many turns where nothing happened - finally be strong enough to follow the main storyline and immediately after wait again for who knows how long for new units to be trained in place of the fallen ones. Yeah, boring.I got three endings: the ultimate spell (which I did only out of curiosity, not knowing that it will end the game), by losing to the final dragon behind the gates and by killing it (last two with the use of cheats because of the difficulty jump - I could easily kill any monster or AI unit on the map but this thing obliterates me in, like, three turns? Yeah, no, I'm not grinding for that - and by the way: those cheats? Did not help much). I didn't try to conquer all the other nations just because I couldn't be bothered anymore and wanted to be done with it. And my rating was always 4/10 (I think) despite having, like, twenty fully upgraded cities and finishing all reasearch and quests.Also, this game doesn't have window mode which incredibly bothered me and the loading process took way longer than it should. Maybe my machine isn't powerful enough, although I thought it didn't have to be to play a top-down strategy game! On the technical side of the things, thank god there is an auto-battle option, cause I don't think I would have gotten this far without it! Never played a battle on my own (except the final dragon one but that one doesn't count) and immensely grateful for that.TL;DRActually, this game is not so bad - for the first few hours. After that, if you're not a fan of the wainting game, it becomes too much. Maybe it's supposed to be played in short sessions, who knows, but for me one run was more than enough.Never would've thought of buying this game before; certain that I'd not now.			"

												When I first purchased Elemental way back years ago, I had every hope it would make for a great table top RPG platform as well as the regular strategy game it was designed to be. When I got my copy I was able to see what could be, but it was still an “alpha” game… So I let it go,  kept checking the progress and changes overtime, but nothing got my attention. Then along came 1.7 update and much of what I read I liked so I purchase Legendary Heroes. A BIG WOW!I am so happy the developers never gave up. This is very much what they had promised back when they were making the first Elemental. There is still room for improvement (lots of potential for growth and expansion), but the main concept is all there! So, soon as  they let us make scenarios using the “workshop”,  a custom monster toolset (like the spell toolset) and add a hot seat feature to the game it will appeal to many D&D table top players like myself.  I love the way the mechanics and AI  have developed and evolved/improved, I love the customization aspect so, so, so, very much. Changing gear is actually visible in game play, love the way cities can level as well as almost everything else, we just need equipment to level as well (hopes). The artwork is splendid. I have loved the art from day one! So perfect for this kind of game, the way the story is presented through text and that unique artwork makes me feel like I am actually reading a D&D campaign and I can get my fiends involved (rolling dice to make decisions, character customization, etc.) we played all night as if we were playing table top, and we never once looked at the time, it was great fun, different, but not so different that it did not work. It is thanks to the freedom to customize just about everything that makes this game so rewarding and usable as a tool for a good old fashion table top game. If you have an imagination and fun friends to play with give this a try. ( mind you we are doing this without hot seat or multiplayer, image if we had that!)In short I am very happy that my bias for DLC’s went away almost instantly, “sell me as many DLC's for this game as you want!"" if they are useful and enhances the game like the current DLC’s.  If you love fantasy strategy games give this version of the game a try, you will love it more and more every turn you take, there is something different and new for your imagination to create in good fun! Recommend!			"

Fundamentally, this is balanced and slightly polished Elemental War of Magic.

												I haven't reviewed many games, but I've logged more hours into this game than any other in my library so far, including Skyrim. It's a very detailed strategy game that includes Civilization style kingdom/empire building from a starting date (after a world-shattering cataclysm) until you achieve one of multiple possible victories over the competition. Similarities to Civilization include focusing research to unlock new city improvements, resources, units, and abilities; expanding your country through exploration or conquest; making trade agreements, treaties, and war with other factions; and turn-based actions for all levels of the game. However, this game also includes a lot of plot. There are some default scenarios you can play to see what the underlying relationship is between each of the sovereigns. Even if you choose to just do a custom map or pre-set map without a scenario, you are able to control a soverign character and heroes s/he recruits to complete quests, explore the map, and level up customized ability trees. This comes into play into the larger faction planning because leveling these characters unlocks abilities and bonuses that can boost any other aspect of the game and can lead to extremely powerful units that can trounce through ordinary enemies. There's not as many factions as similar games, but the bonuses are fairly unique to each sovereign and allow for enough variation that trying different game types is a good way to learn new strategies. The fantasy theme is also very fun. There was a lot of effort and creative writing with the incredible number of quests and lore that is inlcuded in each game. The DLC adds even more. Overall, I just haven't gotten bored with this game. It's a lot of fun and worth the full price, though I did find it on sale when I purchased it. That said, if I had played a demo beforehand, I would have gladly paid the full price if no sale was offered. I had no qualms about paying for DLC, each of the ones I have so far were worth it.			"

												A decent 4X game with a decent fantasy universe. many, many possibilities. 10 races with special traits, 6 carriers for your heros, 5 kind of magic, 3 trees of research, many weapons and armor (or dodge) and various equipements, cities, outposts, and even cosmetic option for your heros. etc. I could score it 4 stars out of 5. So why ""no"" ?Trouble is : this is too much. Too much for the AI, that cannot cope. So it's very poor. Too much for the player, who just has to cut through this mess by keeping simple. Bottom line : this game offer a wealth of possibilities, except that the whole point of the game seems to teach the player to NOT use them. What a pity ... Many troups are available ? don't care. Don't bother to research bows, cavalery or armor or mages : the couple of spears that you'll have to spawn in the beginning of the game will make the party that will carry you to victory, thanks to experience and improvements, with the help of a pair of monsters (rewards for questing), 1 or 2 heros that will come with your fame, and a catapult when available. Same for your heroes. Don't bother to ask yourself if they should use bow, axe, sword or mace, 1H or 2H : just make use of whatever comes as loot. add any kind of magic and that's it. Oh, and forget assassin, warriors defenders or whatever. You need mages and admnistratorsSame for your cities. Just build one or two with max food, add outposts, and that's it. Same for diplomacy. Same for gameplay. Just bother to quest and kill roaming monsters for loot and XP, so as to build a party that will cut throught anythingetc.			"

												Someone tried to mix Civilization with HoM&M, not successfully. I'd rather play Warlock Master of Arcane serie.- obscure interface, - maps feel very small and not interesting, there was not enough space for another city on medium map, wtf? I could build outposts for resources at the least.- shallow combat, imho failed unit initiative system,- no hexes, neither on main map nor battle map - Civ manages well without them I admit, but not the case here,- no separate city view and not clikable buildings, not even a tooltip what it is and what it does.- obscure interface (doubly so), especially city management (wait, there is city management at all?)Disclaimer: I played during free weekend and I cannot recommend what I tried to like. Maybe on sale? And I hate wasted potential in games, so common these days.			"

												It is some Civ+HoMM+Master of Magic+whoknowswhat. There is a lot to like in the game, if you like the above mentioned ones. However, it is more simplified than civ. I liked playing it during the free weekend, but somehow this game feels unfinished... or well, not enough tested. Annoyingly small icons. Unable to handle changes in long production lists. etcCharacter, unit development is great. City development is less, but for me it was still ok. I miss battle set-up, this random drop of units has no tactical consideration, or at least very little. I don't expect a Total War setup, but something.Altogether it WILL BE a good game, there are only little things to fix. €10 (€9.24) on 75%?...I'll wait a little more. One could say €10 is not much, well in some countries this amount of money is more worth than this game is right now (eg. the price of 8 beer in a pub).			"

												OK - so I loaded up Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes... Now it wants me to make an additional account. So I am goign to leave it afk on thier request page and earn its cards without ever even looking at the game. I like steam becuase I don't have to deal with uneeded registrations and spamming my e-mail acount to bussinesses' automated advertisement bots. Enjoy Stardock!**Edit**-_-|I couldnt stop myself...... They got me to sign up with their luancher. Nuuu!!!!Resulting game play gave me the following thoughts:For a game with so much to offer, they missed what I feel are the basics.Game play is generic.Focus seems to be on the heros that you can gain and how you level them. The fighting is boring with a predictable AI and terrain that has no advantage in battle. I was so underwelmed from the fighting that I ended up hitting the automated attack button. The most action I got out of this game was hitting the End Turn button to speed up building.No city design controll.Perhaps this next issue won't bother you, but it irritated me to no end. You cannot place the items in your town were you would liek them to go. You just hit the develop button and then order the items you want made first.UI is unfriendlyThis section is to complain about how unfriendly the controll are in this game. Although mastery of the UI is not hard, it does not feel natural. A few more easy to use button would have made a large differnce as well as a few windows. For instance, I would have like a better way to form war parties instead of clicking on the town, then the soldier, then a blank square outside the city, and then finally repeat for each other soldier I want in the group making sure to have them join the same square outside of town. Even if it only took a couple of minutes, that is time further waisted through uneeded tedium.My final adivceThere are better browser 4x games for free out there. I would pass on this game unless you are looking at a massive discount.			"

												Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes aspires to be a great game, and all the elements of a good turn based fantasy strategy game are there, unfortunetly, after 40+ hours of playing it, i have to say, while it is addicting, it is not very fun to play it.I am sure there are people who have lots of fun playing at the start like an ant wich has to be careful where to build it howel least the many wandering beings of power trample it. Scurry around with you units like rats in a field full of cats and larger predators, and pray that none of the monsters, who are at this point unbeatable, notice you.I know what others playing the game will say, that nothing is unbeatable given time. Well sure, but time is not something you have for it when there are AI rivals on the world, who are absolutly unnaffected by the same creatures building their empires, (And don't you dare claim othervise, i have seen unescorted pioneers of the AI walk around dragons and wandering ogre armies unmolested. And no, they did not have the stealthy trait.) this is frustrating at the least.That is not to say it cannot be an enjoyable game, and that you could not beat it. (Sometimes easily, even on harder difficulties.) But luck is too much of a factor, and it is infuriating to realise that you are screwed after an hour of playing, because a creature with physical immunity wandered into your territory (And you have no magic yet), or a random event spawned a swarm of giant spiders on top of your capital that is stronger as your entire armed forces.In a faster game these issues could be looked over, but Fallen Enchantress is Slooowww. I love empire building, i have no problems with a game being slow, but when it is slow, and a bit of bad luck can be game ending, and you have to restart over and over again to get a starting position that is not full of nasties you cannot beat until after midgame tech, that is simply bad design.

Although even this feature, at its core, is too simplistic and unimpressive. The game itself, for having relatively low-end graphics, runs very slow on my computer. In all, I got a few hours of mild enjoyment, then the game began to get repetitive and I eventually had to put it down. Civ V is a far superior game.			"

												The strategy on this game is a little odd I found... the extra element for the title is the legendary creatures stationed around the map (usually just outside your territory). When territory expands to include them, they become active... and promptly kill any heroes you have in the area.If a computer opponent activates one in his area, and you approach, it kills your heroes, while ignoring theres.... kinda a silly mechanic really.Other than that, the game is pretty enjoyable.

It also makes you register a stardock account to play.I think the gameplay I've tried here for about <1 hours now is enough to say that I'll probably get a good 10 hours or more out of this game, so it's worth ten bux, but the above has turned me off from future purchases from this company or this series.

												I am a fan of strategic RPGs. So I might have had high expectations towards FE. There are several aspects worth mentioning.1. Movement: most units have a movement range of two squares. None can pass mountains or oceans/lakes. There are no teleporter. But in later game you can learn a spell to transport your troops to any location you desire. This makes the game extremely lengthy and IMHO dull. Having learnd the spell of transportation it is giving too much of an advantage.2. Tactical combat: your maximum number of attackers is nine units (i.e. a group of soldiers) or champions. When you attack a city, any defending unit or champion will be supported by a number of city units, depending on the buildings errected in this city. There are no obsticals like city walls to hinder the attackers. This makes every battle follow the same pattern: try to kill the archers as quick as possible and mob up the rest. Even if you bring more troops you cannot stack them. My city was once attacked by four groups one after the other in the same round and for every city unit that was killed a new city unit (level 1 though) stepped forward. After a while that is boring.3. Diplomatic system: normally every fraction is going to negotiate with you. And normally you can persuade every fraction to do what you want regardless of their opinion towards you. It will just cost you more. You can trade knowledge and resources but no citys or resoureces pits. Your opponents switch their alliance at random. Or so it seems to me. What is the use of a long-time friend to turn on you whilest every other fraction already is at war with him? That has to be done better.4. Game stability: crap. I dont have to go into this deeper. Just read some of the other comments.5. Research: there are just very few research differences for the different races.6. Injury system: whenever your monarch or one of his/her champions is beaten they will not die. They start over in the nearest city with all their equipment. All the receive as a punishment is a recreation period during which they cannot move and to a champion a random injury. That injury gives the champion a malady: for example less hit points or less strengh. Such injuries will stay with the champion until they are lifted by a potion which can be produced as a consequence of a city achivement. Even a level-up will not effect the injury. So when my champions were defeated several times, they literally became cripples. Moreover, there is a potion to lift all injuries of a person at once but you cannot produce it in your cities. So you have to buy the healing potion several times for 400 gp each.Conclusion: FE: Legendary Heroes is way behind other products of the genre. Even the older Age of Wonders 2 (which I still do recommend as ground-breaking) is better and more stable.			"

												So I picked up this game for the free weekend, having never actually played a build civilization stratagy game before. A stand-a-lone game by Stardock, upon the opening intro I see interesting artwork and fantasy. The story line or plot is pretty basic. You choose between 10 soverign or heros, who aim to rule/conquer the world of Elemental. Witch has been torn asunder and is in ruins ripe to be brought together again by cataclysm. The soverigns themselves and their civilizations are very themed and have a style of their own. A unique gameplay for whoever you choose. I selected Magnar. I was drawn to (naturally) by his warlock abilities and the story line of ( I'm a dragon/human thing called a Quendar, Were old and ancient and you're not. So I shall make slaves and use fire and death magic to rule the weak. ) Cool huh? A short tuturial and you can jump into the game.  Using you'r soverign you build and take over the world of Elemental. Build settlements and watchposts to increase your economy and research warfare/civilization/magic. It took a while to get the hang of all the micro-managing but after a while I think I got the hang of it. More heros DO join your civilization, while it grows in fame and fortune. Witch they want a part of , butt chose wisely your heros to your strengths and game play. Also you have to build an army or two to kill wild animals, bandits, undead, demons, trolls, ogres and everything else you can think of in the fantasy world. I was rather impressed by the monster library in the game. During all this you can also pick up quests to complete mainly by killing or collecting things while your doing your build civilization thang. And then you have the other soverigns to deal with ! Oh yeah and there is these huge epic elemental boss guys that'll pop up that'll try to destroy you....This game was interestingly addicting by the fact of I MUST BUILD MY EMPIRE BIGGER.  and level up my soverin and heros to rule the weak. An almost primal urge of destroy and conquer kinda takes over. A lot of content to get lost in while you play It's defineitly a game to pick up if you have a chance.			"

												I immediately bought this when I found out about it because I adore the old Heroes of Might and Magic games and the Age of Wonders franchise, and I really wanted something newer and better to play with my friends.Those of you who know this game already know what my first problem is... No multiplayer?! I assumed it had multiplayer since every similar game that went before it has multiplayer, but boy was I stupid not to have checked that little detail beforehand. And there won't be any multiplayer in the future either.Oh well, I like to play those games in single player mode too, so all's not lost... And the gameplay is great. It's better than HoMM and AoW. It really is a step forward, and not only graphically.But that positive note was dashed almost immediately. This game is buggier than an ant-farm (on windows XP certainly, on windows 7 less so). It used to crash right before it saved (only a game that corrupts its own savegames is more annoying), but still I had to save often because a slew of other things could go wrong, so many actions could lead to crippling or annoying bugs that it isn't possible to sum them up here. After a few updates the saving issue was gone but other bugs popped up. To this day the bugs make this game practically unplayable, and that is a crying shame, because it really is a good game at heart.7/10 if they get the bugs out. 3/10 as it is right now.			"

												This is a great game in the making. If you like early access games this might be for you.The problem is, this isn't an early access game. This is the predecessor of this game, with minor patches. The changes and added content in this ""stand alone expansion"" are an order of magnitude less than what I've ever seen in any expansion, stand alone or otherwise. And the game itself is only 75% done - it is still unfinished, unbalanced, and riddled with more bugs than any finished game should have in the late Beta phase. The things that are unfinished are:- A ridiculous amount of bugs (e.g. wrong camera perspective in worldmap until you restart, missing tooltips that should tell you how strong the enemy is, cannot select a unit until you restart, music stops until you restart, game crashes, etc), usually I encounter about 2 of these per hour.- Performance (runs very slow on Haswell integrated graphics)- AI is very very weak- Lategame gameplay not interesting, due to bad balance and AI- Manual and in-game help incomplete, not usableA few balance changes and A LOT of bugfixes, and this game would be good. Add in a decent AI and it would be great. Unfortunately it doesn't have these and never will, so thumbs down.			"

												This game had some good elements, but I would say that most aspects of it fall short. Its like civilization and your units group in an army and you go to a battle screen kind of like Total War games. Except the battles are turn based and I have a lot of problems with the battles, The ranged units can hit anywhere on the map... So your weaker mages or archers get picked off easy, especially if you auto-resolve, all your weak units will be dead, all other units no damage. Also the fights start pretty much face to face, first person to move usually gets the kill. One thing that really annoyed me was the character models, they are going for a RPG element with lots of items for heros, except the heros and items look sooo horribly bad, Like I dont understand how these days, even a modest graphic designer could probably nock out some really good character and item models. The game might be worth getting for under 5 bucks, other than that pass it up. If you really want a city building fantasy battle game go for Warlock - Master of the Archane, seems like a nice one so far,			"

												Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is an extremely fun and addictive 4X game in a beautiful setting. Customization is amazing, I always play my own faction and own hero. Tactical combat is really fun and you can play in many different ways. Personally I play it almost like an RPG running around with my hero group and some troups, doing quests, gathering items, slaying monsters and building heroes so strong they can squash enemy empires. The choice is yours. Highly recommended game, for people who like 4X, RPG and a fantasy setting. 9/10.			"

												Hi, I've just played this game during the trial weekend. As other people have said, this is Civilization meets HoMM, both of which are series that I have enjoyed very much. There is also a resemblance to Age of Wonders. Many of the elements of this game are very well done.Pros:+Turn Based Combat System is well executed in general+Graphics are decent for Turn-Based 4x games+Customisable Characters+Interesting weapon array+Interesting skills available+Quest system is really coolCons:-Game is a bit too complex (for me), as an RPG is good, as a 4x is good, but both is a bit confusing and hard to manage-Hard to understand city system and resources (not clear enough what buildings actually do and how the city evolves)-Too easy to build pioneers, cities should be hard to build!!In conclusion, I feel this game would appeal to fans of civilization who like to play the game on normal or slow settings and fans of total war. This game requires a lot of effort to understand the mechanics but it *might be* worth it. For me though, I didn't feel it was replayable enough as every game seemed to feel the same (I just wanted things to hurry up!), and perhaps I missed out on important aspects of the game. I'm giving it a 'Yes' recommendation as there is no 'Maybe' button and it was nice to give a trial weekend.Recommend? Maybe.			"

												Great strategy game.The possibility of creating new units on the resources you actually have is wonderful + every unit pack can have unique abilities.Seems a bit like connection of Heroes of Might and Magic with Civilization: - Research and grow your cities (very Civilization like)- Have you Champions with their armies fight (almost like Heroes)But unfortunately it also has bad sides: - Saves seems to be glitching occasionally- Bows are underpowered and dont do too much while defensive stance is active - maybe it should have something like 33%-50% armor penStill I would recommend to play it.

												I immediately bought this when I found out about it because I adore the old Heroes of Might and Magic games and the Age of Wonders franchise, and I really wanted something newer and better to play with my friends.Those of you who know this game already know what my first problem is... No multiplayer?! I assumed it had multiplayer since every similar game that went before it has multiplayer, but boy was I stupid not to have checked that little detail beforehand. And there won't be any multiplayer in the future either.Oh well, I like to play those games in single player mode too, so all's not lost... And the gameplay is great. It's better than HoMM and AoW. It really is a step forward, and not only graphically.But that positive note was dashed almost immediately. This game is buggier than an ant-farm (on windows XP certainly, on windows 7 less so). It used to crash right before it saved (only a game that corrupts its own savegames is more annoying), but still I had to save often because a slew of other things could go wrong, so many actions could lead to crippling or annoying bugs that it isn't possible to sum them up here. After a few updates the saving issue was gone but other bugs popped up. To this day the bugs make this game practically unplayable, and that is a crying shame, because it really is a good game at heart.7/10 if they get the bugs out. 3/10 as it is right now.			"

												relatively boring game . Biggest issue with the game i had was the tactical combat . Its dull . Maps are small , archers/mages can shoot across the map , sieges dont involve any forms of walls . Just extra conscript units which are useless are spawned. No more that one stack of units (1 army vs 1 army)  can fight . So if you have several armies fighting you are going to fight first battle . Then after it you will fight another battle , etc. Combat is inferior to age of wonders 2 .			"

												Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes aspires to be a great game, and all the elements of a good turn based fantasy strategy game are there, unfortunetly, after 40+ hours of playing it, i have to say, while it is addicting, it is not very fun to play it.I am sure there are people who have lots of fun playing at the start like an ant wich has to be careful where to build it howel least the many wandering beings of power trample it. Scurry around with you units like rats in a field full of cats and larger predators, and pray that none of the monsters, who are at this point unbeatable, notice you.I know what others playing the game will say, that nothing is unbeatable given time. Well sure, but time is not something you have for it when there are AI rivals on the world, who are absolutly unnaffected by the same creatures building their empires, (And don't you dare claim othervise, i have seen unescorted pioneers of the AI walk around dragons and wandering ogre armies unmolested. And no, they did not have the stealthy trait.) this is frustrating at the least.That is not to say it cannot be an enjoyable game, and that you could not beat it. (Sometimes easily, even on harder difficulties.) But luck is too much of a factor, and it is infuriating to realise that you are screwed after an hour of playing, because a creature with physical immunity wandered into your territory (And you have no magic yet), or a random event spawned a swarm of giant spiders on top of your capital that is stronger as your entire armed forces.In a faster game these issues could be looked over, but Fallen Enchantress is Slooowww. I love empire building, i have no problems with a game being slow, but when it is slow, and a bit of bad luck can be game ending, and you have to restart over and over again to get a starting position that is not full of nasties you cannot beat until after midgame tech, that is simply bad design.

												After playing for 400+ hours I thought I would add a review. So yes I like the game and I keep coming back, now I am playing through with each faction. Features that I have enjoyed is after creating a strong army the weak and medium enemies can be defeated without going through the small map meta game. I have found this really quite useful. I like the multiple factions and army types and then creating my own from the different game concepts learnt. My favourite was taking a Cave Bear into the 20+ level.

												The strategy on this game is a little odd I found... the extra element for the title is the legendary creatures stationed around the map (usually just outside your territory). When territory expands to include them, they become active... and promptly kill any heroes you have in the area.If a computer opponent activates one in his area, and you approach, it kills your heroes, while ignoring theres.... kinda a silly mechanic really.Other than that, the game is pretty enjoyable.

												My initial impression is: How have I not heard about this before? It feels like this game was tailor made for me. It's a mix of Civ and Heroes of Might and Magic without stripping down the hefty ideas from those two games. This is a very deep strategy game that allows for a lot of customisation - a sentence that always wins me over. So far I have been able to create an evil mage warlord from a fantasy story I wrote a long time ago and live out his career. The game is moulding itself around my play style rather than the other way around which is an absolute win. I forsee many late nights with this one. It's like discovering HoMM3 all over again...			"

												I was a silent ""victim"" of the War of Magic debacle; I preordered the game a year before the first beta was released.  Fallen Enchantress and especially Legendary Heroes more than made up for that mess.  I would never say that this is the next Master of Magic, as it is a competely different game.  Much of what makes the game great is due to the company's engagement with its customers; the feedback given over the last few years has shaped everything from the interface to the math going on behind the scenes.  If turn based fantasy is something you like, you can not miss this, and honestly, there isn't much else in that genre to play right now...			"

												As i was running an army pathing, it decides to NOT let me move threw enemy territory as long as do not end the turn in there borders, forcing me to walk around, inwhich incountered a wandering army that oddly enough was in said enemy territories... which as understand roaming monsters will only be agroed to attacking u unless there lair is in your territory...Which for some odd reason AI does not have this limitation.I lost an unguarded outpost to a weak 3 unit wolf pack that was wandering nowhere near to there lair... WHY do outposts not have atleast have a small garrison of militia like settlements?Suppose its not much to ask yet really needs to be over-hauled as the amount of unforseen dangers are outragious, so far had terrible quests with sub-par rewards, Really enter a sand golem lair and only recieve a mediocre snake beast? OR enter a lair for a alchemy spell only to realize it costs 100 mana for 100 gildar... wtf is there such terrible rewards??? its almost like only thing quests give you is heroes and that is with aquiring fame, while no same inn will give the same option to recieve quests anymore. Also had a random event of plague... really? Like i have enough to worry about with roaming monsters/beasts now my food reserves are cut in half or lose 20 population OR i suffice for the cure plague spell and that is a wopping 500 mana!!!SO maybe this is my review yet not really worth the hassle of unbalanced, unreal control of armies...

												This game is the best.  The options to modify your troops allow you to meet different circumstances.  For example,  if you have trouble with fire elementals you can mod your socerers with frost staffs.  I  really enjoyed this game.			"

												I didn't even realize tgis game existed, but then I was sent an email for the newest Humble Bundle. Of course 6 games for 1 dollar sounded great so I bought it and here came Fallen Enchantress. I turned it on ad played the tutorial to find it was Like Civ but with a much more fun spin, QUESTS! If you're a loot ♥♥♥♥♥ like me in games then this game will have you adicted instantly			"

												I spent money for it so I'd hope to be able to recommend it. Alas, not to be.It's not a bad game, really. It's just that, in 79 hours, I've figured out how to utilize the tech tree and can advance faster than the Hard AI can. Having done that, I just take what I want and no one ever tries to stop me.Some of the Rulers are pretty weak, so, one could handicap themselves by playing those, I suppose. Here are what I see as problems.1. Everyone will tell you that the random mobs are often vastly superior to what you can field, especially early on. That these advanced mobs attack your armies AND your cities, long before you can cope with them, is very frustrating. It's the cause of a lot of re-starts.2. It takes long periods of time to recruit army units. Thus, it's long into the game before you can mount any credible force UNLESS you simply allow your research and tech improvements to just languish and build weak units. The AI will happily flood the land with pioneers that take control of the valuable areas while you fall behind while building troops. But, he won't bother to defend them! He'll allow you to take his outposts and the resources there with no opposition. Instead, he waits until they're again undefended to send in some throwaway units to re-take them...maybe.3. Happily, you can leave your cities pretty much unguarded against the AI opponents. They NEVER attack you. They'll build outposts and garner resources and, left entirely alone, create 4-5 units in their cities. But, they never put together any large forces to attack, just a few units that putz around doing nothing aggressive to you. The AI sends in lone heroes to battle vastly tougher mob armies and, of course, lose. The heroes usually don't die, just return to a city, maimed, to recuperate. Maybe that's the AI's method of getting them experience? It's fruitless, though.4. There's Epic (that's YOUR army) and then there's EPIC (that's the AI mobs). Taking YOUR epic army to battle and watching a dragon eat 4-5 entire units in one turn let's you know that you can't trust the game's evaluations. Weak and medium, well, they're not too badly graded. Once you get to strong, deadly, and epic, it's prety iffy as to your relative strength.5. Why does the AI declare war and then just sit in his cities, waiting for you to take them? Why does the AI declare war at all? I know they fight each other and take cities. I think they're just as handicapped as the player when it comes to fielding armies.So, I won't be buying any DLCs for this game and I don't advise anyone to spend money on this game.			"

Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is an odd game to me. Personally, I don't like turn-based games because I don't have the patience to wait for my next turn. But, somehow, I still bought this game because I like the RPG-element in it. Against my expectations I really liked the game because the world looks pretty awesome with the magic and monsters (especially the dragons.. I love dragons). I have spent a lot of time creating new factions and sovereigns because you want to try everything out when you see something new. NOTE: Sovereigns and heroes are not the same thing in this game.The point of the game is to build a kingdom/empire, research and defeat or work together with the enemy AI's, kill monsters (there are dragons, giant spiders and some really epic monsters I  haven't encountered yet) and there can be an event going on like the plague, the shroud (can't remember what it was). All in all, you must make a lot of choices; Shall I attack these monsters and leave my base undefended or shall I make a new squad to defend my base while I'm attacking the enemy? Shall I research better armor or do I need to research better economics? Doing quests around the map gives you items (sometimes unique ones) which your sovereign or hero can equip. Doing quests also increases your fame, fame will get you heroes, heroes will make your army stronger.I had a bit of problem getting the hang of this game. The tutorial wasn't really helpful which is a shame. By restarting the game a few times you will learn the game step by step. So don't expect to get the hang of it right away.Pros:+ Lots of choices between factions and heroes.+ Nice graphics (world, kingdoms/empires) when zoomed out.+ Lots of enemies.+ Challenging.+ Customizing your own faction and Sovereign.Cons:- Most of the battles you will be selecting auto-result (skip the fighting stuff and know the result right away) - Bad graphics (npc's and some monsters) when zoomed in.- Hard to get the hang of this game (I suggest watching some youtube video's first).- When heroes fall they will have permanently decreased stats.- Unpredictable AI. Sometimes out of nowhere they start a war or are angry.  If I had to give this game a score I would give it a 7.5.			"

												Well, I played this for a grand total of 43 minutes, since it's on free demo on Steam at time of writing. I realise this isn't a full review, 43 minutes isn't very long, but the point of a demo is to entice you to want to play the game further, so I can say the demo failed for me.Having never played a Fallen Enchantress game before, I found the controls not very intuitive, and felt frustrated a lot of the time. I don't know if there are ways to choose which things you research in what order, clicking on them didn't do squat, so my research carried on automatically. I couldn't easily see when things I was building would finish, or view or edit my building queue. It took quite a while to work out how to combine units into an army, and the relative limitations of army sizes.Combat is a huge mess. I'm used to being able to wait and move my unit turn further down in the queue, like Heroes of Might & Magic, but instead in this I guess if my unit can't reach the enemy and isn't a long range unit he just has to pass a turn he could still have done *something* in, just not move. Most of my combat turns involved me passing turns, everyone was out of mana pretty much immediately and I wasn't presented with any information on how or when they regained it. I then ran into a battle in which I had to fight a ghost. The ghost is immune to all physical damage. No one has any mana.That was when the 43 minutes elapsed and I decided I'd had enough.			"

You can get away with vector-like graphics and single-digit landscape palettes in a Sci-Fi game like GalCiv, but Stardock shows that when it's applied to fantasy, it just doesn't work.

Tried many times to launch the game but alas, it wouldn't ....but I wasn't put off.2)  Tried to load game again on second day.  Apparently, I have to give my E-Mail address to an unproven/untrusted  entity, despite nothing having been demonstrated....but I wasn't put off. 3)  Signed up reluctantly.  Game loaded very slowly and laucnhed into a poor, somewhat incoherent, pale immitation to the intro to Lord of The Rings.....but I wasn't put off.4)   Changed AA setting and was told game would have to restart.  Started to get put off.5)  Restarted game.  Took ages to start up.....again.  Getting more put off now.6)  Chose to execute Tutorial.  Tutorial turned out to be more like a 90s infomercial, crammed into a tiny little box about half the size of my screen (?).  Now I'm beginning to get irritated.7)  Attempted to move my character as directed in the tutorial.  Spent 10 minutes trying to move character.  Failed.  Extremely annoyed by now.  8)  Figured #6 must be a bug so exited and restarted game.  Waited again.  Game crashed.  Deleted.  Never again.  Absolutely appaling and pathetic.  1 Hour of my life I'll never get back and an unwarranted invasion of privacy.			"

												A bit clunky, has some weird bugs (need to restart the game when you reload a save if you want to see any map borders), but a charming game nonetheless. Takes awhile to get used to if you come from Civ games ( city stats depend only on the square you place the city on, if the first square wasn't next to river then you can't build a harbor even after expanding the city to a river... )After getting access to right spells you can redesign the landscape which is awesome.Army and hero management is alright.Battles against an enemy that spams fear suck but oh well.Definitely worth picking up during a sale if you like turn-based 4X + fantasy setting.

												Fallen Enchantress is an awesome mix of Civilization, Spellforce, and King's Bounty. All of these are games I love to pieces.

												Are you ready for a strategic RPG with tactical combat and a vast world to explore?Well too bad! First you need to build your first city, then set research, then maybe you can wait a few turns to build a scout, then maybe find something interesting outside of a two tile radius of where you started the game, and a few turns later, maybe finish researching sticks with pointy ends so you can make spearmen.Or in other words, in spite of how this game tries to sell itself, this game is basically just Civilization with a new coat of paint and a spellbook mechanic.  (Notably, spellbooks are also tied to tech trees, so you get even more ""sit and watch a progress bar fill up"" fun.) One would think that after over two decades, the formula for these games would be getting refined - even Civilization itself has, for the past decade, done much to try to lessen the micromanagement - but this game and the other low-budget Civ clones prove that some people are just averse to new ideas. In essence, the point of this game is to build cities, expand cities, kill barbarians - I mean monsters - and finally get a conquest/diplomacy/research/whatever ending.  There's also a unit customization screen, although that made a whole lot more sense in Galactic Civilizations than here, and the low polys on the characters and fact that selecting a cloak makes your character go bald make it both a bit frustrating and unsatisfying as a means of customizing your troops.  At best, you can make one class of soldier have a red hat instead of a green one to tell them apart more easily.  I can't recommend this game, as anyone who would want to play a 4X like this might as well play the much better-polished Civ V.			"

												This game had a hell of a life.  It started out as ""Elemental: War of Magic.""  However the game had terrible reviews and angry players, so the game was essentially scrapped, recalled and removed from the market.  According to the developer, it shouldn't be availible anywhere. This brings us to Fallen Enchantress.Fallen Enchantress was created to replace War of Magic.  It removed some of the popular features of WoM such as Dynasties. However it added much more.  This was released in place of WoM, and given to free to the origional purchasers of WoM. This game had its life cycle.Then came Legendary Heroes:  Many are confused. This game is mis-advertised as an Expansion, however its really the Successor to FE in the way that FE succeeded WoM.  This doesn't ""Expand"" anything if you buy FE.  This IS the game in its current line of succession. It isn't WoM, or FE.  It is LH now.This game falls short of the rest of the genre by far. Elemental is better than Eador, and worse than AoW3.			"

												ACCOUNT CREATION ERROR ?!?WTF ?!?Love turn-based strategy, was way excited to play this game. Downloaded, clicked play. Was asked to create/register an account... WTF? Did so anyway. Couldn't get past the account screen. No error, no confirmation, no prompt for additional info. Nothing. Every time I clicked ""Create"" or ""Register"" there was no response. And for whatever idiotic reason, you CANNOT play this game without a ""Stardock Account.""Went to their website, stardock.com, and registered an account there. Informed I had created an account successfully. Hopeful, relaunched game, entered new account info... STILL NOTHING!Have now wasted upwards of 20+ min just TRYING to play this game! Thanks for wasting my valuable gaming time Stardock! If I'm this frustrated before I've even PLAYED ONE SECOND of the game, it doesn't bode well for this game or this company.Way to fail Stardock - you deserve every negative review, and then some.Will never bother with any of their games again, and neither should you.Even at $0, this game will be a complete waste of your time.

												Bad Master of Magic clone...I have picked up the game as part of a free trial weekend as I have not played a 4x fantasy game in some time. Unfortunately it is not what I expected. City improvements for example only give tiny bonuses each, it takes forever to grow a city into something meaningful. You cannot really put a focus or make strategic decisions as each building has almost no affect.The combat is flawed, magic is almost useless. It takes forever to get new mana in the beginning and building new units is a pain. Later on combat is way to simple as you simply pile up units in an army - unbeatable for the AI.To sum this up the game is simply not fun. Playing on a high resolution device (surface 3) also shows that the game has technical problems as you cannot reduce the resolution and still play fullscreen! There is simply no option for fullscdreen in the game menu... and this in 2015. The fact that you need to create an additional stardock account on top of steam is also noteworthy.If you get the game for free try it, maybe get it at a discount. But think really hard before paying full price for that game!I would rate it maybe 4 out of 10.			"

												A clunky, ugly, Civilization-style 4X strategy game that is overly complicated and makes little effort to explain itself. Fallen Enchantress makes a big deal about its RPG elements, even including a win condition where you can practically play it as a single player RPG to defeat the ancient evil while virtually ignoring your in-game neighbors. You can also equip your (legendary) heroes with armor, weapons, and trinkets, put points into large active & passive skill trees, and use them to enhance your cities, increase your resources, or just go out and kill big monsters. However I feel all this added complexity takes away from the strategy elements of the game and are poorly explained; there is only ONE 10 minute tutorial for the whole game, with everything else explained through tooltips, brief popups and an in-game encyclopedia. In fact, many of the new game ""tutorial"" popups just link to the in-game manual's page on that topic. If you can look past the low quality, repetitive music, terrible graphics with flat, undetailed textures and poor character models (why is everything so ugly when there are so many close-ups of your heroes?), clunky UI, and tinny SFX, you might have fun with this game. Fallen Enchantress is a very mundane 4X Civilization style strategy game that tries to be something bigger but is too underdeveloped to be worth playing.			"

Unless you're super into dragons and gold and♥♥♥♥♥♥ I really recommend that you give this one a pass.			"

												I tried this game during the free week-end.I won't put a negative review because it needs a stardock account, that's silly (even tough i can understand that some might find this annoying).Negative review because:1) It's ugly, my god it's ugly...It looks exactly like elemental the first in 2009 (i preorded it, how foolish i was). Ok strategy games can be ugly but this one is ugly and""empty"". The world feels empty, lifeless and you have no pleasure looking at it. Caracters are angulars and seem to come straight from a PS1 game. Moreover, factions have no personality whatsoever.2) Management seem tedious. Neutral monsters are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but if you remove them from the start (trough an option) ,the world is even more empty and I can't stand it.  City management is...I don't know...I don't feel attached to my city as in CIV IV OR CIV V.Same thing for heroes (bound to the ugliness of my hero).3) Sound is lackluster...music is the same as in Elemental in 2009 ""bland"", tasteless.I have no motivation to keep on with this game. There is one out here wich is much better (even if it has its own flaws): Endless legend. Do you like eating things that  have no taste? Drinking empty glasses of air? Do you like getting bored? Buy it sir.For the others? Endless legend. Or even AoW III wich has a much interesting combat system. "

It was fun while I played the scenario but at the end I got fed up with all the errors and reloading. I ran it under Vista and this is the first game ever I have such major problems with. A game with 2 full revisions shouldn't have such problems at all !!! Coincidental or not, but my laptop screen got nervous of this game (bleeding !?) and the screen is now broke.

But, they gave us two expansions for free and I guess that was an ok deal. So basically I got it all for $80 bucks. I kinda feel ripped off.The game is fine enough now. Lots of questing an exploring but the ai is a bit lacking. The wilderness ai is better than the standard ai opponents. That's sad.It's more or less just a time waster like most games nowadays.

												This is an excellent game for anyone with a passing interest in turn based strategy games. I honestly do believe this is the spiritual successor to Age of Wonders or the closest we shall get to it, which is something I've always dreamed would happen.At first I pirated the game and on the second day after I went and purchased it off Steam to support the developers in what way I can, I was that impressed. It has so many layers from the research, the rpg-style exploration and questing to the empire building and warfare. Stardock has really impressed me with how much support they have gone and given this game, it is a light and day difference in terms of quality from the original Elemental to Legendary Heroes and this tells me they really do care about their product and their support for such a great game will not be ending anytime soon. I'll end by saying that the ""one more turn"" feeling we all love and crave has been captured very well so far for me with Legendary Heroes and what more can you ask for with a game like this? Turn based strategy fans shouldn't even hesitate on giving this game a try and spreading the word. I've been greatly impressed with the amount of work and detail put into this game. Cheers!			"

												Got it from a giveaway, thank you kind stranger! :)On to the review:-Game itself is very interesting. For starters, you can customize your character so that you can choose what type you want it to be or you can just play with the pre-selected ones. As for the mechanics, its quite hectic. You face other sovereigns in the map and its practically 'the faster, the better'. You need to outpace your enemies in building your city, training your units, and collecting resources for enchantments. This game requires a lot of time, and if you are quite busy, then this could mean that you cannot play it to your heart's content. However, if you love strategy games , then this could fit your bill. Personally, i like the game. As a battle realms lover, i have always loved outpacing my enemies in building our bases and farming resources, and these elements are all present in this game but with much, much more content. -On the flipside, game is buggy. It frequently crashes and sometimes requires me to restart my pc/laptop. I also found it a bit annoying that they require you to sign-up in their site, i mean for what purpose really? I sure do hope that the bugs will eventually be fixed.			"

												Let me start by saying I am NOT a 4x player (infact I didn't even know what that was when I got this game), so this is coming from some one relatively new to the genre.FE:LH is the perfect example of an intimidating game.  There's just so much going on, so much custimization, so many options, and so much thought process that seems to need to go into every single turn to be successful, to a new player the whole experience can be more then a little overwhelming.Now that's not inherently a bad thing, obviously its not the game for you if your looking mindless fun, but if you enjoy a good strategic experience, a game having this much meat to it can be a really good thing, and can allow for a tremendous amount of depth and replay value.What it DOES mean, however, is that its absolutely crucial that the game has a top notch tutorial to ease a new player into the complexities the game has to offer.  There are various ways this can be accomplished, though my favorites have always been games which provide multiple missions/quests which start with only a small portion of the game available, and incremently add on more and more until by the end the player has had time to at least begin to understand each aspect of the game and is not putting it all together.Unfortunately, that is not the case with FE:LH.  The single player campaigns, while enjoyable, are not very informative or what I'd consider good learning tools.  Although there is a dedicated tutorial, its not very long, it mainly just shows you ""how"" to do a handful of things, then its over, providing very little information as to the why, and generaly leaving the players head spinning from the massive information dump.  It's reminsicent of some fighting games whose tutorials invovle asking you to do a bunch of a characters special moves, you do them, and then the tutorial is over.  You come away knowing these are things you can do, but not really knowing when or why you should do them, and it was all over so fast you probably won't even remember half of the moves once your in a match.Despite the lack of new player friendliness, I'm still giving this game a recommend.  Why?  Because I'm finding that if you're willing to endure a pretty terrible introductory experience and learn the concepts of the game the hard way, the actual game itself is quite well made and actually pretty darn fun.  I honestly feel that if this game had a quality tutorial this would be one of the better PC games out there, maybe even a must own.  As it is though, it takes a very special kind of dedicated player (or some one already familar with the 4x genre) to spend the hours learning things the hard way it takes to actually get to the fun part where you know what your doing and your making meaningful choices instead of random ones, so keep this in mind before purchasing.

AI seems a little bit feeble at the moment I have experienced but I haven't tried high settings.I applaud developers for sticking with their game, and making it shine I hope they deserve the well earned recognition for this.Pros:More map options.Improved tactics.Rebalanced hereos.Fun and deep combat.Tons of customization.Cons:Overpowered mages.End game can get tedious.Small quirks with game play.

												Until recently I would've recommended this game. It's somewhat better than Fallen Enchantress, it was quite a lot better than  Sorcerer King. Great sandbox game, 4x game, tactical combat and rpg (nurse your troups, build your heroes).Unfortunately Stardock decided to fiddle with it and  they broke it. Half the  time you can no longer see territory, the tactical combat has not been improved as intended, but made annoying and  opened to exploits, and as I found out the hard way, city defense is very broken now - you station an army in a town and they don't get to defend it any longer.Until those issues are fixed, I can no longer recommend this game at all. Some folk seem to cheer change for the sakes of the NEW, but in this case I do not agree with them at all.			"

												When your white boots are black and your leather boots are white, when your cities don't actually gain the buffs from magic spells that the game says they do, and when the battle fields have no tactical difference between standing on a hill, in a forest, or in a flat plain, you know you have a game that was released early and never patched.(At least, no patches or user mods that I found fixed them.)On top of that, After loading a saved game it would randomly freeze some turns later.I would have had more fun playing the original genre-setter, Master of Magic, from back in the 90's.

												This is one of only 3 games of my over 300 Steam games that crashes frequently. It does run for a while, but within a few minutes it crashes and locks up my Win 7 PC. The lastest patches have made it a bit more stable, but it still crashes every few minutes.I did read over the 60+ page manual, and based on that and my limited experience playing FE, it does not look interesting. It reminds me of Galactic Civ, another Stardock game I didn't like. Stardock games seem to be very ""dry"", lots of features, but very little that is enjoyable. From reading other reviews here it seems this game isn't very well thought of, even by many people who have put quite a few hours into it. Stardock is now on my ""don't bother buying"" list.			"

												This game is more frustrating than it is fun. Takes ages to load turns, graphics are laggy on a PC that runs MUCH more graphically intensive games fine. The injury system is the most annoying thing I have ever encountered in a game, happen to walk into a deadly encounter that spawned right next to your starting position in the first few turns of the game? Say goodbye to ever using that hero again! I had -75% HP, -150% dodge, and a slew of other stats on my BEST hero one game with no way I could find to cure them. Once a hero falls in battle they are done, that's it. And, given the amount of grinding it takes to level them up that happens A LOT. Endless Legend/Space is so much better...			"

												From someone who has trouble getting in to singleplayer, and someone who prefers fast paced games, I surprisingly liked Fallen Enchantress.The sound track blends well, the gameplay has variety, while not being overly complicated to learn, stuff usually does what it sas it does, etc.However.It is quite buggy. I haven't witnessed anything game-breaking yet, but there are quite a few bugs littered throughout. Maybe I don't quite feel the impact because Ig ot this game in a giveaway, but digress.TL;DR, saw lots of bugs, but nothing gamebreaking or overly experience ruining, otherwise, it's a great game that got someone like me who hates the genre to enjoy it.

Added into what is essentially a $40 mod for another game, instead of supporting/patching that game.Yikes.			"

												While I don't have many hours in this game at the time of the review, this is an addictive Civ5-like ""just one more turn"" 4X game. Set in a medieval fantasy world, Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes pits you against AI-controlled factions, each of which contain a Sovereign, the titular ""Heroes"" of the game. While there are preset sovereigns for you to choose from, you can create your own custom sovereign and choose which of 10 factions it belongs to. You can customize your army, as well, ranging from simple colors to starting equipment and whether or not they are mounted units. Keep in mind that adding stronger arms and armor to your troops will increase how much resources it will cost to create. You can, however, find Champions roaming around the world, seeking the aid of a Hero. Whenever you find a Champion, you can add them to your Sovereign's party or form parties of different units of your choice. There are multiple quests to perform, ranging from finding gold and resources to pillaging a dark lair full of spiders and necromancers. Combat has 2 forms; turn-based isometric view and standard Civ5-style quick attacks. If you choose the turn-based option, you are brought to a tactical overview of the battlefield and all the units within the party will appear on screen. Spells, abilities, and items can be used in battle, as well as many other spells, abilities, and items that can be used outside of battle. There is so much to do in this game that its hard to put down in this review without describing the whole game in detail. For $10 on sale, its worth the price for the base game. If you get hooked, the DLC adds more quests, enemies, loot, etc. If you like 4X games and the fantasy setting, give it a try!			"

												This is a pretty good game if you are playing it for the strategy elements that come with 4X games. If however, you are looking for fantasy elements or something like an RPG, you will be sorely disappointed, as they are pretty generic. This is definitely one game where anything like a story is just window dressing, with absolutely no substance. Since I'm largely a strategy gamer, I don't really care, and the strategy elements are all there and fairly well refined.			"

												UPDATED: Fallen Enchantress is a solid game, coming in at around 7.5/10 for me. The fantasy setting infused with magic can be a nice change of pace from the more reality based Civ5. The hero leveling, upgrade, and equipment mechanics are very nice. The devlop stories over time, complete with scars and injuries for defeats in battle. The city system isn't as flexible as Civ5, but is more tailored. While you can only build cities in select locations, each city can be customized from the start. first selecting the focus of the city, then the structures and ""wonders"" built. The multipul win conditions is a standard in 4x nowadays, but the victory conditions here are a little more satisfying.It is slightly buggy, but not game breakingly so. The menus and UI need more polish. The overall gameplay can get a little stale sometimes(IMO).The battles are a little more hands on with a turn based, grid battleground. I enjoy this more than just stacks of numbers duking it out on a world map. There is an auto-resolve option if you don't want to. It is what it is. You like it or you don't.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Not really a bad review, just raising a flag for an issue that some players may want to be aware of)Looking at my play time you may say ""That's not enough for a proper review"", and you're absolutely right. I may get around to playing it at some point, but not today. Here's why...This is not a review of the game, as I stopped before I made it to a menu. 3rd party DRM via Stardock Launcher needing a Stardock account. Not a real issue, pretty silly reason to give it a negative review. Only reason I've even writing this is because I have to. 3rd Party DRM is nowhere to be found on the store page. You can only figure it out by sifting through other reviews to find ones like this. If they had just listed this on the page, this review wouldn't even exist. Companies like Kalypso(Tropico series) have similar DRM, using their own launcher requiring an account. Meh, it's unwelcome and bothersome, but they're just trying to protect the software they worked hard on(lol, like it actually stops piracy). Weather it's due to an oversight or a shady nusniess model, it's the fact that they didn't list it that I'm rebeling to. Not cool to withold information until you have a persons money. Had I not got this for peanuts from HumbleBundle, I'd have returned it already.I'm sure this won't bother most, and it sounds like the game is pretty fun. I hope the game brings many hours of enjoyment to you. Just wanted to put this out there for those few of you it does matter too. Happy gaming!(P.S. It is a silly reason, so I've decided to play it anyway, but the 'thumbs down' remains until the game redeems itself) "

												I downloaded and played this game during the time period where they allowed it to be played for ""Free"". Would I pay 40$ for this game? Absolutely not. Would I pay 30$ for this game? Absolutely not. Would I pay 20$ for this game? Yes. This is based off of roughly 10 hours of play time. FIRST HOUR.The game has a somewhat clunky UI. It doesn't fully teach the player what to do when it comes to building a city or, better yet, maintaining a city properly once you level up a city and begin to expand. I don't care for a game holding my hand throughout but I feel with a game like this, you need to actually teach a player how to get their feet on the ground before thrusting them in the middle of a ""Civilization-esque"" RTS. I had no idea what to do for the first 45 minutes or so and even afterwards still had to sit and think how to do certain actions. Yes, I played through the tutorial. It did not help. Its very basic.CHARACTER/FACTIONS.I played with 3 different characters (roughly 3 hours apiece), 2 premade characters and one custom made ""Aragorn-like"" character that focused on using a bow and buffing his allies. This is where the game shines. Each character and faction is unique and interesting as well as potent if you expand and progress correctly. Creating a character took roughly 10 minutes and was enjoyable through the entire process. One of the things that is very different and seperates this game from others is that your hero levels up and becomes stronger. Skill trees are always a plus. QUESTING.One of the activities you can do in the game is do ""Quest"". Basically your hero walks into an Inn and someone says ""Hey, go across the map and do this. If you succeed, I'll give you something."" Then you do it. It's pretty basic but its something to do and it rewards your hero with neat little items and gear. WOULD I RETURN.I would buy the game (I've already deleted it once it regained the 40$ pricetag), if it dropped in price. I enjoyed the majority of my time and I'd love to go back and see how my character (which was directly based off my Dungeons and Dragons character) dealt with this ominous Black Gate area that was locked off from the rest of the map. This game is a STRONG 7/10. Its fun but it definitely has its problems that taint the total product. At the current price I can't recommend it. Wait for the price to drop or a sale THEN buy it.			"

												I thought this game was cool before it won an award. Well, at least I thought it had potential. At release it was pretty awful, but Stardock went to great lengths to fix it. The game is now a fun 4x with an injection of RPG goodness. The tactical part of combat can get slow while you watch you little guys lurch or waddle through their turns, but it's otherwise a sweet escape. If it goes on sale, buy it and all the DLC, and then set aside a few days of your life so that you may work through your addiction. I felt done with the game after about 100 hours, though there was plenty of content I didn't get to yet.			"

												A very good 4x game that with only 1 issue the items your hero gets useless like 99.9% of the time even with the loot dlc addon. The Storm addon made by Mod is a must have addon as without it the computer players have only like 2 strategies once you know the faction the compurter picked it is way to easy without the storm addon.  A HUGE  FYI never go above moderate monsters and never go with no monsters ( going above moderate is impossible and going with no mosters also makes beating even a lame computer near impossible).

												Nice 4X with a well worked out combat system. I haven't found any game breaking bugs, only my PC crashing, but I recon that's just my PC. A nice unit creator let's really custommise your army to how you want, downside to this is that here arn't very many pre made units and the amount of weapons the limited. Equiping your hero has the same problems, it's nice that you can custommise your hero, but really I came across the same items over and over again. I haven't used the magic system a lot, so I can't give a real recommendation on that front, but from my experience it works well whit the two kinds of spells. Couple downside, one being that there is no Multiplayer, also to me a couple of hours to get the hang of it and a couple of balancing problems. Overall a fun game which your really benefit from some multiplayer.			"

												What Heroes of Mights and Magic IV, V and VI should have been.This game is a great merging of Heroes of Might and Magic III and Masters of Magic, two of the greatest games ever made in turn-based strategy.FE-LH is an addictive highly replayable game, where you can not only create your hero, but also his race or culture before even beginning to play the actual game.I think that FE-LH and Crusader Kings 1 and 2 are among the best games that came out since the year 2000, in all game categories. It is fun, chalenging, you can adjust difficulty level of the game, highly customizable game sessions (excellent tweaks you can do before creating a new game), decent amount of items for your heroes, decent amount of troops and monsters you can recruit, and so on.I highly recommend getting this game. One of the rare games that are worth playing again and again, as well as paying 50$ or less to get.Thumbs up to the designers!			"

												decent game, with really enjoyable early to mid game. Later the game goes the more boring It gets, also when you get dragons the game becomes too easy. The AI was lacking even on normal difficulty for first playthrough. Some Units seem overpowered and the quick combat is atrocius, so the easy battles are time consuming if you dont want to lose your heroes and units. Designing your own units and heroes is fun, with the addition of items and upgrades you can get a godlike army if you dont lose it. Specialization of cities and their levels are nicely done. So if you would give me a choice of recommending this game for when its on sale i would definitivly go for it.			"

												This is all based on playing the free weekend.This game, Is like heroes of might and magic but with the city building side of civilisation. you are free to create your very own custom hero and build them however you want. For example you could have a warrior who grand slams everything into oblivion, or a mage who is a literal glass cannon. But theres more depth to the game, as you play you accumulate ""fame"" which at certain thresholds will give you the choice between two heroes, as you progress into the game, these heroes get more and more powerful to the point where you can get titled heroes such as the dragonborn.Tactical combat makes huge uses of tactics such as flanking and ""swarming"" where you surround units with your own and deal more damage and with a higher hit rate. Units are upgradable and certain units aka minor heroes don't have the same depth of customization as your main heroes but instead level up and gain traits like regular heroes.DRAGONS, DRAGONS, DRAGONS you can get dragons and they are huge and mean.Theres plenty of quest variety as well.Bottom line. If you enjoy games such as heroes of might and magic, civilization and Endless legend, then i highly recommend you give this game a try.			"

												Fun game for those who like games such as Age of Wonders series and Civi series.  The game is mostly like Age of Wonders especially considering that you have a hero/champion to lead each army you create, however, it is also like Civilzation with the aspects of occupying parts of the map as your cities grow.  Another aspect I like is the world monsters such as dragons, I think that is pretty awesome compared to fighting with simple bandits.  It also uses a similar combat system to that of Age of Wonders 3 which requires you to fight in a tactical grid like movement and turns, think Heroes of Might & Magic in this aspect.All in all its a fun game and if you like the ones I mentioned you should certainly pick this one up too, if you haven't played them I recommend those also.

												This game is a blast to play.  It has all the depth that I expect from a Stardock game, yet it isn't unmanageable.  My one complaint is how many times it has crashed on me so far; however, I blame that on my not-quite-up-to-par laptop.  The gameplay is enjoyable and there are many options within the game to help you manage your units and cities without feeling forced to direct EVERY unit.  The quests add great rewards and more things to do than just build and destroy.  The random events, which I did so enjoy in Gal Civ II, add many playback options.  You can craft your own world with its own story, heroes, and lore.  Really, you will get as much out of this game as you're willing to put into it.  I highly recommend this game!			"

												I downloaded and played this game during the time period where they allowed it to be played for ""Free"". Would I pay 40$ for this game? Absolutely not. Would I pay 30$ for this game? Absolutely not. Would I pay 20$ for this game? Yes. This is based off of roughly 10 hours of play time. FIRST HOUR.The game has a somewhat clunky UI. It doesn't fully teach the player what to do when it comes to building a city or, better yet, maintaining a city properly once you level up a city and begin to expand. I don't care for a game holding my hand throughout but I feel with a game like this, you need to actually teach a player how to get their feet on the ground before thrusting them in the middle of a ""Civilization-esque"" RTS. I had no idea what to do for the first 45 minutes or so and even afterwards still had to sit and think how to do certain actions. Yes, I played through the tutorial. It did not help. Its very basic.CHARACTER/FACTIONS.I played with 3 different characters (roughly 3 hours apiece), 2 premade characters and one custom made ""Aragorn-like"" character that focused on using a bow and buffing his allies. This is where the game shines. Each character and faction is unique and interesting as well as potent if you expand and progress correctly. Creating a character took roughly 10 minutes and was enjoyable through the entire process. One of the things that is very different and seperates this game from others is that your hero levels up and becomes stronger. Skill trees are always a plus. QUESTING.One of the activities you can do in the game is do ""Quest"". Basically your hero walks into an Inn and someone says ""Hey, go across the map and do this. If you succeed, I'll give you something."" Then you do it. It's pretty basic but its something to do and it rewards your hero with neat little items and gear. WOULD I RETURN.I would buy the game (I've already deleted it once it regained the 40$ pricetag), if it dropped in price. I enjoyed the majority of my time and I'd love to go back and see how my character (which was directly based off my Dungeons and Dragons character) dealt with this ominous Black Gate area that was locked off from the rest of the map. This game is a STRONG 7/10. Its fun but it definitely has its problems that taint the total product. At the current price I can't recommend it. Wait for the price to drop or a sale THEN buy it.			"

												Solid game, that the work put into it is finally starting to show some polish. The series started off as a complete buggy disaster, but the developers came out and admited to it, and have worked since to have a rather nice product. The game is definitely playable, and has substantially fewer bugs, so if you have played ""Elemental War of Magic"" or Fallen Ehnchantress, you may want to give this game a second chance.Pros:Tons of Cusomization - Customize Factions, Leaders, Units. Polished Skill Tree allows for Leaders and Heros not to get neutured. Cons:Fairly battle orintated.Diplomacy is a MysteryResearch the DLC before you get it.			"

												This game is incredibly buggy and its manual is really badly written, spending much time on irrelevancies, but none on the important stuff. For example, I have no idea how to build roads and while the manual tells you it is important to do, it doesn't explain how to do it. The tutorial is laughably brief and pointless. Also, forget any kind of detail about all the supposedly nifty abilities your armies and champions get. There is a huge ingame ""help"" area, but it is jam packed full of fluff text and says nothing about how do actually do anything. I couldn't even search for roads, or find them listed.Edit: I also can't figure out how to give mounts to companions. I've a bucketload of them, but thre seems to be no way to give them to the heroes that need them the most.Bugwise, there is a constant bug that makes your borders vanish and which requires a restart of the game to fix. This happens every time you try to load up a saved game and is something that the developers have been made aware of ages ago, but chosen not to fix.Also, there are continuous random CTDs, the latest which completely hung my computer and required me to do a reboot of the machine. This game is a definite miss.			"

Nope I was right the first time.True, this game does have some highlights, and it has some endearing qualities, no doubt about it, so it's not all bad.I think the problem is that Stardock simply do not know how to program proper AI into their games. The ai is simply given stacked number bonuses of varying sorts, so that it becomes about beating numbers, rather than any kind of creative/clever/mindful strategy. As such I cannot recommend this game.			"

												I played this game when it first came out. It was buggy but it had a lot of potential. I decided to put it aside for a bit to give them time to fix some of the issues and add content. If you are a fanboy or part of the dev team you will likely disagree with me, but these are my opinions.The Good:-- A lot more content-- You can customize your hero-- Create and design your own troopsThe Bad:-- Gold is not hard to come by but shop prices would bankrupt Saudi Arabia-- When your heroes drop in combat but you win the battle, they are injured. Shops are incredibly hard to come by, the potions, found in shops, to heal your heroes are soo expensive it's better to kill all but 1 of your heroes and use disposable troops. Currently I have 5 heroes, 3 of them have at least 8 injuries, can't be healed. -- Sometimes when you attack a known force they are orders of magnitude more difficult than expected, for no reason, so sometimes when it should be an easy battle you will get wiped and you are not sure why.-- Sometimes when you pick up a quest it will have hidden defenders, and you are wiped. See above.-- Movement is tedious, slow, seems to be done deliberately just to slow down the game. -- The game play is very slow, over 700 turns to study a new magic skill, really ?!?!?The Ugly:-- Bugs. not just in gameplay but also in concept. It's frustrating because the game is there, they just ruined it with poor decisions.			"

												This game has one of the most boring and unhelpful tutorials that I have ever seen. Considering that a good amount of work seems to have gone into constructing it, this is actually kind of astounding. One of the most obvious problems is the very bland narration of the instructional videos that play before each section of the tutorial. Just thinking about that person talking is making me yawn.One more thing, I keep encountering a rather amusing glitch. Every time I start the game up, it pops up an error warning about my monitor resolution, but the resolution it lists is for my secondary monitor. After I close the error box, the game boots up, anyway, and on the correct monitor. It’s almost like the error message exists in it’s own little world, separate from the game’s actual start-up sequence.			"

I love the combat system because unlike the civ games its not really random so you do not have to worry about units that have a stupid amount of defense being killed by some stone age guys with clubs. The only time I have had difficulty with that kind of thing is when I am fighting dragons because they are stupidly powerful(unless its yours then the super powerful thing is not a problem).

												The best game I have played in a while, this game is definately worth the purchase.It is a deep 4x game with many many options to tailor your civilization. You can even individually create new units and choosing their weapons, armor, accesories, skills, traits etc.The game is a must buy for anyone who likes Tactical games and RPGs			"

												It's a lovely game and I would recommend it to anyone who likes games like Civalisation. The camera angels can be a little hard to manage, and it sometimes is a little boring but I would reccomend it to anyone who likes this sort of game. Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is a game that seems like a cross of civalisation and risk, though I don't really like this game much myself, I'm sure others would love it. I got bored of civ5 so when I found this they seemed too similar for me and thus I play less.Though I don't quite like it, It would be well worth the money to get it.			"

												It's a fun turn-based strategy game where there is a lot to manage and take care off. Random event popping up from time to time, getting a plague run rampant through your city, new heroes to lead your armies. And lots of different stuff to build and research.Yesterday I went ahead and attacked a single ghost prowling around an outpost with my strongest ""deadly""-tagged army.  The ghost, even though it was tagged ""weak"" destroyed it with ease. Never would have guessed that! This game has quite a few of these little surprises, I'm loving it so far!Oh, and people who hate creating accounts and complain about DRM, this isn't by far as bad and as annoying as Ubisoft.			"

												Edit 2/22:Having won my first game, I can definately say that the tactical battle system is very good. It's imporved upon, but I'm still somewhat iffy about the use of ranged fighters. Not only can a ranged fighter fling thier projectile clear across the battlefield, but obstructions mean nothing. A company of archer types can launch their volly though what should be completely solid objects. So there is no hiding from these units in the sense of using the environment.I'm on the fence about how fame is used as a gate mechanic for heroes, especially since it's very possible to blow though those gates and get high leveled heroes while your sovereign is either struggling in a remote location, or sitting in a city, busy in the administer role. While the old mechanic did make acquiring heroes a little easier and a lot more frequent, the heroes that you would run into weren't uber-powered without good reason.Something I find bothersome is the water, and that's somewhat a two-fold issue. The first part is that water, aside from rivers and swamps, are untraversable. There is no naval mechanic in the game as it stands. This leads to the second issue; the map. While the game has a basic grid, a hex system leads to more naturally shapped coastline. This means your land looks less boxy when looking at maps. But the major problem with the map is that no matter what, the map is all one continet or a group of subcontinets. Islands don't exist. This means that you will inevitablly come into contact with every rival faction if you haven't been killed already. It's not a case of *IF* as much as *WHEN*.I do like the political parts of the game. The AI isn't as stingy and stupid as it has been in other similar games. If the AI considers you a threat and it has no real way to stand up to you, that dominion will more than likely make contact with you and offer tribute. But sometimes the AI likes to brag about it's research in the most inappropriate ways. Having about 3/4ths of my tech trees completed, one dominion bragged about how it was reclaiming the ancient teachings of archery. I felt like this would be like North Korea bragging to Japan how awesome it is that they have computers that can now use 3.5in floppy disks. I sighed and ignored them, hellbent on fulfilling the requirements for the Spell of Making.--Edit 2/21:After about three hours of fiddling around with files and discovering that the prefs.ini file was not being acquired though the Steam client, I got to play the game as it was intended. As such, this is my honest review.TBS and 4x are a nice combination and I rather enjoy it. However, I think others might have some problems, I know I still kind of do. The AI is crazy difficult, so if you want a truly easy game to understand how to play, you need to set the difficulty to NOVICE, especially if this is your first time playing.I enjoy building armies of custom units, upgrading them accordingly, and rteaching heroes abilities to make them better in my conquests, but the game might get a little slowed with the citybuilding aspect. It can take a while to get a city going, and you really need to know the order in which you shoudl construct buildings before you really get into the nitty-gritty of the game.Combat is both fun and challenging at the same time. The challenge comes from the initiative feature, so it's important to pay close attention to your initiative bar before really doing anything foolish. So you really need to put consideration into timing, building and upgrading units and understanding the mechanics of battle.The storyline is pretty non-existant. The Cataclysm happened and the races are all scrambling about trying to get re-established as dominions. There are two side, Kingdom and Empire and to say either is a good guy or bad guy remains to be seen. It can be rather relative in this game. However being aligned with either of these two ""superfactions"" makes negotiations with the opposing ""superfactions"" a little more difficult because of an inherent mistrust. And just because you;re aligned with one dosen;t mean the other factions will be nice and leave you alone. No, if you're weak, they will smell the blood in the water and crush you just as well as the other side would.So with this said, after the hours long struggle to actually get this game to work, it's really not a bad game. It might be slow for some, but it has a ncie balance of elements that makes it fairly challenging and fun.--OriginalWow, just, wow. This is perhaps the most bugged-out game I have EVER tried. While I like the whole building a town and stuff, the game is bugged. The first problem is that you can't set the options. Second problem is that you can't save. I've been told that I need to access the Prefs.ini files, but those aren't apparent for me to change. There are people who have posted how to fix these difficulties my manipulating that .ini file, but perhaps it's Windows 10 and some compatability issues in which the game does not generate the prefs.ini file? If the game is this difficult in just the technical aspects, there's no way I can even suggest gameplay. If it's like it's orgin game, Elemental: War of Magic, you're totally SOL as that game had ALWAYS spawned all the factions next to each other.But do you realize the frustration of playing a game for 4ish hours, saving to get some sleep, and comming back to find that there is no save data?Another problem, if the game was bundled in the Ultimate Edition, a similar issue happens with fallen Enchantress; the options menu is locked the same way. But to make it worse, you can't zoom in any closer than the cloth map, or else the map is rendered as a grey field.			"

It's sort of like Civilization V with a tactical combat system from Might & Magic, but it just comes off as awful on both counts.If you want a GOOD up-to-date Heroes of Might & Magic-like, then play Age of Wonders III.

												Wonderful game, one of the best TBS games in the genre. Have never had a problem with gameplay such as crashes or problems of that nature. The deep upgrade mechanics and especially the ability to create your own factions and unit in game, that then becomes part of your game to play with as you wish it one of most interesting features of any I've ever played (And since this is my fav genre that means a lot). I will admit that I wont buy any of Stardocks newer titles due to their incorperation of a 34rd party drm, I guess they think they have on the same level as EA and Ubisoft which is NOT an example I would want to follow if they have any sense. Whther they believe it or not, they will lose a lot of sales in  jumping on that bandwagon (A wagon most companies have abandoned due to the reporcussions, as most gamers just are not going to put up with it). Still, THIS game does not incorporate that crap so you are in the clear from that crap. As to the price, this is way too much for ANY game imo, but if ya got the money go for it. If not, wait for a sale of any kind. 20@ or under and it's worth it....the DLC likewise is worth it for the partifular game, so many games have dlc that don't do much, the DLC in this game does add enough to justify buying it.  Over all one of the best games of this genre/atmosphere.			"

												At first impression Fallen Enchantress is, for all intents and purposes, a fantasy-flavored Sid Meier's Civilization V clone. If you enjoyed Sid Meier's Civilization V and you enjoy fantasy elements in games you may well enjoy Fallen Enchantress. If you did not enjoy Sid Meier's Civilization V, or have not played Sid Meier's Civilization V because it didn't look like your kind of thing, or do not enjoy fantasy elements in games, you will probably not enjoy Fallen Enchantress. Personally, I did not enjoy Sid Meier's Civilization V and as such I proceeded not to enjoy Fallen Enchantress for much the same reasons.			"

												There is eseentially no AI at all. There might as well not even be other factions in the game. They do nothing. You can literally stand next to one of thier cities filled with units,  with one unit of ours, and they won't even come out to kill you.They might send a pioneer (non combat unit) to take over your undefended outposts, but that's it. This has got to be the weakest AI I've ever seen in any strategy game to date.It's too bad. The game feels like a pretty good framework for a 4x stratgy game. Really all it is, is you progressing through the tech tree and fighting the romaing monsters for kicks.The combat would be better if it was more tactical. It's grid based, Most units only move 2 squares in tactical combat which annoys you when you are fighting an enemy with archers who will all concentrate fire on your chanpion. You have to load him up with dodge equipment to kill the dumb AI that just sits there shooting you with arrows. They have mounted units that move more squares, but each faction only gets one flavor. You are _forced_ to use those against archers. Makes eveyr fight the same. Send mounted units to archers, and mop up with everything else. The AI always coincentrates fire on your champion, even if a unit on the board is a bigger threat.The unit progression makes one unit completely worthless against another. You pretty much find out what the most OP unit for a given faction is and just crank those out. Not much variety in combat that way. As you tech up, there really is no point in using anything but the best unit available.Some of the roaming monsters are rediculous. They move 5-6x before you even get an action, castin spells that instantly kill everyone. It makes it more of a puzzles to figure out where and how to get units resistant to whatever they cast, rather than a combt.Everything moves 2 squares at a time on the campaign map, making it a real pain the♥♥♥♥♥♥to hunt down all the worthless AI's pioneer spam. You can cast a force march to move 3 squares, but it can only be active on one unit at a time.In summary:The AI sucks hard and there were a few questionable desing decisions. It can be entertaining for a day or two, but it is no masterpiece.			"

Posted: November 30, 2014
												I am simply dumbfounded by the positive reviews for this game.  This game is an ongoing tragedy in what not to do as a game developer.  From the very beginning (in its first incarnation as Elemental: War of Magic) this game was doomed to failure.  From its horrid UI, to it's uninspired gameplay, vintage 1990's graphics, and abysmal balance--the game plays more like a college student's unfinished Unity 3D project than anything else.  How it has garnered fans of any kind is beyond me.I've always enjoyed games such as: Master of Magic, Disciples, Heroes of Might and Magic, and Age of Wonders, so, as a longtime supporter of Stardock/Bred Wardell, I was looking forward to their foray into the realm of Fantasy 4x.  One word sums up my experience:  Disappointment.  For the life of me, I don't understand how a game developer that produced Galactic Civilizations could produce something so unpolished and uninspired like Elemental/Fallen Enchantress.  It's like they didn't even research the genre--they just looked at Master of Magic and said, ""Well, we can do better than that!"".  The only problem with that point of view is that other/better developers had already made better fantasy 4x games, and had been pushing the genre forward for nearly a decade.Fallen Enchantress is a failed attempt at saving an aborted development project, nothing more.  A new development director was hired to rework the UI and add (i.e., ""tack on"") some new features--things like distict races, unique abilites, etc.--things that should have already been part of the initial design--in a desperate attempt to save an already-doomed game.  For some people, this was enough.  Gamers unfamiliar with the fantasy 4x genre liked what they saw, while veterans of the genre just asked the question:  ""Why?  Why try to save this game?  Just let it go already.""There are no bright spots with this game--not when you look around at all of the other, better fantasy 4x games that are out there.  As already mentioned, the main flaw with this game is that Stardock developed it in a vacuum, in isolation, and thought they were doing something monumental.  If this were the 1980s/early 1990s, they might have actually pulled it off.  Unfortunately, this game game out in the 2010+ era of PC games, and, quite frankly, PC gamers deserve better than this lukewarm dalliance with hubris.Also, if you actually compared this game to the Civilization series ..... shame on you.

												Math does not add up.  Opponent cities generate fighters and still build.  Shuts down when you begin to win.  Not a challenge.  Just more bs.  You mfs need to learn how to actually make a game rather than make a bs challenge that isn't even a fair fight.  Giving the game an advantage because it is the game is not programming.  It's ♥♥♥♥♥.  All I have to say.  Otherwise, great concept, great dice. BS on the opposition development unless you're 2 years old and have no concept of actual gaming.  You wanted a real gamers word on your♥♥♥♥♥♥  You got it.  Be happy it wasn't as bad as Shadowrun's.  I wouldn't spend another dollar on that franchise if they payed me to play for them.  This one, though, in comparison to most others of the genre... not too bad.  I still play it, despite the bs.   At least I will til i get sick of having to reload because some proposterous bs of heavy duty fighters in a place I just friggin obliterated gets on my nerves.  You mfs really dont play the bs you produce, do you?  I'm giving a thumb's up because I am hoping you are working of the bs.  If somebody is dead, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, they;re dead.  Next land.  Not, oh, well this group should have another,... ♥♥♥♥ you.  When I kill you mf you don't get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of extra resources.  I wish this game the best.  Though going by the norm, it won't change and the next installment I'll be telling about the exact same bs.  Don't believe me?  Check out any other♥♥♥♥♥♥I've written concerning gameplay and the bs developers do to make the game a challenge because they simply don't spend the time of the ♥♥♥♥ing math.  Build real games or accept the fact that you're just hosing people for the best thing you could put out quickly.			"

												It feels and plays a lot like Civilization with a quest and individual hero system built in. The combat can be automatic outside of quests, like Civilization, or you can choose to battle turn-based style on a grid map (which I suck at in this game). The questing system is unique with this kind of game, and I really enjoy it. I played on easy and felt that the pacing was a little to fast as far as difficulty advancement, but this didn't hinder how fun it was. The quests have stories to go along that may involve getting new equipment, general, or army guys, which makes questing very worth it.I don't really like the tutorials, but as someone who still hasn't done it, I really suggest doing it. I can't seem to figure out how to get ""guild points"" as they don't seem to act the same as in Civilization even though it looks like it came from that game. There are little differences that if you have played or haven't played Civilization, it really makes the tutorial quite appealing.I was disappointed to have so many characters and only about three (way less than half; not even a quarter) were female. However, the female characters that were there had great backgrounds and characters, unlike other games where females are token characters / boring sex symbols.There is no customization except for naming stuff, and the buildings are automatically placed in order that you choose to build them.

 If you are a fan of both Disciple and Sid Meier's Civilization series, then this is your dream.   It's about 65% Disciple and 35% Sid Meier's Civilization nicely combined.  The tactical battle is the same tpye of age of wonders and Disciple. The strategic side is like Heroes of Might and Magic wtih the Civilization tile output (resources) and city management.  The technology tree is a fantasy version of Civilization. However, it has three seperate categories. It's more like Beyond the Earth tech tree rather than Civilization 5 in that sense. Cons: When I said it's 65% of Disciple series, I also mean with its share of bugs and gliches. (well, I guess that's a part of               the Disciple franchise)          The DLCs are weak. I only got one so far. They certainly don't deserve the 4.99 price tag.            I do wish the tactical battle is on bar with the likes of King's bouty and Heroes of Might and Magic, the setting is                     too simple for the long run			"

												Of all my adventure games, this is by far my favorite. I love the graphics and gameplay. But I mostly like the scope. In my opinion, Endless Legend gets far too much hype. THIS is the game that inspired that one and others that came afterwards. The UI may be a bit rough around the edges but that's small potatoes compared to the game's engine. You have stacks of stuff to see, quest to pursue, and enemies to engage. I've never seen a game with so many different foes and characters save Age of Wonders III and the Warlock series. You can play the campaigns and have a wonderful time. But if you play a random map with random enemies and random other stuff, you're in for a real treat. Make sure to add all the DLCs.			"

												This is not a great game, far from it. It has several problems like dumb AI, diplomacy problems, path finding problems, balance problems, battle design problems, UI problems, graphic problems, and some more. Its a mashup game between Civilization and HoMM. It has Settlements, technologies trees, bonus terrains, diplomacy, etc just like Civilization. And it has heroes that can level up, buy equipments, cast spells and group up in a small army just like HoMM. But, because of the problems, its very below those 2 games.Still, its a very addictive game. It has so much potential that let you thinking why the hell Stardock decided to no deliver a more polished game. It could be a 9/10 game if it had done so. But, right now, its more of a 6.5/10 or 7/10 game. Still, Im having so much fun with this game that all the problems, although annoying at times, can easily be bypassed. Im currently with 20hours or so of /played and I think I will double it before unninstalling. And Im only unninstalling it because I have another 60 games or so to play before the 2014 Summer Sale.If you can look past the annoying problems, its a really fun game. But only if you can grab it in a sale. Its not worth the full price, since its not fully done.			"

												Having played this it's pretty dissappointing. It just appears to be a lightly modified and improved version of the last Fallen Enchantress game, unlike the really awesome Endless Legend which has a lot more variety and feel to it. I find that even with the enemy AI being set to easy that they are still a great pain in the♥♥♥♥♥The major improvement they have done with this game is made it so that heroes level up in more complex and interesting ways which works well when you make your own kind of hero, however it doesn't excuse being a seporate game from the origonal, in my opinion.It'd be worth it on a sale as the game itself is rarther fun and great for anyone looking for a fun 4X game, but I'd stick with Endless Legend instead, which has it's own interesting story unfold too.

												Really disappointing.  I would not recommend this game.The gameplay is dull and uninspired, the unit creation is overcomplicated, unit variety is mostly indistinguishable.There are also a host of thematic issues that made playing the game a chore, such as the fog of war being far too dark, and undiscovered regions being black.  In Civilization 5 they use a sort of grey cloudcover to hide unexplored regions, which means that most of the pixels on your screen are bright, but the flat black of Fallen Enchantress casts the entire game in a gloomy light, leaving the whole experience feeling hollow.I wanted to like the game, but when I got the last card I realised how that was the only reason I was continuing to play it.  Just don't bother, there are better games available.			"

												This game would be very awesome if not for a crippling bug.  You use outposts to control land area in the game.  However, if an enemy captures an outpost and you re-capture it, the zone of control will be smaller.  If this happens multiple times, the zone of control will be non-existent.  This bug has been in the game since before the expansion came out.  I stopped playing the first time because of the bug, and I've now uninstalled the game and given up on it because the developers don't seem to care about fixing it.Now, you can just destroy the outpost and rebuild it, but that also means rebuilding all of the addons associated with the outpost, which can get horribly time consuming.If the developer ever gets around to fixing this bug, let me know.  The game would be quite fun if not for that fatal flaw which leads to much frustration.Update 7/26/2016I have asked around to see if the bug is still in place with no response.  I reinstalled the game to give it another shot to see for myself.  While starting up a custom game, I noticed that many of the tooltips in the faction creation no longer work.  Saw other people with the same problem.  Posted about it on the forum.  No feedback for 5 days even though the post has been on the front page for the past 5 days.  Also, there are posts indicating that 2.0 is unplayable for many people.  I have not experienced this, but it seems that it's fairly prevalent.  Seems that things just keep getting worse for this game.  I cannot recommend it.			"

												Boring game.  I dont particularly like Civilization type games but I played Civ5 for 20hrs+  but this game is really boring compared to Civ5, even though I like RPG stuff that Civ5 dont really have... so gameplay is really boring to even spoil that one.  I like turn based games in particular I dont really know why this game is so lousy.Maybe it is the design elements.  The castle building screen is so lousy.  The immersion is lousy.  I guess everything in this game is lousy.  The battles are lousy.  The graphics in the battle is so lousy that I cant understand an old game like Kings Bounty have a better battle screen than this.  And I wanted to really like this game too.I suggest a better game - Eador - Masters of the Broken World.   Many complain because of bugs but its more of the first players that played that game.  But that game rocks and many people who actually complained are playing it for 200-400 hrs+.  Some even for 1000+ hrs.  So that game is worth every cent.  I cant review it here because I got it from GOG, so I just review it here in Fallen Enchantress coz I paid for this game hoping I may find another gem like Eador.. but it failed miserably.			"

												A game that combines two of my favorite genres in gaming? Oh my. This game takes what was once known as Elemental: War of Magic and turns it into a game that truely is worthy of the Stardock label. This game so effortlessly combines the roles of empire making games with Dungeons and Dragons style heroic adventures you would be hard pressed to find a match for this game at any point in the history of video games. The graphics while not the most realistic are equally astounding in their artistic flavor, walls look imposing even from the god pov you are in for the entirety of the game. For instance my capital of Iphidar is surrounded by walls that put the walls of Constantinople to shame.The integration of magic in this game is so well done as to be second nature within five minutes of starting the game, casting city wide spells to boost productivity or city wide curses on your enemies to make their own citizens fight them has never been so easy or satisfying. Magic is litterally everywhere game. The world has stones littered through out it that act as focal points for magic and allow you to cast spels of greater potency or boost your already existing spells. Let us mot forget this is an empire building game as well. The governmental aspects of the game are what I have come to expect froma Stardock 4x game. They are in a word amazing. Extremely user friendly while allowing the player to govern all things a real government does i.e. taxes, building, army raising, ect. The interaction between in game states is simply amazing, the ai programmed for this game so realistically reacts to the players actions I am sometimes hard pressed to not believe there is another person controlling them. My opinion of this game is very high and am glad Stardock was able to rectify the utter disaster that was Elemental with this game and its predecessor Fallen Enchantress. I highly reccomend this game to all lovers of tactical planning and nation building and who have the patience to deal with the pace of turn based games.			"

												Recommended for fans of TBS strategy and 4x games.  It plays similar to a cross between Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic.  It is imperfect but may be the best fantasy 4x game out within the last few years.  Pros and cons listed in DETAIL below if you find them helpful.Pros:-Fun gameplay.  It delivers a quality 4x experience.  -Intuitive mechanics.  If you have played 4x games, you will grasp this game's concepts quickly.-Good tactical combat.  You can make a difference if you take command versus just autoresolve everything.  Tactical combat is not as strong as Heroes of Might and Magic or Age of Wonders 3, but it is a fun and useful part of the game.    -""Tame the land mechanic"".  There are plenty of neutral monsters and quests to make expansion more than an uninteresting early-game land grab.  -Satisfying empire building.  Your cities level just like your heroes, and there are a variety of customizations options for each city.  This is a great mechanic!  Yet city management is streamlined enought that you don't get too bogged down late game with many cities.-Custom units.  You can make your own custom military units with their own characteristics once you've gotten the appropriate research and resoruces.  While more customization options would be nice, it is a very cool and welcome mechanic.   -Minimal waiting in between turns (in contrast to the long waits in Civilization 5).  The AI is thinking about its turn when you are taking yours, so the time it takes to execute their turn is minimal.  This is a big plus.Cons:-Graphics are ugly.  I suppose on the spectrum of 4x graphics, it is somewhere in the middle (with Dominions being ugliest and Civilization/Heroes of Might and Magic/ Age of Wonders 3 being pretty).  -Spells are bland and there are not enough of them.  I was never excited to get access to a new spell.  Spell research is also somewhat confusing - you get spells through a confusing combination of leveling your heroes and through research.  Master of Magic got spells exactly right and I wish more modern games would simply copy and improve on their model.  In MoM, you could make your own towns a paradise (all with nice little spell effects), you could summon awesome units, you could blight an enemy town with pestilence, chaos rifts, etc (all visualized nicely), you could plunge the world into eternal night, and you simply researched each spell individually and intuitively.  FE has fewer and less exciting options.-Hero advancement is similarly bland.  Although there was an extensive list of traits to acquire, I was never excited to gain a new level with my hero because none of the traits were that interesting.  Contrast this to the excellent system in the Heroes of Might and Magic series.  In that series, getting Grandmaster Fire Mage or even Basic Logistics was always exciting because the skills were useful and interesting.  This is not so in FE sadly.   -Not enough fantasy creatures on your side.  You may get about 3 uninteresting summoning spells (only 1 of which is good) that are limited to 1 summoned creature per spell per hero.  So you will not lead a shambling horde of zombies and skeletons or demons like you could in Master of Magic or Dominions.  A few races also have access to 1 fantasy creature that they can recruit directly from towns (and you can even customize, which is cool but really limited).  If you capture the right location on the map or complete a long questline, you may get a dragon (one) as well.  Humanoid troops are nice fodder and need to be there, but they should be 60-70% of your army, not 98% of it.  The reason people want to play this type of game instead of Civilization is specifically FOR the fantasy creatures and the spells!  -Races are bland.  For some reason, Stardock departed from fantasy conventions of men, elves, orcs, dwarves, etc.  Instead, they have races that are elf-like and dwarf-like and orc-like, but they are  more humanoid and less interesting.  Except for a few structures and traits, they all play similarly.  Again I must compare to Master of Magic where each race had its own unique units and tech tree.  Also compare to HoMM 3 or 5 - each race felt unique and played differently.  -Weak, uninteresting quest items.  In spite of a lot of questing, I seemed to only get bland, weak, and uninteresting reward items.  I would always replace them from the shop whenever I researched the right tech.  -Furthermore, there is no mechanic to make your own powerful items.  Master of Magic, Dominions, and to a lesser extent Age of Wonders all got this right.  I should be able to expend considerable magic resources to make a great artifact for my heroes to use.  Whether that's a sword that raises  slain foes as zombie minions, armor that makes the wearer ethereal, a horn that empowers the troops, or a staff that disintegrates the enemy, this mechanic is sorely missing in FE.  -There is little penalty for heroes defeated in combat.  They simply get a tiny permanent debuff (typically of little to no consequence) and respawn the next turn at low health in your nearest town.  While there should be some mechanism to retrieve your fallen sovereign or save your heroes with extraordinary magic, I personally prefer both my heroes and my enemy's heroes to die and stay dead under most circumstances.  Heck, in Dominions not only did dead characters stay dead (albiet with the possibility of resurrection or magical unlife), they could get significant battle wounds even if they survived victorious combat.  In Heroes of Might and Magic, the defeated hero would abandon your cause entirely.                     -Poor optimization.  The game chugged on my old computer to the point of unplayability mid-game.  It still gets a little chunky on my new Alienware hotrod.  For a game with such primitive 3D graphics, that should not happen!Conclusion:  Recommended to fans of the genreThis game is a good, fun empire builder.  As an empire builder, it is better than Age of Wonders III but not quite as good as Civilization 5.  Unfortunately the fantasy elements (spells, hero advancement, fantasy creatures, and races) are quite inferior to games like Master of Magic, Heroes of Might and Magic, Age of Wonders III, and Dominions.  However, the game is greater than the sum of its parts and a good empire builder with (albiet bland) fantasy elements is still a worthy part of a strategy fan's library.  Though I've listed a lot of cons, I really did have a good time with the game.  Its shortcomings didn't bother me until well after I had gotten my money's worth of entertainment.			"

												For those new to the game, try not to get discouraged when the AI destroys you.  I tend to play the default levels first to get a feel for a game, but in this case ""Don't do that""; the odds are against you.  I will agree with others that the AI could use some work, but overall I'm glad I played it.  I don't know if it'll help you, but I noticed a few quests will pay you a lot of money when completed, and I was able to elimiate taxes altogether for many many seasons which added to production and research.

												Awesome design, awesome game, but not 10/10.First problem is ui, optimization and not-intuitive controls.Second problem is a lot of bugs in gameplay.Third problem is tutorial, which helps you to learn how to move mouse, but not how to understand the game mechanicsAnd no campaign is my personal fourth problemOtherwise it has a lot of good sidesVariative heroes and RPG unit system is much more adorable than in Civ5 or in Warlock 1. You can equip every single unit, you can build a mage with sword and chainmail, you can earn legendary artifacts with variable effects and stats.Tactical and strategical figths, magic and solves. It looks like mix of Disciples2 tactical map and civ3 strategical mapDRAGONS!!!11111Mighty quests for epic loots, solve different quests such as kill rats in the house or summon the great fallen dragon to chat.Totally worth it's cost for every 4x\fantasy strategy fans, but too expensive without any special offer for others.My point is 8 out of 10			"

												Note: I find that FE:LH is a good game, many reviews here describe it better than I can. This is merely a note for those who own the first Fallen Enchantress game---If you own the original Fallen Enchantress, I would advise against getting FE:LH. LH is a more polished game, true, but there is really not much difference. The nations, heroes and units are all ported over. The differences to me are not enough to justify the price tag. It's like paying for a DLC or update at the cost of a brand new game.			"

												Still needs some work, which they are doing. There are lots of little crash bugs hidden through-out. All of which have work arounds (mostly). If you can figure out how to play this game for an extended duration without crashing, then this game is awesome. It's pacing and options on approach are varied and meaningful. I've dumped too many hours into this game and I doubt I'll ever leave it alone entirely.			"

												So far, I have to admit the game is fairly addictive and fun. I enjoy the flexability of being able to build out some of the units and the quests. I also like how you can better balance the play. It is like a cross between Civ and Might and Magic heroes, as another person stated. It also does combine the best features of both. I would recommend the game only if you have patience. If you do not like to wait for things to build or are addicted to instant action, then this is not the game for you. However, if your patient and you plan your actions accordingly, the game is very rewarding.			"

Luckily I revisited the game later and found I really liked it.  It is a nice balanced between Heroes of Might and Magic and Civilization.  Don't expect it to be as good as the two other games in their own category; it is a hybrid that managed to do an above-average comparison to both games.  It has great replayability.			"

Epic enounters await in Fallen Enchantress such as Dragons, Necromancers and Elementals in addition to other factions and players.Complete quests to Earn fame, and have Heroes come from across the lands to fight for you and lead your armies, all with thier own skill trees, weapons and armor to gear out.

												First of i played one of the random maps in the New game options. I used abouth 37hoursI Exploring most stuff(butt there is soooooo much :) ) It worked seemingly tottally bug free :) .Then i started the (BUGGY, full of glitches and bad settup) SCENARIO  ... Still recomen the game,, but here are some tips i required after i wasted alott of time..IMPORTANT PLAY TIPS for version 1.60 ;- Avoid heroes you run into til you have discovered both.... ussually 2 to choose from but 1 will often ""Acsidentaly"" be thrown in your group cause you completed random kill a creature quest you did not know abouth or couldent avoid(as they roam and can atack)Then you wil be unable to kick the out of the party and it will block other heroes from joining you later(mather of different opinions and such between heroes)- Wepons and items that poison, steal life, or boost deffence or acumelate damage doesent always work like they shouldso a awesome sword like the Sword of Wrath just is a more normal sword in stead of an awesome life stealer. Pay atention if it works or not,, maybe choose another weapon.- second scenario map when disembarking from boat, click on relias then on land(worked for me). If not you can also try the raise land option on beach(many said this works,,you then need an high level on earth spells in one of your champions)- Also some quests will be buggy and not complete like they should it seems,, but so far i been able to move forward without game shattering have to restart problems(a mather of prefference though,, as i waisted 5 hours to gett a another champion in scenario 1 )- Another play ruining thing is that i think theres way to manny heroes SPOILER ;i gott 9 now(thin k that is maxed) and i dont like all of them, also manny cant be edited with traits,, like already level 10 without traits) befor u can uppgrade.And batles take why to laong an is then unintresing,, i know i will win just gotte make sure my weak units dont run ahead and gett killed....like they do in autobattle.Otherwise amazing game,,, if the issues people are complaining about and the great fixes(maybe not in a practical script making way) would be done it would be a legendary game.Now its on border for me,,, and almost giving upp because of bugs. Still recomend it highly if you like Civilization and HoMM ,,wel this is a unpolished(at some points) mix that i found awesome. Loots of editing posibles that at least in random game seems to work.Keep suporting , they keep working. Recomended at a price tag on or below..  17 $			"

												Fallen Enchantress is an awesome 4X turn-based strategy/sorta-RPG game. One thing that I enjoy about the game is that it’s VERY different from other fantasy 4X games in a number of key ways.First, it takes place many years after the world was devastated by a war of magic – it’s essentially a post-apocalyptic fantasy world. Virtually everything concerning magic and technology had been lost (technology in this case being the standard medieval-level of weaponry and military tactics). You’re leading a rag-tag group of survivors to build your faction’s first city and begin to rebuild. Of course, you were chosen as leader because you are one of the only people remaining who can wield magic.Secondly, there’s none of the standard Orcs, Goblins, Elves, Dwarves, blah blah blah that have become standard fare for fantasy games. The races are all (with the exception of Men) completely original, as are most of the bestiary that pose a constant threat outside of the safety of your cities. However, the game makes all of the new races and creatures easy to understand with a very thorough and easy-to-access online guide that seamlessly integrates lore and story with game mechanics. Want to know what the Trogs can do before you play as them? Just hover over the attribute marker reading TROG BLOOD in the character roster and see their benefits and disadvantages. Got an army of Brood Hunters headed for a city? Just click on the army on the map and click their profile to read all about them and see their stats.Also, virtually everything is customizable. Make new leaders, new factions, new units. Just researched Warg Riding and want to make some cavalry? Just pop into the unit design screen and design them, what armor they wear and what weapons they carry, etc. Just make sure you have a source of Wargs handy – depending on what weaponry and armor you give your units, you may need a variety of resources (metal, horses/Wargs, magic crystal, etc) to create them. These can be found on the map and brought under control of your cities by building on them.All-in-all, it’s a great game that slipped under the radar to a certain extent.			"

												This turn-based 4x game is set in a fantasy world.  The player represents a faction leader who grants special abilities to the race he controls.  The leaders have backstories and special attributes which make picking a leader about more than just selecting a color for your tokens.  The real focus of gameplay are the heroes which level up and gain power over the course of the game.  The game is a bit buggy, but I still love it and I've put in over 400 hours so far.  Probably the best comparison would be Master of Magic or Age of Wonders.			"

												If you remember Master of Magic fondly, this is a great game for you.If you like the idea of heroes slaying monsters, levelling up and leading small armies, this is a great game for you.If you have Fallen Enchantress already, you can upgrade to this on a good sale.Downsides?  No real Single Player campaign. Its all skirmish, all the time. If this is not a problem, this is a great game for you.			"

												A great fantasy 4x game with turn based strategy battles. A lot of customization options and RPG like quests for your characters to go on. The graphics, sound, and UI are all well done. Solid game! If you think you *might* be interested just pick it up! They did a great job with this one!			"

												Nice tweaks from the base game Fallen Enchantress.  This really should have been an expansion instead of calling it a new game though.  I did run into a nasty collision bug that would prevent me from ending my turn and thus halting play.  Spent a good 30 minutes on the forums figuring out how to bypass it.  Other than that - great game.  I particularly like the option to fight turn based in tactical combat rather than the autoresolve die roll that is typical in these Civ-like games.  Definitely would recommend going straight for Legendary Heroes rather than just Fallen Enchantress.			"

												Master of Magic... on steroids. Seriously this is the best contender I have seen for a new version of the classic. The level of customisation of your units is great (eve if a bit redundant as you will tend to go with certain choices every time) especially given sometimes you will have limited access to metal or crystals so you can change you soldiers gear accordingly. I find the mechanic of limiting where you can build cities very annoying but other than that it is a great game!			"

I was lucky and only payed 30 for the game and dlc, which was def worth it.Note to developers-Give the DLC for free, the game isnt worth 40 by itself. Create a expansion pack that adds races [or allows you to create races], allows you to create custome items through magic, adds randomized maps and allows for better deplomacy options.

You can take your hero, recruit more heroes and go on epic quests or just take over the world militarily. You can win by crafting the the most epic spell, win by diplomacy, win by kicking the♥♥♥♥♥♥our of everyone or win by achieving the hardest end quest. I think one of the coolest parts of this game is the ability to create and customize your own army. You can pick what kind of armor and weapons it has, the gender, size. Just a whole lot of options. If you are looking for a game in your library that will keep you entertained for years, pick up this game. It's just fantastic.			"

												This is an excellent combo of empire building and RPG.  I did read previous reviews and I can see the Civ 5 comparison and it is valid, there are similarities with city building & tech trees, but it has the extra dimension of having heroes to find loot, do quests, upgrade weapons, armour and skills and it works brilliantly.  It's not as easy as some reviewers claim (unless you save the game before battles and reload if you lose, which I think takes away the fun) but if you like turn based combat you will love it.  You learn to pick your battles, there are no shortage of heroes so if you lose one its not too bad, they do heal after they 'die' but in the early game it does limit what you can do and you will fall behind your rivals. I do like the fact that, unlike most turn based combat, your armies can have up to 9 units so you have a mix of defensive, ranged and attacking units.  Although set in a Fantasy style world I am avoiding magic (alright I do have a healing spell) and with my second attempt (on default settings) I am  managing to hold my own but not always in the lead. I can see many different ways to win, the maps are randomly generated each time, the difficulty setting is variable, the diplomacy is better than Civ 5 and I am looking forward to many happy hours of game play.   I would recommend a look on YouTube before you buy and if you think you might like it you definately will.  I havent seen a clip yet where they are having as much fun as I am now... 9/10			"

Both competitive and tactical with the capability of a skilled player you can go into a battle with the unit disadvantage and come out on top with unit placement in real time combat.			"

												At the discounted price, this game is a golden opportunity, even for those who aren't addicted to 4x games.  You will get more than $10 of value just playing the scenarios and following the storyline, and there are few games that are as replayable.  Wander aimlessly and explore every dark nook (set world creation to lots of monsters and wildlands), or min/max in your drive to conquer the world (decent AI at the higher levels, and these developers have historically been dedicated to improving the sophistication of their games).  Fantasy, role playing, strategy, exploration--there's something in this blend for just about everyone (heh, unless you are dedicated to twitch gaming).			"

												I bought Elemental when it first came out and well, it was pretty bad. The one thing good about Elemental was the unique gameplay. It was fun. Fallen Enchatress is no different. The interactivity of research unlocking items that you can put on your troops and heroes so they can be better defended and better armed is really neat. Not to mention the level ups of individual units and the new unit upgrade feature. Mana is much easier to manage in this game because it's just a single, empire wide stat. Also, the choice between the two types of empires and their differences is really quite neat. All in all, this is a great strategy game with a heaping of RPG and the partial city system of civilization but not so complicated. REcommended highly.			"

												Having never played any FE games before and jumping straight into this due to a lovely steam sale, I find this game fantastic. It reminds me of Civilisation meets Heroes of Might and Magic plus some more fun stuff.The amount of customisation of races, units and the choice to make your own hero adds an extra personalised edge to the game as you end up caring more about your character and making more tactical desicions. The skill trees allow in general are well done the sometimes feel random and not very benefical most of the time I decide ""ehh i'll take that I suppose""Unlike both Civ and Heroes the combat is well done. I'm not finding it stale or boring and it has the option to auto resolve for those easy battles.Spells seem a bit chaotic and unmanaged but after a while you get used to them.Defienatly recomend this game to Civ, Heroes of Might and Magic, and Galactic Civ fans.

												I recommend it mostly to all who didn't play previous Fallen Enchantress game (legendary heroes brings some changes regarding champion leveling and fame resource). It's basicaly a Civilization meets Age of wonders - utilizing many good aspects from those kind of games without flawing any of them... well except AI - which is terrible at this point. To be more specific You will see many AI glitches which really shouldn't happen in finished product which is more frustrating considering the fact that this game is 3rd installment of the series. But to make long story short...Goodies are- good mix of RPG with Civi like kingdom strategy with tactical battles juiced with skills and spells- great army design system which lets you create your own units using available weapons, enchantments etc. and pack of perks to choose from- overall nice, rewarding gameplay- if anyone played Civilization before it's almost hop in and play type of game with only some minor aspects You have to learn aboutBad- terrible AI aflicting both tactical battles and overall enemy strategies (I played on above average difficulty and sadly AI shown no signs of any strategy at all)- no good tutorial/help book, there's internet but still... remember detailed Civilopedia with every possible aspect of game at least reasonably mentioned and described? Well prepare for big black holes in FELH help book - some ppl might get ofended by graphics quality in army design closeup mode, I mean it's 2013 and again it's 3rd installment of the game c'mooonNote to the producer:Aside from gameplay aspects - marketing/business approach which consists of making minor changes and selling them as another game (Legendary Heroes are infact patched Fallen Enchantress) instead of letting them as update which in fact they are is uncool, very uncool.

												Fallen Enchantress, formerly known as Elemental: War of Magic has come a long way since its shaky release back in 2010. Legendary Heroes is the first expansion to Fallen Enchantress and brings with it a slew of new features, fixes, and content that isn’t going to win over any new fans but dedicated fans will welcome openly. I’m not going to cover the base game, as I will assume you are familiar with the general gameplay of Fallen Enchantress. If you’re green, I’d strongly suggest you catch up and read my initial review of the game. Basically Elemental is a turn based strategy game that balances a role playing game alongside deep empire building. Of course what expansion wouldn’t be complete without new races, monsters, quests, spells, and equipment? The new stuff just keeps piling in and you’ll only discover all of it after you play a couple games. Keep in mind that Fallen Enchantress is a day killer, where you will suffer from ‘just one more turn’ until it is 3AM. It’s refreshing to see that Stardock has put a ton of thought into new content for the game, and even after dozens of hours I still haven’t even scratched the surface. Maybe it’s due to the fact that they also added a new map size - “huge”. This lets you play longer, more epic games where you are commanding armies across vast landscapes. There is so much to Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes that it is really tough to describe, especially since it kind of mashes several genres together. I can say that you won’t be disappointed with the changes they have made and the content they have added. Personally I’m used to Stardock games evolving as I play them, so Legendary Heroes is a welcome addition to the Elemental stable. The expansion makes it look better, feel more organic, and balances the whole experience for the player. If you’re one of those people who bought Fallen Enchantress on a Steam sale and are looking for a reason to actually play the game, look no further - grab Legendary Heroes and carve out an afternoon to really sink your teeth into the game. If you felt burned by Elemental and the lackluster release a couple years ago, I urge you to get back on the horse and ride this bad boy into the sunset because Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes proves that Stardock isn’t giving up on this game.

Civ-like map movements and town control, very HoMM-like combat and Champion/Item system...A number of things could be better, mostly in the combat screen as you can't check what a specific enemy unit has for modifiers until it's their turn, and in general the UI could be a bit more informative.Not bad though. A middle-ground between the two giants that are Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic.			"

												I bought this game looking for a fantasy turn based strategy game. I use to really like playing age of wonders shadow magic, and this game seemed to kind of resemble it. So I went ahead and bought it, well to my surprise I found this game to both be well polished and very fun to play. Combat- you have the option of auto-resolve which I find to be good when you know you are unlikely to lose a unit.There is also the option of doing the battle yourself, which is what I normally do ( it seems when you auto-resolve they don't use your units abilities). The game loosely reminds me of civilization, you have 3 trees that you can choose from to develop via research,civilization, warfare, and magic. Each has its own benefits, and so it's sometimes tough choice as to which one to develop first.I don't do reviews so it's pretty short and to the point, but overall I would give this game a solid 8.5 for the Turn Based Stragey game class.

												Decent fantasy 4x game with lots of replay value. Some of the factions don't feel as distinct as others, but you can create your own faction and starting heroes so it's a good compromise. The magic enhances the game quite a bit, manually designing your units doesn't feel as deep as Galactic Civ games, but it still plays an important strategic role.Overally, I feel like I had a lot of fun with this game, spent quite a lot of time on it, and played almost every faction. I'll try some of the dlcs just to see, but definitely a good pick-up if it goes on sale. Was worth the few bucks I dropped on it, and still more interesting than Beyond Earth as a 4x game.			"

												This game has a great concept. Despite its mid-90s graphics, the mix of strategy and RPG, the way you can customize your heroes and your units, the interesting quests and monsters - all of that is timeless and shines in spite of the graphics. HOWEVER - I cannot recommend this game because of how incredibly buggy and poorly polished it is. This game takes more RAM and CPU resources than games far more technologically advanced (i.e. Civ 5, XCOM, Endless Space). It crashes every 3-5 turns. It often freezes during a battle, and reloading a prior save doesn't help. Lastly, reloading saves reliably crashes the game on my computer, and again, I run far more advanced games than this with no problems. I've asked the developer for support and troubleshooting and it never helped. Unlike other games that started out buggy but was fixed and smoothed with patches (i.e. Divinity Original Sin), this game has essentially been abandoned by its developers and I have not seen any fixes for years. What could have been a great game has been ruined by bugs.			"

												This game is not without problems. It still has bugs and AI is still stupid. Most importantly, the maps are still squarish and ugly.But, Stardock in their usual manner still continues to develop this game. There is a pre-made maps DLC, which makes a huge difference. Also, they have tried something new - and I must say, some of these new things I like. I am not overly fond of art style but the game as it is now is enjoyable. It is no Master of Magic, but it is not bad either. I can see myself giving it a whirl from time to time. Also, diplomacy is not bad (definitely much better than some other games, e.g. Endless series).I would really like at this point though if Stardock developed an incremental sequel to this instead of dubious Sorcerer King title.

												Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is an immersive fantasy themed strategy game and a significant improvement over the earlier Elemental: Fallen Enchantress version. I’ve been a fan of sword and sorcery based 4x titles since SimTex Software cranked out their classic Masters of Magic in 1994. Putting this game on an “enjoyment continuum” of recent titles, I’d place it a notch behind Age of Wonders III, on a par with Endless Legends and well ahead of Worlds of Magic.The interface is mostly intuitive and a few minutes with the tutorial will allow even 4x novices to jump into the game and learn the finer nuances as they play. The RPG elements are well-integrated and detailed enough to give gameplay a coherent narrative. The visuals are a mixed bag with the locales and topography offering a nice board game vibe but the character art coming off as an unsatisfying derivative of 90’s manga. The sounds and music are neither annoying nor memorable. I have not encountered any performance problems running the game on a two-year-old computer with a 3.4 GHZ Intel processor, 12GB RAM and an NVIDIA GT640 video card.It’s a full price title made all the more sweet if you can bag it on sale.

												A solid and interesting game in the vein of Master of Magic and Age of Wonders.It is not as innovative as those legends were in the their decades... nor does it show the polish and balance of an industry leading game after many years of expensive refinement.But despite that, it is smooth, and pretty, a joy to play and an excitement to discover.I think it clearly falls into the category of an ALMOST industry leading title, after many years of careful, if fiscally conservative refinement... worth every penny and hour you'll spend on it.

												I got this game for 10$ cad on sale, and for that price it no doubt good.  The game does get repetitive and the AI is not good at all.  You can simply turtle through the game even on the 2nd highest difficulty. I haven't bothered with the highest difficulty yet, but I'm sure it is the same because the AI simply gets more resource boosts.  The devs also seem to have a habit of rehashing their games a lot, this being the 3rd iteration of Elemental.  I have not played Elemental or Fallen Enchantress, but I have read that they are almost the same as FE: Legendary Heroes.  I got this game at 75% so I was not disappointed, at 10$ there is still ample play and it is a good deal, but in the long run I would rather play Master of Magic, which seemed to have a bit more depth and more variety of creatures and magic. Edit: This game is no where near as good as Age of Wonders III. I will still leave a positive recommendation because I got this game for 10$ on sale, and because they game isn't completely horrible.  The ai  never seems to try and attack and that is the biggest problem with this game.			"

												I am a novice in the 4X genre. I first played a Civilization game (Call to Power) 15 years ago, but haven't explored the genre much since. As such, I cannot confidently speak to if Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes meets/exceeds the expectations of fully initiated fans of games like these, or how it compares to any other benchmark titles in the genre's history. All I can say is that I love this game, and I am definitely going to be looking for more games of this genre.   I love the fantasy medieval styling, and the gameplay (magic mechanics, designing units, outposts, diplomacy, empire-mangement, heroes, quests, etc) are all really interesting.   Can't wait to see more content for this game. Sequels, expansions? "

I was lucky and only payed 30 for the game and dlc, which was def worth it.Note to developers-Give the DLC for free, the game isnt worth 40 by itself. Create a expansion pack that adds races [or allows you to create races], allows you to create custome items through magic, adds randomized maps and allows for better deplomacy options. [Like trading/offering citys, spells, units?]			"

												This is the Exp to Fallen Enchantress and in my opinion a needed element to the original game. Not only does it add two new races (Humans: Capitarians-Merchants, Fallen: Urxen- Ind Armies) and a new leveling system for all the heroes, along with more monsters, and magic to cast into the world. For anyone not familiar with Fallen Enchantress, it is a TBS 4x game with generals who level up similar to a RPG system. The strength of your empire and random encounters determine how many heroes you have to help lead your army. Anyone who likes RPG's and city builders, should try Fallen Enchantress, and this DLC will add a lot of richness to the orginal game's experience.			"

												So far, I have to admit the game is fairly addictive and fun. I enjoy the flexability of being able to build out some of the units and the quests. I also like how you can better balance the play. It is like a cross between Civ and Might and Magic heroes, as another person stated. It also does combine the best features of both. I would recommend the game only if you have patience. If you do not like to wait for things to build or are addicted to instant action, then this is not the game for you. However, if your patient and you plan your actions accordingly, the game is very rewarding.			"

												With huge, randomized worlds, completely customizable units and factions, lots of monsters to fight, interesting quests, and tons of items, this game showcases some of the best turn-based strategy I have ever seen, let alone from a roleplaying fantasy game.  The overworld plays like a fantasy-themed Civilization IV and the turn-based tactical battles have many of the best features of Heros of Might & Magic or King's Bounty.  Most of the interesting strategy is in the overworld and how you design and build your units, but there's a lot to like here if strategy is your cup of tea.			"

												Let me get this straight right away, I like this game, it is a deep and interesting title which has massive replayability and fun unit design. However it is somewhat buggy and lacks many diplomacy options which we see in other games.Lets start with the pro's:Fun and interesting combatGood variety of unitsUNIT CUSTOMISATION - I LOVE THISinteresting hero systemNice animations in diplomacy scenesReasonably polished gameFun questing system that you don't see in many similar gamesNice faction creationNice sovereign creationNice spells which can be cast both in and out of combatCon'squite buggy - however they have patched several of the bugs recentlySometimes in combat UI it is unclear which unit you are controllingSomewhat irrational AI opponentsLimited diplomacy options - can't sell cities and treaties are limitedSometimes the enemy can gain a massive boost in power for no apparent reasonVery similar to other fantasy strategy gamesLimited number of quests from what I've seen - I've seen the same quests on different levelsConclusion:I really enjoy this game, it has fun combat, decent AI and enjoyable strategy elements however the bugs are a massive pain and the diplomacy options - or lack thereof - are very annoying.

You can equip every single unit, you can build a mage with sword and chainmail, you can earn legendary artifacts with variable effects and stats.Tactical and strategical figths, magic and solves. It looks like mix of Disciples2 tactical map and civ3 strategical mapDRAGONS!!!11111Mighty quests for epic loots, solve different quests such as kill rats in the house or summon the great fallen dragon to chat.Totally worth it's cost for every 4x\fantasy strategy fans, but too expensive without any special offer for others.My point is 8 out of 10			"

												For those new to the game, try not to get discouraged when the AI destroys you.  I tend to play the default levels first to get a feel for a game, but in this case ""Don't do that""; the odds are against you.  I will agree with others that the AI could use some work, but overall I'm glad I played it.  I don't know if it'll help you, but I noticed a few quests will pay you a lot of money when completed, and I was able to elimiate taxes altogether for many many seasons which added to production and research.

												Score: 87Concept: Civilization Style Fantasy GamePros: Very Technical, High Functionality, Tons of Features, Very Cool WorldCons: Tired Graphics, Wanted Bigger MapsEvery Single time I see a ""Civ clone"" I'm intrigued and have to try it out. But make no mistake this game is no Civ clone. It has the formula that Civilization has, but manages to completely make a new, fresh, and original game. Also, this game is definitely NOT Warlock, which(I love) IS a Civ clone. Anyways, to rewind a bit, Fallen Enchantress has been out on Steam for over a year at this point. I've been waiting for some sort of commentary on it and nothing. I has a Metascore of 80, which isn't bad, but I'm not investing $40 in a wild card. Well I knicked it in the Steam Summer Sale for $7.49 and after several hours am proud to say its worth the full price. This is a game that I will be playing for years to come until a sequel is released.Right off the bat I found myself comparing it to the hallmark in this style of gaming. And for the life of me I was finding loads of features in this game THAT SHOULD BE STANDARD. For example, when you research new technologies and unlock new equipment you can either use the default units that are created or... you can MAKE YOU OWN UNITS. This is one of the coolest features I've ever seen. You can customize virtually everything. Sure there are the cosmetic customizations, but you will spend so much time making the perfect hero, unit, army, and city. Oh, this is cool, you can specialize your city as you level up. Do you want it to be a military city? How about a research enclave? Or how about just a standard town?the game has eliminated worker units so everything that they would do, now you the player can do by hand. This is such a relief. I hated having a dozen workers take forever to build a road from city A to city B. In Civ it can take ten to fifteen seconds to load each turn because there are so many units on the board that the game has to move, in a game with thousands of turns you can spend hours just waiting. That problem is gone with Fallen Enchantress as there are far less units on the map.The game does a great deal more. You have quests, and monsters, magic, and more. The part of the game that gets a bit tired might be the combat. When you get into combat with an enemy it takes you down to the field and you play out the battle. I like this. However, I died so much. And if you get dragged into a battle that is clearly over your head you have to play out losing unless you have the flee 'skill'. In this respect it will start to feel like Fire Emblem. If I lose one of my heroes, I'll quit the game and restart from a previous save point. Sound familiar?Second Look: For those of you that don't really play this genre I don't really see too many picking this up. It may interest you if you like a good fantasy game, but it's complexities would turn away most people new to this genre. Where one person might see a game full of ways to control the flow of the game, another person might see a game bogged down with too many mechanics that get in the way of the core game.			"

												I bought this game looking for a fantasy turn based strategy game. I use to really like playing age of wonders shadow magic, and this game seemed to kind of resemble it. So I went ahead and bought it, well to my surprise I found this game to both be well polished and very fun to play. Combat- you have the option of auto-resolve which I find to be good when you know you are unlikely to lose a unit.There is also the option of doing the battle yourself, which is what I normally do ( it seems when you auto-resolve they don't use your units abilities). The game loosely reminds me of civilization, you have 3 trees that you can choose from to develop via research,civilization, warfare, and magic. Each has its own benefits, and so it's sometimes tough choice as to which one to develop first.I don't do reviews so it's pretty short and to the point, but overall I would give this game a solid 8.5 for the Turn Based Stragey game class.

												A good strategy game. A game which starts out as a light rpg and then turns into Civilization on steroids. Elemental is a world that any strategy fan should visit at least once. And the higher difficulty levels will surely teach some humility to any hardcore gamer.			"

												Having never played any FE games before and jumping straight into this due to a lovely steam sale, I find this game fantastic. It reminds me of Civilisation meets Heroes of Might and Magic plus some more fun stuff.The amount of customisation of races, units and the choice to make your own hero adds an extra personalised edge to the game as you end up caring more about your character and making more tactical desicions. The skill trees allow in general are well done the sometimes feel random and not very benefical most of the time I decide ""ehh i'll take that I suppose""Unlike both Civ and Heroes the combat is well done. I'm not finding it stale or boring and it has the option to auto resolve for those easy battles.Spells seem a bit chaotic and unmanaged but after a while you get used to them.Defienatly recomend this game to Civ, Heroes of Might and Magic, and Galactic Civ fans.

												Played this for about 20 hours and lost interest.  Its like a fantasy CIV5 with kinda heroes theme to it.  Doesn't really get the equation right for something that is lasting.  This might be because I'm not a huge fantasy guy but its cool.  Not a terrible game and has some annoying bugs.  This game could have benefitted greatly from some more time in alpha and beta.  Dunno, can't put my finger on it but it was good but just barely.  Could have been better.  Liked the tactical component of the battles though.  Just didn't seem to completely flesh out.  Decend enough title for 10$ or less.My Score: 5/10			"

It is surprisingly well balanced in terms of strategy and tactics, civilization building and RPG TBS combat. There are only two downsides to this game: it's not multiplayer, and the AI past 'Expert' needs to some work. Otherwise, I can never get tired of playing this game :)			"

												A mix of CIV and Heroes of Might and Magic. The maps can be enormous and will take you 20+ hours to complete. There are also smaller maps that, of course, are much less time intensive.With a mix of empire building, research, resource management (yes, you can run out of iron to build those awesome units, but so can the ai) mixed with RPG leveling of your sovereign and champions, there is a lot you can do. That said, the pace can be slow. You have options on the customization of creating a world, but I kind of like the slower pace as my units are not obsolete in 10 turns. Research basically allows you to upgrade armor, weapons, etc. of basic units. Not like CIV where you have spearmen, pikemen, etc. They are essentially the same, with different buffs. You can give them fire resitent cloaks, magic necklaces etc. However, it will cost you more in resources. In a strange twist, it is more expensive to buy things for your heroes! The AI is pretty decent, but not that good at measuring army strengths and weaknesses. This can lead the AI to wasting expensive troops against their counters. Afterwords, you can mop them up as they have little armor.Overall, it is engaging and does have that ""one more turn"" thing. It deserves an 8 of 10.  "

												At the discounted price, this game is a golden opportunity, even for those who aren't addicted to 4x games.  You will get more than $10 of value just playing the scenarios and following the storyline, and there are few games that are as replayable.  Wander aimlessly and explore every dark nook (set world creation to lots of monsters and wildlands), or min/max in your drive to conquer the world (decent AI at the higher levels, and these developers have historically been dedicated to improving the sophistication of their games).  Fantasy, role playing, strategy, exploration--there's something in this blend for just about everyone (heh, unless you are dedicated to twitch gaming).			"

With a wide variety in playing styles and customizations available it adds both a story line to premade hero factions and almost infinite possible to creating your own faction. This is more than just a game of conquering a broken land but if you listen there are clear quest lines and plots to be found. Both competitive and tactical with the capability of a skilled player you can go into a battle with the unit disadvantage and come out on top with unit placement in real time combat.			"

												I recommend it mostly to all who didn't play previous Fallen Enchantress game (legendary heroes brings some changes regarding champion leveling and fame resource). It's basicaly a Civilization meets Age of wonders - utilizing many good aspects from those kind of games without flawing any of them... well except AI - which is terrible at this point. To be more specific You will see many AI glitches which really shouldn't happen in finished product which is more frustrating considering the fact that this game is 3rd installment of the series. But to make long story short...Goodies are- good mix of RPG with Civi like kingdom strategy with tactical battles juiced with skills and spells- great army design system which lets you create your own units using available weapons, enchantments etc. and pack of perks to choose from- overall nice, rewarding gameplay- if anyone played Civilization before it's almost hop in and play type of game with only some minor aspects You have to learn aboutBad- terrible AI aflicting both tactical battles and overall enemy strategies (I played on above average difficulty and sadly AI shown no signs of any strategy at all)- no good tutorial/help book, there's internet but still... remember detailed Civilopedia with every possible aspect of game at least reasonably mentioned and described? Well prepare for big black holes in FELH help book - some ppl might get ofended by graphics quality in army design closeup mode, I mean it's 2013 and again it's 3rd installment of the game c'mooonNote to the producer:Aside from gameplay aspects - marketing/business approach which consists of making minor changes and selling them as another game (Legendary Heroes are infact patched Fallen Enchantress) instead of letting them as update which in fact they are is uncool, very uncool.

												Turn-based strategy RPG like civilization, but with emphasis on your unique characters in game.  Multiple ways to win, again like civ, each faction having clear paths theyre built for.  Allows for easy custom factions and custom units as well, with a few mods that expands even further.  Love this game, most of my time logged was offline unforunately or I'd probably have ""completed"" it by now.  Even with all the time spent it's still something I come back to periodically, which to me is the sign of a good game.			"

												UPdate: After playing Warlock 2 and AOW 3 I must say that FA:LH is a better game overall than both of them. HOwever, I really do prefer the tactical combat of AOW3 better and I like the troops of W2 a lot also. It's just that overall FA:LH is a better complete 4x package than both of them. Great game overall. Really cool units and hero system. More like AOW2 and HM&M than Civ. I really like the limited city building that prevents city spamming. At times can get a little slow while you are waiting to build up an army and the music does not help this. Diplomacy is pretty good with what you can do for trades. AI is not too bad. Biggest complaint is lack of custom maps/good map editor and lack of workshop intergration for new content.DLC is fairly weak so be careful before you get it.			"

												Master of Magic... on steroids. Seriously this is the best contender I have seen for a new version of the classic. The level of customisation of your units is great (eve if a bit redundant as you will tend to go with certain choices every time) especially given sometimes you will have limited access to metal or crystals so you can change you soldiers gear accordingly. I find the mechanic of limiting where you can build cities very annoying but other than that it is a great game!			"

												Mmmm, a little on the fence with this one.  If I would give it a number on 10, I would give it a 6.  Although I like it, this game could have been awesome if the bugs had been fixed and it had been optimized.  Here is a description:Bugs: Through my 14 hour playthrough, I had two crash to desktops.  Also had a game breaking bug that I had to work around during a battle.  An enemy warlock would try to summon a creature that would never appear.  Reloading the game 3 times did not resolve it.  The game would just sit there, with nothing happening for 3min before I closed it through windows.  The only way I could fix this was to try to kill the warlock before he tried to summon his creature.  Worked fine after but that's not normal.Performance:  This was the most nagging aspect of the game and what I believe soured my experience.  On a normal map, the scrolling would not be fluid and clicks felt laggy.  It doesn't make sense that my computer would struggle with this game.  See, I have an 3ghz i7 processor with 6gigs of ram and a GTX670.  Civilization 5 works perfectly fine and runs a millions times better than this game.  Civ5 is a much more beautiful, bigger and CPU/GPU intensive game than Fallen Enchantress.Gameplay: So is the game fun?  Yes, it is.  It reminds me of an old Magic game by Microprose back in the old dos days of computers.  It is a mix of Civilisation where you create cities, build and manage them while you conquer the world in a way that best fits your style.  And then battle enemies with your armies of heroes and units that gain experience and level on a grid battlefield a little like Might and Magic: Heroes, but better since good unit placement is actually important. Graphics: They are subpar at best by this day and age.  I thought the textures looked dull and certain equipment items for your heroes were blurry and I sometimes could barely make out what they were just by looking.Audio:  I thought that the audio was good, nothing stood out here.  The music was fine, not excellent.Can I recommend it?  Yes.  Although I can't help but think what this game could have been.  A classic if the studio would have spent a little more time polishing it.Would I have played longer than 14 hours if the experience was better?  Completely!			"

												If you like Civilization then gvie this game a go. If you also like  King's Bounty or Heroes of Might and Magic, then you will love this. Quests, heroes with skill trees, customizable  units, tactical battle screen, all in a fanstasy themed Civilization game.			"

												Like Civ 5? Like Fanatsy? THEN YOU MUST BUY THIS GAME! Great addition to the Civ genre, with a fantasy twist. Deep research trees, settling, city expansion and city management, combined with Fantasy RPG elements. Unlike Civ, you must contend with more than pesky club weilding wild men. Epic enounters await in Fallen Enchantress such as Dragons, Necromancers and Elementals in addition to other factions and players.Complete quests to Earn fame, and have Heroes come from across the lands to fight for you and lead your armies, all with thier own skill trees, weapons and armor to gear out. Research powerful enchantments to protect your city and devastating magic to slay your foes! "

												Really good game if your into turn based strategy(Which i am). I would compare to Civilisation crossed with Heroes of Might and Magic with some of the better bits of each. I give it 9 out of 10 (would be 10 if it had multiplayer which isn't ridiculously important but would be nice). great game!			"

												Great game from a great company, probably the most innovative strategy game currently on the market. A must have for any strategy or fantasy fans. Made by the creators of the Galactic Empire series. First in series (Elemental: War of Magic) was not well received, instead of simply cutting their losses, company rebuilt the game to be much improved and gave supporters of first game free or discounted copies. This company's integrity and dedication deserves to be rewarded.			"

												Fantastic combination of civilization building and RPG. By directing controlling your immortal soveriegn as your kingdom grows you feel more invested than your usual civ game. Every game is epic, especially on the larger maps. Great replayability!Classes, factions, awesome recruits, unit building, treasures to discovery, titans and lesser monsters to conquer! I highly recommend this game!			"

Magic, Armies, Bulding, and Monsters!? TLDR: Nice Game for those who like Strategy and pretending they are incharge of an Area and if skilled enough, make allies, enemies, Declare War...Propose Treaties, gain fame and even a pet C: Let's start this of quickly...Tried it for the  free weekend and it is an AMAZING game. ( Granted i spent like 3 hours preparing only to wrecked cause i couldn't save enough Glidar and Mass produce my Armies cause i suck and Game over for me )With that being said...You MUST have a great knowledge about this game to understand what your doing ( I thought i was MLG  and skipped the tutorial only to just sit there and click around asking where is my MP7 :C..COD joke w/e.) I did the tutorial and it was more simple then i was OK I GOT THIS. After a few mins of customization ( prob like 30-45 Mins due to all the options ) I picked the Map layout ( even more options ) and enemies  ( Even MORE options ) or Allies ( depends how you treat them ) In Game; Fast Paced and A Quick Thinker to know what your doing indeed. As i was playing i didn't know what to do but after like 2 Hours...i started understanding it BUT THEM BOOM i got declared war on T.T and Game Over.Main Point: Make a Character...Settle on a land, Research and Build Cities and then repeat Research and Cities.THE BAD- There were some annoyances to me as i never played games like this for NEW players who don't have the understanding of a game today will call it repetitive as the only thing you is Research and Build Cities and Do Quest.Other then that nice game over all... btw Small Map = 9/10 IGN To Much Water			"

												This is like Civilization with trolls, dragons and old gods instead of cavemen and animals as wandering monsters - magic instead of technology - but the same just-one-more-turn addictive qualities. The previous version had many faults, but this one is maybe as good as the best civs. Fantastic game!			"

												Recommended for fans of TBS strategy and 4x games.  It plays similar to a cross between Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic.  It is imperfect but may be the best fantasy 4x game out within the last few years.  Pros and cons listed in DETAIL below if you find them helpful.Pros:-Fun gameplay.  It delivers a quality 4x experience.  -Intuitive mechanics.  If you have played 4x games, you will grasp this game's concepts quickly.-Good tactical combat.  You can make a difference if you take command versus just autoresolve everything.  Tactical combat is not as strong as Heroes of Might and Magic or Age of Wonders 3, but it is a fun and useful part of the game.    -""Tame the land mechanic"".  There are plenty of neutral monsters and quests to make expansion more than an uninteresting early-game land grab.  -Satisfying empire building.  Your cities level just like your heroes, and there are a variety of customizations options for each city.  This is a great mechanic!  Yet city management is streamlined enought that you don't get too bogged down late game with many cities.-Custom units.  You can make your own custom military units with their own characteristics once you've gotten the appropriate research and resoruces.  While more customization options would be nice, it is a very cool and welcome mechanic.   -Minimal waiting in between turns (in contrast to the long waits in Civilization 5).  The AI is thinking about its turn when you are taking yours, so the time it takes to execute their turn is minimal.  This is a big plus.Cons:-Graphics are ugly.  I suppose on the spectrum of 4x graphics, it is somewhere in the middle (with Dominions being ugliest and Civilization/Heroes of Might and Magic/ Age of Wonders 3 being pretty).  -Spells are bland and there are not enough of them.  I was never excited to get access to a new spell.  Spell research is also somewhat confusing - you get spells through a confusing combination of leveling your heroes and through research.  Master of Magic got spells exactly right and I wish more modern games would simply copy and improve on their model.  In MoM, you could make your own towns a paradise (all with nice little spell effects), you could summon awesome units, you could blight an enemy town with pestilence, chaos rifts, etc (all visualized nicely), you could plunge the world into eternal night, and you simply researched each spell individually and intuitively.  FE has fewer and less exciting options.-Hero advancement is similarly bland.  Although there was an extensive list of traits to acquire, I was never excited to gain a new level with my hero because none of the traits were that interesting.  Contrast this to the excellent system in the Heroes of Might and Magic series.  In that series, getting Grandmaster Fire Mage or even Basic Logistics was always exciting because the skills were useful and interesting.  This is not so in FE sadly.   -Not enough fantasy creatures on your side.  You may get about 3 uninteresting summoning spells (only 1 of which is good) that are limited to 1 summoned creature per spell per hero.  So you will not lead a shambling horde of zombies and skeletons or demons like you could in Master of Magic or Dominions.  A few races also have access to 1 fantasy creature that they can recruit directly from towns (and you can even customize, which is cool but really limited).  If you capture the right location on the map or complete a long questline, you may get a dragon (one) as well.  Humanoid troops are nice fodder and need to be there, but they should be 60-70% of your army, not 98% of it.  The reason people want to play this type of game instead of Civilization is specifically FOR the fantasy creatures and the spells!  -Races are bland.  For some reason, Stardock departed from fantasy conventions of men, elves, orcs, dwarves, etc.  Instead, they have races that are elf-like and dwarf-like and orc-like, but they are  more humanoid and less interesting.  Except for a few structures and traits, they all play similarly.  Again I must compare to Master of Magic where each race had its own unique units and tech tree.  Also compare to HoMM 3 or 5 - each race felt unique and played differently.  -Weak, uninteresting quest items.  In spite of a lot of questing, I seemed to only get bland, weak, and uninteresting reward items.  I would always replace them from the shop whenever I researched the right tech.  -Furthermore, there is no mechanic to make your own powerful items.  Master of Magic, Dominions, and to a lesser extent Age of Wonders all got this right.  I should be able to expend considerable magic resources to make a great artifact for my heroes to use.  Whether that's a sword that raises  slain foes as zombie minions, armor that makes the wearer ethereal, a horn that empowers the troops, or a staff that disintegrates the enemy, this mechanic is sorely missing in FE.  -There is little penalty for heroes defeated in combat.  They simply get a tiny permanent debuff (typically of little to no consequence) and respawn the next turn at low health in your nearest town.  While there should be some mechanism to retrieve your fallen sovereign or save your heroes with extraordinary magic, I personally prefer both my heroes and my enemy's heroes to die and stay dead under most circumstances.  Heck, in Dominions not only did dead characters stay dead (albiet with the possibility of resurrection or magical unlife), they could get significant battle wounds even if they survived victorious combat.  In Heroes of Might and Magic, the defeated hero would abandon your cause entirely.                     -Poor optimization.  The game chugged on my old computer to the point of unplayability mid-game.  It still gets a little chunky on my new Alienware hotrod.  For a game with such primitive 3D graphics, that should not happen!Conclusion:  Recommended to fans of the genreThis game is a good, fun empire builder.  As an empire builder, it is better than Age of Wonders III but not quite as good as Civilization 5.  Unfortunately the fantasy elements (spells, hero advancement, fantasy creatures, and races) are quite inferior to games like Master of Magic, Heroes of Might and Magic, Age of Wonders III, and Dominions.  However, the game is greater than the sum of its parts and a good empire builder with (albiet bland) fantasy elements is still a worthy part of a strategy fan's library.  Though I've listed a lot of cons, I really did have a good time with the game.  Its shortcomings didn't bother me until well after I had gotten my money's worth of entertainment.			"

												This turn-based 4x game is set in a fantasy world.  The player represents a faction leader who grants special abilities to the race he controls.  The leaders have backstories and special attributes which make picking a leader about more than just selecting a color for your tokens.  The real focus of gameplay are the heroes which level up and gain power over the course of the game.  The game is a bit buggy, but I still love it and I've put in over 400 hours so far.  Probably the best comparison would be Master of Magic or Age of Wonders.			"

												In my book, this game runs a very close second to Disciples 2 - right up until we start talking about the custom factions, unit designer, and all the other design tools built in. I haven't had the time or patience to monkey with anything besides the Cartographer's Table (Map Editor), but holy Notice of Termination Batman, this thing let's you desing your own spell effects, and map tiles.If you're a slightly more casual player like moi, you may be content to unfairly stack the deck (map) in your favor, design your own faction and then design a mounted company unit called Fist of the Empress, subsequently mass producing them. Because the computer will still slap you around, that's why.11/10P.S. You can recruit Dragons into your army.			"

												I got this game for 10$ cad on sale, and for that price it no doubt good.  The game does get repetitive and the AI is not good at all.  You can simply turtle through the game even on the 2nd highest difficulty. I haven't bothered with the highest difficulty yet, but I'm sure it is the same because the AI simply gets more resource boosts.  The devs also seem to have a habit of rehashing their games a lot, this being the 3rd iteration of Elemental.  I have not played Elemental or Fallen Enchantress, but I have read that they are almost the same as FE: Legendary Heroes.  I got this game at 75% so I was not disappointed, at 10$ there is still ample play and it is a good deal, but in the long run I would rather play Master of Magic, which seemed to have a bit more depth and more variety of creatures and magic. Edit: This game is no where near as good as Age of Wonders III. I will still leave a positive recommendation because I got this game for 10$ on sale, and because they game isn't completely horrible.  The ai  never seems to try and attack and that is the biggest problem with this game.			"

												Nice tweaks from the base game Fallen Enchantress.  This really should have been an expansion instead of calling it a new game though.  I did run into a nasty collision bug that would prevent me from ending my turn and thus halting play.  Spent a good 30 minutes on the forums figuring out how to bypass it.  Other than that - great game.  I particularly like the option to fight turn based in tactical combat rather than the autoresolve die roll that is typical in these Civ-like games.  Definitely would recommend going straight for Legendary Heroes rather than just Fallen Enchantress.			"

												great game, one of the best 4x fantasy games. the game has a great mixture of civ5 city building elements, tactical combat, questing, huge amount of customization (you can create / customize every unit) and rpg-elements (spells, heroes level up with skills etc.). the randomly generated maps are quite huge and add a huge amount of replayability.the game is admittedly not without it flaws, personally i would've liked some more diversity within the races, meaning having more like elves, dwarves or other fantasy tropes instead of more human-like races...but this is of course a personal matter. another weak point comes from one of its strong points...being able to fully customize units means that you can basically create some powercreeps, there is no strong unist with some huge counters to them.....there is nothing like cavalry is good against swordsman, which are good are gainst archers, archers good against pikeman and pikeman are good against cavalry (cause of bony / mali etc.). it comes more down to the fact of creating strong troops which hit hard, have high initative and can also take a good amount of beating. that said, the game remains challenging and interesting througout the stages of the game, wildlands make for some really good settling sites but are guarded by boss-monster types of units. there are some pretty interesting ideas in the game and stardock is still supporting this game, releasing a 2.0 version after they've released SK and galciv3...some nice things ahead and i can recommend this game to every 4x fantasy lover :).

												BLUF: The game isn't worth $30, I paid a total of $14 for Elemental (the first one), and FE:LH (this one) - I'm a sales hunter. I have no misgivings, FE:LH (this one) has everything in it that Elemental did. So, if you're going to buy one, skip to this one. Detail:So, I enjoy modding this game. I'm going to say that right up front... so let me break this into two separate sections, vanilla and not.Vanilla:It's a passable strategy game with elements of RPG but not enough to call it an RPG game. Don't come in expecting Civ because that's stupid. Aside from the developers, I see nobody saying anything about Civ in relation to the game except in reviews from people saying its not like Civ (which they expected due to Devs who worked in ome way on Civ). The game play is pretty straight forward - make units, fight on a tactical grid-map. Use Block to reduce damage from hits, Dodge to avoid hits (even ranged), and spell resist to avoid magic or damage from magic. The built in options to customize a faction, a hero (sovereign), and your own units lend replability to the game. The AI will use created factions as ""minor races"" if you aren't using them in a scenario. Always nice.While this is billed as a the Fallen Enchantress come to enslave the world, thats really not it at all. There is a minor campaign that took a tops of 3 hours to complete (and only that cause I like to wander). That dealt with the enchantress, but even then, she was one of the easiest to beat factions. The game is really about random scenarios against random (or selected) factions including your custom ones. It IS buggy in some annoying spots:  -  Basically anywhere that you enter text runs into issues (such as custom facions backstory and custom Hero Backstory).   -  Custom maps have issues erasing each other in the cartographer tool  -  Altering generated maps in the Cartographer Tool will sometimes cause creatures to spawn on ocen-cliff tiles and make them unkillable outside of magic  -  You can only kill the Vanilla ""Ridiculous"" difficulty setting (well all of them) aren't vastly different from the normal in my experience.  -  It crashes infrequently, but the autosave feature makes it only a mildly annoying issue (for me).Modded:The scripting is pretty easy and straight forward. You can even port in 3D models if you're so inclined. The game was intended for modding but isn't set up for the Steam community. In fact, I doubt its even set up for Stardock (not that I've ever been there). I use NEXUS forums if I hit a roadblock or want to see what others have done. You can even alter the AI behavior to make the game more challenging, nerf ranged attacks if that's your piece, or do as some folks did and overhaul the game. Or, if you're lazy, download their versions and have the game overhauled for you. Also, you can add in items or nerf existing ones if you feel the game is all about who has the bigger stick.   - Some folks have claimed to fix the above vanilla bugs, I haven't experienced that. "

												tl:dr: good mechanics, interesting spells, poor AI and shallow tech tree. Fun to play.The best thing is that you can create your own troops by choosing their traits and equipment. Too bad that game is balanced so that your only option is to pile up as many magical items on your troops as possible and thus eliminate the power of choise whenever to supply many troops with poor equipment or few troops with expensive equipment. In the endgame spells are a bit too powerful. Since there isn't any multiplay, the developers haven't bothered to tune down some cataclysm spells like Volcano, which can eradicate whole cities in few turns and alter the environment so that AI has no clue how to cope with that.

												It is a good game in the style of Master of magic / Civilization but I have a machine that is way beyond the requirements and the game keeps crasing to no end. Almost finished a game and when I try to load it, BAM. Crash and crash.***Update***I lowered the settings and am using a lower window than my video screen and managed to play a full game. Still, buy with caution. It is an ok game if you like CIV / Master of magic and such.			"

												Best of the MoM remakes on the market. Suffers from the usual CIV issues in the endgame-- engine starts to bog down, too many cities/units requiring micromanagement, etc. But as fantasy 4x goes, it's still the best I've played in a while.			"

												Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes (FELH) is a rock solid game that is filled with a lot of great content (when adding in DLC) and ideas. The problem is much of the cotnent are set pieces in the game and new things don't happen often enough to make the world feel dynamic or lived in.  That is a problem.  You either steamroll eveything by midgame or complete the huge quests late when it doesn't really add much.Combat at the strategic level is usually fairly easy.  The CPU soes not really seem to know how to use its armies and will invariably park all of them in cities, unless it can be roused to enter a fight.  Unfortunately these armies are eithe rnot well contructed, updated or used effectively.  Like I said even in all out war the AI parks them.  So you conquer everything else and then go for the killing blow.  On a tactical level combat can become quite challenging and the AI seems to handle this aspect of combat better.The DLC is a mixed bag.  There is some good stuff like the undead, but the items and maps packs feel more like a donation to Stardock than great additions.  I did but them all, mostly when on sale (2.50 is a better price point).  What is missing is a workshop.  This is what makes GalCiv3 so awesome, user created content.  Even the ability to make magic items was something Master of Magic had... 25 years ago.The ability to customize your own race/wizard is really cool and for the most part superior to Master of Magic.... save for one thing, this is humans and undead only.  As in everything, save for a few monstrous units from spells.  You want elves, dwarved, halflings, gnomes?  Best of luck, chump.  Units can be cusomized and upgraded too, which is cool and while there ar eoptimal paths there are also lots of options that can differentiate units.  Sadly there are no fun mercinary units to hire like Master of Magic either.  Getting back to races a cool thing about MoM was that you could conquer cities and those cities made different units (big difference between a dark eld city and a human one...).  As you progress in FELH you will pick up heroes and they can be customized to some degree (earlier ones more so than later ones).  They can get gear and expand thier skills/abilities.  Here there are a few more racial options, but for the most part its a humans club.  The great balance here is that while heroes are awsome and powerful you really need an army to bloster them especially early but even later units of heavy cav and wizards do wonders to help them.Anyways this is a fun game and while I iwsh it were more of a challange, had a workshop and more variety in almost everything it has to offer from quests to races... FELH still is a great game and a worthy inheritor to the bar set by Master of Magic for a 4x game.  While it does bring that old game forward with the basics, what is missing is not only noticeable, but glaring.  Which is a shame.			"

												Master of Magic left a legacy and a hole that's never quite been filled. As far as turn-based fantasy strategy games go, this probably comes the closest. Yeah, the graphics are terrible, but honestly I don't care a lot about graphics in a strategy game. Endless Legend made  really pretty strategy game and while it's nice, it doesn't feel as robust as Fallen Enchantress. There's tons and tons of content, and even playing the same race / sovereign multiple times will give you a different experience. In fact if I had to call out one failing, it'd be the AI, but the AI in most other strategy games also super sucks, so this is pretty much par for the course. I realize that this game was built upon the crap-fest that was Elemental : War of Magic, but this is also a testament to what developers can do when they get community feedback on why their game sucked. What we have today works and is a lot of fun. Still haven't gotten a mage high enough to summon Delin though, and that makes me sad.  :'(			"

												I liked the ""heroes style"" gameplay. I liked getting my hero more powerful with skills and items. The game was worth 40 hours of gameplay for me, because I wanted to draw the game out get the maximum power and all the main mission-stories from it. Con: There is a time limit in the game for winning it. Luckily you can continue after you lose this way. On some rare moments the game froze, but nothing what 2 autosave slots couldn't solve.			"

												Think civlization 5, with a actual combat system and a fantasy theme. FE: legendary heroes basically is that. If anything there is a larger tech tree with more options and more building options as well than you get with civilization. I don't even know how many hours of sleep I missed just saying to myself 'Just one more turn and I'll call it a night"" This game has a very addictive property to it that was missing from civilization for me. Even though the games on the surface are very similar I would recommend this over Civ any day.			"

												This game had potential, but there is no excuse between the expansion and the original game for all the glitches and poor optimization that still is present. Units that glitch and die because there is ""no space"", really wacky and unbalanced units, difficult to navigate consequences (permanent injuries without healing), and the hard to use interface ruins it. Since there are so many better 4x fantasy games out there, I'll stop playing this one now. Stardock did a poor job with something with so much potential. I recommend AoW instead			"

												One of the best ""4x"" games I have played. Takes the best of empire building and macro management from the 4x genre and melds it with levelling, talents, spells, skill trees etc that you would see in an RPG game like Dragon Age.The battle system is hands down the best one that I have come across in a 4X game. Once you engage an enemy, you move your units around on a grid and use skills and spells - turn based like Heroes of Might and Magic.There are so many spells and skills, and various roles your champions can take on.Many spells can be used on the map itself, to enchant cities, change the landscape, summon armies, and my personal favourite - dropping a 1200 mana cost volcano in the middle of the enemy capital city.The maps are beautiful and draw you into the world, there are so many different monsters (barbarians) to slaughter, camps and dungeons to loot, countless quests to undertake, all the while keeping your enemies in check and managing your kingdom/empire.Units can be customised with the unit editor, they have included all the developer tools - so the the limit is your imagination. If you ever find yourself getting a bit bored (hasn't happened yet for me!) there are many mods to download and try!It may have had a rough start, but it is very stable now and I have not encountered any major crashes / bugs as of yet.Highly recommended!
