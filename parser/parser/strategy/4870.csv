												Lovingly detailed sprite based RTS.   I've had populations of over 24,000 units (villagers in mines included) on my side alone on a huge skirmish map with 6 other computer controlled players.   You must farm or fish (food), chop wood, quarry stone, mine coal, Iron and gold to supply your army.   I love this game and will die playing this game.  Easily my favorite RTS of all time.   Its cheap no reason not to add it to your RTS library.   Give it a go!			"

												It's difficult not to appreciate the class of Cossacks. Its gameplay focus is well split into all the aspects that characterise an RTT game: game rhythm, upgrades, buildings, unit variety and relevance, population realism, battle simulation... One has got to admire the effort put into crafting the unit functioning and overall building management in this one. Superb.Cossacks offers plenty of pleasurable elements. First, there's the outstanding number of nations, each with its own architectural identity (wonderfully done, by the way); as well as the outstanding number of unique units and their precise importance on the battlefield or in the development of one's domains. Second, there's the realistic representation of population growth, with civil infrastructure costing you more as your settlement expands, although there is no set limit for your population. Third, there's the artillery/infantry details, amazing to watch as they engage in battle. Fourth, there's the customisable gameplay, as the options for a skirmish match are reasonable (type of terrain, type of elevation, game speed, resources, etc.), gathering all the good and fair choices everybody should have when playing a free-build or skirmish game mode in any RTS/RTT. Last but not least, the naval conflicts: it's just too exciting to watch your territories and riches grow and have to formulate quick strategies with your coffers and coal reserves so you can build a solid, fearsome fleet that can outrun the enemy's.Whether you're playing the main campaigns or the 17th and 18th centuries battles in quick match mode, Cossacks: Art of War shall bring you strategy-ecstasy. The huge battles (details of hundreds of men can be formed), the realistic artillery ballistics, the exciting invasions on the enemy's settlement, the fast-paced management of your resources (wood, gold, food, iron and coal) and workers, and the extreme attention that one has to keep on the keeping up of improvements and specific upgrades, will determine who prevails in the hot war scenario of this game. Cossacks can give you this kind of thrill, if you're fond of the genre.Bear in mind that, while I'm writing on the Art of War page, this goes for all its ""sister"" games (European Wars, Back to War).

												I remember this was the first RTS I played (a long time ago) and even though it has simple graphics and gameplay I still find it very fun. But this game is pretty difficult and its different than most RTS games and time is of the essence and you have to be on top of everything from mining to building troops to farming from beggining to end and if you don't quite simply your gonna lose. I sometimes find myself building up a huge army and getting ready to invade the enemy but forgetting to make sure my peasents are doing there jobs at the mills and nothing feels worse but scrambling to get food while watching your soldiers die from starvation. All that aside its a fun (and cheap) game and if you like RTS games you should try it out			"

												A classic RTS, its major distinction being the nearly unattainable 8000 unit capacity. Map options are quite versatile, as are the nations to choose from. The one downside is that MOD1, which brings many imporvements, is unavailabe for the Steam version. Nevertheless, Cossacks is an excellent game.			"

												I had played this game when I was 4 and had broken my leg. I couldn't move around very much with a broken leg and all so I mainly stayed on a loveseat. My dad had taken a ton of days off so that he could be home with me, and one of my favorite things to do with him was play this game. I had my leg broken for almost 4 months, and every day I played non stop. Once it had healed, I would eventually forget about this game. Years later, I was wondering through the steam store and saw this by chance, and immediately bought it. Never checked to see if it would crash or not on my OS, see if my rig was too powerful, none of that. I bought it from sheer nostalgia. This game has been a huge part of my life, and you should make it part of yours too. My absolute favorite game of all time.Edit: Literally have shakes because I'm so excited. They ae making, and close to finishing, Cossacks 3 for PC!!!			"

												Do you ever feel like you should control an army? Would you like each soldier to keep track of how many enemies they kill? Well you better be able to pay them! This is Cossacks a no nonsense RTS for those who like an indepth game but still casual capable. Game play wise this is easy to pick up if you ever played the AoE series or Rise of Nations. Excpet you only live in the 17th and 18th C. Build a town or more, control citizens and put them to work, build army, build defences, build navy, and upgrade tech. Simple right? Well no. There is more than just gold to mine for. You have coal, iron, ect. Then you have wood and stone.(they are located typically close to each other) You have mills and fishing for food. If you can not pay an army they will rebel, and if they can not eat they will die. The thing is numbers matter here. You can have over 2000 citizens and so can your enemies. So be aware you need to grow. Also you can capture enemy citizens if no military is near them. So you can absorb your enemies culture. The naval battles are really cool and controling waters with a coast line city is a big advatage. A frigate can easly destroy a incoming army when in range. Now the indepth part. The technology trees are massive and pricey. Do not upgrade your 17th cent soldiers and just rush to 18th instead if you have a western euro nation. They are pricey and take time, then you will not use them once you are in the 18th cent. Each mine can be upgrader to support more workers. The military and agriculture upgrades are very indepth. Rifling and gun powder advancments make all the difference. So you can have a highlander or other ranged soldier on a hill snyping and weakening a passing army. Remember when I said each soldier keeps a tally of how many he has killed. Well I have had a soldier kill more than 2500 troops due to time and a cliff.   Now for stradgey. This is kind of a grand RTS at times. It can take a long time to complete a game. So you can take advatage of the land. elevated troops(on a hill or cliff) shoot farther and well placed cannons can turn the tide. Dragoons and other horsemen are great for fleeing troops and artillary, but aweful in a siege. Naval control is a massive advantage but very expensive. If you lose a man o war to muntiny you will struggle to get the sea back. Picking a wise local for your city is near impossible. If you are on the water and you lose control of the sea you're lost, if you take a valley you can become a sitting duck. Think of your entrances and exits. So what about the nations? Each has their own advatages and unique troops. The middle eastern and eastern Europe counrties are all better early in the game. If you pick these nations like Turkey or Russia be aggressive, cause man the computer will be. These troops cost the least but have major weaknesses. Once you get to the 18th C the power drastically turns. Countries like Britain, France, Prussia, and Sweden are the stronger. With countries like Spain some where in the middle. This game follows historic fact so some technologies do not get developed in some nations. Now for the bad. Back to War is the last expansion but does not recoginize any resolution other than 768 and 2160p for me. 2160p is not compatable with this game and it will crash. It also will not take a custome res. This game, the Art of War does support all resolutions. The highest it will support is 1440p. Since it is 2D it will just zoom farther out. The game also crashes at times. Typically around the 3-4 hour mark. Loading is fast and it does auto save.   So if you like AoE II or any other RTS. Give this or Back to War a try. It's like them but bigger and more focused on historical accuracy. For a game hitting the 15 year mark I would still strongly recommend it.			"

												Ah, Cossacks: Art of War.The strategy game of my childhood.Since 2004, when my father'd introduced me to the world of PC gaming, this is perhaps the most wonderful RTS game I've ever played.There were three RTS games back then for me and my uncle (my father preffered playing Max Payne);Cossacks, Empire Earth and Battle For Middle Earth 2My uncle had spent thousands of hours on the latter two, he's playing Empire Earth now as I speak!Yes, I loved all three games, Empire Earth's fantastic editor, always making up stories in my head, or Battle For Middle Earth, imagining how I was trying to get the ring for myself. But that's enough about those two, this is a Cossacks: Art of War review, after all.My favourite RTS game was, and still is Cossacks; Art of War.I remember how I was always frustrated when I had to install European Wars first, because it'd take too long.I remember how the first thing I did when I installed and booted up the game was to enter the editor and write ""money"" dozens of times, and then the party would begin.I'd turn the peace mode on, generate the map of Europe and imagine that I'm a conqueror who's main goal is to destroy his enemies, make alliances with other factions (controlled by me, of course) and just create a lot of building and units and make them fight.My uncle still refuses to play 1vs1 against me, he preffers to play vs. AI.But I'll make him play multiplayer one day, and people of Cossacks will celebrate that day as the day Tycho the Glorius defeated Uncle the RTS Master.

												This game is nowhere near the quality of AoE or AoE2, sadly it's missing something that would keep me playing and returning.Strange balance with enemies being able to take over your buildings and enslave your units so quickly.Huge numbers as far as resource quantities, which makes no sense, just use smaller number, as the overall balance is really weird.It's not  a bad game, it's just very mediocre and has no longevity for me.

												Fantastic game. I always have plenty of fun playing this tidy little RTS, and it shows a bit of insight into the lives and ways of old, with decent animations, sound effects, technology tree and units. The game is based around resource gathering, technolgoy research, city development and large scale batles with guns, artillery and cavalry. It's a great little RTS and I'd love to see a new version with updated graphics. I recommend this.			"
