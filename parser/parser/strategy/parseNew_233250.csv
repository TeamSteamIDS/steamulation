												Kickstarted with lots of promises but delivered with less of actual content. Also releasing standalone expansion splits the community and devs think selling the same game twice is brilliant economical move.			"

												(EDIT: This review has been quite popular [Thanks for that, by the way], and I feel that in the interest of fairness I should mention that I have not played the Titans expansion, and I'm not going to, such is my dissappointment with this game. But it does perhaps bypass some of the problems I have raised here, I just don't particularly want to waste my money on it.)I wanted so much to love this game. I'm a huge SupCom and TA fan, and this game looked like it was going to be the game that I was playing every day for the next couple of years. But after a while things were starting to look pretty bad, I came back online for the first time in a while to see if things have picked up. The game is still a very bland and repetetive experience. As an RTS all of the authentic strategy is in the first 5 minutes of each game, and then it's just who can push the most build capacity.Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is, in my opinion, the best RTS game ever made. It's basic mechanics are excellent, the need for map control, economy management, unit management, tech management and intel are all closely interdependent, meaning that you're always INVOLVED in the battlefield even during the ""quiet"" stretches of gameplay. The available maps are excellent, and if you play on Forged Alliance Forever, a community maintained lobby with a competetive 1v1 ladder and public match service for casual players, there are stacks more to download. The game was also beautiful, with a good spread of aesthetically and strategically unique factions from the bread and butter ""space marines"" UEF, the intel oriented guerillas Cybran, the overrun focussed Aeon, and the tech heavy Seraphim. The game progression from opening to endgame is multifaceted and calls for real-time responses to your opponenents activity. To this day after 5 years of playing Forged Alliance if anybody tells me they're looking to get into a new competetive game I tell them to get FA. Similar things can be said of Total Annihilation, PA's other direct predecessor.PA takes the ""massive-scale"" RTS format, and turns the format into an (ironically) incredibly two-dimensional experience. The units are bland and there is no faction diversity, the game escalates quickly but when it gets to its peak it tends to degenerate into a massive drag, especially across multiple planets with player interaction at a minimum, with power plays limited to a very uninteresting blob vs blob. Defensive plays just don't mean much in this game after a point. Your point defence investments will be thrown out for the sake of producing ever more units in the ongoing drudgery that is the endless escalation in this game. It sounds and is pretty cool the first few times you play it, but then you have your 10th game, and you realise you're doing more or less the same thing you did in the last 9, except there's a lava planet in this system, cool! But aside from your units not being able to drive over lakes of lava, that means very little. it's just forced no mans land. Interplanetary warfare epitomizes this. Build lots of orbital defences, build lots of fighters and send them at your opponents defences, wait 5 minutes for the fleet to arrive, hope it works, maybe send some fabricators to teleport an army from your planet to that one. I've done it so many times and I just don't really want to any more.Huge scope for escalation in an RTS is cool, but you can't build a game on sheer escalation, which is what this is. There is no nuance, deploying a small force well is almost never going to make a game-changing difference, to the point where it's not worth trying, better stick to what you know. The learning curve is too steep as it is to try subtle strategies as a new player, and once you get to grips with the game you realise that there is very little to be done outside of beating your opponent in an arms race.The game was released unready, and is just generally a very poor execution of a great concept, centred around a gimmick which doesn't come into play that often. My one hope for the game is that some modders come along and take the good (but extremely temperamental) engine and inject some life into it, the elements are there, but Uber half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it, and just made the most nondescript RTS they could, and then made it really big and really long... and really ♥♥♥♥ing boring.

												19/8/15: HA! PA:Titans eh?How bout, ♥♥♥♥ you UBERent.-----------------------I truly love this game. It does have something great about it. So I am going to bash the **** out of it now.This game could be so great, but sadly it just falls short.If this was truly a hard working little indy dev struggling to make it in this world then I would not be writing the wall of text before you!I also understand the amount of hard work that has been put into the game of which a sizable chuck goes in credit to the actual fans and modders, since they are likely to make the game better than the people that actually earned money from it.Planets? Flat, lifeless with a few cracks and if you are really lucky, you might get a raised platau a toddler could step down off of, and yet your giant commander cannot! Shoddy half arsed textures. Metal planets not looking metal at all. Strange knobbly mountains and bits that really, just get in the way of the already terrible pathing. Controls? Buggy, not clear and needing work.Boats? Whats the point, seriously? Maybe to defend a base with but unless your world has half water, you wont be using them to attack... Seriously! Because you CANT!!!! You cat get anywhere near the enemy with your super slow, super useless ships. Again, the aircraft are insanely overpowered. Yet they talk about balance issues with a unit cannon?!?No shields. When you crowdfund a game, give the people the game they crowdfunded! Or was it ""backed"" or ""supported"", noone seems to make their mind up and as with every game nowadays there is an army of drones that make excuses for these sorry game designers making money off your backs.People have a right to be annoyed and to say it and to express ANGER at this kind of thing.And now, to rip Galactic war, the Single Player element of Planetary Annihilation.Terrible UI and genrally GW is devoid of feeling, story or substance.Limited things to do, getting the ""cards"" to upgrade generally needs work, more cards, variation, a real reason to play GW.You cant move around at all on the game map. If you want to travel backwards past previously conquered planets on the galaxy grid you have to click each individual planet and click travel, agian and again and again and again and again. You think Im kidding? Ha!I know there is a ""mod"" to fix this map movement issue,!! made by the community !!. Lazy work letting the community fix your game. Lost respect for you guys after this. I shouldnt need a mod for a game to make it playable.Buttons clunky, interface clunky, doesnt feel nice at all and sucks to be you if you get stuck on a 1v3 in the Galactic War when the enemy computer commanders can throw nukes at you from other planets but you cant even land on their planet which is heavily fortified with orbital units and air units and maybe some mostly useless land units. The reason you cannot land on a fortified planet is because all you can build is one unit type you use to travel between planets called the Atreus. This Atreus can only hold ONE unit at a time so if the computer has locked the planet down good luck getting onto it!!!I did actually get 200 Atreus loaded with T2 builders and tanks and land and get a portal up that had hundreds of T2 units that all swarmed thru as soon as it was built. I did this THREE TIMES to THREE PLANETS in ONE GAME. Yeah, it was satisfying but blow me down if it isnt a serious game flaw. Its not hard, its stupid and badly balanced and badly done.Is this game still in Beta? NO! but it should be.Update--------------------------- I have to say, I just read that they only just fixed the save/load for skirmish. Thats not a fully released game, thats a work in progress. I stand by what I said, this game is still in Beta. Im angry that the devs said it was done and v 1.0 was released when the game was clearly, oh my gawd so clearly not finished! and Im angry that the Devs went on to say (Im paraphrasing) 'we will only continue development if people keep buying the game' which, to their credit, they have and may yet save some meagre amount of grace. The flak that UBERent has come under is not unwarrented and Im far from alone in thinking this.I will take Plutons advice (formerly Arioch) and wait a few more months, Im too annoyed to re-assess it right now. Grrr, bear claws!			"

Shut up and take my money!!Take the money and run...and then try to take it againSITREP September 2015: So now they took out the game from Steam. It hasn't been out of Early Access even for a year(and it should have been in early access for longer) and they already took it down from the Steam Store. What do I have to do now? Pay again? Because now what I have is a game that is no longer being sold, so it is not going to be getting any more development or improvements. And I also have a feeling the I've been ripped off with a game that is not finished and already out of circulationDevs like this are harmful for the videogame industry, for other projects with real good intentions, and they are the first that promote piracy with their actions			"

												You want to know about Planetary Annihilation?First, Uber♥♥♥♥♥♥in their community's collective faces by abandoning Planetary Annihilation as a bug-ridden, incomplete piece of garbage further made up of disappointment and empty promises. Second, they removed Planetary Annihilation from the Steam store entirely, further signalling their abandonment of the game, while simultaneously releasing their new full-price repackaging of the same game with the updates and content you always wanted (Planetary Annihilation: TITANS).Third, after months of nothing but negative reviews and angry backlash from their community, they've inexplicably READDED the original Planetary Annihilation to Steam...For almost the same price as their repackaged game with more content!Up and coming developers take note: THIS IS HOW YOU DON'T MAKE A GAME.Curious potential buyers take note: Don't buy this game. There is the possibility of course that you might glean a couple hours of entertainment from it, but in the end it won't be worth the waste of your money or time. If you want a good RTS to play, pick up Starcraft 2 and its expansions, or Greygoo, or Company of Heroes, or Endless Legend. Just don't buy this game, Uber doesn't deserve your money. If I still haven't convinced you and you're still determined to try it, don't waste your money. Pirate this piece of trash instead.			"

												Let me start by saying that I have been following this game from the beginning as a backer. To put this simply, I would not recommend this game in it's current state (release build 71544). To call this a final game is absurd and borderline insulting. Features are missing or not flushed out at all and I don’t just mean I don't like them.  For example:There is no way to play this game in offline mode. This was promised from the beginning to be included ""When the game is released"". They lied. Also You cannot save a game so either be prepared to spend at very least 30 minutes of uninterrupted time on here or waste it when you have something unexpected happen.Single player is useless, boring, and flavorless. Many of the games only redeeming features are not even included with galactic campaign, no super weapons here folks. And maybe I am in the minority here but I like singleplayer usually, there just isn't anything worth playing.The games are hard to follow after you leave your first planet. Most of the time will be spent navigating the UI trying to make sense of the battle while you literally leave your other forces idle.OPTOMIZATION is nonexistent. I have a high end rig for windows and a top line IMac and neither of them can run this game without major lag, graphical tears, or in many cases crashes/screen blackouts. This is acceptable for a beta but not a final release.  And honestly the graphics are pretty boring to look at and I'm a fan of the cell shaded/cartoon look but somehow they managed to make that dull and not vibrant.There are some small gripes I have with the game as well. First is the lack of ""flavor"". I feel like all the units are so bland and basic, and to make it worse everyone is using the same ones. I wish there was some way of differentiating the units per leader, or even take some cues from the terrible single player and limit the techs for each player to 3 or 4 cards to make games more exciting. That brings me to my last little gripe, bots vs land vehicles. There is almost no difference between the two gameplay wise, honestly what’s the point, maybe I am missing something here? So unless something drastic changes don't waste your time or money on this game, I know I wish I hadn't.My internet connection at time of review was roughly 7mb down 2-3 up, actual. Best I can afford and I would say better than avarage. Note: This is my actual number not the ""estimate"" that providers give you. (Welp, I'm an idiot. Actual numbers are 31 down, 12 up.)I will Update the review if anything changes.(UPDATE Oct. 7th) They have announced a patch coming Oct. 9th that will bring offline play. I will be testing it out and update the review accordingly.(UPDATE Oct. 10th RELEASE BUILD 73737)So far with the update they made adding offline support everything has been going smoothly (at least as much as before). There are still plenty of major bugs that can be really frustrating and even make the game unplayable at times. I am glad that so far they have stuck with PA and turned out this update. As of right now I still cannot reccommend the game, however. Some people have complained that my review doesn't take multiplayer into account much and honestly they are right. I dont like multiplayer in games like this, it all comes down to who can click faster. I thought it was pretty clear from my statments that this review is more for singleplayer or casual multiplayer people. Also once you are entreanched in seperate planets there is really no way to invade eachother so it ends up being who can make the most nukes first (or activate the deathstar-esc metal planet).I really hope this game grows on me, I love the concept, I also really want to back their new project Human Resources but I think I will hold off since this game left such a bad taste in my mouth, not only for Uber but Kickstarter in general (Kickstarters really dont have to provide the product to you at all, and that breaks no kickstarter rules).

October 2014 - Very Important Update:WARNING, AVOIDCorruption, Money ScamIm a big player of Total Anihilation and especially Supreme Commander-Forged Alliance, im a huge fan and loyal long time player, this is my view of the game so far.Is this game worth buying right now?    NoWhat about later?    NoWhy? It's unfinished, claiming to be a completed work when we all know this is still a beta. There's missing effects, units, customization and more. Saying that the game is ready to be sold, is rubbish, its not, they just needed another bulk of cash to carry on developing. Remember all this is just my opinion but it is based on facts that even recently have come to light. In-depth information. Graphics: 3/10To allow for many amounts of units on the screen at once, polygon-count has been shredded, where most units and structures appear extremely square-ish, textures also greatly simplified to a huge extent. It looks really bad. I think i appreciated Supreme Commanders dramatic wars a lot more because of the quality of the image and units. Advantage is, you dont need a mega-computer to run this game smoothly, but i still feel like the quality has been destroyed too far. Many negative points for many effects being completely missing from the game. Remember a planet colliding and blowing up in the trailor? theres no effect for that in the actual game...it's unfinished.Sound: 3/10The repeated low quality sounds become very overly repetetive, with all units in the game having nothing to say but a mechinical noise, where only the engineer tank makes any unique noises, and the weapon firing sound effects for all units feel completely impactless, there's no OOMPH! or quality. The orchestral music isnt so bad, but it is short lived as there is no variation or multiple tracks. EVERY game features the same, SINGLE interchanging track based on wether youre incombat or drinking a beer etc.Gameplay: 2/10After all the wait and all the multipl intakes of cash Uber Entertainment conned out of us, we got scraps. Where in short, the person who Mashes the mouse button the fastest AND wins a Decision based Dice-roll, rather than the smartest and most strategic player is going to be the winner of the game. You cannot speed up and slowdown gameplay (like in Supreme Commander) to allow for real strategy, instead, the winning formulae is to build as much as you can, as fast as you can (mash that mouse button! yeeaah!) of something to Zerg rush your opponent in ALL games. There's no strategy whatsoever than 'Send units directly to enemy'. The ability to smash moons and planets together is broken, where even some games end with EVERYONE losing, because early in the game, your planet 'naturally' (not caused by players) smashes with another one before ANYBODY including hard AI has a chance to leave the planet...meaning the entire game was a pointless waste of time right from the beginning.With Land > Sea > Air > Orbital >Artillery > Nukes > Forced Planetary destruction giving too many things to possibly build to defend against all of them, the whole games boils down to who plays the fastest from the beginning, and what choice or units you build at the beginning, in a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Stapler-Pencil-Rubber-Glue-EverybodyLoses  style gameplay.In short, it feels pointless to play a game where you know who's won in the first 5 minutes. THERES NO STRATEGY HERE WHATSOEVER, it's all about mashing the mouse button. Terrible.Overall: 3/10The idea of what this game can become, is fantastic, but it is greatly undermined by being unfinished, unbalanced, and not anywhere near ready for consumption, and currently not worth that asking price. My advice is to play Supreme Commander - Forged Alliance against AiX (super hard cheating AI) if you want 'actual' large scale war that involves STRATEGY in order to overcome a tough challenge. It breaks my heart as a massive fan and lover of the other 2 games to say it :(  This is not a RTS, just a button masher. AVOID.Feedback? 1. Give people the option like in Supreme Commander to SpeedUp and SlowDown gametime. We all have different physical playing speeds and bodily/mental fingerclickin limitations. It's not skill or strategy (i cannot state that enough), Planetary Annihilation is just speedclicking in it's current state. Its like giving a button-masher the championship-title in a Street Fighter tournament, it just aint how it goes.2. Scale. Planets, are so small that it takes away the ability to create strategies on the ground level.3. Defenses.  Most turrets are pointless, they cannot stop much, and are too squishy. The most concerning defensive structure you gave us...is the wall...It is too easy to shoot around and many air units, orbital units and launchers and artillery and (long list of other things) simply ignore Walls. Remove these pointless walls that dont do anything, and replace them with Shield technologies.---UPDATE - 2014 9th OCTOBER---It has been announced that Uber are teaming up with the creators of Super Monday Night Combat (another piece of unfinished junk) to create another strategy game, when this game isnt finished by a huge mile. Breaking their Kickstarter contract to complete what was stated they were going to do.At this point i can sadly say that this is all just a money scam at this point, to rush out a crappy game using kickstarter even though they already have the money squeezed from the fans of Supreme Commander. This is just greed, and full corruption even below EA standards. THIS COMPANY IS SCAMMING YOU, AVOID ALL GAMES.Uber Entertainment have gone very low into corruption. This game is nowhere near finished, and we the people are now being stabbed in the back after supporting their game with an unfinished product, and being shaked for more money on a new kickstarter for another game when they already have the money they robbed from you the fans.There has been a great deal of drama over the internet on this, and i (once a hugely loyal fan) am saddened to have to agree...All trust has been lost, take my advice and do not do any further business with these swindlers. DO NOT FEED THEM MONEY ON KICKSTARTER. Its a scam, they already have taken tonnes of YOUR cash to be able to afford development of the next game. They want cash, for nothing. Discluding the crappy campaign mode which only consisted of copy/paste skirmishes, this is what Uber Entertainment have done:-Stolen over $1.1 Million in Kickstarter Fraud.-Stolen (by leaked rumours) around $16 million from Steam/Game fans in sales of a broken & unfinished game that does not meet the Kickstarter declarations.-Abandoned the game to a small team to do patchwork, breaking their Kickstarter contracts.-Instead of using the stolen cash to develop the new game 'Human Resources' , setup another Kickstarter so YOU have to pay for it. Expect further fraud and broken contracts. This is large scale fraud that deserves headlines in every game magazine (where the hell are you guys...you call yourselves journalists?) Uber Entertainment should be Boycotted.---UPDATE 22nd OCTOBER---https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/659943965/human-resources-an-apocalyptic-rts-game/posts'Human Resources' canceled, the fans responded with great power behind their lack of donations. Human Resources was boycotted & the fans have been given a slight piece of Justice.May Planetary Annihilation now be properly developed on...probably not.Either way, they should be banned from using Kickstarter in the future for taking the money and abandoning the game before the contract was complete. Thats fraud on a massive scale that needs an appropriate response.			"

												Strategy on a massive scale, conquering planets, invading solar systems, smashing and blowing up moons. What's not to like?Release (review) Update!PA has officially been released! This doesn't mean it's done though, but it's at a point where the devs feel it's reached a solid foundation to build upon further. They will keep working on it for quite a while, and some features are still coming, such as offline play, dynamic savegames via ChronoCam, and multi-monitor support.Some new release features include Gas Gians, orbital only resource planets, which can be mined for a massive boost in resources.Also, metal planets can be turned into planet killing death stars via a new building, the Catalyst. It's an excellent game ending weapon that will keep everyone on their toes for sure, and changes the game dynamic quite a bit.Area commands and PiP windows turn the task of managing whole planets into a breeze, while units such as the stargate-like teleporter shows off how interesting solar system-wide warfare can be. Personally these are the features that ""wow"" me the most.Most importantly, the client side of the game has gone through massive optimisation work, with multi-threading and many other improvements that make it run smoothly on not-so-new systems.The game has a single player mode called Galactic War, with procedurally generated galaxies, that are unique with every run. It's not perfect, but it's excellent fun for a first pass, with unlockable technologies, AI assisted sub commanders, that make every run unique and fun. And it will only get better once the updates start rolling. Improvements and a multiplayer version is in the works!In summary, if you loved Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander, but would like to take it a couple steps further, this is a game for you.-----Disclaimer: As PA is in development, I will occasionally update this review to reflect the state of the game.

												This game used to be reasonably fun. Sure, it had its issues, but playing with and against friends would provide hours of fun. Unfortunately, that changed today- the TITANS 'patch' came out, with a load of new content, gameplay, everything needed to make this game amazing fun. It also came with a $39.99 price tag. Sure, kickstarter backers got it for free - and EA backers got it for about $15 - but the sheer gall of Uber to try to sell its game twice to experience the full game is unbelievable. It's not even selling the game twice, really, as the 'expansion' costs MORE than the base game. It's absurd. For people that haven't bought the expansion, an annoying splashscreen comes up at the title reminding you. That's like taking the middle finger they've already given their entire playerbase, and then shoving it down their throats. Do NOT buy this game. If you already own it, don't buy it again. Uber doesn't deserve your, or anyone else's, money.			"

Early Access Review
								While many people may spend their time arguing and squabbling over the price or what the game should be like, I would like to go in a different direction.[Note]: I play on the stand alone browser, that is why my time on steam may seem low. If you contest my veterancy please go look up OathAlliance on youtube. That is my channel and it chronicles some of my +100 hours in game.[Note]: I'm doing my best to keep this up to date with every major game update. It might be a little bit behind the current build however.Key Features(What makes it, it)- Planetary Combat - Why settle for flat polygon maps that block you from flanking when you can attack from literally any direction(except from underground)?- Interplanetary - When you lose one world move to another. War doesn't take a holiday as long as there's worlds to conquer!- Interplanetary Nukes - Enemy on an orbiting moon? Nuke him!- Planet destruction - Why spend hours nuking all of your opponent's bases when you can just destroy the whole planet?- Massive scale warfare - Tired of having that dinky little 1k unit cap? How about swarming your opponent with 10k of bots(game supports 10k doxen atm)!- Galactic War! - Now you can conquer the galaxy, one planetary system at a time!- Voiced Alerts! - Low on metal? A voice will let you know of that and any other important info!- More little things that would be a pain to write down -So now you're like ""That sounds cool! But, why isn't it like that? Where's all the cool stuff!?"". Well, let us remember that this is Gamma not Gamma as in ""almost done teaser demo like BF4"" this is literally ""We are throwing in tons of awsomely big features that we've been working on throughout beta"".What's coming?- More units and buildings! - Over 50 units are supposed to be in the game not including a host of buildings to accompany them!- More gameplay features/UI updates/more game types! - It says it all!- Co-op galactic FREAKING WAR! - Say goodbye to those boring campaigns that take away half the fun items. Just destroy the galaxy over and over again for fun!- 40 Player Games! - Killing everyone you know in a 40 way FFA is BOSS!- Even more things that are small and not worth my time writing! -So, the final question. Is it worth the $? Well, that would be up to you. I paid over $100 during the Kickstarter, I've been in since the ALPHA(people who'd like to challenge my veteran status can check out my youtube @OathAlliance) and it's been worth my money. If are willing to accept that it's not complete and that you get to watch it grow and become even better than it was before whilst gaming, then go for it. If you simply want a finished game with all the nice shiny features and polished gameplay, wait until release.I'm not here to tell you what to do. This is simply a guide to help you on your path.Updates have added the following:More Units: Flame Tanks, Gunships, Sniper Bots, with more coming.Teleporter: Insta-Transport to the other side(planets, bases, etc)Artillery acting like artillery: Up and over not straight.Cheaper Units: More units, less nucks!Optimization: Particle effects are now GPU rendered!Transport Unit: Carry your units around like a pro.Main Menu UI update: It's SO pretty!More social features: You can add friends!Upcoming in more updates:More Aggressive AI: Stronger, faster, deadlier.Graphics update: Beauty just got more beautiful.Balance work: It's barely been done!Optimization: Always more work to do!UI updates: First pass of the second pass!Bug fixes!: Uber hates bugs as much as we do, they're doing their best to squash the little buggers.More to come...Helpful links:PA Forums: forums.uberent.com/categories/planetary-annihilation.60/PA Homepage: www.uberent.com/pa/My Youtube with over 200 PA videos: www.youtube.com/OathAllianceIf this review was helpful please rate it up, if you didn't understand something or something was incorrect please leave me a comment so I can look into it.

Early Access Review
								Remember Rome: Total War? Taking over a continent with large scale armies was great. Watching hundreds of arrows arching into a tightly packed phalanx, breaking it up just before the distracting charge from your Swordsmen forced them out of position so your Cavalry could break through the side. What a game. I believe this is the next best thing. In terms of scale, it is crazy! Most matches have the potential to see orbital engagements, with Commander units fleeing the battle torn main planet in search of refuge. A nearby moon makes for a better base than the distant planet. Once secure, the moon is turned into a war factory, pumping out robots and tanks into a teleporter to be fed back into the foothold left on the starting planet. Then, just as your waves and waves of units seem to be breaking the enemy line of defense, they nuke your teleporter and push you completely off the planet! But all is not lost... You move every construction unit into the production of Halleys - giant rockets that can move small planets out of orbit... All the while inter-planetary nukes harass your anti-nuke defense and orbital units flood into your atmosphere trying to break through. But you manage to hold on just long enough to finish building your Moon of Doom, and it is time to quickly flee with your commander to the unoccupied planet. Now comes the fun as your push the moon into a new orbit of the sun; one which intersects with the orbit of the home planet - now riddled with machines of war, eager to break out and destroy you. However, without a foothold on the moon, nor an attempt at collonising the distant planet, your enemy has no where to go, and can only watch as a multi million ton projectile, hurled through space, smashes into his base, obliterating the planet, triggering the destruction of their Commander unit, and knocking them out of the game.Yeah it's fun :D I just need someone to play with :(Multiplayer is where it is at, as unlike most strategy games, you can play as the same colour, sharing controlling of the same units, as well as team up. What's more, unique game modes like 1v3v3v3 can be played due to the dedicated servers, whereby the aim of the game is to knock out the solo player who has a production bonus. Almost like a race to break into the fortress! Watch this if you need any more convincing!

												DO NOT BUY.When this game first came out on steam, in early access, it was 90 dollarydoos. But this amount of money from everyone wasn't enough for the developers, so they decided they weren't going to release all the promised features they had promised on kickstarter / elsewhere.Then they tried to do another kickstarter for another game (called Human Resources) after deciding they were going to abandon this one so soon, but that kickstarter rightly failed, since everyone lost trust in this developer.After that attempt to jew the customers failed, they decided to work on planetary annihalation again. But wait! They weren't updating the base game, oh no. They were releasing the new standalone, Planetary Annihalation: Titans! But they wanted everyone who already owned PA to buy this ""new"" game, so they decided to offer a ""discount"" for people who own this version of PA!Here is what you're paying for if you buy Titans:""It includes new units, including 5 new TITAN class units, new maps with new CSG to play with in the editor, a new gameplay mode called ""Bounty Mode"", a playable tutorial for new players, as well as new balance for Multiplayer, Skirmish, and Galactic War!""Singleplayer ""campaign"" in both games is a joke, and it's just you playing against bots in a series of randomized skirmish matches, but the bots have access to every unit while you are gimped in what you can use.Planets are the size of peas.Game is an unoptimized pile of crap.Do not buy Uber Entertainment games.

												Not worth more than $10.It's like Total Annihilation if it were made by Peter Molyneux - Unfinished, unoptimized, and far below everyone's expectations.It's a resource hog.Planets are the size of marbles.The ""galactic war"" mode is really just a bunch of skirmishes where you have a handicap, nothing more.I could go on about the kickstarter rewards and how the game was like $90 on steam at some point, but to make a long story short this is just another crowd funded flop. I hate some of the decisions the bean-counters make sometimes too, but video game programmers have proven themselves to be completely incapable of time management and making rational business decisions. This game is just more evidence of the massive downsides to crowd-funded video games.I've been a fan of TA since it's first rendition and this to me is a blemish I will pretend doesn't exist. Just play TA:FA if you want a good RTS with giant robots and massive weapons.			"

												The game just isn't there.It looks amazing, the concept sounds amazing, but it just wasn't done ""right"".Ultimately the game is not horrible and I am sure that I could still enjoy some matches, but for the most part I just find the game lacking in many (needed and simple) ways. To give an example, this game is said to be RTS. While by definition I suppose it is, the strategy element is the weakest simply because every game mostly consists of unit spamming. It basically just comes down to who can get the biggest army the fastest, and there are very few opportunities for tactical flanking, unit countering, etc.The final nail in the coffin for this game (to me) was the Galactic Conquest mode. It sounded amazing and I was expecting something akin to Star Wars Empire at War. Instead it is quite literally nothing more than ""exploring"" a pre-generated map, and whenever you encounter an enemy force, you then have to fight it. There are no turns, so the enemy does nothing, and the only ""strategy"" involved is you having to choose which units you can build via which ""techs"" you hang on to (you can only hold three at the beginning). Oh and you don't research the techs, you find them on planets...At any rate, I just can't give this game a positive review. It had the potential to be awesome, but I feel that it failed.			"

												This developer has gone a very dishonest route by releasing a ""standalone addon"" that includes patches and upgrades to functionality that had been promised for this game, but has not been provided.I had held reviewing this product until this new release, hoping the developer would fulfill their promises and obligations even though they had released PA early and incomplete.  I now hold no such hope or illusion, they have abandoned PA and all the supporters whom had paid good money.  They used a very deceitful way to re-release the same product with a patch and get rid of the negative reviews.  At this time there is nothing to prevent them getting this negative review.  They have decided to hide the negative reviews they got for this product by making a new product and calling it a standalone addon but it is nothing more than a somewhat patched version of this game with features that had been promised for this game.The developer should release PA: Titans to everyone whom already owned PA during the Early Access period.  Anything less is a dishonest and deceitful tactic.  Valve should be held equally culpable for this deceitful and dishonest business activity.			"

Oh, goody!...Look Mommy!!  I can review this fine, completed, ineffable, incredible, exceptional and transcendental...sorry, sorry, that's my bad....I meant preposterous and laughable release yet again because, after the game got slammed by those of us who backed it in Early Access, got f*cked over, then the devs took it off Steam, then resubmitted it some months later so the ratings would be reset and they hoped for better reviews. AHEM This release, despite what they may say, or what you have been led to believe, is NOT what the finished product was supposed to be, even WITH the ""Digital Deluxe Commander Bundle"" addition.  A large number of us bought this game whilst it was available through Early Access, (Yes, yes, I know, we're f*cking dumba**es for doing that), and were promised what seemed to amount to being a brilliant bit of software once they had finished it......However.....They decided to do half a job and then release that as a completed game.  It was not.  The extra units in-game that were promised suddenly weren't included anymore, neither were several other features.  So we kinda felt ripped-off, (quite understandably, I think), and watched in despair as the money we had poured into the development for this game through EA was, for all intents and purposes, basically stolen.  Yes, we had paid for the game so the money wasn't physically ripped from our wallets but the game that we got, after the devs decided to do their cash-grab, WAS NOT  in ANY  way whatsoever, the game that we were promised...So, yes, I think that basically amounts to theft, in my books.  Now this is where it gets real good. Having placed their many, many, many thousands of pounds/dollars/euros/whatever in their pockets now, this game was put on the ""Ignore"" list, and what happened then? What was it?? Oh, yeah, Planetary Annihilation: Titans was released.........and, oh, look at that!  The features and units that we were promised for this release are now being sold as a completely different game now, even though the only real differences are the features that we had their words were being included here.  So we have this game and we have the ""different"" version that is PA: Titans, the differences being that the extra stuff that is in Titans were promised for this release, yet they've chosen to release Titans as a completely separate and different game, for the full price again, despite the ""extras"" that would amount to a DLC, AT MOST  from other developers.  Well, Uber, you f*cked us all royally and you didn't even have the courtesy to give us a reach-around while you were doing it!!  Devs like you are the reason that Early Access gets so much sh*t from people.  Hell, why didn't you just release a Unity pack as a full game and have done with it?? So, yeah, I'm a small, petty little man but if my review goes towards somebody thinking twice about buying this game, then I suppose that's some small consolation and I can rest easier knowing that I haven't got a chafed sphincter for nothing.  Sorry about the length of the b*tching but it had to be said			"

												So first of, why all the negativity?Well the game is certainly not without it's faults. It has had a rocky start and some people do have problems with even getting it to run properly without crashing. But it is getting better.The latest version is by far the best version. The new balancing and tweaks for units make it so much better in many ways. Compared to a few months ago, when I bought it (oct 2014) it is much better. The fixes for stability and performance was really needed and can't be appreciated enough.The future looks bright as the game continues to be developed and gain features and fixes. For those that want to play around there is an excellent tool for mods, PAMM (Planetary Annihilation Mod Manager). With that you can install, uninstall, update mods with just a few clicks. Mods range from UI tweaks and hotkeys to overhauls that change the whole gamebalance. Some even adding in new units.Well worth looking into even if you only want to add teamcolours to commanderexplosions.So what is the game.Well it is a game where you balance economy with expansion while trying to stop you oponents to gain economy and expand. The goal is to defend and keep your commander alive while finding and killing your oponents commanders. Depending on what skillevel you land on you will find the game as a nice slow basebuilding excersise (not appreciated style in multiplayer ;) ), or a spamfest where the goal is just to outproduce you oponent and overwhelm them or, lastly, as toptier you will have a real good spamfest but also with an intense need for always making the most of everything. Meaning you will need to micro armycomposition. Making sure your anti-air isn't in the front getting slaughtered. Doing that in a couple of places is one thing now do it in up to ten places on a sphere. Then introduce more spheres, more oponents. It gets hectic, frustrating and really rewarding when you manage to have some control.The game really scales very well to. You can play 10 people on a small planet and have an intence fight from start or you can play 2v2v2v2 starting on a planet for each team. It is up to what you and the ones you play with wants.There is a 1v1 ladder that presses skill hard on those that need it. This is where you can see the balance of the game shine (or not :P). It is easy to get into and replays are available to study what the good players does that works.Actually the replaysystem in it self can merit some mentioning. they call it ChronoCam. It makes the whole game into something that can best be compared to a videoplayer. Jump around, change speed and so on is all there. The really amazing thing is that while you play a game you can jump into ChronoCam anytime and rewind to see what you missed. Not something you will use often but still a fun thing.While 1v1 ladders rarely (never?) end up advancing the tech to tier 2  there is a largescale endtech war to be had. It involves planet vs planet where the goal is to get a beachhead with a teleporter to massinvade from you homeplanet. Or you could scout the location of the enemy commander and target the location with a nuke volley to punch through the anti-nuke defences. Just before christmas they also added the Unitcannon. Big artillery piece that lobs units to any place in the system with pinpoint accuracy. With it you can land a harassmentforce righ inside you enemy's base.It really is a game that will reward those that embrace it. But it also isn't a game for everybody.Addendum 2015-05-25In response to kwiksilver344's comment2 days ago they launched pte-82000 with way to much balancing tweaks and bugfixes to post here. One month between patches is comparatively high when it comes to games when they contain so much changes.Yes the saves bit are bugged. Quoted from the pte changelog....Originally posted by PA Forum:Saving a Galactic War game has not changed. Select Save Game (Beta), wait about 5-10 seconds, then exit out of the game. You can exit by selecting Quit to desktop.Please note, selecting “Quit to Main Menu” will not save the game.There are sadly plenty of aspects of the game that could be described as underdeveloped. But for them to prioritizing the multiplayer aspect is only natural. That is where the game shines. The singelplayer bit (galaxy War) is very lackluster.I can also recomment cheking out PAMM (Planetary Annihilation Mod Manager). There are plenty of things to play around with including big overhauls that change the whole game around.   PTE is a testbuild branch you can opt into via the the steam client. It is where new balance tweaks gets tested before hitting the live branch.Addendum 2015-06-13As of writting the game has had an overhaul for the singleplayer content. It is much much better balanced and fun now. Still not epic but good enough for some fun. The game is still very much a multiplayer game.Another addition is the functionality to use chronocam(replayfeature) to rewind the game and now resume playing from an earlier point of the game. (Button marked beta so it might need some more love)Worth mentioning is that by now there is also a save/load functionality in the game. Something a lot of players have been screaming for.There are still those that have to make an effort to solve issues with drivers and such to get the game working. Most issues should be solvable though.			"

												I've been playing this RTS since the initial alpha release, I've watched it steadily get better and better over time.  If you enjoyed Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander this game captures a similar (note: similar, not identical) feel, but with a unique approch using spherical maps (you can have one or multiple planets)The highlight of this game for me is playing with a group of friends in team games with shared armies.  I played a good deal of SupCom / SupCom:FA with friends and while it was fun, it just didn't capture the same feeling of team cooperation that you can get from sharing a single set of units working with your friends.  Shared armies lets you split up the management of the game by not forcing any one single person to keep track of everything (and in large games over multiple planets, this can be difficult)  Tasks such as economy expansion, scouting and raiding, orbital and multi-planet expansion can be split among teammates.  This does require a degree of cooperation as there is a single shared resource pool, but the benefits are well worth it.			"

When we got to start playing, I was very excited to see what the lore had developed like- but this is really just an RTS smash-em-up, with no soul. TA had more unique units and combat method, and was trapped with a 2d platform. On the whole, great if you want to play multiplayer, bad if you want to play a grand RTS story.			"

												Unfinished. And the developers are completely incompetant. Made people pay $90 and then produced this garbage, then rarely updated and even released DLC for an unfinished game. I regret purchasing this. DO NOT BUY. It is unfinished and STILL overpriced. Why would anyone pay for this?			"

												And here it goes. Yet another big scam on steam. First they start out by charging their backers insane amounts (90 dollars for early access) and then they slowly go down. Selling their unfinished game for as low as 5 dollars. And now they come and rebrand it with a shiny ""new"" addition that should have been in the base game (as they promised in their kickstarter campaign) and charge 30 for it again.This behaviour is unacceptable. The game itself brings a novel idea and feature of planetary wars, which is nice but everything else is very basic and limited. And now they add a feature that is considered standart by the users and charge for it. Going as far as disabling the original games sales.If you have any dignity, stay away from this and any other Uber Ent. game. They all end bad for the customers. Just look up their history.			"

This is game is the supreme example of early access gone wrong.  The bad part is that this had so much potential. This game with 2 proper factions and a good single player campain would have been very good. As the game is now it still has a half a game feel. Thankd god that Ashes of the Singularity is going to be evrithing this game is not. Dont waste you time and money like I did, and consider not buying anithing that this studio produces.			"

								I'm changing my review for this game.I've owned this game for several months now and the updates still have not made this game worth any ammount of money. Stay clear of this game till it is 100% complete. It has allot of potential. But until it's a finished product, don't waste your money. They've made a fortune from those of us who have bought it and are delivering sub par results.			"

												Well, let's just say I told you so. It is far from being ready to be played. I'm a huge RTS fan. Planetary Annihilation has been on my radar for the past weeks. I was super excited for the game. As a huge Supreme Commander fan, I wanted something similar with different gameplay. For that point, I wasn't disappointed. You still have a commander and unlimited amount of units to your command. The scale is huge, which make the game more interesting. However, the game lack in terms of performance. I have a good rig, and I'm not shy against graphical settings. When you hit the thirty minutes mark, expect an immense drop in frame rates. Here's why: you are streaming the game. Your computer is never working hard. My graphic card usually make a bunch of noise due to heat (you get the point), but not with this game. The game needs to be connected to an ongoing internet connection. It destroys the entire experience. Each time you generate a game, you generate a server on the Uber service. When the action is getting high, the game is extremely slow due to poor server maintenance.  It's far from being DRM-free. You can't play offline. Nope. Never. Forget it.So, you get the point: no servers, no game. It's simple as that.My $60 experience so far was to explore the menu. My games are never loading up because the servers are not responsive. I was extremely excited about the game. I dreamed to play the game. Now, I have nightmares. If you want to play a new RTS experience, give it a shot. It is not that bad. I actually liked it, if I was able to play. Unfortunately, painful drops in performance and weird servers maintenance make the game not fun at all. Try it in a couple months. Simply hold your money for now, or buy Supreme Commander. After all, it is pretty much the same game, but with much more content (and yes, much cheaper).If you're still skeptical about the performance you might get, go check it out on YouTube. There's plenty of let's plays. You'll eventually encounter - no, you will - bad frame rates. It's like getting a game but the engine is so poorly optimized that the frame rate is awful. You wouldn't get this game for that reason, right? Well, it's the same scenario here, but the cause is the Uber servers.			"

Early Access Review
								I still enjoy this game for what it is, of course there are plenty of people who bash it because the devs didn't add everything before release or broke proclaimed promises, that you have to go spend quite a lot of time searching for. I liked this game because it was simply macro upon macro with no need to micro a lot, it isn't Supreme Commander with 4 different nations with several different tech tiers which each has advantages and disadvantages, it is more like Total Annihilation with a good mix of units with some being for the most part obsolete. It has its bugs and annoying moments, sometimes one will have to Alt+F4 because they can't get something to work and lose their entire current game. But when I see hundreds of units blowing up other hundreds of units it is entertaining enough that it was worthwhile. It has a few balance issues regarding usefulness of units, just like how some units were in Total Annihilation, such as Naval being obsolete unless you start on a water planet and Orbital Defenses being spammed late game as the only useful defense since it covers both the Orbital and Surface without being easily destroyed. It also has no unique feel to anything except the fact that it is the only popular-ish game that lets you watch hundreds of units just shoot and blow things up while being blown up. Total annihilation started the Macro Large Scale RTS genre and was quite revolutionary. Supreme Commander took Total Annihilation's gameplay and made it unqiue by giving Factions different strengths and weaknesses and a much more interesting storyline. Planetary Annihilation took Total Annihilation's gameplay and made it much simple, gave it a few twerks and just made it a game where you enjoy explosions and explosions. Just to make it simple:Pros:  - Simple. - Lots of Explosions. - Newbie Friendly. - Runs pretty well considering at times there is thousands of units. - Rather mod friendly in comparision to some other games. - Unique maps as well as a unique and confusing, at times, map creator.Cons: - Buggy randomly. - Useless Units. - Unique Map system can be clunky and make some content obsolete . - Rather slow updates regarding basic game content, such as saving which hasn't been around for a while. - Stalemates happen a lot when players start on two planets. - Lack of variety in appearances, only Commanders have different models, the rest is done by team colour. - On low end systems, it can quickly become unplayable. Beta Review Below:"" This game, currently in Beta, has been through a lot lately. I wasn't in the Alpha but I am in the Beta versions. It is a simple large-scale real time strategy ( or Large-RTS ) with a unique look and feel. Now I've always been a fan of Large RTS games despite the lack of them; Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander were the two Large RTS games I've played and enjoyed a lot, despite me not being the best at them. But comparing this game to those two, it is a lot smoother and easily more playable for newbies.This game is worth while for those who enjoy large battles with hundreds of units and no unit capacity ( as of right now anyway ) and a lot of explosions. But sadly it gets repetitive as of right now with the lack of visuals and variety between units and structures. But many games suffer from that in the real time strategy genre during early development and such. Now in my opinion the price is a bit too high for what it would be sold as during release and I think it should be lowered down slightly, but I'm not in control of prices so I couldn't change it. Also currently the main way games are ended in certain systems are via Nukes and Planetary Annihilation without a way to disable either right now. You can remove all small planets but nukes still exist.For visuals and audio this game is actually quite nice, even the explosions, it is unique and does well to follow the Total Annihilation way of keeping a player wanting to play the game over and over. Basicly right now it is a Total Annihilation game on a planetary scale but a lot smoother. I also wish to point out that it is quite demanding on your computer if you wish for a system with more then a few worlds, sadly. Sure some people would be able to run it but others may not and might have to stick to maybe a couple of worlds as ususal, which is currently the default.Galactic War was added with the Galactic War Update. It is more like a Skirmish against bots at the current moment of time with a 'turn' system in between battles and technologys. Really it isn't much more then that, so unless you find that interesting you might as well stick with Skirmish.So I would recommend this game but you have to remember it is in Early Access and isn't completely finished, it needs more units and structures currently and the developers are trying hard to please a large variety of players. So if you would enjoy this kind of game go ahead and buy it early or wait till it is finished. ""			"

Ive been out of the strategy genre for a while now but I feel as if this particular game is the perfect grand return to the scene. It can be a bit challenging trying to master all of the multi tasing necessary to be successful ad its definitely about production and managing your ecnomy to outproduce your enemy. After a few practice games you can easily get the hang of it. Great game.			"

												Seven months after release, this game is still really in an ""early release"" state. Given some of the design decisions, I'm not sure it will ever be what fans had hoped for. There are still fundamental stability bugs -- the game will simply lockup for no apparent reason. On a high-end game pc, even on the lowest graphics setting, the game will sometimes slow down to a point of unplayability. There is no story in single player, and no meaningful variation in the planets -- they look slightly different but strategy is fundamentally the same. The AI is weak.I could go on. For example, there are a handful of high end units that completely destroy game balance. Without certain other high end units you *cannot* win. There are strategies that will insure complete deadlock. After sticking with it for all this time, this is very disappointing.			"

												Bought this game when it was $80. Didn't get anything for supporting. You only got special stuff if you bought it when it was in beta or earlier. How much is it now? $20? Something like that. Enitially, I wasn't too angry; I felt that I supported the dev team, and that the $80 would go towards making the already awesome game, better. The gameplay itself is pretty awesome; being able to smash planets and all. It used to really take some resources, but with all the updates it runs great now (Would still recommend an SSD). So yah, the game it self is pretty great. But....NOW THEY CAME OUT WITH A FREAKING STANDALONE EXPANSION THAT COSTS EXTRA $$$. They could have at least given us access to it if I paid $80 for this game. Chances are now they're gonna stop focusing on the original, and work on the expansion.			"

												The developers for this game can choke on my sodden♥♥♥♥♥♥Why? One big reason, I was an early access buyer for this game, hell, by that I mean I freaking paid during the Kickstarter.Over the first year of development I was fairly optimistic, then the updates seem to matter less and less and the potential started frying in the sun like a savagely foul turd.Then they decided to release it, they release this unfinished, bug-ridden, unbalanced garbage pile of a game, promised to fix it (for god's sake you couldn't even save during singleplayer), and then promptly gave up on it.After that, through some insane ungodly act of complete lunacy and rage-inducing stupidity, they release an ""expansion"" (in quotes because I considered the god damn thing to really be a patch that was the final product we SHOULD have received) and ask me to pay again to receive the game I should have gotten in the first place.Are you kidding me? A pithy little discount? Screw you, screw you god dammit. I was frothing mad, there was slime dribbling out my mouth and pure rancid acid splashing out my bunghole as the crushing pressure of hatred condensed my body into a singular black lump of complete and utter loathing for the nincompoops that dribbled this hideous abortion of a game out of their diseased birth canals.The developers of this game can eat my♥♥♥♥♥ they can stew in their own fetid consommé of DEATH while they stew in hell until the heat death of the universe.For an actual review, this game is profound garbage, the unit selection is abysmal, the balancing is beyond inane, air superioty rules all, the planet system offers nothing but a fairly new way of managing logistics (but that's about it), the graphics are stunningly bland and lack the oomph of Supreme Commander or Total Annihilation, the singleplayer is absolute trash a metagame that contributes nothing of value, and there aren't even saves, how are there not any saves?There's no saves. They said there were going to be saves and then they said, no saves. What kind of crazy nonsense is that?Developers saying there will be one thing but then that thing isn't there? Are developers losing their things? Are the things being used for butt holes? My answer is yes.If there was a physical copy of Planetary Annihilation, you might be able to use it for your butt hole, but there isn't, so there's nothing of value you can do with this game.			"

												TLDR: This game is awful. At any price. ITS REDEEMING FEATURE, ITS SCALE, IS HANDLED BY SLOWING DOWN TO BE UNUSABLE - BY DESIGN. THINK ABOUT THAT BEFORE YOU BUY - THE DEVS ARE SO BAD THEY COULDN'T MAKE THIS WORK ANY OTHER WAY.Uber is extremely dishonest and has opted to release a totally half-baked product, on a massive cost (it started at $99!) with DLC and a new title entirely before even properly finishing the first one.Planetary Annihilation's huge draw is supposed to be its scale. Multiple planets, thousands of units. Instead, load times are obscene, and the absolute kicker: it doesn't take long at all until the game throttles so badly that it's unplayable BY DESIGN.I'm in a game with 5 AI factions and one human player, and it's running 14s per 1s in game. The game's solution to its own untenable scale is to throttle down until its scale works - which means it fails horribly for the player and is extremely uninteresting.This game could be fantastic, but that alone makes it almost complete, unusuable garbage. IF YOUR GAME CANNOT HANDLE A FEATURE WITHOUT THE ONLY SOLUTION BEING ""THROTTLE DOWN TO 3 FRAMES PER MINUTE, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY NOT CONSIDER IT A FEATURE WORTH ADVERTISING"".I got it on sale, @$26, and it was still more than this game is worth. It is my sincere hope Uber goes out of business completely and a competent developer decides to try and make the game PA should have been. Garbage. Complete and utter throttled garbage. DO NOT BUY THIS. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY.			"

The UI and information presentation is quite bad, the balance is somewhat questionable, but the most glaring error is in the core design of the server-side everything. And the single player might as well not even be there; one could say it was tacked on, but tacks are often of higher quality than this.			"

My Point?Every shot cannot hit - every shot MUST not hit!You are essentially making cold machines with zero nerve - all the while slowly locking the game up, as you unit number starts to climbe. Im runing on a gtx980, i74770, 16gb, 2160p and it lags, stutters and hang.Which leads me back to that initial statement.Dont get into early acces - dont buy an unfinished product. "

												Could have been so much more than it is. Did not live up to the hype. The game is unfinished, there's no tutorial, which it needs because it's quite a complex game, and the units aren't very well balanced. Bringing in the original narrator from the old Total Annihilation game to narrate the intro was a nice touch, but the game otherwise lacks a clear storyline, compared to the rich storyline TA had.I want to like this game, I really do, and it's not a bad game per se. But to understand the game and play it well you need to have played the original TA.			"

												Bottom line: While a cool take on an RTS, this game is extremely frustrating. I don't think I will play it again for quite some time.Edit: after having returned to this review a little more level-headed, I have decided to err in favor of a positive review. I have added some positive points below.Edit 2: I apologize for how long this review ended up being. I also just saw how many hours Steam has logged for me playing PA. This is partly due to what I mention in bullet 2.Yes, I am writing this after just being completely hosed in my one and only multiplayer, ranked 1v1 match. Yes, I am writing this after coming from having been recently annihilated on my very last battle in the Galactic War I was in (the furthest I had ever gotten up to that point). Yes, I'm not by any stretch the greatest RTS player out there (but I really thought I was getting the hang of PA after several hours of play). And yes, I'm probably not in the best frame of mind to write an unbiased review. Still, for now, I'm sticking to my opinion above. Let me tell you why:This is not a casual game. There is no Easy Mode.For some games, that is okay.  Some time ago,  I reviewed FTL: Faster Than Light. In FTL, the fact that there is no easy mode is okay because, while it is difficult, all you really need to do better is know how to plan upgrades and know when to pause during a fight (hint: very often). With those two skills, and a measure of patience, your only really challenging enemy is bad luck. In a game with no significant curves thrown at you, you can work through it without a ton of effort most of the time.This is only kind of true with PA. In PA, you either do the right thing, maximizing productivity all the time, or lose (and in the case of a Galactic War - permanently). There's very little room for error. Really, the only way to win any fight is to pause often and issue several orders at once. Otherwise you are just going too slowly to keep up. While this is not always a bad thing, I feel it is a little inappropriate for a Real-Time Strategy game.With the tech options at your disposal, there are often only a couple of paths you can take to success. If you can build a vehicle factory, do it right away and pump out tanks and AA. If you have air factory tech, focus even more on that and pump out bombers. Always play offensively; there is no such thing as a defensive win unless you already have a serious advantage. Don't interrupt the natural progression of building - make cheap units and buildings first until you have a lot of excess metal and energy. Trying to shoot immediately to an advanced factory, as I have often tried, always fails. Expand as fast as possible, across your start planet and to other planets. In the endgame, metal is always your most restrictive resource, so grab as much as you can as early as you can.When you are able to do it right and win, it is a satisfying win. But in the final battles of a Galactic War, you already start significantly overwhelmed, meaning you have to take out as many commanders as fast and early as humanly possible or you lose - badly.There is no way to save and return to a fight - so they always have to be finished in one sitting, or paused and left running.Now, I have read somewhere on the forums that is mostly because the developers have to do more optimizations on their end to have the ability to save games using the Chrono Cam, which is basically a replay feature very similar to what you find in the Dirt racing series (or at least Dirt 2). The idea is that, when fully implemented, you can open a saved game (or the one you are in) and rewind/fastforward to any point you choose, and pick up right where you left off. While this will indeed be a very cool feature when implemented (it's one of the things that really sold me about Dirt 2), it doesn't make up for the fact that currently there is no saving at all, not even a stop-gap feature until the Chrono Cam saves are done. This seems like a pretty basic omission to a game not still in beta.There are still some aspects of actual play that feel unfinished. One of the larger examples is planet-smashing. While I have not yet smashed a smaller planet into a larger one (to supposedly achieve the crater effect shown in the promo video), I have successfully smashed some fairly equally-sized planets together - and the resulting animation is completely underwhelming. The attacking planet approaches along a path that often has several unrealistic jerks, it lines up with the target, and runs into it. That's pretty much it. There's no planet-crumbling explosions that shatter it into a thousand pieces or widespread surface deformation as they collide. The model for the two planets simply overlap breifly until they each reach the other's core, and then both instantly disappear. The only evidence that planets once existed there are the mushroom cloud(s) of whatever commander(s) you destroyed still billowing up from the invisible surface of a now non-existent planet.Other smaller issues:- The relatively small number of structures and units. This would be different if there were some faction-specific units with differing strengths/weaknesses. Right now, the only difference between two armies' units is their color.- The pause screen banner has an invisible no-click zone above and below it, requiring repositioning the camera until the desired selection is in the bottom or top quarter of the screen before you can click it.- Sometimes after selecting a group of units, the arrow keys stop working; so that you must first deselect the units, move the camera so that you can see the units and the target, then selecting the units and issuing the order.Also, in case you are wondering, I always play with the maxed out (""Uber"") graphics preset and can still get a good framerate, so that is not the issue.Okay, with those negative points out of the way, here are some positive ones:The general idea behind Planetary Annihilation is certainly ambitious and, if successfully fleshed out, will be totally awesome.PA is still a pretty solid RTS. Play on a single planet feels like it should for any standard RTS (my opinion from my perhaps limited experience).Interplanetary gameplay adds a whole new dimension to an otherwise well-explored genre.Kill your opponents by blowing up their planets. Make it a destruction by collision with another massive body, or with a frickin' laser beam, Death Star style.If planet destruction isn't your cup of tea, then you could try a much more subtle death-by-bajillion-nukes. The mushroom clouds are quite pretty.If that's still a bit strong for your taste, then there's always the classic invasion-with-hundreds-and-hundreds-of-units method.The community seems to be a good one, and the developers do interact and take feedback on the forums.Ultimately I decided to mark this a positive review, but only just. As I said above, PA can be very frustrating for several reasons, but that is at least partly balanced by how unique it is, and how awesome it has the potential to be.			"

												Its time for closure of PA review after the many updates released of the game. Despite of many balances, changes and fix. I still can't feel the fun of the game itself. The Galactic War gameplay remain disappointed and hopefully someone in the MOD community can fix the problem what Uber fail to do. Be advises the latest build doesn't contain any save in game until today so once your commander kill, you have to restart all over again.Only the multiplayers are fun to play so far but there are majority prefer playing single player mode. Sadly this is not the right game for you.			"

												EDIT: Uber have now released an offline mode, but it came months late. For that reason, I am leaving my original review as-is, and I continue not to recommend the game. (Besides, I'm afraid it simply isn't that good a game.)I backed this on Kickstarter, always looked forward to it. But my university's firewall prevents the game connecting to servers. Uber said that fully off-line play would be included (100% DRM-free etc). However, even though the game is now ""released"", there is no sign of any offline mode and I am still completely unable to play the game. Be warned: if you are behind a firewall or network you don't 100% control, do not buy this game. In fact, don't but it at all: Uber have lied to their backers. Don't give them your money.			"

												I hate to not recommend this, but I have too.Edit: Thanks to the few commenters who stayed on track.TA fan since release, Skipped all the SC business, thought I'd risk it again on PA (Still have TA and all its DL units installed now <3 Cavedog!).Single player:You will start with 1 commander as always, Proceed to build Energy, metal extractors, fabrication plants, constructers for more/higher plants, then you'll be spamming units endlessly.That's fine in and of itself, yet by the time you have 20 units, the AI commander has 50 already bombing your production lines, By the time you can send a fleet to bomb theirs, they will have hundereds swarming your base the second you select your units and give the order, All of them bombing your Commander, IF you are lucky, your units MIGHT get to see their command before their entire force swarms your Commander within the first 20-30 mins...With every available mineral node used, adequate energy production, constructers helping production lines, you will still be too slow to stand a chance against the stupidly overpowered AI on the lowest of difficulties.99% of all units die in 1 hit, some take 2-3, tops.Even with fully mixed squads there will be times when they just sit there, as the enemy units wipe a group of 40+ of your units, who never even return fire even though they are set to patrol.Almost no help to new players, No tutorial, a ""How to play"" card that consists of a few ""Tips"" only, no intro to the plethora of shortcuts needed for management, no intro to tactics, no intro period.Looks great... besides Explosions looking completly out of place, and not fitting with the theme of the game at all.like seriously... Huge immersion breaker right there seeing this big stupid cell shaded smoke cloud that looks made for a 16-bit console, right next to Normal/Bump/Spec mapped high resolution units/terrain textures... To who ever was the art designer for the explosion effect?NO, NO, BAD, NO.You took the gorgeous planets, units, textures and made them feel cheap and nasty, because I'm always waiting for the big orange cartoon show to start.Runs fine.Plays like a bag of wet socks.MP might be better, but TA/PA was never about Multiplayer to types like me...I came back looking for the 3+ hour long battles with thousands of units going nuts....Hugely dissapointed and will definitely be considering the refund option, as the Single player experience feels nothing short of broken.

Early Access Review
								This review is relevant as of 25/06/2014 using version Galactic .67523GameplayThe Gameplay for Planetary Annihilation consists of having a commander that is dropped on a planet, and having to build up your base, carefully managing an economy so that you don’t expand too quickly or too slowly, while building a massive armada of troops that you will use to help annihilate your enemies.A match takes place across a solar system and depending on what kind of solar system you are fighting on (does it have moons? How many planets? Etc) it drastically changes what kind of tactics you will have to use and what kind of approach you need to take to beat the enemy.For fans of Supreme commander this game will seem extremely familiar, with some of the supreme commander team being behind this game, it retains the feel that supreme commander had and most importantly it does not dumb down itself for the masses, it retains a great deal of complexity while accurately achieving the “easy to learn hard to master” feel. You will have to manage orbital, aerial, naval, and land troops to achieve victory. This can be slightly overwhelming when you are managing multiple planets and is the only downside to the Gameplay. But if your cup of tea happens to be managing a massive amount of troops in a gigantic scale then that will not be a downside for you.In the multiplayer side of things you can have multiple people playing as the same faction, or being able to command each-others armies. This means you can have a 3v1 against the computer (who of course can manage all their troops no problem) and have a challenging time. The resources are balanced depending on the breakdown of the teams, so if you are 3 v 1 the 1 will get a 3x resources boost to keep things balanced.I give Gameplay a 9/10 only losing 1 point for sometimes being difficult to manage the scale of things, but I stress that this is personal preference and that I know other players who enjoy this aspect very much.GraphicsGameplay is a much more important aspect of a game for me than graphics. But those who have a much higher standard for graphical fidelity will not be disappointed. The game looks fantastic and the planets are visually pleasing, the graphics are as realistic as they need to be while retaining a very high quality look about them.There is not much more I can say about the graphics other than they look fantastic, the game can sometimes slow down when there is a large system with a lot going on (this game is demanding on your system specs) but overall this does not detract from Gameplay. With it being early access there is still optimisation to be done so the finished product will run a lot smoother.I give graphics a 9/10 only losing out to slowdowns when there is quite a large amount going on it a system.BalanceThe game balance is still somewhat lacking in most departments, although the developers have made some passes at correcting the game balance it is still unbalanced in many aspects.In multiplayer some units get neglected in favour of others because they are far better than their same-tiered counterparts which should not be the case. The units should each fill in different roles and have different strengths/weaknesses rather than just an overall better feel to them.Galactic warfare needs some more balancing on its technology side of things before it is an acceptably balanced game mode. With the locking away of certain technologies, some things become completely uncounterable and the player cannot even choose to branch out into these technologies that can counter the enemies due to the strange RNG system that the developers have went with for Galactic warfare.I give balance a 5/10, for the most part the balance is acceptable and the game is playable, the galactic warfare drags this down quite significantly but the multiplayer experience is not detracted (simply because people tend to use the same overpowered units and it cancels out)BugsBeing early access it is natural to expect bugs therefore I will not go into many details about the bugs that are In the game and only briefly cover the current state of the gameThe game as it is right now is surprisingly bug free, some things such as the pause button going off the screen and the game not connecting to the game servers (which you NEED to do to play the game at all) can be very irritating, but the support for the game is good and the developers have a good track record of swatting bugs as they come up with frequent updates.This section does not get a score, simply because it doesn’t seem appropriate to put this into the averaged score at the end of the review being that it is early access.Overall Overall I think if you like supreme commander, and you want a game that feels like what supreme commander 2 should have been like, you should most certainly buy this game. In early access it is already extremely fun and playable with a great community and vibrant multiplayer.With offline play coming up soon the issue of having to play it connected will no longer be a problem, which was one of my major gripes with the game at first.Overall this game gets an 8/10 from me. Very worth the £10 I spent on the steam sale for the game and most certainly worth the full price as well.			"

												Uber Entertainment lost my trust. TITANS stand-alone expansion is a relatively small content expansion. It's on the scale of a DLC, but considering the current questionable state of the base game, the broken promises by the devs, delayed core mechanics, lack of a tutorial, constant buggy releases and overall lack of content there's no doubt it should have been a free patch.https://www.change.org/p/uber-entertainment-planetary-annihilation-titans-stop-making-us-pay-for-what-we-already-paid-forSign the Petition. If Uber Entertainment complies, it's a massive step towards regaining my, and many others their trust.A big reason they are making it a stand-alone expansion is to get rid of the mixed reviews, but ofcourse it's a great way to try to drain our wallets some more. Even though some of us paid more for this game than any other game they've ever bought, and that while some of us still don't feel it's a complete game, due to persistent bugs and the general lack of content.This is some way to treat your loyal fans, apparently the loyalty is not returned. Let it be known that this company does not play fair. You'd expect it from the big ones, but we MADE you, show some gratitude. You've lost my trust Uber Entertainment, and by extend access to my wallet.			"

												Releasing Titans as a separate game and pulling PA from the steam store is a new low in development shadiness. It's obvious they want to edit and exploit their past. Why not simply call it Titans? Because they want more money from all that paid during the sales. Why not simply make it a content upgrade or (shudder) DLC even? Because they want to bury the legacy of bad reviews and complaint well earned up to this point.Gotta love the divide and conquer model because it has already worked. Now instead of players ostensibly watch dogging developers, it'll be plebs vs elites based on who paid uber more, with each pleb having to decide if they want to pay to keep previous gains in the form of paying the new entrance fee, or walk away from the game entirely, in either case providing a win for the elites and uber. Uber because they would certainly rather have a concentrated base of high and frequently paying players who are eager for any form of fiscal/development abuse.And elites because they would rather be surrounded by people patting them on the back for over paying as if having disposable income is a character virtue.I suppose I should thank uber and their whiteknights for sparing me future hours of modding frustration. Though it's sad that my work to this point has been sentenced to a slow death.Had I posted this in the forum only a few people will have read it before being deleted and I'm banned, or it'd have been held up and mocked at which point I'd have the choice of being banned in defending myself or letting the white knights have the last words.So I'm posting it here instead.Edit:

9/10""You can see your enemies' buildings&units... when their planet passes yours - holy♥♥♥♥♥♥""Planetary Annihilation is a true Real-Time-Strategy game. It's set in a non human galaxy where robot commanders have to regain power by building up their base and army to annihilate the other commanders. The special thing about PA is the ""map"" is a galaxy and you play on whole (3D)planets and not only a (2D)square map. You can choose if you want to fight on 1 or many planets. Also there are no limitations, neither in the amount of buildings nor units. But beware, if your commander dies your whole base will, too. If you like C&C / Dune / Starcraft / Total Annihilation... PA might be exactly your thing!Pros:+ great multiplayer gaming value+ great ost&sound+ good graphics+ unlimited units & buildings+ crush a moon/planet into another+ real 3D maps (=planets)+ map is a solar system (=1 or 10+ planets)+ controllable PiP mode+ logical economy system  => metal+energy=produce+ logical unit skills & building functions+ ground- sea- air- & orbital units+ no overpowered ""fraction""+ no building site limitations+ no view distance/zoom limitations+ inter- & planetary nukes & anti-nukes!+ planetary annihilation laser cannon+ stargates & interplanetary transporters+ (map-)solar system editor+ multiplanet starting points+ community & mods+ Router disconnect / Blackout / CTD /... => restart game & easily rejoin the MP party!(compare this to a C&C disconnection=end of game) + and still more stuff to come...Cons:- massive battles are laggy (server-sided?!)

												A promising game with a bumpy development and mis-timed release. That's why PA has so many negative reviews. It's better now. Is it the best RTS? Probably not. Is it fun? Yes it is. The whole multi-planet thing is a  really great feature, especially with the new unit cannon. The metal planet and smashing is cool too. Is it as good as say, SupCom: FA? No, with less units and less balence, no. But it's still a great game with fantastic soundtrack, and again, multi-planets can be confusing, but it is wonderful.9/10 I recommend it, but it's not the best RTS.			"

												Firstly, understand that people are more likely to review a game if they percieve it negatively than positively.It is true that PA has some issues (naval balance, etc). It was also released too early, in my opinion, since offline was not included among other reasons. However, offline mode is now a part of the game in the latest beta build, and should be added to the main build within the next 24 hours.Overall, this is a seriously fun game that breaks new ground in the RTS genre. On these spherical maps, you can be attacked from any direction. On the flip side though, you can use this to your advantage to pull off sneak attacks from an unexpected vector. Orbital play and the ability to move between planets adds yet more depth and complexity.I have heard other people complain about the controls, but for the most part I find them adequate. You can assign control groups to make selecting specific armies easier, as in most good RTS games. The current hotkey support is limited, but you can download the ""Hotbuild2"" mod using PA Mod Manager to assign hotkeys to build specific structures and units. Camera anchor points let you jump to saved locations at the press of a key.Graphical performance was great for me on my Lenovo Y410p laptop with the GeForce 750M, 8GB of ram, and Core i7-4700MQ 2.4GHz processor. I rarely had any graphical glitches. If you are having performance trouble, the first thing you need to do is update your graphics drivers and make sure PA is using discrete as opposed to integrated graphics if applicable.The AI features four difficulty levels, and is a competent opponent to fight if you aren't comfortable with PvP play.Now, on to nitpicks. The biggest issue I see right now is naval balance. Although it has improved markedly, naval pathing is still a bit buggy. Naval units in general are too slow, and don't provide enough bang for their buck. An expensive ship can quickly be demolished by a handful of tanks. Targetting of ground units is also poor. Orbital units ought to be a bit more varried, and I wish there was a multi-unit interplanetary carrier. Teleporters are a bit too easy to set up. I'd rather have to land a small army with a transport to secure a beachhead, and then set up a teleporter for reinforcements. Overall, I think there need to be more and more specialized units.Aside from all that, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. You can ♥♥♥♥ing crash moons into planets, blow planets up with death star lazers, fill the skies with nukes, send nukes between planets...you have to play it to get it.A quick note on offline play, just released in the latest beta build. I tried it and it was completely stable. Uber recommends you don't play offline without 4 cores and 8GB of ram, but I was totally fine, at least in a 3 player game, with 2 cores (phyical cores, I don't know if logical cores count).Seriously, buy this game!

												If you would have asked me months ago what I thought about this game I would have slapped you and told you to throw your money at this game. After the release of Planetary Annihilation : Titans, I feel like Uber Entertainment just took a crap on my face. I pray Uber fails at their cash grab and I strongly hope everyone that reads this stays away from both games. So sorry for those whom have already been burned.			"

												One thing I really like about this game are the graphics, the minimalist style is very great, but one problem about Planetary Annihilation is that the gameplay is very repetitive and extremely limited. The only way I could recommend this game is if, like me, you can buy it at 2$.  This is the MOST OVERPRICED GAME I HAVE EVER SEEN.			"

												So when  this game came out it looked amazing and i had a couple hours of fun before just moving on because lack of content and just decided to wait on some updates to improve it. A couple of weeks went by and nothing really updated that changed the games content that much so i just found a new game and moved on (this was before steam refund policy)  It was probably worth a couple of hours of gameplay but thats about it with nothing new to make the game more exciting. I feel like this game is a example of bad company decisions to make money and has really disappointed me. This game has barely been out a year and it seems that they have given up on this game and moved on to the new ""Titans"" game they have released, looking the exact same as this game but with bigger leaders. I would NOT suggest this game to anyone because of this experience and will probably NEVER buy from this company again because of this. This ""Titans"" game should honestly should be a minor update to the original Planetary Annihilation.Short: Game comes out, played a bit, no big update to add content, new ""Titans"" game comes out that looks like the exact same game but for $40.Never going to buy from this company again, bad experience, almost worst than EA.

												DO NOT SUPPORT THIS DEVELOPER. They are part of a very bad trend of developers making promises charging for early access debugging and ditching the final product. The game has been ""RELEASED"" as complete nowhere near as far along as promised.Buying PA is like going to subway and making the whole sandwich yourself then being charged double and when you are handed your reciept they slap the sandwich out of your hand and tell you to ♥♥♥♥ing deal with it. I dont recommend supporting this new industry aprouch to selling games. we only hurt our selves and expose out self to poor development teams. For all the details check the forums and other negative reviews.			"

												So, I want to love this game. I really do. It's cleverly designed, has a lot of great ideas, and can be fun to play.HOWEVER...This game's fatal flaw is it's lack of organization tools.Every single time I play this, it's an annoying, confusing cluster and I can't figure out what's happening, where, or why. I lose time, lose efficiency, and then just lose because I had no idea which of my units were doing what, and where, and why.Here's the solution: Have a box somehwere on the screen where you can organize your units. I want a list of everything I have, and I want to able to click on a unit and see something like this:Missile Tank (click to give name)-Currently attacking Bot Factory-50/100 HP-Mode: Noneanother example:""ocean squad leader"" (Stealth Sub)-Currently on patrol-100/100 HP-Mode: Patrolanother:Fabrication Bot (click to give name)-Currently Building Advanced Bot Factory-100/100 HP-Mode: Auto ImproveI want to be able to click on any of the units in the list and switch the current camera to their view.I also want to be able to organize the list. Maybe have a default organization that you can set in the options (like checkboxes for ""Sort by unit type?"" or ""Sort by job?"") and be able to change it in game, by assigning groups of units their own drop-down box and name.I want to love this game... I really do. I can see that a lot of work was put into this game, and I admire the devs for their dedication and hard work... But I just can't play this game. It's like torture. I can't.			"

												Planetary Annihilation shows potential, yet over long time I didn't see any clue of the fun part. I understand the potential, but potential is not enough for fun, is just technically interresting, but without the fun part. the AI is strong and competitive which is good, but sometimes too much as he will take control easily of multiple planets, and if you play galactic war mode you may stuck without the technology necessary to win. yeah... there is no way to research the technology, you need the luck of getting the right cards. well, after a while i decided to give my negative feedback... srsly, how a strategy game relies on a random card? how is possible that this game is so unbalanced that everytime the AI has control of the orbit? I'm sure I am not the only one spotting those unbalance issues. how is possible the commander does not have a way to build an anti orbital missile from level 1? just broken... there are thousands of way to invade a panet I know, yet, if the planet is in total control of the AI you need advanced technology. this game is a race, and the only way to win is to destroy the AI immediately in less then 10 minutes or he will overwhelm you from multiple planets. if you are so good with AI, put some automation on the base production, to avoid getting stuck on the micro management and focus on the strategy, you cannot compete with the CPU speed on micro management. I am very disapponted... I want a serious campaign, not that crap mode of galactic war.			"

												I almost didn't buy this because of the bad reviews but I'm very glad that i did and that's my reason for leaving a review. As a big fan of Total Annihilation back in the day i can happily say that I'm not disappointed by Planetary Annihilation, it is a good quality successor and if you enjoyed TA then this should take you back.There are some minor balancing issues [bit of a noob comment from the time of review, the game seems fairly well balanced, however i'm sure it'll be tweaked further] but this should be fixed in future patches. The gameplay is fun, very fast paced and the strategy is more than deep enough to make wins satisfying but not so overly complex that it becomes tedious or unappealing.I have a feeling that some of the negative reviews and complaints about the strategy elements are down to a lack of a tutorial which is a shame. The game doesn't have lots and lots of units and buildings and no tech upgrades and so forth but in my opinion that's a good thing, it's much more about map control and resource management, it is essentially quite simple but that forces a purer form of strategy from the player who must think and react very quickly and creatively.+Enjoyable strategy.+Nice clean simple graphics.+Enjoyable 1v1 ranked matches.+Seems to be a fairly good community.+Can be very fast paced and fun 10 to 30 min battles, or longer more epic matches if desired.+Now very reasonably priced.-Some balancing issues. [Not really an issue currently]-Developers apparently not very active.-Not many units, a flame tower for example would be nice and i'm sure there are a few simple additions which would spice up gameplay quite a bit.-No tutorial.My hope is that patches will polish the game further because it's very close to being excellent in my opinion and a worthy TA successor.P.S. I would highly recommend downloading PA Mod Manager where there are some very useful mods which help aid the controls and gameplay. Also, read the guides on the steam community page which are a good tutorial substitute to help get you started. Oh and check out Zaphodx on youtube to get an idea of competitive online play!			"

												I played a lot of total anihhilation as a child back in the day and this was a must. I know its not a direct successor but to me it is. A lot of the game mechanics feel like they are straight from the 90's. The way you harvest metal and energ. The way you build buildings its all just great.Positives:-You can slam planets into other planets-You can build up some crazy armies in ludicrously short periods of time-Smart graphics. Its definatley a different style to your normal rts but I really like them-The games with 5 or 6 players are just bonkers! I'm not very good but its just utter brilliance watching the havoc unfold!-If you loved TA you will love this-I have only found one bug-Sometimes, there is just so much carnage, its a joy just sitting back and watching everything explode, mushroom clouds and all....and then someone puts a planet on top of the whole thing. Everybody wins.Negatives:-Compared to TA it feels like there is a lack of units-Sometimes the AI goes into ""fail"" mode and just sucks♥♥♥♥♥br>-The camera is somewhat fiddely but bareable-THIS IS MY BIGGEST NEGATIVE- Planets and moons share the same orbitOverall its a great game and I dont know what all the complaints and negatives are doing here. No, there isnt a tutorial but has this generation of gamers really had their brains melted out of their noses due to radiation and cod smack talk so much that they either cant work it out for themselves or use google?. It doesnt take a genius to work anything out the only thing i had to check online was some of the camera work.YOur commander builds your basic stuff, your basic stuff builds advanced stuff and your advanced stuff does advanced stuff...stuff. Like throw nukes around the planet, or just throw planets at other planets, or teleport all your guys onto another planet, they all die but you throw a planet at the enemy anyway. "

												I am new to this game so these are my first impressions. I see a lot of reviews that have to do with the Kickstarter, or the ""expansion pack"". I was *not* involved with the KS, and I don't have ""Titans"". This is just pure PA.Number 1 best thing: Engagement!Once the game starts I do not notice the passage of time, I get so involved with building my units and economy.The unit and structure build-times are very well balanced.After a while, though, gameplay does get repetitive. Build economy, build massive force, rush enemy commander, game over. I have gotten to a point where I can always win on ""hard"", but I can't keep up with the next-higher difficulty.Something really impressive about it: Scale!You can go from viewing a few little marching robots all the way out to the orbit of multiple planets.Sometimes you even have to get your forces from one planet to another, and manage armies on multiple worlds simultaneously.Something else I like is the fact that you can play a 'galactic conquest' mode, where there are multiple star systems on a map, and you have to conquer each system individually, *and*, each time you win a fight, you collect a special new technology that you can use in your future fights in this campaign.Glitches / bugs: Very few, none that are game-breaking. Performance: runs fine on my gaming computer. Did not run at all on my previous machine. I think it's pretty hardware-dependent.Graphics: very impressive. But this is about the least important thing to me as a gamer. I almost always view the units as ""icons"" instead of ""models"".Sound: excellent, really top-notch.Music: also good. Gets a bit repetitive when you start a lot of battles, but you get into the game and it just becomes a nice background.User Interface: excellent. Very many 'convenience options' for managing your forces.Overall: Highly recommended.			"

I would have rather played Total Annihilation 2, you know the one that was rated one of Gamespy's Top Ten Real-Time Strategy Games of ALL TIME?? oh that was in 1997. This one is not even close to as good. Don't bother downloading it's a complete cashgrab ripoff.			"

												As a big fan of the previous series (Total Annihilation / Supreme Commander) I had high hopes for this title and purchased the game while in beta. In the end, I am very disappointed since it is basically a skirmish RTS against one or more brutal AIs, even in the early campaign mode. This in combination with a messy unit overlay system could be so much improved by implementing a short story embedded in a tutorial setting, but I wouldn't count on it to happen. On a personal level, I prefer to build up a base at my own pace and then start exploring. If you do this, you will quickly get overrun by the enemy AI since he already built up a lot of factories and covers nearly all resources on the map.All in all, a grand disappointment compared to the previous series. And here I had good hopes for it...However, if you are a big fan of rushy skirmish RTS'es, then this might be the game for you, even though in the end it may feel very repetitive. Buy it when it's on sale!			"

												Played the game when it first came out. They still had plans to expand looked promising, was a little slow at times but the features where still coming in and it looked nice....Went back to it recently wonderering what stage the game has gotten to. Huge costs and ads everywhere, the game is beyond broken, no feature I changed seem to make my game not bug out, lots of screen flashing missing lots of basic functions like where ore deposits are, or how to switch between one planet and the sun. This game is a failure, while the devs didn't ""jump ship"" they only decided to abandon their initial game and only started to bug fix on their ""new"" game PA: Titans which... is the same game just supported... for paying an extra money... The most disgusting practise of game devoplment I've ever seen.			"

So you copy the game over, add a couple things and call it a new game for the price of the old one? Thank you for showing your true colours. I will NEVER buy another one of your games. If I could I would  return this game immediately. It never fully worked in the first place and was missing a bunch of features that any decent RTS has.

Early Access Review
								Looking good, considering it's only alpha. However, I'd implore you to hold off on buying this game until it's fully released and functional, as there are some major and some lesser balance issues aswell as performance issues with the game as it stands. Also to add to that is the current hefty price-tag (heavily reduced as of right now!).(Slightly) Updated - 3rd of March -14.After having been criticized that I didn't specify enough, I've decided to complete this review.Well, I must say, this game is getting better and better, albeit I do not know the recent changes they've made as it was a fairly long time ago since I played it last, but at that point, when I played it, the major imbalance issues I'm talking about is just swarming tanks which is pretty much unstoppable, should you not strike back with the same coin, which, honestly, makes for pretty tasteless gameplay. I prefer something grander, such as attaching a bunch of huge thrusters onto a planet and then proceeding to crash one planet into another, for instance, is really awesome in my honest opinion, much better than just massing a bunch of basic tanks (not even upgraded ones) and zerging your enemy. This really is just my point of view on this though.As in regards to the performance issues, it might have been just my old system at the time (Five year old motherboard+processor), but I was getting really heavy lag once alot of units started popping up on my screen, which really is a problem when paired up with the massive zerging of the tanks as I spoke about earlier. Another concern that I remember was bugging me a whole lot was the camera being a bit clunky. I remember having a really comfortable camera position where I build my starting base based off of, then I zoomed out to see the other planets, rotated the camera abit, then decided to return to my base, only to be greeted with an alien base that didn't at all look like mine. It was a bit of a hassle to get the camera back to normal, and I, ultimately, lost a fair bit of time because of it. But I guess that's the type of problems you run into when creating a game of this scale.All in all, I can really see great potential for this game, the concept is awesome, I really like the artstyle, and it's just an overall enjoyable game, and with the sale bringing it down to, what, 27.99€, it's definitely worth buying because of the potential alone.7/10			"

Dev's (and Community) made this game playable and finished.This is somehow extraordinary, most early accesses get abandoned as fast as people fill the bucket.

												Bought this game for $90 during the very early phase, lets see what i get for contributing time and money (the ingredients to any business) to this game while it was being developed: 1. Unfinished game: which is fair enough as it was alpha, the updates and fixes were good enough to keep me interested until 'finished'2. No special commanders: all kinds of cool looking commanders available...... at a price! gee that would have been a nice way for the devs to say 'thanks for paying $90 and finding all the bugs so we could do our job"" but no. 3. A ""standalone add on"" which somehow erases the first iteration of the game and is actually the game i paid for so long ago..... at a 'standalone' price of $41. Remember when you bought a game...... and got a finished game? those days are soooooo long gone. Now its: pay us full price for hunk of data... help us trim the game up and find all the bugs..... then we will charge you full price again for game you helped make by investing your time and money.  But i guess thats what i get for being sucked into a $90 early phase game.			"

												I could sit here and tell you all the things that i think that are wrong with the game, and good.though there are already plenty of in depth reviews that go into that. So I'm just giving my own 2 cents.  Sadly the good doesn't make up for the bad. I paid $75 for early access and the game was pretty good for early access, it had it's bugs but for the most part it was fun. I'm Dissapointed however that they didn't change much from then and kept the game really simple. I guess thats what happen when you pay someone for a job they have yet to do. Well not always but it happened with these guys. I wish that the game didn't end up this way, it had a lot going for it. However, they dev's didn't care, they already have their money. This game may be worth it at a few dollars, like $5 but at $30 nope not at all. Even less so for those who paid extra to get into early access. And now the game is for the most part, dead. Unless you buy the Titans DLC. What is the deal with that not just being an update? It would have been this games one redeeming quality. But guess not.			"

Early Access Review
								They advertize it as a beta, but it's still in alpha, and the price they charge is way too expensive. Don't bother with this game before 6 month unless you really want to give the developers some additional money to finish their game. This is indeed what this is all about : they didn't get enough money to finish the game with their kickstarter. I backed them but I hate the way they are using early access now to grab some more. At least, if the price tag was not so high, I could understand, but this is just unacceptable. And it's even on sale as if it were a finish product... Seriously Valve, stop this nonsense and try the games you propose in early access and limit this feature to the ones which are actually in beta stage and not alpha, or set a price tag for alpha stage that is lower than the price of a finished product : you will do everyone, dev and customers, a favor. If the dev don't agree with a reasonable price, prevent them the early access possibility, that's all there is to do. This would avoid so much bad advertizement for games that can't afford a bad reputation before they are solid enough.Here are my advices if you are interested in this game:1. grab a copy of Supreme Commander Forged Alliance. Even at full price, it's 10 €, and it's leagues ahead of Planetary Annihilation in all areas (factions, variety, gameplay, depth). 10 dollars for a rich, polished, finished product compared to 55 € for a clumsy, unoptimized, half baked product. PA is a huge step backward among RTS of its kind, it's even less interesting than Total Annihilation with community improvements and it's as if Supreme Commander never existed and didn't improve the TA formula. The better game is already out, no need to play the less interesting one at the moment. 2. Have fun with Forged Alliance until Uber Entertainement actually finishes their game and enter beta stage (i.e. with full features, only balance changes and fine tuning remains)3. Give PA a try only once it reaches a true beta state, or even wait for release. Only then will it be able to even start to compete against Forged Alliance, but I'm very pessimitisc about its appeal over time (only one set of units is boring, when the gameplay itself is already boring). It looks to me that it will be a nice little game, fun for a while, and that I won't want to play for a long time (I currently don't feel like palying it at all). The only new feature is spherical maps (planets), but I feel like it's more a gimmick, and it feels to me more annoying than really enriching for gameplay.			"

												Just like my last review, my spelling and grammer sucks. I apologize. (TL;DR at bottem of ""review"")This game is fantastic and everything I hoped for but, to see one of my most anticipated games get released like this is a shame. The preformace kills any joy you might recive from this game. Hell I backed this game for 90 on the kickstarter so maybe im a little more critical than others, but I knew the risk. I also know that if these devs are really as good as they seem, they will fix this issue. Just wait this problem out, then purchase the game. (My computer can run almost any game at 60 on max, these problems are due to their servers) The largest problem is the imenense slow down from their steaming servers or whatever it is that they have running this game. Even the single player is online. Why is it everyone can attack sim city for this? Yet so many people seem fine with this. It really bugs me that I can't play large scale maps. An im sure that everyone who wanted to play this with all there friends will be even more disapointed. I can't stress enough that it makes the game unplayable. Freezes for up to 2 minutes, slow downs constantly on large systems. CONSTANTLY. Your game will be unfrozen for like 20 percent of the game. It's a real shame they decided to release it like this.There are couple little small bugs here and there. One of the more annoying ones is when a ""phantom"" building is stuck to your cursor. When holding shift to build multiples of buildings ive noticed it to stop working and then just leaving the building on my cursor doing nothing. So I have to click off my unit and click a different building to build to get it unstuck. Just minor bugs that also should have had fixing before the release.TL;DR - Game sufffers from game breaking slow down due to their servers, UBER seem like a great dev company so just wait this out until it's fixed, then buy it.

												Planetary Annihilation is massive. The armies - all robotic in nature - can be churned out at an amazing rate, growing into vast hordes; the maps are solar systems, complete with moons and planets, all gently spinning and circling their suns; and the devastation is on a scale that should be obvious from the title. It could have been great. A new, bigger Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander.Strategy games, or indeed any game with a substantial amount of depth and complexity, require a bit of education. It begins in the game: tutorials, detailed tooltips, campaigns - the things that teach you the basics.Planetary Annihilation skips the first part entirely, expecting players to dig their own way out of confusion. This makes one’s introduction to the game an unpleasant one, but when that first commander lands on its first world - it’s impressive.The commander makes planetfall, announcing its arrival with an imposing explosion. In a game that’s a race to the eponymous planetary annihilation, the lumbering commander is a liability, needing to be protected by an army. A swarm of enemies could take it out and spell the end of the game.Gargantuan armies can be constructed with surprising speed, and with new factories comes the ability to build fabrication units - more builders - with their much larger repertoire of blueprints.There’s a satisfying cadence to the unlocking of new toys.That first few games you are entertained with spectacular, planet-killing explosions and nuclear extinction. But eventually the unpleasant flavours are reached. Races can be fun. They can be intense, focused things, too. But they are also exhausting, and Planetary Annihilation never stops being a race. Defensive plays take a back seat when you can weaponise whole worlds. In multiplayer, victory goes to whichever player can click fastest and most consistently. Navies get ignored because the tiny oceans serve no purpose and you can just send aircraft over them, and spacecraft are equally limited. Space in general is no fun. It’s somewhere to travel through, and that’s not very interesting at all. When a match reaches the point where players are buggering off to other worlds, it becomes a micromanagement nightmare. Everyone’s playing with the same tools, as well. There’s only one faction. The question of balance has always been important in the realm of the RTS, and Uber Entertainment’s answer seems to be: make everyone play the same way. The Galactic War mode - Planetary Annihilation’s single-player mode is exceedingly bland. There’s no story, no real context and the AI can be abysmal at times. There are rough edges everywhere, no matter what mode you play. Rapidly getting into jaw-droppingly huge wars spanning multiple worlds is brilliant - it really is. And there’s no other RTS that gives players so much destructive power. But the lack of tactical depth and focus on constantly rushing makes Planetary Annihilation tiring. Overall 6/10.			"

												Not much to recommend it.  The gameplay is very shallow, the Commander unit is the least interesting in the series (other than visually it is a basic worker with a better gun) and the spherical planets sound interesting but in practice make it hard to locate anything and make the units seem small and hard to distinguish.  The seemingly unlimited units mean the AI is always at an advantage for controlling them, and it is a constant rush-fesh.  Disappointing overall.			"

												Don't Buy this Game or any game from Uber Entertainment, this company is worse than EA games. They released another one under title Planetary Annihilation: Titans which is essentially a copy-paste of this game with some patch and Titan units as extra. Devs only care about money not the player, so don't give them anymore money, I am regret to buy this uberCr@p.Game Review: The game itself isn't that bad, its buggy but its still playable (atleast for me in the past), the concept of this game is really good, but devs ruined it and literally giving cr@p to consumer by releasing identical game and charging it for full price game. Why devs not release Titans as add-on?? why they abandon this game??.Back to game review, the gameplay is pretty decent, you can control huge amount of unit on a planet and try to annihilate enemy, unit type also quite variable however most of the time you only spam 1-2 type unit since other type is useless, and mixing unit isn't really effective (maybe because I am bad with micromanagement?). The coolest part of this game is blasting your enemy with an asteroid, but it gets boring after 2-3 try. Honestly I would give 5-7 out of 10 for game, however devs don't care about player, they only want more money. SCORE : 2/10 VERDICT: DON'T BUY ANY KIND OF GAMES FROM UBERCR@P ENTERTAINMENT.p.s = Sorry for my horrible english			"

								Don't buy this game...now. This game looks good on the trailers and on the pictures, but the game has big performance issues, my computer is not a ""gaming pc"" but it runs battlefield 3 on high pretty well and almost all games on high or even ultra! But i can only play this game on low and it still had very low fps so the game was almost unplayable. I was pretty exited for this game, i read the reviews and it seemed like a good game and it probably will be but it isn't good now. Wait until it comes officialy out then read reviews and do a little research and if the game is good then buy it. I will play this game again when it officially comes out, until then don't buy it.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! (and its """"""""expansion"""""" TITANS) - since they share the same build and problems.It is, as for now, September,7th, 2015, It has MAJOR issues:- You cannot select where the AI starts. So if you want to have fun with you starting on a planet, and the AI on another, you'll have to b luck for it to get randomly assigned to another planet.**EDIT: As of today, September 10th, you can set the AI to spawn offworld, at the same planet as a player, or randomly, IN MULTIPLAYER CUSTOM MATCHES. Not in Skirmish yet. No idea why... ¬¬- METAL PLANETS STILL HAVE METAL SPOTS, (so you cannot harvest where you want, you have to use the spost as a regular planet) BUT THAT IS NOT ALL!!! - a lot of times the metal spots spawn where the catalyst (the structure that ""activates"" metal planets to fire)  should be! (so you cannot build the catalyst because there is a metal spot on the way!!!!!- The AI is orbitally dumb. Get out of your starting planet. You win. Congratulations. ** EDIT: testing if the new changes improved it... - The planets have a ""realistic"" impact setting: if you send an asteroid to annihilate another planet, if, by any chances, YOUR PLANET is on the way ( and you CANNOT PREVIEW THAT) the asteroid will hit YOUR planet, instead of the enemy's, as you designated.So, until this is fixed, DO NOT BUY IT! At its current state, I would qualify it as Beta, and not as a complete game, with an """"""expansion"""""". If this issues are fixed, I'll gladly change this review.			"

												Uber never finished SMNC, moved on to PA, never finished PA but announced another kickstarter that failed, then went back and said ""Don't worry guys we're not dropping PA"" and here we are with a standalone PA expansion before PA is finished.  Uber fail.  But more on this game:It's unfinished.  It lacks real strategy except for who can spam faster.  The music is great, but limited.  The planets and solar systems are cool, but lead to the lack of strategy, you just need more units to either defend your planet or take into battle.  Chokepoints exist pretty much only while traveling between planets.   This game had great potential for a ne style RTS, but the ball has been dropped too many times by this Dev/Pub Uber.			"

												Now that PA: Titans has come out, I have to say I absolutely cannot recommend the original game. Frankly, it should be removed from Steam, the ""standalone"" expansion pack contains all of the content in the original game and more for almost the same price.As much as I wanted to love this game, the full release was missing much of the promised content, and contained microtransactions to unlock the backer units even for people who spent $100 pre-ordering on early access.Then Uber has the nerve to release an ""expansion"" pack that is roughly what the game should have been in the first place.I would recommend Titans to anyone who likes Supreme Commander and Total Annihilation, but the original Planetary Annihilation pales in comparison to all of the above, both graphically and in depth of content.

												Go play Supreme Commander or Total Annhilation instead of this. If you've played either, you'll know within seconds of playing this that this is just a heavily watered down, gimmicky verison of the two. It's significantly easier to get into than SC or TA, but it feels like it's missing a lot of the depth, and ultimately isn't really worth your time. For crying out loud SC2 at least had different factions and less gimmicky mechanics and combat. I've won games solely without using any units whatsoever, just building massive artillery zones and then rushing superweapons to end the game. It's just one of those games that no matter how you play it, it ultimately comes off as a gimmick. Game performance is incredibly spotty. It works for some, and doesn't for others. For me, it's always been really jittery and laggy at first but then finally becomes smooth, but expect like, 3 minute load times. The game really needs some work. Too bad it won't get any.Spend your money on something way better. PA is like SC but with XBOX HUEG maps to it. Imagine being able to go to different parts of the map and finding a new biome. Really sick. Now imagine that's the whole game. Sometimes the biome can be used as a weapon, and people may tend to rush that, so just mess em up and you're good. It's legitimately one of the most shallow games I've ever played in my life. It's fun to mess around in with friends, but seriously, if you're really adamant about playing this, buy Titans instead, which is a standalone expansion with a lot of content that should have been in the game Day 1.TL;DR if you want an easy TA game to get into just get into Supreme Commander 2 if you REALLY want something easy, or take the time to learn and git gud at Supreme Commander and Forged Alliance instead of this gimmicky meme game. If you REALLY wanna play this, just go play Titans, since it contains content that should have been in the game from the start. With Titans out there's really no reason to touch the base game anymore. PA isn't a bad game for what it is, but the planet stuff that supposedly sells the game gets really old after a while. I come back to it every once in a while and get hooked by the simplicity of the game, but it's ultimately just a timewaster.			"

								I used to play Total Annihilation when I was younger and it was the best! The endless ways in which you could dominate your foes was pure bliss. Whether it was airdropping massive waves of units behind your enemies, sending naval fleets to bombard ground units, or straight up plowing the enemy commander over with hundreds of ground units! This game though has failed my expectations in every way. There's barely any units, the miniture planet instead of a flat map is confusing as hell and it's basically just a rush style game (like Star Craft 2 online ladder matches). What a rip off, don't buy this game. They've tarnished the series' reputation.  Nothing but pure gimmicks.			"

The game is very fun in its current state, but it has even more potential if Uber fixes a lot of the small issues with the game.  Still worth a buy.			"

												Boring game, I love RTS games however this was a terrible release, paid £40 and look at the play time, very annoying that they ""released"" this in a broken state and have the nerve to call TITANS an expansion. Worse company than EA and I'll never be buying a game from Uber again.			"

												First of all, Total Annihilation was one of the best games I have ever played.  I was addicted when it first came out and for several years beyond.  This game attempts to capture that, sadly it only attempts.  I bought this in pre alpha for sixty bucks and I really regret that decision. First, the good part.  The build system is just like total annihilation, which I always thought was a great way of doing it. ( you build a starter factory which produces a builder which can in turn build the advanced version of it's factory which produces more advanced vehicles of that type).  Now I am not a fan of pvp with this type of game because it always ends up being the same thing, build a small economy as fast as you can, then build a big enough force of low cost units and hope that it overwhelms the force that the other player has managed to build.  It's usually not a lot of fun in my book, but if that is what you like then this game will deliver in that department.Now the bad.  Many things in this game are what I would consider incomplete.  First and foremost there is not a storyline/campaign that has been well thought out so that it is interesting and fun.  It is simply this galactic war garbage which is merely a series of ai skirmishes with no storyline or real progression.  In fact it severely limits you on the tech tree as you can only use a small percentage of the tech tree at any one time.  I understand that they were trying to be different from the normal path of giving you one piece at a time and building it up.  But being different just for the sake of being different does not neccessarily translate into being good.  In my opinion it is actually really bad!  If you click on the screen shot above where it shows the picture of the galaxy then you will get to see the entire single player ""campaign"".  Thats literally all it is, you just move between those stars and play a skirmish, I would assume there is some little congrats screen at the end or a ten second animation where one commander blows up another one, but I just get so bored I can't even get that far.  And honestly who cares about the one sentence that lets you know they have nothing else to deliver in that area.  I'm sure they used some kind of computer voice over for it as well, as if that somehow will make me forget that I just spent the last few hours being bored out of my mind with no reward.  There are also some things I found which seem broken, like not being able to build advanced metal extractors on certain metal deposits due to terrain conflicts.So in the end my main point would be that if you love a mindless blow em up where you and your teenage friends get high and pwn each other then this is probably right up your alley.  But if you are looking for an immersive and rich experience then you should look somewhere else.			"

												I was pretty stoked about playing this game when I saw it on Kickstarter, but didn't have the funds to pick it up - I bought it on offer and...well...was pretty underwhelmed to be honest.  It may just be the single-player experience (not a fan of multiplayer), but it really felt like it lacked depth.  On my first game I picked a strategy of ""build orbital death-rays over the enemy base ASAP"" and was able to stick to it for my first 20ish games without adjusting.Perhaps the multiplayer experience is much deeper and more rewarding, but if you're buying for the single-player; there's no tutorial, no campaign, and no real progression that I was able to observe over my playtime - I'd advise that you give this one a miss.

												first of all let me say how glad i am dor not listening to all the bad revieuws. if i did i missed out a great game.some people gave it some serious critic's and some of them are right. but as how i see it most of the critic's i see it is the problem of the user having a under minimum spec's computer.i see a lot of issues about lagging, memory failure  etc etc these problem's are pure technical.i am not saying they are wrong but you can't blame the dev's for this.some con's from me- there is not an tutorial mission (there is a guide)- not a real storyline- when you reject tech in galaxy war it's lost forever. it would be more logical that when you rejected it and move on to find an additional data bank, that you could go back to previous point and get the tech again.- in MP i felt like really stupid played for 10 minutes and i was wiped out completly. i watched the game back in chronocam. watched my oponent with the hope i could learn something. but on the speed he fabricated some things it seems impossible to me. he had laser sattelites, nukes, and multiple orbital space platforms up in just 3 minutes.- Not a decent save feature. (i heard they are working on that.)now my pro's+ great SP+ nice visuals+ decent guide+ fantastic soundtrack during game+ youre not in need of microtransactions to be better in the game. ( it's pure cosmetic)+ endless replayabillity+ living comunityhubi do reccomend this game. but be carefull do not buy if youre not have the recomended spec's i think this game is heavy'er than people think. (made that mistake myself a lot of times)have fun.			"

												Personally, I freaking love this game, purely because of the amount of fun you can have with your friends. I agree with everyone else about it being out of beta, it shouldn't be. But the game is here and whether it is finished or not it is really good. Maybe the gameplay isn't polished, basically all you have to do is rush at the start of the game if you are both on the same planet or who can build the nukes the fastest game, but when you are with friends, you can set up rules like grace periods, no nukes, no annihilasers stuff like that, so you can have a proper war with units and armys. Now on the the singleplayer side of things (Galactic War). This is possibly the worst singleplayer i have ever played, like, i can't even understand what i have to do, limited troops and armys, it needs to be worked on. However, this is a very promising game and could be the best game i have played. Graphics aren't the best and i did expect better since this is a PLANETARY based game, but it is enough to tide me over for now, i just hope they improve. They are still working on the game but it is very slow, made even slower by the 'new' and 'improved' game Human Resources. They have added a lot of things including unit cannons and offline mode, so in my opinion, ITS NOT A SCAM. I recommend this game to whoever hasn't played an rts before, because they have added in a small player guide which will help you a bit.Also, this game in its current stage is not worth £22.99 or $35, buy it when its on sale for 50% off or something, then its worth what it should be.

												This game is not what I thought it would be...Me and my cousin booted this game up and finally after an hour and a half we were able to run planets into each other. My goodness, if you don't have the patience this game might be a bit difficult for you to play. The game follows the Supreme Commander scheme where there is a main robot that builds most of the factories. There is of course minions that help you do the same, but depending what level they are (L1, L2, L3 as units and buildings alike follow this pattern) means how fast they can build or what they can build. A level 1 tank depot of course is not the same as a level 2, but a level 2 depot will require a level 2 ground unit builder. The game is fun, and jumping from planet to planet is pretty cool. Transport ships are available but portals make the journey a lot easier. There are ground units, air units, and sea units that are available to build. You are also able to launch units into orbit and are able to have defensive units on the ground (like turrets) as well as in orbit.Visually the game delivers the proper graphics and have yet to notice any major chops within the scene.This game is okay... I'd like to say it's great but it's a very slow build up on action. Because of that, I CAREFULLY recommend this game.

												As a man coming from a series of SC,Total War, and many other RTS games this one doesn't really stand out in terms of ""revolutionizing strategy"" In combat it is literally the same thing with only slight differences only because of the different planets which the whole game thinks it can carry it's self on. The Single player is even worse when you try to give it the time of day and even more worse when you aren't prepared. It's utter garbage and if PA ever really wants to get people who dont want multiplayer to join they have to change this or die. The ""difficulty"" often depends on how lucky you are to get the current ""meta"" teck path so you can beat an AI which has all teck at it's disposal.There idea of new gameplay is atrosiouse. Simply put their ""new"" ideas are just more late game stale-mate breakers because the frequency in which it happens is rediculouse. Unit Cannon>Catalist>Halley it's allways which game ender will I use in the map because of how the game has progressed.Here's the good news:It's still growing and thats why I have stayed, I have put in a soon to be 900 hrs into this game and I still will stay with it for another 900 more. The new way which they have taken a simple and boreing 2-D game and made you afraid that you will be attacked now on a 3-D level is intense. Though new units are still far into the pipleline I can't wait to see what they add. The people in the game are really the nicest that I have ever met on a RTS level, while there are some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥players simply saying ""hey I'm new"" and people are more than happy to help you out. It's a community that really wants to be a community and that is something that I have NEVER seen. While I have said that there are many problems the dev's are working on it and I am not afraid to wait, it's gonna be worth it!GG GL HF ALL! LONG LIVE THE MBC AND LONG LIVE PA:D			"

								At this point the game is basically the same as Supreme Commander only on a larger scale with ""cartoon graphics"" (not that i dont enjoy cartoon graphics i very much do), also take note that there is one faction or ""race"" to play as and to me for a game such as this is something that should have been added from the start of the release not something to add in later. i understand at this point the game is still is development, and i have hopes in the coming months that the game becomes something new and orignal. But at this point in time this game is basically a copy of something of a game i have already enjoyed and brings nothing new or exicting to the table. I do not recommend spending almost 60.00 CND at this point in time for this game.			"

												Build as of January 12th.Hi, I love RTS games. I have been apart of the community of RTS ever since the first Warcraft and Starcraft. Cried when Command and Conquer was destroyed by EA. i.e. (Red Alert 3) and played SupCom like crazy. I like this game and would recommend it when it goes on sale. I think it was 7$ a couple weeks back. Otherwise wait for a sale. Not worth otherwise atm. This game has amazing potential and I want to believe in it. Which I do, it is just that from playing it so much I have found plenty of things that hurt it in its path to greatness.I will say now this was my experience with single player vs. AI and GW. I do not care about multiplayer. I am sure it has its fair share of problems too. I have played the multiplayer. Just not enough to make informed opinions on it.GRAPHICS AND OPTIMIZATIONI have a high end gaming rig; core i7 quad core OC 4.66ghz, GTX770, 12gb RAM. This game has cell shaded graphics which I think is cool and artsy. It doesn't have to look amazing to be fun and it does look good where the polish has been applied like the death star laser, it looks awesome! Also nukes look better than they used to. IT IS POORLY OPTIMIZED. I get 60fps when I just start up a game but 20min later or even maybe 10min later depending on what level of difficulty I am playing on it dips down to 30FPS or lower for the rest of the game! I have a FPS counter in the corner of the screen while I play and I noticed whenever an explosion goes off it dips to exactly 30fps. I dono if that's just my comp or what but that's weird. I feel like this is still beta, there is no way this is final build or even close to feeling complete. The Planets are a bit bare and boring but that was so we as players could focus on fighting with as many robots as possible without it lagging to the point of unplayable. I am fine with that. Bigger battles and less lag, cool! Sign me up! In reality what we get is lag, crashing and screen tearing. Sometimes I will still get textures that wont load for an entire planet at the start of a game so I have to start over till it works. That doesn't happen too often but IT DOES HAPPEN. Things have gotten better with graphics and optimization over time since release though. It used to be a lot worse. I mean read some of the other reviews from a couple months back and you will get a good picture. Back in early Beta I would get fps drops that were ridiculous. Yes I did pay 70$ for this game. Because I believed in it, I believed it could turn out to be one of the greatest RTS's of all time. Still has work that needs to be done to make it truly great.GAMEPLAYI have played as of now 63.8 hrs on record of this game. Starting from late ALPHA I got to see this game develop from a basic prototype to what it is today. The ALPHA and BETA phases of this game are wrongly named since the BETA felt like an ALPHA most the time. But let us talk about the game as of now, not how it was. I said it before that this game feels like it is in BETA still. Balance is an issue in this game and will be forever I am afraid. If there is ONE metal planet in the game then it turns into ""who can race to the metal planet first"". The metal planet is VASTLY OP. 1st of all it takes no time to recharge what so ever. ZAP. then ZAP. another ZAP. WIN. 2nd The amount of power it takes to fire it is incredibly little. It is a superweapon yes but there should be strict regulations for making it a bit more balanced. Multi planet battles are a problem too, if you or an AI gets fully entrenched on a planet it becomes a game of nuke the ever loving crap out of the other planet till you win. You cannot go and land on an enemy planet with the space transport which STILL only has capacity for ONE unit because of the insane response time of the AI that swoop in and kill your landers so fast. Plus the orbital defense and fighters make it nearly impossible to send anything other than swarms and swarms of fighters, landers and orbital bombardment units. I am sorry if my brain cannot handle swapping between 5 planets and managing thousands of units all at once. It is not easy to manage everything after 50min of play time with multi planet battles. The planet smashing is still broken and looks so bad. It is definitely better then what it used to be but compared to the LASER DEATH CANNON its not polished at all. Flying through space the engines still disconnect from the model at times, the entire animation is clunky from start to finish, the explosion from the planet crashing can be laggy or just miss timed. There is just something so wrong with it and yet it is a key selling point to this game. FIX IT. THE LASER CANNON LOOKS SO GOOD. They have it in them to make this superweapon better, look at the nukes and unit cannon. OH YA, UNIT CANNON. Recently the developers added a Unit Cannon which can build and launch units anywhere onto a planet, even across space onto another planet. This is cool and I love it. I remember seeing it with the original trailer and wondered where it went. Its well polished and can only build certain units so its not mega OP. Overall the lower end of the spectrum is pretty well polished and balanced it seems. Just when players reach endgame it seems to drag on forever and certain superweapons are really overpowered. The game shines with 1-2 planets and can be so much fun to play without the planet smashing and lasers. There is one thing I will mention that I love to do, invasion fleets. Building over 300 of those orbital lasers and sending them to a totally entrenched enemy planet and watch the destruction, takes forever to get there though.Galactic War. Hey designers. I know its tough to make a game. Especially one of this magnitude and ambition, but come on. Galactic War is a joke right now. GW right now consists of the player battling through an entire galaxy, system by system, to obtain cards that boost your armies power so you can conquer your enemies and take over the galaxy. Backtracking through already conquered systems you have to click on each system individually, just to get to where you want to go. There should be an automatic ""go to"" button so I don't have to click on each system so many times. Players should be able to go anywhere they want within their territory. Once u get to where you want you can not go back, so you had better decide which system you want to attack before you move. The upgrade cards you get from beaten systems are borderline useless or plainly helpful. It is random too what you get from each system and you only know until after what you are getting. This is just bad planning and design. Players should know what they are getting before hand so we can plan a better route and stay away from the more useless cards. The home systems of enemies are 1v3-5 and you had better hope you got an assisting commander or two or else you will get stomped on.USER INTERFACE AND MENUSThis game has bad menus. I can not think of a single reason why the menus in your game should be this bad. There is a 1 second lag time between me mousing over a menu icon and it lighting up to show that I have highlighted it. Sometimes I have had to click more than once on the main menu just for it to receive my input. What is this. Please, please fix your menus. The menu's haven't changed since late BETA. It is so frustrating having to click 2 or more times on everything. This isn't even in game. In game the UI seems pretty basic. They should take a note from Sins of a Solar Empire on UI. In PA it gets hard to organize and keep track of everything especially after 30min. You have to play alot to get used to it. Not so ""new user friendly"". Not even an idle worker button! Age of Empires 1 had that!WRAP UP - I have seemed to run out of room with my rant. I wanted to say more. But I will say that I love this game and want it to be better.

												Uber had an awesome kickstarter campaign. Promised a great game. Released late with a buggy game missing promised features.Fast forward 9 months or so. PA has been replaced by PA:Titans. PA:Titans is a ""new"" game that costs $$$ to get. Early adopters of PA who missed the kickstarter got screwed. Guess what you supported a early access, buggy game?

												I learned about this game through social media long before its release. I watched the kickstarter campaign success and I was keeping an eye to the game for quite some time. From alpha, to beta, to release and so on... I bought the game a few months after it was released when it was on a sale. I think I paid 15 euros for this. All I can say is that it is totally worth it! The game is a mixture of Supreme Commander stategy style with a bit more simplicity for the more casual gamers. As for myself, I am a fan of RTS games & space/planet/sci fi stuff so I immidiatelly loved it. I've been watching 1v1s as well as clan wars on youtube about this game and I find myself enjoying watching these as fun as playing the game. It's a pity that it does not have a huge player base (about 2000-3000 active online players) but it is a great game as a future e-sport! Developers seem to still care about the game and try to balance and add units,buildings & features all the time so it has a lot of future in it.			"

												Lots of potential here, but unfortunately no single player campaign and many mechanical concepts are not properly implemented/polished yet. What made Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander so great was their single player campaign content - but PA provides none (the extremely pathetic attempt 'galactic war' doesn't even try to count). Repetitiously  AI battles is a terrible grind because one must either cheese the AI, or spend meticulous time to focus on defence so that one can handle an enemy constantly attacking from every direction.I don't want multiplayer right now and am very disappointed with the single player experience.

												Edit:I want to clearly say here at the beginning that my ""6 hours"" of gameplay only includes the time I've spent playing it on Steam; it was available to early backers for a long time before it arrived here in ""early access"".  I've not spent much time playing it since it came on Steam because I only occasionally start it up to see whether any of my complaints have been addressed, which to date they have not.Regarding the many glowing reviews this game has recieved and the number of people who have disliked my review, you should ask yourself whose opinion is more important to your decision whether or not to invest in this game's continued development:A) What people who've paid money for the game hope it might eventually turn intoB) The reality of how the game currently plays and a rational projection of how its development will continue based on how development has progressed to this pointIn my opinion, ""B"" is more valuable.  So this is my review of how the project currently stands and my projection for its future based on how development has progressed over the last few years. Also, while my review is strongly negative, I'm absolutely NOT hoping to see this game fail, I paid a lot of money for it and I desperately want RTS games to have a comeback.I'd truly love to be able to say that Planetary Annihilation is another example of how crowdfunding can save genres that mainstream publishers have abandoned, similar to how Star Citizen and Elite: Dangerous have demonstrated that there is still demand for space combat simulators.  However, I can't in good conscience just blindly recommend this game to people in hopes that the additional money in the developer's bank account will allow them time to fix the game's multitude of problems.  They've already greatly extended their development timetable and have almost nothing to show for it - in fact, late last year they finally just abandoned all notion of having a development plan and said that the game will be released ""when it's done""... well, there are companies that I'd accept this from - Valve, Stardock, etc - but the problem is, they're not one of those companies.  Their staff isn't hand-picked from industry-leading companies, there's no brilliant developer like Chris Taylor or Sid Meier at the helm.  Here's their proof that they can be trusted with your money: promises and delays.-----Original review:One of Planetary Annihilation's biggest problems at its core - battle across multiple randomly-generated planets - isn't conducive to good RTS gameplay.  The entire basis of the real-time strategy genre is the strategic use of terrain, and although this is probably the least fixable problem it's far from being the only one.  If you don't see why having randomly-generated battlefields is a terrible idea, let me explain:Think about your favorite RTS game; maybe it's Total Annihilation, Starcraft, Forged Alliance, one of the Command & Conquer games, or even something totally different like Homeworld.  All of these are great games in their own way but no matter how much you loved your favorite, I know that if you think about it you'll remember that not only were there maps you wanted to play on all the time, there were also maps you despised.  If you played a lot of multiplayer, your friends and people online probably had their own favorite maps too, and you might even have gotten in arguments because one of you was sick of playing certain maps so often.  Maybe your favorite map relied heavily on the use of a strategy you were really good at, or you enjoyed one that started each player on equal footing, or you liked a map because each starting location was unique in some way.Now, take all that away.  Instead of your favorite game coming with a carefully polished, gameplay-tested, diverse set of maps designed specifically to highlight and take advantage of the game's units, structures, and unique overall design, imagine all the maps are replaced with ones which are randomly generated and with no real terrain to speak of, not even something as elementary as differences in elevation.  Sure, there might be a few mountains, some canyons, a lake or two, and so on, but they serve almost exclusively as window dressing because they weren't placed by a professional human game developer in such a way as to foster strategic gameplay.  By coincidence they might occasionally form a small choke point or provide some other (purely theoretical) strategic value, but because they are so small and easily bypassed they still don't serve any purpose in terms of gameplay.What do I mean, ""easily bypassed""?  Well, all the terrain features are tiny compared to the scope of even a small planet... and there's the problem summed up in a single word: ""planet"".  Maps have no edges or corners, so you can attack (or be attacked) from any direction.  And by ""any direction"", I do truly mean ""any"" direction, including orbital bombardment, or even by way of an unstoppable planetary collision for which you have little warning.  This means that defenses are functionally useless most of the time because it's almost always quicker, cheaper, and easier to simply replace lost structures after the enemy has moved on than it is to attempt to defend your territory from every possible type and direction of attack.The same is true when attacking.  No matter how much damage you inflict, it often feels almost impossible to cause lasting harm to your opponents.  The game continues on and on like this, a planetary-scale game of ""musical chairs"", until one player's attention span is exhausted and they forget to move their commander out of harm's way, leading to it being destroyed and them losing the game.  Games end more often by accident than as a result of a clever plan or a strategic blunder.If you've read this far then you might be thinking (or hoping) that I'm out of things to complain about, but unfortunately you'd be wrong.  In fact, I've only scratched the surface of the things wrong with Planetary Annihilation's irreparably flawed core design, things so central to its basic concept that they can never truly be ""fixed"" because it would mean starting from scratch.  I haven't even begun on topics like the unit and structure balance, the interface, the graphics, the audio, etc.  That's because all of these things - even the random map design - are insignificant in comparison to the one singular thing that I believe will forever doom this game to serving as an example of the dangers of Kickstarter hype: after so long in development, there remains such a multitude of braindead-obvious flaws both in the game's design and presentation that I, as an early and enthusiastic backer of this project and a huge fan of RTS games in general, must conclude that the developers are genuinely trying their best to make a great RTS game but have absolutely no concept of how to do so.As I write this, the game is over 7 months late for its final release deadline, a date which had already been pushed back.  Its developers have now simply given it a release date of ""when it's done"".  I paid a lot of money in good faith to support this game's development so I truly, genuinely want to believe that even if it doesn't become the groundbreaking RTS we were promised, it might at least turn into a worthwhile product one day, but nothing I see right now points toward that being a likely possibility.  Just to put things in perspective, it was only few months ago that they first added water units to the game.PA will probably never be truly finished, let alone become an RTS in the same league as the 17 year old masterpiece that inspired it, Total Annihilation - or that game's true spiritual successor, Supreme Commander, which despite its own set of flaws still had a competent design at its core and was clearly developed with gameplay in mind from the first planning stages rather than as an afterthought.Do not buy this game.

												EDIT: Ignore my comment on the Devs i was reading reddit's comments and not steams!A lot of well justfied complants for early backers and disappointment with how the game ended up. But fortunatly i came in 4 months after it was released. After 3 hours in i can say that this is probably the most exciting RTS i've played in years. When i play a RTS i'm used to hiding in a hole and waiting for the computers to fight amongst themselves, but this game is diffrent. You try that in Planetary Annihilation you will lose, and you will lose quick. The only way to win PA is to be as aggressive and smart as you can. And that's something i really really like about this game. I'm absolutly in love with the planetary view it planning how to get to your enemys more interesting. Wanna get to your enemies but he is building a wall? Walk around it!  Another thing i really love about the game is the fact that you can jump to diffrent planets and hell even destroy the planets! It's just such a crazy and cool mechanic that i freaking love.The campaign for the game is also amazing because its a randomly generated board where you just have to destroy every enemy in the galaxy. I love it.There are downsides though. There are absolutly 0 tutorials in game. Wanna learn how to really play? Gotta hit up the wiki, and i really hate games that make me do that and it's really really unnessary. I dont' wanna read thousands of lines of stuff just to learn what each thing does i wanna play the game. Another thing i've been reading about is the Customer serverice is horridous and the developers of the game seem to be really hateful to the community lately. It also has always online which sucks but i'm always connected to the internet so i've never had that problem. Overall i'm giving this game a 8/10 and would recommend it if it goes on sale. It's very exciting and makes you think and makes you wanna play agressivly.			"

								Impossible to play the game as it requires you to log in to a uberent account that is registered with a key of the game. I am unable to find a key for it anywhere on steam. Very dissapointed.EDIT: For some reason it finally accepted my account after starting the game multiple times. Ctrl+Alt+Q for @ does not work ingame on my german qwertz keyboard.EDIT2: Game gets extremely laggy when downloading things on steam, even in the supposedly offline galactic war mode. Settings aren't saved longer than the game is running for some reason. Very laggy on my rig, which is capable of running games like Tomb Raider 2013 on max at 60fps.			"

												I remember kickstarting this for $80, still have proof that I did so, and they want to charge me again to get content that I specifically already paid for.  They come out with a new expansion, and my $80 + ~$60 purchase price (was really excited about the concept) wasn't enough for them to make it an unpaid DLC?  Keep in mind that my playtime over total development is well over 100 hours, almost none of it was even remotely fun.At least make it a cheaper DLC, not a full price addition.  What is wrong with this dev team?  The game wasn't even finished in Early Access and was released as a shell of what could've been.I will personally be paying more attention and follow Uber to see what happens with them, because I never want to play or purchase another game from anyone that had anything to do with this project.I know what you're thinking, the RTS genre is so rarely developed in today.

Buy this instead:It has 3 times more content than PA for a third of a price, it has actual story campaign, there are 4 races each different than the other, and you can play it offline!Oh, and it still has lively multiplayer community.Planetary annihilation is a great concept turned into simplistic cash grab. The game was sold on the idea of installing giant engines onto a planet, and launching it on a collision course with other planets. Also, a Death Star. As soon as you launch the game you are greeted with in-game store in which you can purchase additional content, because you know, single payment for the game will not buy you everything, let's not be ridiculous. You have only one faction. One race. Everyone's units are completely the same. Not only do you have to be always online to play, but now they're also selling you a unit pack. Because you know, maybe if you spend enough money the game will become good? Buy Forged Alliance instead, which is this game's predecessor and a complete game.			"

												Planetary Annihilation is a difficult game to talk about, as it is very flawed, however most people over-look some of its impressive feats as an indie developed strategy game, somewhat inspired by StarCraft. The game is underrated, however this is understandable, as the game is so different to most strategy games that some new features understandably feel a little shallow.The gameplay of the game is perhaps the greatest strength and downfall of this game. Its mechanics are all very simple, yet it has a steep learning curve (especially in the multiplayer). As in most games you build factories to create offensive units, and some sort of resource gathering contraption to gain power. These basic concepts aren’t elaborated upon, but are spiced up by the scale of the areas given, made possible by space travel (done through simple mechanics, almost identical to how one would get from place to place normally).One thing that isn’t done well is the dynamic “currencies” with which one makes vehicles and powers buildings. These functions don’t act as money, that can by spent, rather than efficiency, something which makes gameplay (i.e. base or vehicle building), slower or faster. This does NOT work. The base building feels stagnated, constantly slowing down or speeding up, due to seemingly random circumstances on the battlefield. Simply put, it’s boring to wait, especially if one doesn’t know why he or she is waiting. However this is all completely justified by the incredible scale of the battles one can compete in. At times there will by thousands of units onscreen once, and it is a satisfying affair to send the entire capacity of ones military force, to crush the opponents base. Single player is a series of simple missions paired with some worryingly bad AI. Sometimes teammates will build water armies in a spot of water, on an otherwise dry planet, but at least it’s comical to watch the poor AI trying to figure out what is going on. Multiplayer is where most will spend their hours. It has an incredibly simple ranking system that works fairly well. Matchmaking queues are quick, and opponents are about as good as you. The game has an unmistakable theme with simple square graphics; wish a nice and simple color scheme. However, frame rate varies. I understand rendering a whole galaxy easy, but am disappointing to see such simple graphics slow the game down to only 40 FPS. Other than that there isn’t much to be said about this games average presentation. The solar systems look like wide out dots, and battles have alrtight visual effects (nothing to boast about).The one think the game just completely fails at, is at bringing a good soundtrack. The theme is a booming imperial track with little to do with the themes. It awkwardly blurs with the audio and sounds unnecessarily epic. The game could have been much better sounding with a simple techno soundtrack with less extravagant flare. The audio isn't clean and crisp, and the voice acting is nothing to special.FINAL THOUGHTS This game had lots of potential if it had only focused more on its core mechanics. Its far to ambitious, however is still a satisfying experience that has enough content to keep you occupied. The development team behind this game aren't very compitent with delivering constant updates, and generally polishing the game. Uber Entertainment are very ambitious, but have limited resources, which means they often find refuge at kickstarter. This means they don't have regular funding for thier projects, hence struggling to update or fix the game.SCORE 70/100An overambitious mess, with moments of genuine awe during the massive battles that keep me coming back for more.

												Woah woah woah woah WOAH. This is released now? This is done? Hang on, this incomplete mess is -DONE- now? I payed a ridiculous fee(I think it was double, maybe triple, what the release price is now) to get into this games early access because it looked amazing and it promised much...So I assume this product is no longer being worked on, in favor of the new one which looks like a copy paste of the same game with more features and more units. Cool.No. Just no. It doesn't matter how good this game is, don't support this garbage. Honestly what's the point of buying this game anyways if the new one is the exact same thing only better? They charge a CRAZY amount to buy this game early and then suddenly call it done and a few months later release a stand alone game that's THE EXACT SAME THING ONLY BETTER AND COSTS MONEY. Who thought this was a good idea?! Who is the failure of a human being who thought this up, wrote it down, and proposed this to the developers in a meeting of their peers because they thought it was a great idea???? Fire that person immediately because he has tainted your names forever in this business.			"

												I just removed my positive early access review to start over with clean slates.With the release of a standalone ""expansion pack"" which added nothing that couldn't have been added as a complementary DLC, Uber is dead to me.Their entire business philosophy is sub par and nowhere near tolerable, and has been so for a long time.Granted, the game is excellent RTS. PA:TITANS adds cool features and makes the game experience all the more enjoyable, despite minor caveats which mostly stem from Uber's idiocratic Reign of Dev anyway. Nonetheless, I recommend boycotting them. All they seem to do is entertain their favourite weekend project long enough for it to bring in some profit, then all but abandon it in favour of more and even ask for another grand crowd donation for another cash cow (which incidentally failed, too). Regular updates are meant to play over this, which works quite well, too.If you want to buy PA (or rather, the expansion, as it's the exact same game with more content), do it for the game's sake, not to support the devs. They took EA for an idol and consquently lost a lot of followers; now another one.

												When it first appeared, Planetary Annihilation seemed like it would become one of the best rts games of the decade. For once we had a game that was not a clone of the one of the ""standard"" rts. (like Star Craft) The 3d worlds and unique art style, as well as the addition of the orbital layer seemed to have much promise. It was also a game by a smaller developer, and many of us like to support smaller companies. When I bought the game, it was not finished by any strech of the imagination. It was buggy, laggy, and had balance issues. But even then, it was fun. A while later, the game was better optimised, balanced, and had more unit variety ( around the time of the Unit Cannon update). That was when I really began to though that uber would pull the game together and make it into the game that the majority of players had hoped for when they bought it. Now that Titans has been released, I and many other players (judging by the reviews and steam forums) feel cheated. The fact that Uber has released our dream update as a seperate game is like a slap to the face. The game is not even near complete without the update. Its rediculous that Uber expects even the backers from the beta and gamma phases of the game to pay an extra $40 for an update to an unfinished game. I don't know about other players,  but Uber can say good by to any funds from my wallet until this is changed. I am sad that I had to give this game a bad review, as the concept was excellent; but I can't reccomend a game where needed updates cost as much as the game itself.			"

												So I started off playing this originally on release after buying into the kick starter, at the time I struggled to play it and felt a little let down, BUT I have recently come back to this game and it has been an incredible experience. I've had a lot of fun battling the A.I which seem to be very fast and responsive to the player making it a good challange unlike other games where they're seemingly useless or just Godlike. The game is like all other RTS games, yes it can become repetitive but every match creates a new scenario, there are always differences between matches. Personally, securing a planet and coating it in defenes then creating a giant army, followed by silently making a teleporter on an unexplored planet then just flooding it with an endless swarm of units set to patrol randomly in every direction until there was nothing left but craters and debris was incredible, just witnessing a near endless flow through the portal and seeing how the enemies reacted and banded together to face armageddon really did set this game aside. I personally would recommend this game to others, the art style is beautiful, and the audio creates an immersive, descolate, clanking future. I love it.			"

												They started with an amazing idea and some pretty great stuff. Then they decided not to take care of the bugs and crash prolems with the game. Futher more the game lags so much and they have done nothing about it. All they did was create a DLC which has ONE new item and yet it cost twice as much and is the same thing just with some improvement on bugs and performance issues that should have been taken care of in the original game. Even if you really like the idea and want to give a shot on a sale this game isn't worth a penny because of the absurd problems that the creators decided not to fix and instead try to get an insane cash grab with the DLC out of its player base. I suggest trying a game like supreme commander if you want a massive scale RTS game or just wait till the developers get their heads out of their asses and fix this. After all if there was just an ounce of love put into this games performance it may have been decent maybe even great but instead it turned to a heaping pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥cash grab.			"

												I'm no hardcore strategy game player. But I have very much enjoyed blowing up planets in this game, especially in multiplayer. There's a lot of multitasking involved here with harder difficulties. So I recommend teaming up with a friend if you're going for those. After a while though you're out of tricks and there is only so much you can do with buildings and units. A very hardcore RTS, and a very worthy successor to ""Total Annihilation"". The ONLY RTS I liked during my childhood days.This game's graphics might look simple enough. But most systems that seem high-end (mine and friend's computers) seem to have a lot of trouble showing a lot of units on screen, there is no limit to building things as far as I've seen either (which is awesome). Also simulating more than 4-5 planets at once in a solar system proves difficult.			"

												I think this is an enjoyable RTS. I enjoy the multiple planets you have to deal with not present in other Real Time Strategies. The art style of the game is simple so it is fairly easy to tell what units and buildings you have, but the graphics aren't the best I've seen, but that doesn't mean they're terrible at all. This game at the moment is pretty stable, a few exceptions are present though. I will list examples, the pathing needs some work because I will give units many jobs to do, but their pathing will smash them into walls for a while until it realizes what needs to happen. Another thing is that when I go to place move or attack commands the game will wait about two to five seconds to do the command because the path line doesn't show up for two to five seconds, I believe this is caused by the lag that large numbers of generally aircraft create because of their constant animation of moving up and down in height causing the shadow beneath them to lag.Though overall I would reccomend a play with this game it is quite enjoyable in my opinion. Go check youtube and other sources for reviews as well if you are paranoid.			"

Product received for free
												Started single player game, went to planet, started building. You know because it says single player update on the fudging logo. Played for an bit, saved game. Came back and all progress was gone... This is not cool its weak, like a broken game. No way can I recommend a game that doesn't save work put into it. What kind of devs make a game that doesn't save? Is it too hard to code? Hell no, just build the right data struct bro. Also it makes you pay for more commanders, really? 4.99 for a 3D model, complete BS. Money grabbing pansies. Might as well add that there is no tutorial, just a fudging button that says how to play, which doesn't explain anything. Even games from the 90s have fudging tutorials.Through some investigation I found out that they were 6utt-hur7 over the release of this game, and had to re-release the same game but under another name PA Titans. It has an ""improved"" single player tutorial, and probably adds all the commanders that they make you pay for on this dated piece of doo doo.I would have never said anything if the game didnt have such high profile people, ""seasoned vets"" of the RTS genre, that asked for Kickstarter money. This is embarassing, the game had real potential and its a complete flop.The game is BS, and weak in the RTS genre. Dumb AI, 2 resources, boring, blocks. Totally worth what I paid for it. I don't recall ever hating a cheesy a$$ game as much as I hate this garbage.I also want to add that I have to drink a lot of vodka to enjoy this game. It's so slow that I have to R3t4rd my senses just to sit through the boredom. Curious on how slow? I can contest that it took the 30 min out of the 1 hour I put into it for 1 enemy to show up and attack me with a little ship. I destroyed it with my horde of dumb little blocks, very efficiently, then I patiently waited for more, but did more come, I didn't see them, because my saved game was erased. If you've never played an RTS in your life, then by all means you will probably love this game. If you've played any of the RTSs below, you will probably not enjoy this game. The game that this game tried to copy, but failed miserably, is Supreme Commander. It looks just as good as this game, and it only cost $30 for the main + exp. Instead of $30 + $5 +$5 +$5 +$5 + ... as many commanders as you want * $5.Here are some RTS, that I have played, and would recommend to someone that wants to play a good RTS.Starcraft, Starcraft 2, Company of Heroes, Warcraft 2, Warcraft 3, Age of Empires, Age of Empires 2, Age of Empires 3,  Homeworld, Command and Conquer Series, Total Annihilation, Warhammer 40k, Rome Total War, Empire Earth, Shogun Total War, Rise of Nations, Shogun 2 Total War, Empire Total War, Stronghold, Dune 2, Warlord Battlecry 3, Men of War, Medieval 2 Total War, Supreme Commander, Battle Realms, Warcraft 1, Black & White, Black & White 2, Dungeon Keeper, Dungeon Keeper 2, there are more far better than this game...Lastly, I had to update this for all you diehard down-voting haters. Keep dreaming, enjoy wasting your time and missing out on real quality gaming.			"

Posted: August 9, 2015
												I'm not huge into writing reviews, but having tried and wanted to like this game for so many hours, I just have to say it's been consistently disappointing.The game is visually stunning, and has a very clean, cel-shaded sort of look that is very appealing.  It takes some serious hardware to make it run, but the visual appeal is very high.  The main failings are in gameplay, particularly single player.In my opinion, they've made a big mistake in confusing length for depth, and after a while it becomes clear that the only real solutions to the game are to rush or grind.  Games seem to last either about eight minutes or three hours, with little in between.  You either assassinate your opponent's commander right away, or you're in for a very long, slow slog through hundreds of inert power plants and metal extractors, and assaults on base after base after base.  When multiple planets are involved, it slows down even further.  I add that with some serious disappointment, by the way, as multiple planets seemed like such a great idea, but in reality I have found it just a bridge too far in keeping track of an RTS like this unit by unit.  You can't really automate any of the things you'd like to be able to in order to make things like multiple planets or spherical maps work in any really convincing way, and very often you'll find yourself getting a ""Base Under Attack"" warning and spend more time wondering where it's happening than responding to it.  You can't set your units to do anything useful while you're not watching, like run away when they're attacked, or respond to enemies attacking your base.  You can set up a perpetual unit patrol, but that's about it.  And your little tanks will sit distressingly still while being bombarded from outside their sight range when you'd think they should be able to be set to retreat when they're hit, or when they've reached some kind of damage tolerance.  Maybe there are ways to do this, but they aren't terribly easy to see.  More often than not, they'll just kind of stand around waiting to die until you specifically tell them to do otherwise.Galactic War was particularly interesting in conception, and another feature I thought highly of initially, but the way it's structured is bizarre, and frequently puts you up against enemies that cannot be beaten, not because the AI is particularly smart, but simply because you play with handicaps based on having to randomly discover the correct technology to allow you to do even simple things like store energy or metal.  You can't recon planets ahead of time, you have to commit to an attack whole-hog, and if you haven't happened to chance upon some particular technology to counter something your opponent has that you don't, games become very hard to play.  Since you can't withdraw from an unwinnable battle, it means that one bad skirmish basically spoils your whole campaign.  This was an oddly obvious thing for a game that's so clearly structured in a system of strength and counter-strength, and I have to wonder why they have kept it working this way.  More often than not, your very first enemy has advanced, multifaceted tech options and you're simply throwing masses of first-tier tanks at him because that's all you have available.  I don't find that to be an element of depth or a challenge - I just find it frustrating at best, and boring at worst.  Moreover, the ""come-from-behind"" victories those conditions are apparently supposed to encourage don't feel rewarding, they  just feel like you spent an hour mobbing your opponent with masses of disposable units instead of planning and executing any kind of an interesting or multi-faceted attack.I hasten to add that I'm not huge on multiplayer experiences with RTS games, though, so take that with a grain of salt - playing against humans may be more of a rich experience, but if gameplay videos are anything to go by, it seems to be a lot of the same kind of build-up-and-rush tactics as more or less the only dimension of the game - few multiplayer games I've watched get anywhere near the final technology levels, making them essentially interestingly designed dead weight.  And to reiterate the point about the spherical planets: visually fascinating and well-conceived, but the feature doesn't add any real tactical detail or depth - it just makes it hard to keep track of what you're looking at and how your camera is oriented.  It also very often results in what's ""up"" being totally relative, and so makes the maps hard to track, especially, again, when you have more than one planet to worry about.I plan to come back to this from time to time, but overall, I find it to be a drag more than anything else.  It's not so much excting to play as it is long and frequently irritating.  Somehow, on the way from Supreme Commander to here, they lost the real character of the game.  If you're looking for Supreme Commander 3, this is not it.  Stick with Forged Alliance and you'll be much happier with the experience.			"

												UPDATE 1/29/15This continues to blow me away with the content, and that's why i have over 1000 hours now. Call me biased, but it's really now my favorite RTS game of all time now. This balance and gameplay update brought some absolutely amazing features to the game, it's very close to being finished.Save game is also coming next! Yay!UPDATE 12/18/14Unit cannon HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥!!Literally made the game 10x better, no more stalemates.Honestly though, most bugs are squashed and mechanics feel super solid now.This is a definite steal, at $10 you might as well buy 3 for other people. This update has made things so much better, and I can't quite explain how much better this huge update made it.69/68 Would Cannon Unit Again.UPDATE 11/15I've gotten more out of the $40 I payed back in March. This game is the number one played game for me, and I'm not surprised even with L4D2 coming in at second place. Let me tell you why: PROS:Instead of listing stuff, which makes it look like the game only has highlighted parts, I am going to explain why I like it so much. The huge landscapes and massive armies without unit caps is the feaure that no other game can brag about. The moment the server starts to lag ever so slightly is the moment you realize that you did something right. Obviously, lag is bad, and it only occurs on huge systems or when you spam units.The modding community is one of the best I've been a part of, the organization and variety turn this game into a sandbox for game modes, inlcuding entire balance mods and game modes like ""Dox4Lyf"" where there are giant dox and dox cannons. This is the main reason why I come back to play it. Competitive play is also very healthy; with an active esports community and system editor, the competitve side is amazingsauce.CONS, AND WHY I DONT LIKE SOME OF ITYeah. There's no tutorial. But guess what? There's a thing called youtube. This is not an excuse for there veing no official guide, but really? You want an official tutorial in 2014? Sigh...Anyway, the game has lots of bugs, including some crashing, but there is a handy recconnect feature that will recconnect you to your latest game if you leave or crash. There are very few graphic bugs, and when something does happen with the UI, just press F5 and it should be fixed.The balance is kinda bad, but with a modding community, there is really nothing to worry about. Vanilla balance is still fun, it really is, but there are some obvious problems that need to be addressed.CONCLUDEPA is worth more than $30, and it's a shame people look at the cleche reviews here on steam and the rating on metacritic and automatically say ""nope"". The game has a future and it would be awesome to have more people be a part of it. It's the first RTS i've thoroughly enjoyed and should be for everyone.			"

												Large scale yet simple RTS. No real story, no need for one, what you see in the title is what you get. You can put thrusters on planets and smash them into enemy planets. Plus nukes and orbital lasers and all that goodness. Single player Galactic War mode is semi-rougelike I would say, in that if you don't quit the game before the AI kills you you're perma dead. Oh and that the tech (stuff you build) is limited and you acquire more tech as you win systems.Honestly, haven't played an RTS since Age of Empires and I had loads of fun with this. Worth noting it is getting regular updates as well.			"

												Don´t buy it now, it´s too late for this game.

												Planetary Annihilation------------------------------------------A groundbreaking RTS (Real Time Strategy) game. Very many levels of strategy where terrain affects strategy dramatically. There is no one powerful strategy that everyone uses, spicing up gameplay and requiring a smart person who can adapt to different challenges and scenarios. I have spent over 270 hours playing this game and I plan to keep that number counting as more updates are released. It is not a game, like other RTS' that you can take your time and stare at your guys. You need to be quick and manage your troops effectively. Once you start expanding to other planets and making more bases, managing gets harder. Giant pushes of units will not work anymore. You have to corrdinate attacks from many means, space, land, air, sea, etc. Attack from multiple fronts and use the planet to your advantage. It's a sphere, you can attack from anywhere. Take over your enemies' outposts, manage your resourses, annihilate your foes.ATTENTION: MANY PEOPLE HAVE  QUIT THIS GAME DUE TO THEIR INCOMPETENCE IN PLAYING THE GAME EFFECTIVELY. THIS IS NOT AN EASY GAMENote: If you are looking for a singleplayer experience, do not purchase this game. The game is geared towards multiplayer gameplay. Singleplayer gameplay does not reflect the multiplayer game very well at all. Also, mutliplayer games can range from being very short or very long in length.

												So far, this is a really fun game that I have no regrets purchasing.My short summary of PA: The aggressive, large scale, macro-focused, pick up and play rts with excellent esport potential.My past RTS experience: Starcraft 1 and 2, Supreme Commander, Homeworld 1 and 2, Company of Heroes, Warcraft 2 and 3, Command and Conquer: Yuri's Revenge/Red Alert 3, Age of Empires 2/Online, Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War (all expansions), Army Men: RTS (for kicks and giggles)  Pros: No needlessly complex mechanics to give the illusion of ""strategic depth"" making for clean gameplay. The pace isn't woefully slow and feels great. Early game isn't repetitive and boring (unlike Starcraft 2) since units get out VERY quickly. Very mod friendly (especially for UI and hotkeys) Can create your own maps Unit diversity is certainly sufficient (I've played MANY Starcraft 2 matches with less unit diversity than this game) Multiplayer community is still active (this is primarily a reaction to people shouting ""ded gaem!1"" with no basis [basically because it's not nearly as big as more mainstream competitive games]) Awesome Picture-in-Picture feature that allows you to multitask two speparate locations (planets, even) at once. One faction means everyone's using the same tools to get the job done. Places emphasis more on player skill. Matches can last anywhere from 8 minutes to over an hour. Awesome art style and soundtrackCons: Single player campaign is lacking. It's definitely still fun! But it doesn't have a lot of meat. No continuous story. Units still need to be balanced more. (This is always the case with a recently released rts, and the game isn't HORRIBLY balanced) Naval is very underwhelming at the moment. Basic bot unit (dox) needs tweaking to become less prominent in the early game. Tier 2 units (which are pretty sweet) need to be worked to a point where their use is more encouraged. As of now, they aren't used that much. The community has made several balance mods already, however. One faction can be disappointing to those who were looking for drastically different playstyle shifts.That's about it, folks. The game contains much more good than it does bad. Many reviews on here seem very emotional or overly sensationalized so hopefully this was concrete and objective enough to aid you in a responsible purchasing decision. "

												A note about the reviews:Lots of negative reviews were posted in the Fall due to the game being launched as an offically release (instead of early access) while lots of key features were missing. At the same time, the developer launched a kickstarter for a different game, which scared a lot of players (including myself) into thinking that that Planetary would be abandonded and unfinished. But each month we've been getting big patches that added in matchmaking, annihilasers, unit canons, balance tweaks, new air and sea units, etc. The devs are still working hard on planetary, and it plays like a complete game.This is a great RTS that breaks the mold, and you'll never feel like you've played the same match twice.

												I though PA will become failed project. I stand corrected. This is a trainwreck of a project. Nothing is there. Game got it's ""release"", but its still in never-ending beta. I mean, it is ""beta than nothing"", but i'd rather prefer nothing than this mediocrity. Built it's fame on nostalgic vibe of Total Annihilation, this game fails to deliver, and instead constantly slaps you: ""Oh so you wanted various units and balanced unit forks like in TA? Streamlined!"" *slap*, ""Oh so you wanted interesting maps with lots of variety we've been talking about? Budget cuts!"" *slap* ""Oh so you wanted epic single player campaign? NOPE!"" *slap*...It ain't fun.Do i really need to support or even like a game which constantly slaps me? Nah, no. Then again, what do you expect. It is from makers of monday night combat. And we all know what piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥of a game that were. So much so that they, few months after release, threw it into free to play. And even there it failed to gain substantial crowd. So please, for the love of god - do not buy it. Let it die off quicker, let it be a testiment to ""how crappy developer can fail to deliver no matter what"".			"

												The game is fun. Supreme Commander/Total Annihilation on a planetary/solar-system scale. I haven't ran into any bugs... The only thing is, the AI difficulty.

There is no campaing mode and no properway to save checkpoints.No real way to naturally develop your skills and learn step by step all technologies.War mode and Skimirsh are ok for a short while, but eventually I got bored.I cannot recommend this game to single players until a proper Campaign mode is created.Multiplayers, please check other more appropriate reviews.

												Now, to start off, the game itself isn't necessarily bad. At its core, way, way down, the games mechanics and overall idea and design are actually very good. Its fast paced, action packed, and keeps you on your toes; and its art-style is fresh and pleasant to look at. When it worked, I enjoyed it a lot.Ahh, but theres the bad part: when it worked. The game is techinically out of its beta/dev stage, but it still feels like its in it.  Not only does the game lack any form of tutorial or guide in-game (you can find some on youtube), but the game also suffers from balancing issues:-Naval units are completely pointless. There is so little water on most planets in the first place, and they pack 0 punch.-It is WAY to tedious to try to do some of the things that the trailers brag about you being able to do in the game. The perfect example: slamming asteroids into enemy bases. Sure, its cool when you do it, but its not much of a reward to your hours of effort trying to do it.And then, of course, there are the bugs/glitches:-Graphical glitches have been the worst lately. Does anyone remember Total war: Rome 2's release? Thats the state the game has been hovering in ever since it's 'release'.-Enemy and troop a.i. will sometimes just die on you mid-combat.-Pathing is pretty bad: it was worse, but its been somewhat addressed in (the most) recent patches.-and many, many more...The worst part about it is that Uber entertainment is seemingly preparing to abandon the game. Most of you have likely heard of the cancellation of 'Human recources' on kickstarter. Why are they attempting to create an entirely new game when PA isnt even finished, let alone polished? And there are plenty of us that remember SMNC. It is quite clear that the executives at uber entertainment are aiming more toward creating cash-ins than creating solid, fully complete games; likely the product of coorporate greed. Or maybe they arn't even aware that thet're doing what they are doing?In conclusion, PA is a fun and fresh RTS with some fun gameplay elements, but its masked by a sea of bugs, a lack of gamemodes/additional content, and an overwhelming feeling of incompleteness. I give it a 5/10 when factoring in the bugs and other problems; a 7-8/10 when looking at FULLY WORKING gameplay. I only recommend this if you are willing to deal with all of said problems and really enjoy RTS's.			"

So what is Planetary Annihilation?Planetary Annihilation is part of the Total Annihilation/Supreme Commander RTS sub-genre. It focuses on large-scale battles, favouring macro over micro. Of the two it has more in common with Total Annihilation.To summarise some of its selling points:Planets - Play on spheres not flat planes. No corners to hide in, attacks can come from any direction.Systems - fight across multiple planets with different terrain types, and their orbits affect transit time.Orbital - A whole other layer in addition to land, air and water. Attack from space with lasers.Super weapons - Forget experimentals, you fire units across space, smash planets into one another or even build your own Death Star to blow up other planets with.Active ladder - Unless you're in the top 10, your ladder queue time will be minimal. The ladder maps are both diverse and extremely well balanced. We've gone from top players having one or two generic opening builds to multiple builds per-map.Active developers - A day doesn't go by on the official forums without a post from the developers. Sorian even works on the AI on his days off.AI by Sorian - If you're into your single-player then you're getting an AI from the guy behind the infamous Sorian AI mod for SUPCOM, who was also recruited by GPG to ""fix"" the SUPCOM2 AI.Scale - The game can be as small or epic as you want. You can battle over a tiny moon for ten minutes, or you can battle for hours over up-to 16 planets. Planets can vary massively in size, with the largest giving you more than enough space for a couple of hours fighting, if not more.Mods - There's an active modding scene. The game was built to be moddable, and the PA Mod Manager gives you access to all of them. From graphical mods to UI mods to total conversion mods. Whether you want coloured explosions or to fight with nothing but Boom Bots with a massive Boom Bot birthing new Boom Bots where it walks, the modders have you covered.Powerful map editor - The System Editor allows you to create almost anything you can imagine. Planet shaped like an hourglass? Check. Planet with holes in its side you can hide in to escape bombers? Check. Planet with an outer ring which is also playable[forums.uberent.com]? Check. The community is letting its imagination run wild.Active scene - There are constantly streams[www.twitch.tv] and events happening. The game has Twitch support built into it, so someone is always streaming something, and there are events and tournaments[exodusesports.com] happening almost every weekend! Many of them feature cash prizes. And of course there's the community IRC[irc.lc] too if you just want to chat.Procedural campaign - If you're into single-player you have skirmish, but you also have the Galactic War which is a rogue-like campaign across a randomly generated galaxy. Fight across different systems (each of which plays like a standalone skirmish) against an increasingly difficult AI, unlocking new technologies to help you, and upon winning you unlock new loadouts for your future campaigns.Server-client mode - Remember how your multiplayer match in SUPCOM lagged when someone with a low spec machine hit their limit? There's none of that here. No matter how crappy your opponent's machine everything is run on the server so they can't impact your experience. The game scales far better in multiplayer. It also means people can't cheat.What PA doesn't have:A story campaign - Seriously, if you want a story campaign this is not the RTS for you.Interactive tutorial - There's an in-game user guide, but no walk through tutorial.Didn't this cost, like, $90 last week? Is this a scam?Planetary Annihilation was funded through a Kickstarter campaign in 2012. As with any Kickstarter campaign there were numerous tiers, with the higher tiers getting you access earlier, $90 for alpha and $60 for beta respectively. For $20 (or $15 if you backed early enough) you would receive the game on release.When Uber put PA on Steam under Early Access they didn't want backers to feel punished for buying in early. Indeed, without those backers the game wouldn't have been made (see Human Resources). Thus the Early Access followed the Kickstarter pricing, $90 for alpha and $60 for beta. Only when the game passed the expected release date of December 2013 did the price get reduced further and all Kickstarter backers were given access.Since then it has been priced, and put on sale, in line with any other game on Steam.Didn't the developers abandon the game?Uh, no. Developers are posting every day on the official forums[forums.uberent.com]. As I type this there's a developer in Twitch chat on the stream of ZaphodX[www.twitch.tv] talking about what changes are coming in the next Player Test Environment (PTE) release.I develop an AI mod for the game and all my questions are answered by Sorian, much as other developers have been on hand to respond to the queries of other modders. Meanwhile balance changes are released to the PTE, often to deal with issues raised by the community through the forums or identified by the developers in community tournaments and streams. Players test the changes out, revisions are made and eventually it makes its way from PTE to the live environment.You can switch between PTE and live any time you want, either through the Uber launcher or Steam beta opt-in.Didn't it have a rough release?Yes, it did. There's no denying that the game wasn't in the shape we'd have like to have seen.But it's not release any more, it's months later and the game has been hugely improved since then. I'm more than happy to say it's in an excellent state now. The last major release was just before Christmas and more changes are already on the way.Reviewers who have revisited the game have been very positive[waywardstrategist.com].I heard it has micro-transactionsThe game allows you to buy commander models from an in-game store with real money. These are purely cosmetic changes with no gameplay impact. All the commanders are ones designed for $1000 Kickstarter backers who have not only approved their commanders being sold, but are also getting a cut from every sale.The reason for this is to allow PA to be a long-term investment so Uber can continue to make further content releases well into the future. And you can ignore the entire thing if you want, it's not in your face, it's all tucked away in the armory.What about T3?The Orbital Factory is T3. But if you mean experimentals, then no, PA doesn't have experimentals. It has super weapons.I've heard I can't play offlineYou can.So is it worth it?Yes, absolutely yes. The only other active game even vaguely in this space is Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever, and the two are different enough that I cannot see why you wouldn't want to try Planetary Annihilation.It's a game that's actively supported, has developers who listen and respond to the community, and it's getting better every day.It won't be for everyone, but no game ever is. It's not Total Annihilation and it's not Supreme Commander, it's both a spiritual successor to them while also being its own game.			"

												Fun at first, until the realization hits that this game is all about economy and not really at all about warfare.  Pretty much just build a big army and send it at someone.  You can try surgical, but turrets (especially air) are fairly cheap and do work if set up with just a little bit of intelligence.  The whole planet busting thing is cool, but only late game when playin against lots of people.  Also, the interface needs to be streamlined in order to more easily control units, because its very easy to lose them and not have workers working on anything.  In conclusion, too much economy, not enough warfare, poor interface.			"

												I wanted to love this game SO much, but it just doesn't have the swank that made Supreme Commander the breathtaking game it is. It's cumbersome, boring, and all that this seems to do is capitalize on the idea of smashing planets together, instead of amazing gameplay. The musical score is brilliant, but that's about all they have to offer.			"

												If you like RTS and over the top inter-planetary  strategic battle, this is the game for you. Thou limited (still) to one simular technology this game offers a great variety of possibilities for total destruction among one another.The great mass production of buildings and units possible while maintaining a constant metal and energy flow really works very addictive, being efficient as a robot/computer is essential is some battles, losing concentration in multiplayer and even Skirmish against AI battles isn't done, this will result in getting behind one schedule and end you up being annihilated  !!!!

												Planetary Annihilation was a fun game but the Planetary Annihilation:Titans should have been an update to the original game. The original game, while fun, lacks content. My hope was that instead of just making a new game they would improve the current one. At this point I could not recommend this game or Planetary Annihilation: Titans as I would not be surprised if something similar happened.			"

												I loved Total Annihilation, both Supreme Commanders (even if storyline was a... well... medium) , this is... undeveloped. Or maybe I'm getting older and require more.One faction, no storymode, comic style - can't get through this game. I like dirty tech-like desing of previous titles. Right now I feel like I'm commanding papercut army of same looking units.Even if the gameplay is fun, I didn't get to this part, because in first few hours game doesn't make you want to play more. AI is just stupid as hell, and I won't hit multiplayer without knowing the game.Has potential, but no soul.			"

												Why is this even still for sale? Standalone expansion is the same price and features this game + other content. Why does Steam allow this sort of behavior? This is 100% a scam. Releasing a ""standalone"" expansion with 5 extra units is shady enough.Game itself is dull, uninteresting, no single player content to speak of and no multiplayer community now that a standalone expansion was released (didn't have much to begin with). Game stability is poor as well, multiple bugs and crashes particularly late game.			"

												A great concept with lacking executing. Naval and orbital aspects of the game are unfortunatly underdone. Missing the trademark features original TA players want. Definatly had some fun matches, but the game is very glitchy and it is very frustrating to play. Many times i have been deep into a game only to watch my base be walked in on as my turrets wont fire, or watch my entire planet get nuked as 4-6 fully loaded anti nuke launchers do nothing but watch. If you can get a non glitchy game, you'll have fun. But then you'll be burned out as you lose time and time again because the game simply is very bugged. Probably could have spent 30$ elsewhere better,  still had fun for a bit but not worth it.			"

												This is a great game that I've thoroughly enjoyed playing since late alpha. Proud to say I'm one of the thousands of Kickstarter backers that made this project a reality. The game engine has been built from scratch to support modding, which helps extend the game even more. Recent updates continue to shape and improve the game for the better, but it has been playable and fun before it was even released.The scope for strategy is vast, especially in team games. 1v1 ranked games are fast paced and can get tense. PA has a different balance to many other RTS games, which can take some getting used to, but is well worth it.You can tell that Uber really care about this game, and have invested a lot of skill and passion in to it. I could go on about smashing moons into planets, destroying planets with giant lasers, huge multi faceted armies sweeping across a planet's surface destroying all in its wake, teleporting across planets, and so much more, but watch the videos and see for yourself. It is well worth it :)			"

												It's basically Supreme Commander 3. Nearly every detail about this is straight-up Supreme Commander rip-off. What sets it apart is the very cool solar system map style that allows for literally global conflict and, as the title suggests, very satisfying planetary annihilation.Unfortunately it is very true that the game is buggy. More than once I built rocket boosters on a small moon and launched it into a crash-course with an enemy commander, only to have the two celestial bodies simply vanish on impact (I just pretend they both silently imploded).  When they do successfully collide it will leave a crater half the size of the planet on the target, but units will still be able to build there, floating in the air as if there is no crater at all.The graphics need work too. I understand that the scale of the game is enormous, but there are no textures to speak of at all. Supreme Commander looked better.My biggest gripe is that the map creator simply DOES NOT WORK. At all. I spent good chunks of time creating my own solar systems to play on, but when I load the maps in-game they are completely different from what I made. The only thing that carries over is the actual name of the system. That really grinds my gears.However, Planetary Annihilation is FUN. That's what matters most to me and that is why I give it my recommendation.			"

Posted: January 29, 2015
												Planetary Annihilation seems to be a hot button right now for how ""Early Access"" games should be released. I want to objectively discuss that point, the devs support of the game, and its current state. (build 77443)First off, I want to say that I love this game. I bought this game in earl alpha and have been pretty active with it as I can get with an RTS. The thing about PA is that its not the average RTS. Its not Starcraft, Grey Goo, Etherium, or even Supreme Commander. PA is a huge game, it has no unit cap, and the only 'research' you need for higher teir units is to build the required factory. This structure for an RTS supports a different playstyle. So lets look at the simple, ""is this game for you?"" -myeah-maybe... The lack of a tech tree seems to be a deterrent for some, so if you want the slow build up for complicated tactical gameplay, you may need to look a little closer at PA. I've played this game competitively, casually, with friends, by myself, and pretty much everything. Its possible to set up planets and solar systems, so I've even messed around with scenario games, like all Navy or an Air Force only game with friends. I've genuinely enjoyed all of this. It has offered me my money's worth for sure.Competitive: PA is micro-intensive. You need to constantly be checking everything you're trying to do. Camera hotkeys and anchors help with your interplanetary wars. That aside, nearly all competitive matches I've played has gone a T1 battle, between combinations of the T1 units, when the casual really well matched battles can go on for 40 minutes. The 1v1 ranked matches are played on mirrored, pre built maps. I don't see this as a problem, in fact, I welcome it. Most RTS's have this map structure to make the playing field even. Their are plenty of strategies in competitive. Of course you have your META, Aniti-META, Anti-Anti-META, but PA lets you focus on heavy minor strategies like choosing whether you want to bomber harass, build up those turrets, get a more respectable army, rush that early expansion, maybe try all at once and plunge your economy, etc. You can mold your playstyle to fit PA. Casual: I defiantly wouldn't reccomend PA to anyone who has never played a RTS, and expect them to enjoy thier time. Like any game as micro intensive as this, PA can be a little frusturating to players who stick to fighting the AI. That being said, once you ramp up the AI, it can get pretty-friggin challenging. of course, you can put the AI on normal and toy with them any way you want. The galactic war mode is okay, nothing super new, but you can make a campaign out of it if you want.With friends: Really fun if everyone is ready to lose. Teaming up with a few friends to fight 3 bots on the hardest difficulty is a nice experience, full of tears and suffering, and sometimes, triumph. Then killing your friends with 30+ nukes is also interesting. Dynamic Alliances in FFA games make for some interesting real time diplomacy. Really fun game with friends. about 30 hours (i have ~95 at time of posting) is just with friends.Singleplayer: I don't have much to say after what I've already discussed. Load up a bot game, play the Galactic War mode, run some scenarios. Make it your own.Now I want to just touch on the aspects of the game that are discussed in about every other review here. Music - Fantastic, want soundtrack. 9/10Graphics - Fun artstyle that I personally enjoy, looks great. 8/10Personalization - Purchase the commanders that the backers made (I'll talk about this in the next section.) Commanders are generally nice looking, get to pick your own. No special effects on commanders, e.g. one doesn't have faster build speed or fly. That is nice. 6.5/10UI - Used to be jumbled, now much nicer. 9/10Now lets talk about how the release was handled. I was generally just a spectator because I had already bought the game, but I agree with most people saying that it should not be in 'full release' yet. Constant updates keep coming, and the community is alive. It feels like a finished game at most points, but it can have its issues. Luckily devs are constantly on it. The big fuss about all of this is due to the fact that this was a crowd funded game. This makes people complain when they see that the uniqe, player created commanders cost some money (personally I think a bit too much, but who am I?) but again, crowd funded, they supported first, they have privilages, these kind of games are fres from DAY ONE DLC GET THE GAME EARLY GET SNOOP DOG MARIJUANA GUN PACKS MTN DEWRITOS, so be happy about that. To be honest, I don't really care - but the topic has to be discussed. Early access games are a breed of their own, and people need to realize that they aren't going to be done when in development. Some people say PA is still in dvelopment, I wouldn't necessarily disagree, but if the title of 'released' bothers you that much, you may need to go to another game. But who cares about all of that? you just want a number. I give it a 7.5/10. I'll keep playing. New things keep popping up, and I like the dev team. Come back and buy it during a sale if you are skeptic. It drops to around 6-7$ so pick it up then if ever. If you don't want something where all of the tactics include where you place your base components and how you use your units, and want something a bit slower, but more in-depth - go check out Wargame Red Dragon, Grey Goo, and Etherium. They are all relatively new, look good, and have their own quirks.			"

To be honest this is basically normal move by developers now a days but still... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t move.Gameplay wise it's a 7/10. a bit laggy when building huge systems and multiple planets and stuff. could be optimized.As an RTS it's a solid 10/10 But still, Titans is out there so still no point in buying this game.Developers are a solid 1/10. ♥♥♥♥ em.

Early Access Review
								I know its early release, but feels like I wasted money on a Supreme Commander clone that is not nearly as good or smooth as SC1. So many things are missing, and its just awkward to control - I just gave up because you get pummeled - not because you aren't building well, but the controls are brutal! Scroll a bit with your mouse wheel and you're so zoomed out you can't see anything. You can't find units unless you are zoomed in very far, and meanwhile you're trying to scroll back across your round planet, to find your units, you're getting squashed because it took you a minute to find your troops. Its too bad - I love RTS games, but unless this gets a lot of improvement, I'm back to Supreme Commander and Sins....sigh, so much lost potential.			"

												As an original Kickstarter of this game I feel robbed of my $50 that I foolishly gave them. Thanks to Uber Entertainment, I will never Kickstart another game. For some reason, Uber decided to split the community up by creating a new stand-alone game called Titans, therefore the Vanilla version is completely dead and is no longer supported or updated. The game is still riddled with bugs: achievements do not unlock, cannot build in 5th Catalyst spot, units freeze up and do not respond, terrible pathfinding, etc.). As well as the game has terrible performance and terrible AI. By the way, you have to always be connected to their servers in order to play the game, and their servers have been down which you are out of luck if you want to play. The overall gameplay feels like this game should be $20 at most, and not the $40/$50 pricetag they are trying to sell it for. The gameplay at times is very stagnant and bland, however the musical score is excellent and it's a shame that such beautifully orchestrated music is in such a terrible game. There is no campaign, however there is a Galatic War mode which essentially is just a bunch of random skirmishes tied together with the player starting off with little to no technology and after every battle you will slowly increase your technology. After a few battles in Galatic War mode it's the same thing over and over and becomes very tedious. Finally, the loading time is ridiculously long for games in this day and age - it literally takes more than a couple of minutes to populate the world and to load your commander in. Do yourself and everyone a favor and skip this game, it's not worth it at all.			"

												Great concept, but an incredibly boring game. The unit diversity sucks, and the game was released without being finished. It still doesn't feel finished and it was ""released"" well over a year ago.Go buy Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, and download the Forged Alliance Forever mod so you can play online again. Much better experience than this.			"

												So basically if you start out getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you, you can literally with one man left turn the odds around. If you are skilled enough and or think smart, this game has endless possibilities. The controls are smooth once you get used to it, everything just flows. The graphics are excellent and you do not have lag when you have hundreds of units the FPS and game mechanics are optimized fantastically. This game should be way  more popular and i hope it gets the attention it deserves. The best part about this game is that you don't have a CAP on your army. You can have an endless army that's just massive!    My 2nd 1v1 game I played I rocked this dude. he wiped my army out but I had enough time to get a launch pad and get my commander to the Planetary destroyer planet or what ever its called. I got him there and immediately expanded resources and massed bombers and executed planet wide patrols so this guy could not land on my planet.. well I accidentally over looked a small part of the planet were he was able to plant a teleportation building and transferred at least 400 to 500 units. I immediately gathers all bombers and fighters, I positioned all my fighters to go in first and take the first wave of AA attacks then sent in my bombers in one quick strafe run my bombers took out ALL of the units and destroyed the teleportation device I immediately beefed up on my orbital patrol units and what ever he sent in after I destroyed and this was on going until i finally gained control of my Planetary destroyer.  He mass sent at least 6 to 7 nukes but luckily I knew he was going to do that because it was just commons sense he had no other options or crash his planet into mine.  so i made ANTI nuke missile's. GG his planet was wiped and I win and he raged. turned out he was like over 100 plus games in and it was my 2nd. GLORIOUS!  This game has endless possibilities and you will always have something to counter anyone's military so choose wisely. Best part about that battle was my orbital scout made it to his planet before I blew it up and he had at LEAST 300 orbital bombers. if he made it to my planet I would have lost.			"

This game is going forward very nicely. - i reccomend this game to any RTS lover who is getting a bit tired of the normal C&C type games. this one makes you think, plan, and laugh hysterically when things work out.

												Can't say for sure if I like it better than the original Total Annihilation but it has a lot of the same feel. Being able to battle across different worlds is definitely nice. I got the deluxe bundle and initially did not have the extra commanders. A quick email to support resolved that. No special abilities to the commanders that I can see but the different looks kind of lets you set your mood for a battle. I've seen some negative reviews but the game works and it's fun so I like it.			"

												I got this game in a bundle for like 3€ most (the whole bundle, not the game) and I still feel ripped off. The saddest thing is that the concept of this game is brilliant. It's just terribly executed.One of the biggest selling points of the game is that you can have a whole system and have a match where you not only have to fight the enemy, you also have to figure out where in the system they are. Sounds great, right? Yeah it should. The problem is, the moment you have a system that big (9+ planets) the game becomes unplayable, ranging between 1 and 14 FPS and with planets not rendering fully. My GTX 970 can run any modern game (Witcher 3, SW: Battlefront, etc) in Ultra at 50-60 FPS with no sweat. However even when I overclock it, it cannot run Planetary Annihilation at more than 14FPS when playing in a full system. The game looks barely better than a mobile game, the fact that it's far more demanding than games like Witcher 3 or SW: Battlefront (even at low a graphic setting) is simply absurd.If you have a GTX 1080 or better than you can still get this game, but don't get such a high-end GPU just for PA. It's not worth it. If you don't have such a high-end GPU avoid it. It will bring you nothing but headaches.			"

												I'm really not sure what all the negativity is about here...Okay, maybe the developers were a bit.... annoying.... making a £29.99 DLC....I haven't even bought the DLC and this game is still pretty fun. You can have 2 hour games crashing asteroids into planets and basically destroying everthing.... You can have 15 minute games on one planet where you clash armies of bots, tanks, planes, orbitals and boats together.... You can create your own planetary systems, which you can do pretty good stuff with like making planets crash into eachother after a certain amount of time....Overall, a highly strategic RTS game which, to be honest, is amazing. :)			"

Early Access Review
								I've first fell in love in love with the strategy game genre with Warcraft then Command & Conquer and Red Alert I dropped a stupid amount of hours of my child hood into these games. I've played many titles like ZZ Soldier, Starcraft, Heroes of Might & Magic, Age of Empires, Civilization & Alpha Centari, Homeworld and etc. The one title that seemed to steal my soul was Total Annihilation.You might be uhhh I've never heard of that title. Was that a starcraft knockoff? Not even quite. Yea it was futuristic but that was it. It was one of the first fully 3d strategy game even if they had to secure the camera view to overhead because of deisgn problems and being overcomplicated. (TAspring is what it would have been like..) Every fired projectile had physics afffecting it and the cpu would track it + million other processes. There's more to say here but Im cutting it short. I spend days online on the boneyard ( in game multiplayer service which I've never seen the likes of before and still to this day have not) then Mplayer, then when that service crashed I spent my remainder days on Game Spy Arcade when not using tcp/ip connections with clan mates. This was an early game that made it easier to mod and accepted modding, which popped my mod cherry. To my dismay I never knew a game could be changed like that by a user!Then Supreme Commander came out which Chris Taylor the project lead of TA started that with some of the old crew of Cavedog (developer of TA) made another great addition to the franchise. Even though there was more to be improved but I spent a stupid amount of my young adult life playing it 19 to present(26). Now you have Planetary Annihilation. Alot of people from primordial ages of Cavedog and the newer employees from Gas Powered Games are making a new love child of Total Annihilation. There's brilliant ideas with the game but with it still in beta I cannot give a concrete review about it. If you love massive scale strategy in real time and space this might tickle your fancy.  I cannot wait til the team takes their time and finish this title. It could be another A+++ title like Total Annihilation or better!			"

												In my opinion, this is the most revolutionary leap forward ever made in the RTS genre. Nothing else comes close.Learning lessons from their past games (Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander), the developers have reinvented this style of RTS with a completely new paradigm: inter-planetary warfare, which means spherical maps (no hiding in corners), and the ability to destroy entire planets. In this new spiritual successor, the interface and economy have both been streamlined and simplified, while still keeping to their original spirit. The elimination of micromanagement has been a fundamental design goal from the beginning, and the developers have largely succeeded.One of the most significant features is the Chrono Cam, which gives the ability to jump to any point in a replay, or even a game that you're still playing. You can go back and forward in time, and even play the game in reverse. It's seamless and works extremely well. This Chrono Cam, in its entirety, is something that no other game studio has ever made.The game can be difficult at first, and there is a high bar for multiplayer gameplay, but there is an excellent integrated replay system that will let you watch anyone's games, even the top-tier ranked games, so you can improve rapidly.The interface is extremely powerful, which moves the emphasis away from micro-management to macro. This gives the greatest thinkers an advantage over the fastest clickers. This focus separates this game from most other real-time strategies, making it more about higher-order planning than quick reaction time.The strategies can get quite diverse with 4 ""planes"" of combat: Land, Water, Air and Orbital. I often end up fighting battles on multiple planets simultaneously in bigger games, but if this isn't your thing, you can limit your play to small single-planet systems.If you liked Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander, but are looking for a game with the potential for longevity, you'll find it here. If you've never heard of those games and are in to the RTS genre, you'll find this completely different from anything you've seen before.I've been waiting 15 years for this game, and I'm really happy with how it turned out.

												Every game I have played of Planetary Annihilation has been plagued by bugs, fps issues and general disapointment. The main issue I take with PA aside from its stability, is its lack of units. To win you have to use a ""Super weapon"" e.g. the death laser, weaponised asteroids and nukes. You lack the ability to win conventionally. All these issues do not exist in this games progenitors: Sup Com and Total Annihilation.To put it in as few words as possible: Playing Planetary Annihilation makes me want to play Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance.

												If you like RTS games on a larger scale then this is the game for you.Building massive armies and invading other planets just feels so good if you manage to pull it off. Or you can build a Death Star and destroy entire planets by the click of a button.Game is pretty well optimized and will probably run on lower end computers as well but tends to lag every now and then if you're playing on a map with 5 or more planets.For those that are interested in lore there is plenty of that in the singleplayer Galactic War campaign. Not to mention the amazing soundtrack this game has.The art style might not appeal to everyone but I quite like it. 9/10 would destroy entire solar systems again. ;)			"

												So I bought this game and actually enjoyed it, it's a solid RTS with mechanics never seen before, it has Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander spirit, but lacks in some of the good aspects of both those games. However, it does some things that those previous titles did not. You might say this should be a positive review. But it's not.I bought this game back in the last summer sale. I've been wanting to get it since it was announced in kickstarter but the exchange rate in my country is quite steep (multiply by 10 every price you see here) and I had to wait for a sale and for it to be ""finished"" and/or ""polished"" enough to merit the purchase. Keep in mind that I'm not a fan of Early Access and all that it implies (paying for a game without the guarantee that it'll be finished or it will deliver what was promised).Yesterday UBER launched TITANS (the unannounced ""expansion"" that  doesn't expand anything  because it's standalone) which for us that bought the original PA is literally a big finger in all orifices. You might say ""but hey, you get a discount!"" yeah... I get a 66% discount that leaves a $40 game (that I already own) at DLC price, with the knowledge that if I don't buy it  I will never get an update  on that same game (vanilla PA)  AT ALL . And I don't mean those Titan units and whatnot. I mean actual performance, bug, optimization fixes and updates. Basically all I get from this is that they discontinued support UNLESS I buy the game again. This could've been a DLC and noone would be ranting like this. But no, rebuy the game, guys.That's the worst business ethics I've seen in a while, and even worse the ""standalone DLC/Update"" Titans is getting good reviews for some reason. I hope the press doesn't keep praising it and consumers don't buy into this company's ways of treating us. I for one, will pirate it if I ever want to play it, these guys won't get a dime from me again. If you plan to buy Titans, do so, i'm sure it's good, but do it with caution, you never know what Uber might pull in the future.			"

												I honestly love PA, but I feel I should warn potential customers of the shady developer behind this game. PA is a great game that works most of the time. I have come across a fair share of bugs, but nothing that completely breaks the game. Uber, instead of patching the game, decides to release a stand alone expansion that adds 21 units and an equal if not greater number of bugs. So the original PA will never be patched since TITANS is now their focus. I cannot support a company that does this to their customers.			"

												I knew when PA came to Steam it was going to be nothing but a  poop storm diaster. Steam isn't kickstarter, don't post your unfinished game under early access and expect rediculous kickstarter like donations. Steam is for product distrubution not charity for your overhyped unfinished game. After their first cash grab Uber went on and released a second cash grab attempt. Again screwing over every steam user in favor of kickstarter morons who think game development should be run like a charity. Turns out that method of funding game development is about as productive as faith healing televangelists. You get nothing they get rich.Valve can't do anything out of fear of scaring away indie talent. So scum like Uber get to contiune on exploiting the community.			"

												So this game is okay. I'm more of a single-player/couch coop and the single player mode is a bit underwhelming compared with the extensive campaign modes of its predecessors like Total Annihilation. You'd probably get more mileage if you're into But anyway, this review is going to be more about the recent conduct of the developers Uber Entertainment. They've just released PA:Titans - which is the same basic game, plus a few more units - essentially what would be a $5 DLC for any other game. But because the original PA has a 67/33 split of good and bad reviews (enough to show up as 'Mixed Reviews' and Metacritic scores of 62 and 57, it appears they've  basically relaunched the entire game as a ""Standalone Expansion Pack"" for $40, albeit with freebies for Kickstarter backers, and a discount for EA buyers.It's the sort of shady♥♥♥♥♥♥move that you expect from the big publishing houses, and if that's how Uber choose to conduct themselves, they won't be seeing any more of my money.

												Most of the things shown in the trailers is wishfull thinking. Not only got it crowdfunded for an exorbitant amount. It also has ""Micro"" transactions (6 Bucks per Unit, and there are plenty) and full price DLC. You could easily spen 200-300 Bucks on this one. Does it deliver for that price? Not in the slightest. The game sessions are luck based clusterf**ks that have litle to do with strategy. Maybe it will be as pollished and impressive as the trailers promise in the future. But not today. Right now its a cashgrab and the development time took ages allready with little improvements. My tag for this one ""Money Annihilation""			"

												Well this is my first review sorry it wasn’t a thumbs up…     Okay so after taking a deep breath and calming down after my PA buddies told me about PA TitansI sat back and really thought about it is what Uber did cool or not cool??Okay so I’m a kickstart player I think I’m helping a software company get a title off the ground to what I would think is PA 1.0 a finished retail playable game then half way through this kickstart they try to release another title! I was upset at that point lucky the project was scrapped for whatever reason… but now I’m head shy of these guys $55 for PA is not a lot for a good title but I wanted to see the journeys end a finish retail ready game witch PA is not in my opinion. Then they come out with PA Titans this means they were dividing their time between two projects not being up front with kickstarters they call it a “stand alone expansion” this should have been the natural progression of PA!! not a “stand alone expansion” or DLS free for all kickstaters  not just 40.000$13 is not much I will go ahead and get it but with a sower taste in my mouth!Funny thing is Supreme commander forged alliance with a few mods is still today a better game than PA I play it more than PA and it’s like ten years old lol! PS.This is the last “Early access” game I’ll ever get! "

												This game is the bomb and totally worth the price. Nothing beats the moment when you finally blow up a planet with the annihilaser or you smash someones base out of existence with a moon. Even though the game is fully released, the devs are constantly working to continually update it to further improve the balance of the game as well as add some new features.As to all he negativity, there is really no basis for it anymore. The game is constantly evolving with balance and performance tweaks and updates. The game is so good right now! Yes, the singleplayer galactic war mode does still suck quite a bit but this game is meant for multiplayer and really shines there. As for making planets geographically more interesting, the system creator has been improved a lot with more settings to tweak in better customizing planets as well as there are countless interesting community maps to download.This game is so much better than it was a few months ago and is totally worth the pricetag.Great game with tons of replayability and oppurtunity for incredibly awesome moments of epic scale.9/10			"

												This game is pitched all wrong.  The hook isn't death stars or planet-smashing - the hook is that this the only RTS with strategic zoom on spherical maps. Spherical maps! I can't overemphasize how much of a game-changer these are! One you experience a battle not on one front, not on multple fronts, but on multiple connected circular fronts, you'll have a hard time going back to your standard flat-map RTS fare. It doesn't hurt that it looks gorgeous too. And there's a stripped down, focused tech tree that makes every unit unique and useful (no experimental spam here). And there's even a thriving mod scene with a 1-click-to-install mod database app to go along with it. Not to mention built-in multiplayer hosting, matchmaking, and a global replay library. Oh yeah, AND death stars and planet smashing. I picked this up for cheap at the last sale with low expectations - knowing only that it was generally considered unfinished. Liked what I found enough to buy a bunch of useless in-game commander skins to support continued updates. I definitely underpaid up front for the amount of fun I'm having, and there are more updates coming!There's some rough edges and features still missing, but the core game is all that counts and that's where PA shines. If fast paced Supcom gameplay with powerful, customizable controls on multiple spherical planetoids sounds fun to you, that's because it is.			"

The graphic style, the sheer scale and great music all add up to make this game worth the money. I truly believe that when this game is released, it may be a bit revolutionary RTS.Just please don't buy this if you don't have a powerful PC or a lot of patience, wait for the release. The release version will be much more polished and you won't have to deal with occasional bugs.			"

								It's still under development but already a nice RTS game that brings the genre onto a new scale by having entire solar systems as battlegrounds and planets as ""maps"".As time goes by and it approaches release it just keeps getting better. A must for everyone that loves large scale RTS.			"

												When I first installed this game, it was very much a PvP affair with bare bones single player at absolute best.  Having played a hour or so of now, Planetary Annihilation has blossomed into a satisfying package.  The EP sounds like a nice buy, but I honestly thought the additional commanders available for purchase is a little cheeky - but okay...All up, Planetary Annihilation performs rather nicely as I am currently running on my MacBook Pro and I would recommend it for those who enjoy old-school RTS with no limits.

												A unfinished game that gets a DLC/Expansion instead of Bugfixes.When the Game was in its Beta bugs were acceptable even though one payed nearly 30€. However, releasing the game without fixing Bugs where you can't move ur units anymore and other issues isn't fair.The biggest fist for the customers is that the features are missing and the developers just bring out an expansion.

												A quite different RTS. Play on spherical planets. And blow them up. Use hundreds of units of all kinds. Fight on land, sea, air and orbital space. What other game lets you do that?While you're browsing trough these reviews, ignore all reviews from september and october. Lots of issues have been fixed since release, and good new stuff such as ranked multiplayer, the Unit Cannon, offline mode and player guide have been added through updates. These old reviews are seriously outdated. The developers will keep adding and fixing things, they have absolutely not abandoned this game. The micro-transactions are purely cosmetic and have no gameplay impact. Plus by purchasing commanders, high tier KS backers get a small amount of money for their commander sales. The current problems that the game has is no saving and Galactic War is a bit unpolished and boring. Balance is also not that great, but still good. But those are issues that can be addressed in updates and I'm sure Uber will do so. Also managing multiple planets is quite hectic, though that is something that is harder to fix.What's really good about the game is the ability to construct units without a limit, you can have hundreds if not more than a thousand on the field(s). The planets are randomly generated and you can blow them up by smashing one into another one or by using the Annihilaser of doom. The orchestral soundtrack is also pretty epic. The AI is smart, propably one of the best (that doesn't cheat (except on ""absurd""))  in an RTS ever.What are you waiting for? Go blow up some planets!			"

In fact a whole mother♥♥♥♥ing swarm is on the other side of the moon.

He's vulnerable!So I get a nuke going, send a couple scouts out to find the commander but they're instantly shot before they can see enough.I send a few T2 vehicles on their way to their proxy moon base so that they can clean up.I fire the nuke, it hits. My three or four T2 vehicles get there. It's ground zero, BUT, a mother♥♥♥♥ing ""Austreus"" is dropping THE AI'S COMMANDER ONTO THE MOON.

I fire the nuke pretty blind, with my army on the edge, ready to rush in once it's landed.The nuke weaves through the orbits and lands on the AI's base.My guys rush in... slowly... because they're largely T2 vehicles.

												I didnt get the memo that it was released, and if you play it, you won't think it was, either.The unit pathing is bad, original Supreme Commander levels of bad, getting stuck on walls and needing to be babysat in order to manage the slightest obstacle without causing a 12-lane pileup getting around a rock.The units are bare-bones, with 2 tiers, basic and advanced; there are ""factions"" in the campaign but the difference between them are the colours of the units and nothing else, leading to shallow gameplay and maybe 1 or 2 dominant strategies in ranked.Orbital gameplay is sparse, consisting of space rush, spam superiority fighters, set to patrol and repeat, if the other guy gets into orbit before you, pray he ruined his economy doing so or you've already lost if there's an off-world superweapon on the map.And now, there's a £20 expansion, adding all the things I paid £20 for about half a year ago to support being put in ""in the development cycle""Do yourself a favour and buy Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, better unit variety, tech system, economy, and a dev console to mess around with if you get bored. Oh, and about £15 cheaper if you get it on sale.TL;DR: Uber did a DoubleFine, classic bait-and-switch. Buy SupCom:FA for a better RTS			"

												Good game so far.======================After 2 hours: (equals about 5 in-game matches)--Single player works like charm and it fits me well. They don't really focus on story (or is there?), which I like best. Unlike Warcraft series, this game is about unlocking features (there are TONS of them) on your way of campaign.--Game Style: Let's go straight. I like Warcraft, Empire Earth II, Age of Empires, and this game. They do share a lot in common, but PA is a lot faster in my opinion.--Graphics: Good enough. I don't have any complaint. Work well on my laptop.--No crashes, bugs found so far.============================================After 5 hours:--The music is just epic.--Tried AI Skirmish, created a big map => Froze for awhile. The game do freeze sometimes while it's loading. ""Just need a little patience"" (Alx Rose)--Normal AI sommehow is quite easy? They are really slow; don't protecting their commander well and their troops are just... lame. ============================================			"

								From what I've played so far of this game, it is an absolute blast. There's no greater feeling then crushing your opponents in an RTS and PA does it in spectacular fashion. I mean, how can you beat slamming one planet into another for an ultimate victory? Or building a massive nuclear weapons facility to annihilate your opponent on a bit smaller scale. This game really is worth picking up, especially if you can grab it while it's on sale on humble bundle and help out a charity with the proceeds :)			"

												Summary - game is alright, netcode is good, lobby netcode is awfulSo i've played this game over 10 hours now and actually have quite an alright time once i make it into a game. The problem is finding and connecting to said multiplayer games. I'm frequently connected to an empty game, occasionally the game crashes and my computer just siezes up if i connect to larger games... and there's not even many people playing at any one time, over half the hosted games are passworded. Campaign is just a series of skirmishes against idiot AIs, no fun to be had there.nitpicking - the multiplayer browser's filter list needs work. even on my 1920x1080 screen the filters run off of the bottom of the screen, and every time you fail to connect to a game you need to apply those filters again. I got the game for free and i don't think i'd have been happy paying money for it!			"

												Pros: Fun gameplaySomething different, it’s not the same as other rts games.A surprisingly good single playerDoesn’t get boring fast Cons:Server Issues Low population of players Lack of recent updates Planetary Annihilation is a really fun game and it really doesn’t get boring because of the custom planets and scenarios you’ll find yourself in. The gameplay is fun; there are many super weapons like nukes, unit launchers, Orbital Lasers and more stuff. The interplanetary mechanics are pretty good too, it’s always fun to spread out your empire and dominate the enemy. The single player too, is pretty good and fun but at the Normal difficulties, I personally think it’s too easy.Despite this, the game has some minor server lag issues, but I’d say that this is because of people abusing huge maps and making a 2v2v2v2v2 lobby with 10 planets. Obviously there will be some issues, though saying that, the issues are not that bad. Just some response lag (probably 200 – 400ms). And yet another problem is the lack of players, while recently it was on a free giveaway (I didn’t get the game for free, I bought it a year and a half ago), the player base has increased but i doubt it will stay. There hasn’t been an update for about 5 months but there a rumours that a patch is coming out soon for both Pa and Pa:Titans.Optimisation:Personally I don’t understand the problems some people have with optimisation with this game. My laptop has a core i7 cpu with intel hd 5500 and 8gb of ram and it can play the game at 40 fps in medium settings.Titans:Planetary Annihilation: Titans is an expansion pack, which costs 13 euros for people who already have the base game, which isn’t bad. The expansion its self, adds around 21 units, I can’t say more about the expansion pack since I haven’t got around to buying it yet. Uber:Uber entertainment developed the game. Uber is a small company; I doubt that they have anything more that 3-5 employes. This explains the lack of updates. And very few of the players still play the game. According to steamdb, pa (which has sold 1,000,000 copies, but only 73% of that have ever actually played the game), only 8.79% players have played the game in the last 2 weeks, which is not a lot for a multiplayer rts game. I recommend this game to anybody who likes rts games, it can be played casualy and competitively. I'd ignore most of the negative reviews since they're just reviews from people that have unconditional hatred towards Uber. The game is perfectly fine and will improve if it gets support. "

I have had strange FPS issues even at low graphics.(I don't have the best PC so this is my problem)But I choose to say No because they split this game into two games when it wasn't needed at all.

Early Access Review
If you want to lose friends, buy this game.It was a warm, sunny day, the birds were chirping and all was well. ""JARHEAD!"", said the Dan with a force of a million Roberts. ""AM I GOING TO WASTE MY MONEY ON YOU?!"", he said. It took hours upon hours of conversation to finally get the Dan to buy me Planetary Annihilation, and at last, he did, and all was well, for now....The first game, I was taught how to play the game, it didn't seem that hard for me, but Dan HAD to spend an hour teaching me. Once I finally grasped the concept of the game, I challenged him to a duel. It started off fine, I made a few metal extractors here, some energy plants there, it was all well. I didn't say anything about my strategy, eventually, I had a whole army built up of millions of little bomber planes, I spent hours making my millitia. I was ready to nuke the living $hit out of him, when he says, ""Ahhh, the sweet smell of destruction."" Before I knew it....BOOM!Everything.My army.My commander.My metal extractors.My friends.All dead.Every.Last.One.I left the game, went into the skype call, shared my screen, and let that mother&$%#er watch me uninstall it.I have very little patience.For the love of god, buy this game, you will like it.Unless you're like me.

												Well, I have to start this by saying I got the game for free and I still feel cheated.After playing through the Galactic War mode a couple of times I feel really sorry for whomever decided to spend actual money on this.The AI is horrible and the only way to meet any resistance when you're playing is to crank the difficulty up so high that it's got 4x as many resources as you.The entire speed of the game feels really slow and clunky. The graphics of the game are its worst point. It looks like something straight of ♥♥♥♥ing LEGO and pretty much 90% of the projectiles look like my units are shooting ♥♥♥♥ing BB pellets. I have it on the highest settings, so I doubt it can be any better.The amount of units is rather limited and progresses by tech tiers similarly to how the first Supreme Commander used to work, but it really feels limited in the amount of units there are and what they do. As far as I know, the only difference between fighting or using different factions is just the colour scheme. Nice.It feels like what Supreme Commander's spiritual sequel would've been if the developers had given up 2 hours into development and just wanted to finish it as soon as possible, but even with all the whining fanboys do around Supreme Commander 2 not being an exact copy of the original, I have to say that even with the severely limited amount of maps and single player missions, that game completely ANNIHILATES (get it?) this game in every aspect.Oh and there's skins for 5-10€ each to change how your commander looks, most of which are♥♥♥♥♥♥Let's not forget it's so poorly optimized that even running 2 clients of Minecraft and a server with a 300-mod unstable modpack, while playing Dota 2 in the background, slows my gaming computer less than this game with a browser open.DO NOT BUY.

												WARNING: Honest recommendation(totally subjective)Well... let me start by i love this game(Duh) and i know theres a lot of negativity around it and i read some negative reviews and those that i think have actual valid arguements are outdated and the games is currently actively supported and... yea...So lets get to why i am recommending this game...although at the time of recommendation i played only 5 hours i think that i have played enough to recommend it.GRAPHICS: In short... i love them. here is why: the overall design gets that amount between simplicity and complexity i find really compelling (i guess youll have to look to understand)SOUND: tbh i haven't paid too much attention to it but what i did pay attention to sounded really niceGAMEPLAY The most important part of a game: I love it because its a constant game of quick but smart reaction you have to build smart or else your resources will drain pretty fast you have to continously act or react and for me its overall really compellingOverall i really like this game (if i would why would i recommend it) and i hope you can see the amazing game behind all the reviews and if you end up getting it feel free adding me as a friend ingameWARNING: make sure your rig meets at the very least the minimum requierment so you can play the game and enjoy it smoothly(to an extent)srry if i had bad english			"

												At first I was skeptical if I should buy the game or not, because of a lot of bad reviews here on Steam. When it was discounted, I took the chance and got it for quite a low price.After playing a few hours I am able to say that it's way better than I expected!It has great mechanisms to keep track over the ton of action that is going on in this game. Unfortunately there is no tutorial which teaches you to use these mechanisms, so you got to learn em yourself.To keep this short I will just sum this up in a simple list:Pro:+ Great graphics especially on high resolution screens+ Good mechanisms to keep track of the tons of units you will command+ Pretty simple resource system, so that's sorta easy to get into+ Great new approach to the RTS genre with orbiting planets+ Contains an easy to use level editor+ Has bots of different difficulty+ Has randomly generated campaign+ Very cheap on sales+ Superb classic soundtrackCons:- If not bought on sale might be a little too pricy- Loading a big solar system might take a while, because the planets are randomly generated each matchWell that's all.I really am enjoying this game and if you are a fan of the RTS genre you will likely too!

												Great game, 9/10, definitely worth the money. Really fun action packed RTS game unlike no other. I have noticed a lot of bad reviews but 95% of bad things I have read about the game have been fixed in recent updates (such as the save game feature). The game is constantly being updated with bug fixes and other changes.Single player is fun and challenging -> in galactic war you start with basically nothing but as you take over planets in the galaxy you find upgrades. You can also play skirmish against the AI which can be fun and challenging especially for beginners. Online you can play 1v1 ranked matches or play custom matches where you can play massive FFA or team games and just about anything else you want with whoever you want. The game is made to be easily modded so there are a lot of mods that are really easy to download. You can even get mods that just about change the entire way the game is played. You can also download and play on planets other people have made or make your own planet(s).There are still a few small annoying bugs in the game, it often crashes and it helps to have a good PC but these are not major problems. I’m not playing on a very good PC so I can’t play games with more than about 3 planets but that doesn't make the game less fun and it is very easy to avoid games with a lot of planets. You can smash planets together and build death stars. What else could you possibly want in a game? Massive battles across a solar system? Great balance and gameplay? Well you have these things too and much more. :)			"

												Edit: I got this game when it was $50, and now I'm seeing the price it's currently being sold at.  Get the damn game.This game is very frustrating, decently unbalanced, and has a steep learning curve.  However, the concept is phenominal. Being a huge RTS fan, this has to be one RTS game that truly stands out to me.  It looks beautiful and I'd say it's revolutionary as far as gameplay mechanics.The game isn't finished.  It still needs a lot of work in it's current state.  I was surprised to find that it's in a released version and not still in beta after playing for a bit.  Despite the game being nowhere close to finished, it's on the right track.The only problems tha stand out to me are the balancing issues and lack of variety.  Different units for different factions would be sweet - like in C&C.  Every match seems to be a spam fest with who can send more bots to the other base first.  Defensive towers can't do much against a wave of 200 bots. (But, it DOES look pretty damn cool.)Aside from the game being somewhat buggy and unbalanced, I have hope in it.  Stretching gameplay onto multiple planets and even adding an orbital layer makes for a great concept.  The game needs to be developed further so the it can be truly fleshed out to it's full potential.With the minor faults aside, this a game is a good time. Definely a slow start with getting used to how everything works, but it's worth it in the long run.			"

												BEWARE... DRM DROPS THE GAME IN SINGLE PLAYER MODE.Total annihalation this is not... although you can tell it is trying to be it. I can see how this game could be fun... the idea is great and they have streamlined the units to remove a lot of the useless teirs that was found in Supreme Commander. It is also easy to tell that they intended for wars to be quick and only last around 30 minutes or so. I was playing against the AI on extreme mode (1 level above hard but not on master mode which is supposed to be slightly harder) and i was able to have 6 nukes going within 15 minutes (among other countless units) and won the game before 20 minutes (this was an example of me turtling). Just to warn you, if you are a quick strategy gamer, this game is really easy (at least against AI). When i ran a series of power play tests, the hard AI's didn't even come close to providing a challenge (i didn't try against master AI because i got bored). I simply spammed level one factories, ground units (tanks and some AA trucks) and teir 1 power plants/ metal extractors and charged the commander with around 50 units or so. BOOOOOOM. I just put up some turrets and SAMS around my base  to prevent the AI planes and pathetic death squads and I always win within 10-15 minutes.BUT...This game does not feel finished even though it has been released. I deliberately didn't install this game until the release because i knew the bugs would ruin it. I have encountered crashes to the desktop, strange graphical artifacts, the instructions given to units are not always followed (individual units do not always move/fire when told. Build orders are not always followed even when their is plenty of space for the building, even when the build order is queued) and the most annoying thing: SERVER CONNECTION LOSS CAUSES THE DRM TO DROP THE GAME... EVEN IN SINGLE PLAYER MODE. I will admit that the DRM really did cause me to rage quit the application... although i did go back to the game the next day and spent a few hours in it without any DRM issues (most likely because my connection didn't hicup).I have really tried to get into the game because i love these type of games usually. The trouble is, this just feels... crap. The graphics make the game feel like it should be run of a tablet computer, not a hardcore PC. I know that their are a lot of physics calculations going on and that these take priority over graphics but why are the textures so awful. I will admit that I did chuckle when my nuke missile launched and then flew around my planet backwards, I'm taking that as  compensation for the frustration i encounted when i had to order it to fire around 6 times before it fired. I also have a major problem with the fact that the blueprint snapping breaks constantly so that thet base building feels like a constant battle with the UI (yes I like my bases to look nice sometimes).If this game had remained in Beta status, i would forgive it... but it has been launched in a state which isn't fit for purpose so i have uninstalled it and am now leaving this review to warn others... I believe it could eventually be good... after about another years worth of development... but i don't recommend it in it's current state and do not support this level of DRM out of principle.			"

Posted: September 24, 2014
												Planetary Annihilation is a giant, half baked, cluster♥♥♥♥ that fails to deliver on the promise of its predecessors and is a slap in the face to all the people who funded it through Kickstarter.Uber entertainment seems to be run by the marketing department, asking itself the question, ""How do I make a game go viral?"" instead of asking, ""How do I make a good game that will go viral?"" There's livestreaming integration via Twitch along with ample controls to shoutcast and record matches, and the ability to add extensions and mods, but the core parts of game are severely under developed.Planetary Annihilation has failed the basics. For instance, rebinding a key shows a developer error message. Commanders will spawn sometimes extremely close to each other. Pathfinding is poor. There's no option to save Multiplayer games, and practically speaking, there's no instructions. The only ""tutorial"" is an old YouTube video that's sounds like an advertisement and is so basic it won't be of use to anyone. It is so bad even the dwindling community has expressed creating an extension themselves to add tips into the game.Speaking of the community, less than three weeks after its release there are only a handful of multiplayer matches and PA's price has dropped significantly on steam, both of which are indicators that this is a failure of a game. Outside of the game Uber hasn't even provided things like stats, or tech trees, and the poor suckers who bought the game for full price are expected to add that knowledge to the Internet themselves.This ties into the biggest problem: usability. PA takes place in a solar system where you can hop planets, but the planets are tiny King Kai planets, so you can only see half of your planet at a time like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fog of war. There is a picture-in-picture mode, but not dual monitor support. The lack of tips means that after several games, many of us people didn't even know what planet they were on, much less how to get off it and launch an invasion. When you run into an army, the name of the person to whom it belongs isn't even shown. I couldn't figure out how teleporters worked until someone told me several matches later, and figuring out how nukes works is an exercise in random clicking. I landed on a planet, I think it was a gas planet, which means I can mine it? I don't know.This is coming from someone who has played both Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander/2 and was willing to buy Planetary Annihilation on pedigree alone.Usability is super important when there is a lot going on and there is more going on in PA than ever. PA builds on its predecessors main tech trees of Vehicle, Naval, Bots, and Air with a third (fifth?) dimension of Orbital and the inclusion of different planets on which to wage war. A (real, not space) Navy seems kind of useless on tiny King Kai planets, and the purpose of bots still overlaps with vehicles. Not that I was expecting a TA/SupCom/2/PA game to get rid of bots, but that Kickstarter stretch goal to include Naval units? Bad idea and worse implementation.Games are enormous and sprawling, with hundreds of units and structures. Zooming out reduces the units to icons, which are another failed attempt to fix the problem. They glitchly overlap, and look the same. If you were designing an UI to move icons around, you'd probably at least make them different colors.While most of the time you're watching little icons come into, and blink out of existence, it's not like you'd actually enjoy the graphics anyway. There's only one faction in PA, and all the units look like toys. And I mean the type of toys you give to toddlers; the designs are generic and strangely clean for weapons of war. I'm not expecting Warhammer 40k levels of grit, but the unit designs look like something a Freshman graphics student would turn in for solid B. The Supreme Commander 2 units looked more detailed and just... better.To be fair, there are some innovative selection features: highlighting an area will only select combat units and not builder units, you can click and drag areas to have fabricators build a lot of things, and... well that's all I've discovered after reading up all I could on the Internet and playing.When all this is tied to the underhanded fact that Uber sold this game in stores for full price while still in ""Early Access"" (which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because if anybody can access it then it's not ""early"") and the fact that there's expensive DLC already, I can only feel sorry for the the people duped into Kickstarting Uber's salaries.

												I dont usually write reviews for games, but i felt like i had to say something here.I had been following this game off and on since it was on Kickstarter, it sounded like a great idea in a genre that seems stale.I held off on getting involved with the game during Alpha and Beta, because too many times i have had my impression of a game ruined by getting involved in the early access.So I noticed that the game had officially released! and the price tag was down from that rediculous 60$ sum.So being a strategy fan i decided to go get PA and enjoy the finished product.Well it hits you pretty early on as your playing, that this game isnt finished. IT is missing textures and animations, not to mention the different commanders have no difference between them ( just the skins really). The Single player seemed to lack any real strategy, seeing who could churn out more units faster. Oh, and it lags and i dont mean graphics lag. There is no offline single player,  so you have to be connected to the servers ALWAYS and if the connnection goes bad which it seemed to, then the game will lag even if just with the computer.This game has left me with the same feeling i get when I buy an early access game, it is not complete and i feel it is dishonest practice to describe it as a full release when clearly it is missing so much.

												Terrible lag, DRM/always online requirement, crashed >50% of the games I've played (me vs 1 AI so far, so hardly a big load), even when it does work there is huge lag on big events (yet to properly see a planet smash).Summary: So frustrating, can't believe this is being sold as 'completed' - it doesn't work!Hope it gets better though as the concept is great.

												Summary: Dont buy. Greedy devs. Kickstarter cashout after butthurt because their second kickstarter flopped.From my comments on the latet ""Titan"" release, which should have been a free expansion to this:So let me get this straight, I paid $60 dollars for a game you are now packaging into a ""DLC/Expansion"" that costs $40 dollars and the game STILL feels unfinished, uninspired, and poorly designed from the ground up? And no mod suppourt? Way to make the consumer feel like we got cheated. Sorry nobody wanted to crowdfund your other game and you now packaged its ideas into this one, but poor business move. I will not be purchasing and I will be avoiding any project you associate with. You should fire whoever had the idea of this. Everyone that paid full price should be given a copy of this. If you called it a ""Free Expansion"" like the guys who make the Endless series of games, you would see sales flourish again.Original review followsfurther♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off customer note: Now its on sale for SEVEN BUCKS? when you hosed everyone for a brutally unfinished product that they bought on good faith and now you reduce it to CLEARANCE price? way to spit in our faces further for our purchase of this horrid piece of garbage. back to Starcraft II2015 notes: They are still adding units like a unit cannon and submarines... If you game was done you would not be adding entire CLASSES of units. Fail.New reviewNow that gameplay has been fleshed out, and technical issues like offline play have been solved, looking at the core game I am still dissappointed. There are many who might cite my reasons as positive for the game, but I am not a fan of the end result. Recently was on sale for like 5$. I feel very cheated by this Early Acess title that is ""Final Release"" and ""Full Feature""-ProsLarge scale multiple planet combatSound is good, even if it does lack that 'oomph' of games with a camera that is closer up.Music is good, although limited.Multiplayer works well enough, and is (As of oct. 2014) populated enough to find a game easily.Everything works very smoothly, from worker and unit AI to menus and UI-ConsEconomy would be good, but maps are so random you could get a spawn point with zero resources, or ten, which can end a game before it starts (Patch is coming for symmetry I am told... )Combat is very bland due to replacable units and the feeling of no impact of losing one. (Not like losing your first tank in Company of heroes, or that ever important first couple units in Starcraft.Sound is good as I said above, but you will get very sick of the same four tracks of music, and I like a little variance in my explosion sounds if theres gonna be 50 of the same unit dying. personal taste makes this a con.The tech tree is very uninspired. You have a few types of units (Bots[Infantry], Air, Naval, Vehicles, Orbital) and two tiers of those units, you make a basic and an advanced production building and suppourt/defensive structures.Units themselves are very boring. Instead of having some standard units with some specialists and some power units, you have units that are only good at one role, or are bad at multiple, and nothing that really *Shines* except for maybe the orbital lasers and the planets-as-weapons thing. Snooze.The campaign is absolutely HORRID, it is a ""randomly generated galaxy"" which is really just a series of skirmishes in an attempt to make it seem like an epic space campaign. Not even worth mentioning it HAS single player as far as i'm concerned. Limits rather than expands the tech tree to make an inventory system, much fail.Balance is very, very wrong. Defenses dont take more than a few hits and take ages to kill anything, tons of units one-shot and are one-shotted, its eseentially a race to the superweapons or spam so much until you can whittle down the commander. makes for very boring gameplay.

												Looking for the next big thing in RTS’?  Look no further.  This game revolutionizes the RTS genre.  Instead of square maps you have spherical ones.  No longer can you get in a corner and only worry about two directions.  People can attack from all 360 degrees of your base.  Most RTS have one map per game.  In PA battle grounds are actual one to many planets in a solar system.  The size of the game is staggering.  There are a lot of different kinds of units.  There are vehicles, bots, air, naval, and orbital.  There are nukes, HUGH engines you can use to smash one planet into another, and metal planets can basically be turned into death stars.  On top of all of this you have procedurally generated solar systems and planets as well as a built in system designer for creating your own planets and solar systems.  The objective of the game is to kill the other opponent(s) commander(s).  If your commander is killed then you lose.  So just as in chess you must keep him protected.  Early game he is a powerful unit, late game he is a liability.Single player.  Know first that this game started as a multiplayer that got single player features added in.  You basically have two options.  AI Skirmish and Galactic War. AI Skirmish in which you fight it out against one or more AIs, all of which can be adjust for difficulty level.  Galactic War is a randomly generated galaxy that you can adjust the size of at the start of the game.  You take your commander and hop from system to system and try to conquer the whole galaxy.  Die and it is over.  No two play throughs will ever be the same.Multiplayer. Up to 10 players currently (this will be increase with future updates) can duke it out over a solar system.  You can do FFA or team games.  With FFA there are options to have dynamic alliances where you can basically on the whim in the game team up and backstab your other opponents. With Team games you can share armies and economies or simply a team for victory.Future Updates.  We expect there to be a lot of competitive things like match making and ladders to be added in as well as the number of players increase.  We also expect Galactic war will be made possible for multiplayer for clan wars.  The devs have made it clear that they mean to keep supporting by creating updates for a long time. "

Great game idea, first I'd like to point out that this game isn't perfect and is built around the multiplayer,  secondly this game is buggy BUT it is updated frequently so fixes come. I recommend you have a good comp (not the min specs at least the recommended if not better) and have the patience to learn the game or use youtube or guides to learn.  Galactic war at this point it isn't personally very interesting but I came to play this game against people and not ai. Tips: Learn from those who are better, youtube, twitch, guides on steam, etc.Small systems and not ridiculously huge planets,, don't make em to big, large systems and huge planets increase chances of crashes(your computer, not the planets)Get mods,, they help, lots. PA Mod Manager[forums.uberent.com]Patience is golden,, systems take time to load, games tend lag when past 5000k unitsDon't rage,, the pathing maybe a pain but it's better than it was (trust me)REMEMBER TO HALLEYP.S. Read recent reviews some of the older un-updated reviews don't reflect the current state of the game and if you find a bug it's better to report it at the ubernet			"

												Everyone is saying that this game is not the best it could've been... But in its current state I would highly recommend people pick up this game. Most of these 'Helpful' reviews are just way, way to outdated... When i picked this game up is was not much a year ago. But now its been fully fledged out as a proper RTS, just like some of the old one I used to play.I've purchased every Supreme Commander (Spiritual precessor) to date and each one getting progressively worse... And Planetary Annihilation has partly brought back that love for large scale RTS'Smashing planets into other planets and then proceeding to teleport onto the planets surface, taking it over and then building a giant Death Star lazer on it. THAT is the kind of game progression I want in ANY RTS...So Please PLEASE get this game when you can... its $30 ($6 when I reviewed it!) 10/10 Would so, play again...			"

												This game is pure awesome. I don't care about how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the devs are. It doesn't make the game any less fun when I play it.As a person who was unfamiliar with the RTS genre, this was a perfect game to get started on. I picked it up for free from BundleStars, and this is by far the best game I've recieved in a giveaway.At first the game seemed confusing for me. There was no proper tutorial and the fact that I'm new to RTSes just makes this more so, but in my first game I already picked up the controls real fast - it was all very intinuitive. It also is really tactical, which I'm sure skill will make a big difference when playing against harder AIs or people. As far I can see, there isn't that much of a ""meta"" which means you can freely develop your own playstyle while still being effective. The game also runs fairly smooth (at least on PC). I've not experienced as much as an FPS drop yet. Finally, the amount of flaws is minimal for an early access game. The only bad thing I've encountered so far is the fact that there's no tutorial - as I mentioned above. Game progress can also be slow (games take around half an hour or more), which I'm sure some people DO mind, despite being able to save the game.I encourage people to pick up this game, it definitely isn't overpriced and to play it if you happen to recieve it for free like me.

												This game rides along the border of me liking it and hating it. Planetary Annihilation, to me, feels like the groundwork for the perfect game. Let me list some pros and cons and you'll see what I mean.The Good- You can smash planets together!- You can use a Deathstar-like planet to blow up other planets with a laser beam!- You can design your own systems with plenty of collision and laser-ready planets- Many different ways of attacking and defending. From land units, naval, air units, orbital, and nuclear, it becomes very interesting to try and tear a hole through someone's defenses. When you're dealing with multiple planets, things can fall out of your favor by overlooking a certain defense, but the same thing can apply for your enemies.The Bad- THE LAG!!! Anyone who has touched this game will know that it eats at computer memory like a homeless monkey in a banana store. On top of it not being optimized graphically, there is currently no such thing as a true single-player game. All games, even if you are playing by yourself, are hosted on one of three different servers throughout the world. This leads to some ridiculous load times, and tons of latency while playing the game.- Bare-bones tech. Tier 1 and Tier 2 buildings and units. That's it. On top of that, there are no different races. Everyone has access to the exact same units and technology, which is unheard of in the RTS market. Somehow there is enough diversity that games are still fun, but I can't even imagine how much more amazing this game could be with some variation.Overall, I would recommend purchasing this game, but do it when it's on sale, like I did. The game is fun but feels incomplete. Don't pay full price.			"

Then they released a new paid DLC package for the game, except the paid DLC package is like, basic game features.Apparently a Tutorial counts as DLC.  When I bought 'early-access' apparently that meant I will never get to play anything besides the unfinished version of the game without coughing up any more money, which I most certainly will never do again to this developer.

												Despite the game being offically launched, Planetary Annihilation is far from being finished. The game demands that you look elsewhere for information on how to play it or what does what as the UI is lacking. Offline mode is currently still being developed and the game goes for quantity over quality with too many strategies built around "" take giant blob of units and attack move"" The orbital functionality is interesting but not enough to add depth to an already basic experience. Save functionality is also missing which is a huge problem for playing extended games and is just another item on the ""what's missing"" list.There is a small piece of a great game here but it needs more time being developed and wasn't ready for prime time.

Early Access Review
								I can tell that once this game gets fixed up it will be a great game. However at any price with this performance, I cannot recommend it. The game has completely froze on me 6 times in the 4 or 5 hours ive been playing. Units need constant babysitting as they tend to want to stop doing any action halfway through its completion, (Generally building and moving positions), they also tend to just wander off and do their own thing. Lag is constant and joining in on a multiplayer match was impossible for me unless I hosted it myself. The A.I is ball drainingly difficult even on normal, as the first fight I encountered took 3 or 4 tries, each attempt taking 15-20 mins to complete. Nothing is explained as virtually everything has changed since the tutorial beside from right click to walk. changing from one unit to the next can also prove difficult because if not done correctly your unit may stop what it was doing and move to the random spot you clicked, which can prove quite frustrating when done over and over. Which is a great way to describe the game, click the building you want built, or location you want your troops to travel to 100 ♥♥♥♥in times (or it wont get done) as the game lags uncontrolably taking ten minutes for you to walk to the enemy base. Kick down their ♥♥♥♥in door goin in guns blazing and then have your game freeze and have to shut down your computer.			"

												The scope of this game was so promising I decided to purchase it soley based on that. I can't recommend this game because it STILL isnt a finished product writing this in October 2014.  Luckily I have a gaming PC, with a lot of expensive hardware, but I feel that typically most systems will not be able to run this game smoothly because of the poor utilization in-game. It is RAM extensive and CPU extensive as-well. There was a point in-time where the Devs were motivated and updating the game, now it seems they have lost that motivation and are packing up and moving on to the next game. In essence they've abandoned this game, I don't see this game ever meeting it's potential either. One of the concepts of this game is traveling the galaxy and expanding, there are no space battles on the galaxy map, only fixed movement trails when you send spacecraft to other planets. Another concept is the borderless strategy at play, it isn't a conventional RTS where the map is flat, you play on a spherical world, there are pros and cons to this, but I find that it is too poorly utilized and needs to be worked on. For example for people who like to turtle or play defensively it is impossible to build an adequate defense because of the spherical world, they need to encourage defensive type gameplay as-well and not just one type of gameplay. I think that they need to make the spherical worlds larger so the gameplay is more flatter like a convential RTS however once you run off the the screen you can move around the planet freely in the spherical concept they have already integrated. So it will have a conventional RTS feel, but also incorperate the spherical concept as-well to make a outstanding RTS game. Pros:It's an RTS gameMultiplayer BasedLarge Scale BattlesCon:Can't fight in outerspaceCan't Micro Very Well In This Game Compared To Conventional RTS Games Campaign? Should I even call it that... Small community due to game being rubbishGUI experience is like groping a pineapple.Graphics, Unit Modeling, was drawn up and conceived by a pre-school class.This game will genuinely dissapoint you upon buying it. They really flaunt the scope of the game but it is so poorly utilized they might as well have not incorperated it in the first place.			"

												To the majority of the negative reviewers:Get over yourselves.Seriously, start acting your own age.Rarely in the reviews for PA do I ever see anything praising the actual gameplay.What??? A review that talks about the actual game itself and not the financial dealings of the company?To be fair in this review, I'll do a pros/cons list so all the little children can migrate down below to the cons section...Pros:- It's very smooth. I'm talking both gameplay and textures. I love the ""blocky"" feel to the game. - Lasers. C'mon guys, you can build a freakin death star in this game. How could you hate on the death star?- Halleys. Ok, you probably don't know what the halleys are if you don't play PA. Basically, they're giant thrusters you put on planets to make them fly into eaechother. - Little tiny worker robots. These things are adorable. Like actually. I use them cause the sound effect they make sounds like little children happily doing manual labor at your whim.- It feels finished. There's no open ended ""coming soon"" bs. It's a solid standalone game. Here's where the haters come in. ""TITANS WAS A RIPOFF OMG KYS UBER"".Ok, well, yes it was kinda dumb for them to release Titans as another standalone game. HOWEVER! Did you children do your homework? No? Why am I not surprised.If you had done your research or just happened to be around at the time Titans was released, Uber actually pulled PA from the steam store and put Titans in it's stead. Titans took over the original cost and that was that. But all the little children couldn't put 2 and 2 together, so they all assumed they were being scammed.Maybe if the children stopped hating on Uber for a second, they'd see a possible strategy. Consider that it's possible that Uber wanted to release Titans into the game but put it as their face for the game itself? Yes it backfired which is why it's back as more of a DLC than anything. But still, stop hating on the game...Ok, and the cons:- I am on an iMac, on which it runs beautifully 99% of the time. It's crashed twice, mainly when then enemy AI spawns in too many units. I tried to replicate the crash using my own units, so I manufactured 5000+ units, during which my framerate dropped a little but it stayed up. I haven't heard of it crashing on PC.- It can get a bit repetitive if you don't have friends to play it with.- The imbecilic reviewers in the ""Negative"" section. Remove them and we can all forget about the minor issues above.So yeah. 10/10, IGN something, idk. Go buy the ♥♥♥♥ing game.			"

Early Access Review
								The absolute scale of what Planetary annihilation is doing is quite astounding. Have interplanetary duels with nukes or send heaps of moon rocks to completely annihilate their planet. Unit cap is 10,000 units. ""wait what!?"" is probably what you are thinking and yes you can have a max of 10.000...per PLAYER! :O. That is a 10x improvement over supreme commanders unit cap and that game had enormous battles. Unfortunately there are shortcomings that can overshadow the amazing feats Planetary Annihilation is boasting. The game can crawl to a complete stop on loading planets, watch your fps drop dramatically every now and again, A.I is horrendous if you start on another planet and they can't reach you, your commander may glitch and get stuck depending on the planets geometry (for example stuck on a corner of a hill/mountain etc) and lastly for me I feel as though strategic missiles have lost their destructive capabilities that they had in suppreme commander and now are just miniscule dust clouds that do absoultely nothing to the enemy.Despite these flaws Planetary Annihilation is still in gamma stage and I have faith in uber entertainment to address these issues and are already doing a superb job at fixing issues. When I first heard about this game I had my doubts that it could be done . On the other hand upon playing it and finally having the chance to experience large scale battles on a unprecedented scale in the Rts genre I have to say congratulations to the developers that made my dream Rts game a reality. Here's hoping that the issues get addressed as they are small blemishes on an otherwise prodigious planetary game.If you loved supreme comander forged alliance then you will love Planetary Annihilation. 9/10.

												Remember when this game was $90 and it barely worked? What a ripoff, how do all these alpha games get away with this? Who do these developers think they are? I'm shaking my head seeing that it's now on sale for $5.99.Anyways, no longer in alpha, It's difficult to move units on the metal planets and frustrating to navigate between planets. The concept of planetary fighting is great, but I feel an invasion of planets would be better. I mean they got rid of their unit cannon, come on that was a great direction to go! I still play it from time to time, but I still think it falls short of Supreme Commander 2. Just go get Supreme Commander 2, that's a clean and well developed game.			"

Early Access Review
								So much fun, yet still a WIP. I can't wait to see the finished product. Yes the servers are laggy. Yes the game isn't optimized completely yet. So? What did you expect from an early access game? Great for what it is. My only complaint is the price, but after the steam sale many steam trading bots carry it for the approximate price of 15-20$ if you purchase using items from other games. Uber entertainment has done so many things right.-This isn't even my final form!			"

								I really liked this game and i think it will revolutionize all rts games for many reasons but i would like to say some thing´s the devs should work on:-Very big framerate drop .i have a really good computer and still i experience major fps falls).-The tree system. Trees stick trough buildings and lag like hell (my advice: let them be removable by bots)-The unit movement system. I sometimes end up having my bombers attacking my own base and that is really annoying. That´s about it. Don´t take it the wrong way. I´m just listing issues i had in the game that could really be removed from it, thus bettering your fans gaming experience.Thank you for your attention.			"

								The game has potential, but the controls are odd and the battle happens in a multi-dimensional matrix. The engineering bots don't help building and repairing stuff while you are fighting.  So you get crushed by the computer that acts like 3 or 4 players against you: building economy, building factories and organizing attacks by multiple fronts: 2 ground flanks, air squadrons and orbital ships all at once.After playing this game you end up exhausted instead of relaxed. I never finished a game, I got tired and overwhelmed by micro-managing more task that I could handle. This game is like getting in the cockpit of an Air-bus A380 without crew, in mid-air, with all the alarm buttons beeping and blinking all at once... LOL The game would be fun if you could assign officers to take care of certain tasks like: (i) a support lieutenant to take care of the mining, repairing and buildings; (ii) a general that could take care of the ground; (iii) an admiral for the sea; and (iv) a sky marshal for orbital defense (your choice of how many), so you can take care of those tasks you feel doing that day and make it a fair fight, but above all, fun and stress free.

												Are you looking for the next best thing in RTS gaming? Are you hoping for modern and extended version of Supreme Commander?Then look somewhere else.The Good:- Clean and concise Art style that doesn't really get old.The Bad:- Unoptimised beyond belief, even if you have a rig that smashes the games recommended requirements, it runs poorly and suffers from extreme slowdown in mid-late game.- The 'orbital layer' feels awfully tacked on and lacks any strategic depth outside of blanketing your planet with orbital fighters.- Gamechanging Bugs that have existed since the game became available to the public still remain. Nukes not being shot down by Anti-nuke missiles etc.- The pathfinding is utterly atrocious, trying to send a huge army through teleporters is painful to watch and actually achieve.- Horribly unbalanced. Certain units remain broken beyond belief even after months of constructive criticism from testers.- No Offline Mode.- Only one faction.I regret paying for this game.			"

												As a once avid Total Annihilation then SupCom player, this game as it stands is a disappointment. While the game is now a '3D planet' the gameplay is unmistakably 2D and unlike many old maps there's no real bottlenecks or impassable terrain beyond random water placement or small jutting pieces of rock. There is literally no challenge from the AI and near zero meaning to your own base: just spamming factories; no defensive lines or support structures really: everything is liquid (which could be good) but nothing has customisation or choice like SupCom's tech or upgrading mechanics. I imagine it's an alright game multiplayer but it is truly lacking depth in comparison to SupCom with respect to it's abysmal 'campaign/adventure' mode, it's current AI's strategies and outrageously fickle gameplay.I have tried it at multiple stages of the beta but only managed 55 minutes of interest for a £20 game. For someone who wants to enjoy this as mostly a singleplayer game it is nothing in comparison to SupCom or TA. There just seems to be a lack of fun in it since you effectively do the same thing each game with the lack of factions, tech or experimentals. The only unique thing about the game is commanding relatively unresourceful moons to crash but in reality this is just another form of a nuke and is not half as important as 10 factories.			"

It took me only little time to turn away baffled. This really is a joke and I think the most popular steam reviews are mild.This is not a real game, it is a mere demo of what they might have been able to do if they would have finished it.The lack of features, modes and the state of the so called single player content is so embarrassing, I feel stupid to have invested any money. This is the most disappointing early access game I have played so far. Do not spend any money on this no matter at what discount.			"

												I feel like this game is majorly underrated, While it does not exactly deserve an overwhemingly positive overall review system it does atleast deserve mostly positive. The game is exactly how its name explains it, Have massive armys of robots and tanks used to conquer entire planets... Of course if that does not work you could always try the nuclear option.... And if that does not work you could always turn a planet into a massive space ship and ram it into the main planet with all of the other team's commanders on it. Overall this game is amazing when you just want to damage a solar system or just plain want to construct a massive army and have it duke it out with someone elses army while both sides lauch nukes at each other.

I have a decent gaming rig and researched the reason for the choppy garbage and it seems to be the online malarkey.  The game itself is fun, what I've been able to play until I get frustrated with the choppiness.  Not recommended until this is fixed.  If I'm wrong in regards to the reason for the glitching... someone please correct me.			"

												The main reason i give this game a ""recommed"" is because think of this game as a steriotypical american's dream. Explosions, robots, death, robot gore and more explosions because logic! my main quarrel with this game is that you have to have a ""beefy computer"" in order to not lag as much. When my friend and i attempted playing i ended up crashing his computer forcing a restart of the game/steam. my other problem with the game is that there is way too much to manage when by yourself seeing how you can make infinite troops. (i dont multi-task very well) thats the main reason i play with my friend as it becomes easier to manage your faction with the share army button. An entire match is basically ""zerg rush and hope you win"" there is some strategy and some counters but very minimal overall. The galactic war seems a bit rigged seeing how you hope to get an AI buddy or a good peice of technology, nope its randomly generated. it would be nice to find two technologies on one planet and choose one of the two instead of a randomly generated technology machine as in some matches in the galactic war seem rigged as your AI enemy gets all the technology (effectivly cheating with nuclear weapons) while if you dont have anything to counter super weapons its GG from beggining. This list could go on forever, but now to what this game does right.This game manages to be addicting to come back to even after excruciating losses. The planet creator is a great idea as you can make custom maps for your friends. When i mentioned in the very beggining about the steriotypical american's dream. That means what it sounds like. Constant explosions, lasers everywhere, and a deathstar(esk) annihilaser that makes planets go boom! The concept is very interesting and with the lore's setup it seems primed for a story than just hey you hate these guys kill them. It is extremely fun to see that you can travel between planets and colonize them before your enemies. Then dominate them. Again this list could go on too so here is my rating for this game. But otherwise this is a crap game.5/10			"

												I am a kickstarter backer. A big fan of TA and Supreme Commander (the first one + FA) With at least a thousand hours ingame. Me and my all of my friends were absolutely thrilled for Planetary Annihilation. But this game seems not finished and rushed to completion. The EPIC Battles are nothing more than zerg rushes. This game is all about building small units fast. No Teching, no real buildup of economy, no finesse in building your base. The Spawn System is totally useless because it can happen even if you have a giant solar system (the planets are always small. A battleships normally curves with the planet...) that everybody just spawns on the same planet. I am disappointet bcs I was awaiting an awesome epic RTS but instead got a zerg simulator with a lot of casual gameplay. Still playing SupCom: FA with FAForever Lobby a lot			"

								Lots of promise.  But definately not ready for prime time.  Shouldn't have been released this early.  Game has numerous bugs and key features missing (eg saving).   Game crashes constantly (try teleporting a large number of units to another planet).   Game is unbalanced.   Awkward UI makes it hard to use.  Slow when you have even a small number of units.   The zoom function shoots out to solar system view when your just trying to open up the battle field.   In the end the game looks good but soon becomes unplayable.			"

												The first thing I would like to point out the always online DRM is a pain.  Whilst it is quicker to connect to Uber’s servers than it was before it is still quite slow.  Even setting up a single player skirmish or a joining a battle in Galactic conquest takes time on top of the log in DRM.   My steam tells me that I have 21 hours in game, although I disagree, It is more likely to be 5 + hours of me trying to get past the Login in DRM and then another hour of me trying to get past other loading screens.The game is also rather difficult to pick up an still lacks  a proper tutorial and there is a lot of features thrown in your face.  The best way to learn how to play is to play the galactic war because that way you can take it step by step.However the game does have some great systems and mechanics, and so many of the units/building are really nice.  The naval units are really well designed, although I they are not as used as much as I would like.  The Gas giants are a really call concept, and the wide variety of units is really good.  The AI can be tricky to beat at first because of its ability to multitask but once you know what to do the AI is beatable.  On the whole the gameplay is solid and quite enjoyable.Aesthetically the game isn’t the prettiest game but it isn’t ugly and the graphics work this sort of game so it is fine.  On the other hand the full orchestral sound track is great, and it really suits the game.If you buy the game make sure you have a reliable internet connection and don’t have to worry about 3rd party fire walls.  If you want an epic sic-fi RTS, then this game is for you, just make sure you understand the game is heavily affected by always online DRM, still has a couple of bugs, and that the game can be quite crashy.  And be prepared to wait to get past loading screens.			"

												I look forward to playing it when they REALLY do finish it.It looks like it will be a fun game. I really love RTS games, and this one gives me the impression that it will be superb. The problem is, I just won't play a game that isn't finished, and this one clearly isn't.Take this for example. I try to play it on my super powerful computer, and the screen flashes like crazy. It doesn't flicker, it flashes from pitch black to normal screen, and repeat. Turns out this is an error with the game and NVidia, so I'm forced to play it on my less powerful machine.So seeing as I had just sat through the intro video, I click the mouse so that I can skip it. It doesn't skip it, forcing me to watch it a second time, but I suddenly hear people talking in the background. It turns out that what appears to be a YouTube video is overlayed in the background, and my clicking suddenly started it playing, so I'm listening to the developers chatting about their game!I check out the tutorials, expecting to see one in which you play along, and it teaches you as you go, but instead a video appears, with the most annoying voice over man ever explaining it. I'm not in the mood to listen to someone repeat how ""amazing"" and ""incredible"" the game is, as well as try to absorb and remember everything at once, so I skip it. I've played dozens of hours of Supreme Commander, so how hard can this game be?I click on single player, and start the galactic war. Pick a planet to do battle on, and I'm in the game. I'm off running around, building things, finding it odd that when you click and drag turrets, the gap is massive (in SupCom you could connect one to another), when suddenly a voice tells me I need more energy storage.This is where I get fed up. I have no energy storage buildings. I assume I have to unlock them in Galactic mode, but if that's a very odd thing to limit you on. I'm on one planet, the AI is on another, so I assume I need to build some kind of flying unit, but I'm limited to land and boat. I then try out the teleporter building, but can't use it, so I build another one thinking it's a point to point building, but that doesn't work either.After 15 minutes to aimless clicking, I eventually tab out to go look at a tutorial, and all I can find are videos of the beta, which look very different to what I'm playing, so I switch back to the game, which is now running at a snails pace. I get bored, quit the game, and suddenly my machine is also running at the same slow pace, resulting in me holding down the power button to turn it off.It's not the PC, I should add. I can play all sorts of games on max, and the new Wolfenstein on High.The game WILL be good... but they should not have considered it finished just yet.You can't save during skirmish games, and you need to sign up and log in to play. There is NO offline mode, it seems!I'll play it when it's finished.			"

								Even in its early state, this game is oozing with class and style. A throwback to the olden days of Command & Conquer, Planetary Annihilation takes Real-Time Strategy and adds Space Colonisation into the mix. This game seems to have it all, great graphics, a good combat system and a really innovative way of winning, via flinging moons at your opponent. As a wise man once said, ""There's no such thing as overkill, just Fire and Reload""There are a few issues I have with this game that any potential buyer should consider before purchasing:1. It's still in Beta - While most of the Alpha-stage bugs have been ironned out; there are still many Beta bugs hidden in the woodwork; so your experiences may vary.2. AI is a little overpowered - This might not seem like much, but the AI is structured so that if you beat it, the next time you get a harder AI and, while it's nice, it really doesn't have a way to make the AI less difficult again. (You can reduce the AI's resource collecting, but that's not really the same)3. It's over priced - All's fair in love and war, except the insane price tag. You know what other games cost me this much? Sim City 5 and Red Alert 3. Both of these really weren't worth forking out the cash for it. Neither's this game right now. If you can get it for less, say in a Steam Sale, go for it, it's well worth it.			"

								If 'Supreme Commander in Space' doesn't sell it for you, nothing will.  The game is already fantastic and is only getting better with updates.A word of warning however.  You NEED a stable, relatively fast internet connection to play it in early access.  Even playing single-player, the games are hosted on their servers, not your machine.  This is set to change in the near future, but until it does it can be incredibly frustrating watching the game stall once the unit count increases too fmuch.			"

You will get a few things after you lost your first battle and watched your enemies layout. You will make LOTS of mistakes on your first try so make sure you bring your luck on your first game. But once you get the ropes you will start taking over planets, taking advantage of situations, yada yada yada.... Buy it now and try it for yourself!			"

												One of the better RTS games I've played. It plays alot alike the Supreme Commander series. It also has a good balance and variety of unit types and technologies like nukes or big rockets to push planets into each other. The bad - If you were to have a single factory producing units till the end of time. The game would crash. A big army is part of the game, so in that aspect, it's fundementally broken.			"

												Updating an out of date Review:This is honestly my favorite game of all time. Ever. It combines everything I want to see in a game into, well, a game. Specifically one I like. But for some reason, not EVERYONE shares my views on EVERYTHING ( I know, weird, right?), so here is a compilation of why PA is awesome, and the problems it still has.PA has no unit cap. None at all. You can build 4000 factories and with those factories infinitely spam out units if you so wanted, and the game would not stop you. In fact, the only thing standing in your way, is either:a) your computerb) your internetc) the server you just killed by building over 10000 units and trying to get them to do something.PA (now) has singleplayer offline mode. Yes, you can play offline now. The only problem is you need a rig that meets the reccommended requirements to get a reasonable experience.PA has interplanetary warfare and interaction. Ever wanted to fling a planet at someone? Well now you can. There are litterally no downsides here.PA is incredibly moddable. You can make whole new units/balances/metas/UIs/Biomes for PA. Once again, no downsides.PA is a macro-oriented game. It's more about base-building and army management than click-spammy micro where whoever clicks the best and fastest wins. In PA, you need to be good at strategy, assess your opponent's weaknesses before he discovers yours and strike from an unexpected side, or two sides, or from space. If you love SC2 because of its micro and want something similar in all your RTS games, this isn't really the game you're looking for.PA has a somewhat steep learning curve, unless you've played similar games before. (TA, SupCom, SupCom FA, etc.) It also has effectively no tutorial, so you need to play for a few hours (preferably against a freind, the AI is pretty mean to new players) before you start understanding what's going on. After that, it is a highly enjoyable game.PA has a competetive ranked system (just implemented) it's a fun way to prove yourself against others! Not as fleshed out as it could be, but we're looking forward to more improvements in the coming months. Also, if more players played ranked, we'd have a better ranked system simply due to population density.PA's Devs are highly invested in the game and are constantly talking with the community on their forums. PA has a great community, and great community-dev interaction (I think we can all thank Jables for this!).All in all, I'd give this game an 8.5/10. Yeah that's right, my favorite game of all time got a 8.5 out of 10, even I can see that there are issues with it. Although it's a little buggy at times (mostly if your drivers are out of date), it's not completely balanced yet, and the UI in some cases could use a decent bit of work, it is the only game I own where I consistently come back to it week after week and constantly take part in the community. I would highly reccomend this game if you are into this kind of RTS.			"

								(Please note this was written during the games extremely early Alpha Stage, All is subject to change)Basicaly it is a very rudimentary version of Supreme Commander. The resource system is the same, You start with a commanding robot (who if dies you lose the game and also sets off a nuclear explosion around him) and build Mass Generators and Energy Generators and try to have more Generators outputting than what your builders are using for input.It plays in much of the same way as well in that you build Factories (Land, Air, Sea, Robot) and pump out as many units as possible, each of these buildings also has 3 tiers with different units like supreme commander.Unlike supreme commander though they manage to do it simply and effectively. I personally had a hard time tackling supreme commander and how to play it correctly and still do to this day. In this game however, it manages to stay fun in the same way of supreme commander without being as complicated.Unfortunetly the space aspect is not ingame yet, which is what i am looking forward to. You can currently zoom out of the planet and see the solar system, but you are not able to build space faring structures yet. You can also zoom out further to a grid that is HUGE, currently it only shows the planet and the sun on it, with all of your current unit cards plopped in the sun. Which leads me to believe there will be multiple stars with planets in the full game.			"

												I wanted so very much to like this game. I tried, I really did. I hung in there through numerous patches that were supposed to bring the game to the level that was promised from the beginning. And then I sign into Steam one day, and the devs have released the exact same game -- only with additional units, planets, etc. -- as a standalone expansion. No reduced cost for upgrading from the unfinished, buggy-as-hell game I already own. That takes a lot of nerve, Uber. I can't downvote your ""new game"" since I'll never own another one of your games. But I can not recommend this one, and hopefully keep at least one user out there from giving a shaddy developer another dime.I'm glad Human Resources failed to fund its Kickstarter, while we're at it. I would have gotten my hopes up just so that you could screw me over a second time.			"

												Bought this game back when it was $99 with high expectations. They released it as a pre-alpha level game that was not enjoyable, and now they release basically a stand alone DLC pack for it for $40 without updating this instead? The most scumbag move I have ever seen from a company, even worse than anything EA has ever done. I cannot believe steam would let a scamming company like this sell their game on their platform. Unbelievable. I am never ever going to buy another game from this dev. I don't know why I would anyway, the gameplay is trash and its a bad clone of supreeme commander that had potential but was squandered by lazy trolls with greed.			"

Which leads me to believe there will be multiple stars with planets in the full game.			"

								It doesnt look very fun from the pictures but if you watch the videos it will look way better. I like everything about this game, except for the cartoony like graphics, but everything else is way better. I would recommend this game to anyone who has the money to buy it and likes strategy games. I just wish I had some friends to play it with because multiplayer looks amazing.			"

Early Access Review
								Преемница Total Annihilation вышла колоритной, емкой и легкой в освоении... Однако сложной в исполнении. Благодаря большой свободе действий и большом количестве построек и юнитов вы можете сыграть в РА сотню раз и каждый раз использовать разную стратегию. Пожертвовав одиночной компанией разработчики дали игрокам такую свободу действий, которой не было в любой другой стратегии в реальном времени:вы можете создать наимощнейший танковый парк или огромный флот, который окажет незаменимую поддержку при штурме укрепленной базы противника, а может оказаться так, что рандом выкинет ""финт ушами"" и планета будет полностью покрыта льдом и придется полагаться на сухопутные и воздушные войска и тому подобное, также в игре присутсвуют орудия массового поражения: от ядерных боеголовок до изменения орбиты естественного спутника планеты и обрушения всей этой мощи на менее развитого противника. Конечно же не обошлось и без минусов, начиная долгими загрузками локации и заканчивая вылетами игры. Также разработчики перестарались с игровым ИИ. Если на среднем уровне можно изловчиться и выйграть, то на самой высокой сложности вы еще не раз всплакнете над обломками своего командира. Если же учесть, что это еще недоработанная альфа-версия, то становится очевидно, какая игра станет стратегией года.			"

Also, for some reason the devs refused to add ""experimental"" units (like in Supcom) to the base game......and now make an ""expansion"" with just that, a few more units, and call it a new game! Also, the paid-expansion includes a better tutorial, because, for some reason, it can't be in the base game.			"

												Don't jump on the hate train, this game is quite fun! It's a sequel to the classic Annihilation and plays like Supreme Commander on a much larger scale! In fact, scale is one of the main challenges of the game and if you can build up faster than your opponent, you will most likely win.Fighting over systems, and the planetary combat is awesome! This isn't something you find in other games and it's really under-appreciated. Due to the crowdfunding going way overboard, some players began trolling the community and created a hate train against the developers, but honestly I don't regret buying this game, and I'll probably buy the sequel as well. It's a lot of fun and absolutely gorgeous graphics!			"

												from the start of this game, the gameplay was absolutely incredible. the AI is just awesome to battle against and the cartoony graphics add a nice touch. it's fun to team up with friends to battle mass hordes of nuke and tank spamming AI. Using planets to destroy other planets is so satifying as well. Also the variety of units is great. From sea to space it is trully amazing.The map creator was also wondeful. it is a bit tough at first when you can master it, you can make truly awesome maps. i have made with this creator a starwars galaxy map, a 'our solar system map' and a map that is a giant urban sprawl.there are a few issues with the game. a couple of said issues are that matches with a huge map count lag like crazy, having many AI in the late game starts to lag the map, some connection issues and there are no factions so no unique units. but these problems are minor and probably will be patched/added in future updates.In short I highly recommend this game for any stratergy gamer due to all these reasons.

Early Access Review
								Re-writing this review. I've backed and tested this game from Alpha for reference.The game itself is extremely fun with friends. The AI can provide a challenge too but at its heart you'll want to bring some friends along for the planet smashing fun. GENERAL:PA is an amazing game, both in gameplay and in visual representation. The ONLY limiting factor is your machines capability (And internet if you're playing with friends). If you have a high end PC you've built recently this game should run like a charm. The sheer amount of destruction that is unleash over the course of the game is astounding. If you can run a massive system with lots of moons/planets then you're in for a good time. The planets orbit around the star and each other, if you're close enough to another planet you can actually see your enemies buildings and units on the passing planet and if it's in your planets orbit you can send a welcome nuke their way!The gameplay is similar to Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander. Resources come in two fantastic flavours: Metal and Energy. Both of these are streamed from your resource producing structures and to be effecient you'll need a lot coming in to pump it back out into units and buildings. The combat is fun and engaging from early game scouting and raiding to mid game clashes and then end game battles. When you add other planets in you'll eventually be playing galactic marbles throwing around moons and asteroids. Units have purpose and balance. You have several types of units to choose from (Vehicles like tanks, rovers, AA. Then there is Bots which are your general raiders, snipers, artillery. There are also Naval units and Air units which are you bombers, scouts, air superioirity and long range bombardment) Your buildings and defense are also useful but the aim of the game is attack not turtle in and hope for the best. You have the ground layer which is where most of your attention will be, positioning, attacking, pulling a ruse, etc. There is also an orbital layer which supports your conquests and helps expand to new planets so you can then turn them into 'rocks with rockets'The UI is clear and concise which is exactly what you want in this kind of game. Resources are displayed up top. Unit actions on the right side of the screen, A mini screen which can also switch between several bookmarked locations is also present. Your building menu is displayed on the bottom of your screen when you click the apporpriate units. The lobbies received an overhaul several times. They are easy to read and navigate. It shouldn't be hard to find a game with your friends or create one yourself. Once you do find a game you can easily customize which colour/commander/team you want to be on. You can also set how many teams there are, whether players will share armies and what resource rates will be.During this time the game will load the system (there will be an icon indicating this) As the game begins your planet choice will be available. A system generator is present. This lets you set up a 'map' which your computer can handle (the defaults generally contain 2-4 planets depending on your roll) There are also some set maps by the Devs which vary in size. The generator is easy to use and fiddle around with and helps you test your computers performance with the orbital bodies 'simulated' on their orbiting paths. You can set starting planets, orbits, size, type or planet, metal density, mass (which affects orbit) and geology of the planet (hills and seas) They can also be saved as templates which can be used later.The PA community is great, you should be able to find a game relatively quickly and there's plenty of let's plays and tutorials on the internet.As of 07/09/2014;The game lacks an offline mode and as an extension saving games. Once Offline Mode comes local saving should follow. Sometimes there is a TiDi effect (Time Dialation) which comes from using Ubers servers. This will slow the game down via increments when the load becomes to great. There are some units and features not implemented yet. There is a thread which can be followed here for the progress of current suggestion and additions to the game: https://forums.uberent.com/threads/confirmed-features-list-2-0.44950/ The game does rely on your computers power, if you have a gaming PC that you set up recently this should run smoothly. If you're running on and old laptop you will struggle on a mid sized single planet game. A tutorial video in the menu is dated and needs to be redone as some units are not present anymore.			"

Early Access Review
								Gamma has just made the game feel on par with Supreme Commander - but with the scale of Sins of a Solar Empire.  Until now the game was a little laggy and lacked polish, but you have some basic interface improvements that allow you to jump between planets with ease.  The game is beyond epic in scale almost to a fault but allows you to control unlimited number of units and features a interplanetary war.  For 30 bucks you cant go wrong, the game is only getting better and more polished over time.			"

								Incredible scale.Fight over multiple planets.Throw planets at another player for kicks. (takes a lot of planning and resources)HUGE WARS.  Not out of the ordinary to have a few thousand units over multiple planets going at it.I once made 83 orbital factories pumping out fighting units and had them swarm an enemy moon.  Once i took out his orbital defenses i dropped a teleporter on his planet and then WARPED several hundred heavy hitting tanks.  The guy actually sat back and said, ""nothing i can do now, but i'm going to sit here and watch this... this looks incredible""10/10			"

												Its...... A game....In all seriousness it is a decent game, the 3D nature make commanding armies an interesting challenge, the visuals are nearly all beautiful and you get a lot of satisfaction from bringing your army to victory over friends or the AI.However, getting to this point has been a struggle, updates are lacking and far between. We were still promised multi-screen support. Its now its looking like many of these promises will never be forfiled, its quite a disapointment, yet the game is still playable and fun.Maybe if the updates push forward a little more it would be worth £20-30, but for now i'd wait for the sale.

												Love this game, with friends it's just amazing being able to compete against each other for planetary dominance then fighting over moons and giant planetary death lasers. You have a wide range of fun units to play with depending on what you feel like at the time, you can use weird or straight forward tactics to destroy the enemies commander e.g Unit cannon, sneaky teleporters, orbital strikes, ground strikes, firing a giant death laser at an unexpecting enemy and even pushing a whole moon into the planet they're on! You can build solar systems that you can fight with your friends in, and many more exciting things to do, I still find cool things to do.Problem is that it can be a bit low of frame rate sometimes, but if you have a decent computer you will be able to run it.The AI is not a push over, I have trouble fighting regular AI sometimes. The multiplayer is well done as well, I haven't ever had a problem with it.And its just a load of fun with friends. Easy 8/10-Addicting, diverse, amazing gameplay!			"

												Would have loved to have saved my game but the menu dissappeared... esc button just zoomed out infinitely. Its really annoying when these kinds of games don't have an on-screen way to access the menu, its like RTS 101. My initial impressions are that this game is designed to induce frustration. Its really fun until you realize your bassically fodder for an AI that can multitask, well, like an AI. Good luck ever doing anything, especially using any kind of air units. I couldn't even understand how the radar worked but the second I built an air unit the raids were endless until every one was destroyed. Would have been a lot of fun if the goal was to allow the player to annihilate, rather than be mercilessly annihilated at the hands of a painful interface and unfair mechanics. Hopefully devs wont push multiplayer so hard that they ignore the excellent single player/coop game trying to take hold in the process. I really don't care about twitch or any of that other crap. Also I hate the middle button pan/scroll thing. I have several other buttons on the mouse that would be far better but cannot remap them. Edit: Found out my esc/menu button was bound to the smooth scroll function, so fyi there, completely able to rebind the menu button accidentally. After installing a training mod via Instant Sandbox, I was able to play around and get the hang of things. Not sure if any cheats were installed but I highly recommend the PA Mentor, Build Power, and Instant Sandbox mods to really help figure things out. The next time I tried the initial campaign fight it was a different story and I successfully annihilated the enemy. It was a feeling no RTS has given me since red alert 2. I really, really hope the rest of the campaign is just as good, if it is this is one awesome game!			"

												Had this game for 2 years and this is all of the time I have in it over that time. Why? Because all of the promises back during the kickstarter never met fruition and instead, were thrown into a standalone expansion because ""why the ♥♥♥♥ not""Never buying a product from these people again.

												Buggy as hell. UI process would silently crash, so the game looks like running, but won't accept any input. A regular crash would not be that annoying. I googled around and it seems such problems have been there for years and on all platforms (so it is not my Linux). There are a few workarounds known, some make things even worse, one made game playable for me… for a single battle a time, as the screen goes black afterwards. That is ridiculous. I have not seen a game that broken for a long time now.			"

								I am finding this game to be very good. The graphics are vibrant, the mass destruction is awesome but  it suffers many problems.1. It lags. My units and building ques will suddenly freeze and 2o seconds later unfreeze but the units have still traveled, leading to some pretty stupid combat.2.No tutorial. When i jumped into the game i had no idea what I was doing and still have soo much to fiure out, some of the buildings arent available it seems.Other than that this game is very good and wood deffinatley recomend it if the price tag went down, you would be better off waiting for a few more updates.

												For a spiritual successor to SC and TA, this is OK. Nothing more. The game is still fairly bug plagued, isn't very well optimized on some platforms, and is just generally more meh. However, it has two things that will never cease to be amazing every time, and that's the title of the game, you guessed it, Planetary Annihilation. It's satisfying as hell to do, no matter how many times, and that art-style. For being ""cartoonish"" it's extremely well created and a nice breath of air from all that dark♥♥♥♥♥♥we apparently need in games nowadays.Some of the things I hate so much about this is the same problem SC had with it's AI. As an example, on a two planet system where you're situated on one and the AI on the other, this is the problem i have here, they NEVER move from their base unless it's all destroyed, making focused fire like nukes the easiest way to win every time. They also decide that ""I wanna spam one orbital unit all the time because they totally can't destroy it in half a second with one plane!"". This makes Galactic War quite tedious when it actually decides to work.This is not to say MP is boring though: it's fast, intense, and definetely the strong point of the game, but I can't help but to ask myself, is PA really that much better than SC - FA or 2 for that matter? I mean yeah, PA has orbital units, but that's about it, it's not polished in any way like the others are, it's no way near as intricate, ten times more glitchy, and generally just not as much fun.TL:DR If you want Supreme Commander with orbital, sure, this is great, but if you don't feel like it's necessary, pick up SC - FA or 2 (1 as well for that matter) for a great price and play the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them!

								An amazing game, right up front. Robots, liquid green metal, space, PLANETS SMASHING INTO EACHOTHER. What's not to like? Sure it can get laggy or have graphics issues, but big deal. I can't wait for more updates and final release.P.S. Please bring back subs and all the other things you removed.P.P.S. I think you should add space elevators. What for, you ask? If a unit similar to the Astaeus but couldn't land yet could hold maybe 10 untis, they could use a space elevator to get down to the surface.			"

Early Access Review
								I do not recommend this game for the moment. It was in my wish list from the first day I saw the 'trailer' but it was to expensive (84€ I think). When I saw the price was lower (20 € more or less), i bought it. In 20 minutes I regret it. The game is not like an Age of Empires (they try to sell the game like a futuristic AoE or a similar game) where you can conquest different planets, you conquer one per one (not showed in the 'trailer') and the improvements or the builds that you have made in a planet, are useless for other planet, I mean in a game you play different isolated games. It is so basic with 5 kind of vehicles, 4 bots and 3 planes... so I do not understand WHY IT IS SO SLOW. I have 'played' 6 hours and 3 of this 6 hours i have been waiting. My PC is average, but Arma 3 in HD runs faster than this game. I hope the fix it because I am not going to play anymore until the game runs faster.Other things: -There are games that requires a short explanation like you have to 'download' different data (in the game, not extra data) to build all the buildings, and not the seedy Youtube video that you call Tutorial.- You are waiting for 20 minutes to play a solo game and when you can move you commander, the enemy have build all the buildings, have 300 troops and have read all the Shakespeare books... In the lowest difficult! I will not learn to play if I have to wait 20 minutes to play 4 minutes.In conclusion: 20€ burned... At least I have not bought it when its cost was 84€. If do you want to buy, wait some time. I hope i could return the game.			"

												This is an visualy appealing game, it's just great to look at, all the explodions and mass-open warfare!The major problem for this game is the fact this is a very fast phase game, and I am used to the slower strag games such as Civ5 and Empire Earth. One slip up, one misclick, or one second of resting may cost you the battle, and you be needing to react and think very quickly. This is suited for some people, but for people like me, who likes to think slower and plan bigger, this is too quick.Great game overall, only fits for certain Strag players.			"

												Planetary Annihilation is an RTS game of unprecedented scale. Developed from the ground up by Uber Entertainment, it takes strategy gaming to a whole new level.​A little history. PA first appeared on Kickstarter in August of 2012, billed as 'Total Annihilation-inspired gameplay on a planetary scale'. The developers had worked on games such as Total Annihilation and the Supreme Commander series and cashed in big on the nostalgia factor which those names instilled. They were asking for $900,000 and were successfully funded on September 14th, 2012, with $2.2 million. They remain one of Kickstarter's most successful projects to date, being one of only 82 projects (out of 69,400 projects in total) to raise over $1 million.So how does it play?PA is a game of scale. Your battlefield will be entire planets, not mere countries, and this introduces perhaps the most immediately noticeable difference compared to traditional RTS games, that of a spherical map. Players will no longer find themselves boxed in to a square map with artificial, invisible borders. Instead, you will now find yourself with 360 degrees of complete freedom of movement, as well as the ability to zoom in close enough to see your commander's nose hair, or out far enough to view the whole solar system at once.This brings a degree of strategy to base building and defending that is rarely seen in other RTS games, as you can now attack, and be attacked, from any direction at any time.In keeping with the spirit and inspiration of Total Annihilation, PA encourages massive armies and absurdly explosive battles. You are given the tools to build and manage literally thousands of units, there is no unit cap, and this focuses the gameplay on macro expansion and overall 'big picture' tactics, rather than micromanaging small groups of a handful of units.The UI takes some getting used to, but once you get it figured out, you will be impressed with how simple, yet powerful it is.Units can be given a variety of commands, i.e. attack, move, patrol, and the like. They can also be given area commands, which quickly become essential to manage large armies. For example, instead of having a unit patrol simply point to point, you can set an area command of whatever radius you like, and the unit will patrol the entire area selected. You can use this command to cover the entire planet for things like scouts, allowing you to quickly locate your enemy while leaving you free to manage your base. Likewise, you can issue an area attack command, and your units will attack anything they find in the radius of the area you selected.Buildings can also be issued area build orders. For example, when placing a building, you can click and drag the mouse button to queue up an entire line of buildings instead of just the one. This allows you to set up your units with a build queue and then ignore them while you focus on something else.Another UI innovation that PA brings is the picture in picture window. This opens up a secondary small window in your screen, which you can mouse over and use as a second interface. You can control the map, select units, and give orders all within your secondary window at any time just by mousing over it. Tasks such as launching nukes, linking teleporters, or even just keeping an eye on your enemies base while you scout it become a simple matter with this secondary window up. Managing armies and bases that cover entire planets is made easy with these features.​The units in the game are not quite as varied as Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander, however you will find a unit to cover each of your typical RTS roles. The balance of the game is decent, although I imagine it will still be tweaked a lot through upcoming patches, as more people play more games. As with any RTS game designed to be played competitively on ladders, there is always a meta game that evolves, and if you want to be successful in 1v ranked matches it is usually a must to know the current most powerful strategies. If you are like me, though, and play mostly co-op comp stomp or casually with groups of friends, then the game really opens up and allows you to play how you like.The multiplayer interface is nice, but currently the servers are fairly slow, and both hosting and joining games can be a chore at times.  This has gotten progressively better with each update and is at the point that I no longer notice it as any sort of issue in most of my games.The potential for some pretty insane multiplayer games is there, as you can add any number of players in any configuration of teams as you like. I have seen games that were 10v10v10v10v10 and ones that were 3v6v2v8. There is no restrictions and no artifical limits on how you can set up your game, except maybe your system specs.The one thing currently lacking in multiplayer is different game modes. Currently you can set up games as team games, with shared armies, or as free for all games, however you can not choose a supremacy mode, or sandbox mode, or anything else. All games are basically assassination mode, which means that as soon as you lose your commander, you are wiped out entirely, regardless of how many units or buildings you had remaining.The visuals of this game are good, the different planet biomes look fantastic and have a great variety of different ways they can be generated. Things like forest fires and wreckage add to the feeling of complete devastation. The commanders explode in a very satisfying mushroom cloud, and of course, crashing a moon into someone else's planet is always an excellent way to end a game.			"

												I am one of the kickstarter backers, and this game showed so much promise, looked cool and awesome.Along the way of this game being made i have had my sheer amount of doubts of what would become of this game.Having played the game for many many hours i must say this product has become a wonderful strategy game!The game at this moment and today is the 6th of February 2015 is very good.If you like strategy games you are going to love this, this game has features you have never seen before, and you might need to get used to some, for example:Planet shaped maps, this you will need to get used to, but in time it's awesome.A 3rd and 4th layer of strategy in the form of orbital units and moving to other planets in your system in real time.Blowing up complete planets with a deathstar like super weapon. Building planetary engines on planets and send them like asteroids into another planet and leaving big craters.Wiping out the enemy in so many different ways with such awesomeness, and much more!In my honest opinion, allot of bad things have been said about this game, and at that moment i agreed with allot of them.The developers promised us they would keep working on this titel and make it better, more beautiful, more characteristic, and they kept there word and delivered!!!!! So many things have changed, improved, and new stuff was added and there still working hard on this game and patch it very regulairly.In the short time they made this game, i have nothing but praise for Uber as a developer, not for what they were, but for what they have become and what they made!Buy this game if you like strategy games, i ensure you, you will have lots of fun with this one!

If these are fixed, then I would definitely recommend (Edit: some of these graphics errors have been fixed, but I'm still crashing, though not quite as much as usual).			"

												I really don't understand why this game is getting so much negativity. I think it's a great game, and it runs great on my ASUS ROG laptop, not to mention my far superior desktop.The developers are working hard to fix things and keep in mind that this is a never before seen scale for an RTS game. It's all brand new territory for developers, and from the looks of it they are doing a pretty awesome job with it.Instead of bashing the game, help support it to keep it alive and growing. Sure there are still some issues for some people but that doesn't mean we should dislike the game entirely. I'm a veteran player coming from the origins of Total Annihilation and the Supreme Commander series, and I've always thoroughly enjoyed seeing the development and growth of these games. Keep the support alive so that the company doesn't collapse like Cavedog and Gas Powered Games did.Give the game its time and the developers will get around to fixing it I'm sure. The game is solid and seeing many improvements, heck a new update just rolled out today as of this writing. So guys, give it some time to keep improving.			"

												When a person looks at the reviews for this game they do see a lot of negativity. The reason for that if you look at the dates of these reviews, you will see that they were from the previous year in October and November when it was first released. When PA was forst released it was a mess. However now it is very much improved and is very enjoyable. I urge all those that put in a negative review to re-review PA and see how it has been improved, reblanced and overall just made into a good game. It would be great for the big rating groups of IGN and Metacritic to also re-review the game and see that it is now a good game, to improve on the very low ratings on there sites.			"

												This is indeed a very good game and I recommend it. I bought this game when it was on sale for $5, now. Not saying that this game is so bad that it has to go on sale for 84% off, it is a very good game but for what price you buy it for is your choice. I bought the game twice, once for a friend and once for me and I must say it is a blast, I have barely played any RTS games and he's played a few but we went into the game looking at no videos, no tutorials, nothing. We went in knowing nothing about the game and had a blast, we learned as we went and after a couple games of nonsense it became full scale planetary war between the both of us making it very tense and difficult. The battle of 4 armies is amazing since to win you must develope defence against orbital, naval, land, and air troops otherwise you will greatly get destroyed.Defence:To play this game you need to be somewhat well versed with RTS games and if you aren't it'll be a bit before you get good at it. The game offers 5 types of troops that you can use but 4 versions of them. The 4 versions are the basic orbital, naval, land, and air while the types of troops include orbital, bots, vehicles, planes, and naval troops. When making a base you have to build AA turrets, AN turrets, AO turrets, ect. If you skip one of any of the defences the enemy could have scouted you out with a satellite or scout planes and could easily exploit that weakness for the win.Offence:A good offence is always a good defence. This game can NOT be won if you just sit around making an indestructable base because no matter what you will always have one weakness and if you dont then the enemy will constantly hack at your defences until they cave in. To win you MUST go on the offence, you have to create an army before your enemy does and start attacking immediately. Scout their base, find their weakness, exploit it. Be unlike me, I feel bad when I do this so I lose many of my games, I am slowly learning to stop doing this. You must attack to be victorious. There are many strategies, build and use a teleporter, use unit cannons, or just make a base on THEIR planet!Planets:The planets are very diverse and randomly generated. You will never play on the same map even if you choose the same system to play on. There are planets that are like Earth with trees and oceans, there's lava planets full of oceans filled with lava instead of water, ice planets covered in..... well..... ice!, there's the ""Metal Planet"" A.K.A death star, and not to leave out the gold mine called a gas planet. There are so many planets to go on and many ways to defend and offend on them.Pros:- Many things to build- Progressive building- Control of multiple planets- Difficult economy- Nice effects- Simplistic graphics- Fog of WarCons:- Slightly unbalanced gameplay- Poorly optimized- Large amounts of lag when armies begin to grow- Horrible bugs			"

												Picked up this game becuase it looked really fun. What a good call..... This game is so fun its insane. Theres a lot of critics out there putting it down and brushing it under the rug but I just dont get why. Takes a little time to get used to but its super fun even when you get over the initial hump. I am still a beginner but have a blast and can actually put up a decent fight now against a 1v1 match. Highly recommend and would love to see the player base grow and see the the negative reviews dissapear off the steam page. it also goes on sale a lot. if ur hesatant pick it up then.!! lets destory♥♥♥♥♥♥!!

												This is an visualy appealing game, it's just great to look at, all the explodions and mass-open warfare!The major problem for this game is the fact this is a very fast phase game, and I am used to the slower strag games such as Civ5 and Empire Earth. One slip up, one misclick, or one second of resting may cost you the battle, and you be needing to react and think very quickly. This is suited for some people, but for people like me, who likes to think slower and plan bigger, this is too quick.Great game overall, only fits for certain Strag players.			"

												Planetary Annihilation is an RTS game of unprecedented scale. Developed from the ground up by Uber Entertainment, it takes strategy gaming to a whole new level.​A little history. PA first appeared on Kickstarter in August of 2012, billed as 'Total Annihilation-inspired gameplay on a planetary scale'. The developers had worked on games such as Total Annihilation and the Supreme Commander series and cashed in big on the nostalgia factor which those names instilled. They were asking for $900,000 and were successfully funded on September 14th, 2012, with $2.2 million. They remain one of Kickstarter's most successful projects to date, being one of only 82 projects (out of 69,400 projects in total) to raise over $1 million.So how does it play?PA is a game of scale. Your battlefield will be entire planets, not mere countries, and this introduces perhaps the most immediately noticeable difference compared to traditional RTS games, that of a spherical map. Players will no longer find themselves boxed in to a square map with artificial, invisible borders. Instead, you will now find yourself with 360 degrees of complete freedom of movement, as well as the ability to zoom in close enough to see your commander's nose hair, or out far enough to view the whole solar system at once.This brings a degree of strategy to base building and defending that is rarely seen in other RTS games, as you can now attack, and be attacked, from any direction at any time.In keeping with the spirit and inspiration of Total Annihilation, PA encourages massive armies and absurdly explosive battles. You are given the tools to build and manage literally thousands of units, there is no unit cap, and this focuses the gameplay on macro expansion and overall 'big picture' tactics, rather than micromanaging small groups of a handful of units.The UI takes some getting used to, but once you get it figured out, you will be impressed with how simple, yet powerful it is.Units can be given a variety of commands, i.e. attack, move, patrol, and the like. They can also be given area commands, which quickly become essential to manage large armies. For example, instead of having a unit patrol simply point to point, you can set an area command of whatever radius you like, and the unit will patrol the entire area selected. You can use this command to cover the entire planet for things like scouts, allowing you to quickly locate your enemy while leaving you free to manage your base. Likewise, you can issue an area attack command, and your units will attack anything they find in the radius of the area you selected.Buildings can also be issued area build orders. For example, when placing a building, you can click and drag the mouse button to queue up an entire line of buildings instead of just the one. This allows you to set up your units with a build queue and then ignore them while you focus on something else.Another UI innovation that PA brings is the picture in picture window. This opens up a secondary small window in your screen, which you can mouse over and use as a second interface. You can control the map, select units, and give orders all within your secondary window at any time just by mousing over it. Tasks such as launching nukes, linking teleporters, or even just keeping an eye on your enemies base while you scout it become a simple matter with this secondary window up. Managing armies and bases that cover entire planets is made easy with these features.​The units in the game are not quite as varied as Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander, however you will find a unit to cover each of your typical RTS roles. The balance of the game is decent, although I imagine it will still be tweaked a lot through upcoming patches, as more people play more games. As with any RTS game designed to be played competitively on ladders, there is always a meta game that evolves, and if you want to be successful in 1v ranked matches it is usually a must to know the current most powerful strategies. If you are like me, though, and play mostly co-op comp stomp or casually with groups of friends, then the game really opens up and allows you to play how you like.The multiplayer interface is nice, but currently the servers are fairly slow, and both hosting and joining games can be a chore at times.  This has gotten progressively better with each update and is at the point that I no longer notice it as any sort of issue in most of my games.The potential for some pretty insane multiplayer games is there, as you can add any number of players in any configuration of teams as you like. I have seen games that were 10v10v10v10v10 and ones that were 3v6v2v8. There is no restrictions and no artifical limits on how you can set up your game, except maybe your system specs.The one thing currently lacking in multiplayer is different game modes. Currently you can set up games as team games, with shared armies, or as free for all games, however you can not choose a supremacy mode, or sandbox mode, or anything else. All games are basically assassination mode, which means that as soon as you lose your commander, you are wiped out entirely, regardless of how many units or buildings you had remaining.The visuals of this game are good, the different planet biomes look fantastic and have a great variety of different ways they can be generated. Things like forest fires and wreckage add to the feeling of complete devastation. The commanders explode in a very satisfying mushroom cloud, and of course, crashing a moon into someone else's planet is always an excellent way to end a game.			"

												I am one of the kickstarter backers, and this game showed so much promise, looked cool and awesome.Along the way of this game being made i have had my sheer amount of doubts of what would become of this game.Having played the game for many many hours i must say this product has become a wonderful strategy game!The game at this moment and today is the 6th of February 2015 is very good.If you like strategy games you are going to love this, this game has features you have never seen before, and you might need to get used to some, for example:Planet shaped maps, this you will need to get used to, but in time it's awesome.A 3rd and 4th layer of strategy in the form of orbital units and moving to other planets in your system in real time.Blowing up complete planets with a deathstar like super weapon. Building planetary engines on planets and send them like asteroids into another planet and leaving big craters.Wiping out the enemy in so many different ways with such awesomeness, and much more!In my honest opinion, allot of bad things have been said about this game, and at that moment i agreed with allot of them.The developers promised us they would keep working on this titel and make it better, more beautiful, more characteristic, and they kept there word and delivered!!!!! So many things have changed, improved, and new stuff was added and there still working hard on this game and patch it very regulairly.In the short time they made this game, i have nothing but praise for Uber as a developer, not for what they were, but for what they have become and what they made!Buy this game if you like strategy games, i ensure you, you will have lots of fun with this one!

												I bought this game months ago on a whim but didn't bother trying it until this weekend. To put it plainly, this is the game I've been waiting for. I've always loved RTSes and was waiting for the day Civilization made it to this level of play. I'm glad I didn't wait. Even in beta, it's incredible. The graphics are crisp and responsive (set to moderate on my GE70) and the gameplay is fantastic. The controls are easy to figure out and there is very little learning curve. I had started playing Eve for a while but got tired of the learning curve, not to mention it's just not an RTS or TBS.As someone who rarely plays games, I was unsure about paying for a game that was still in alpha but I'm glad I did. This game ranks with Seven Kingdoms: AA as one of the best strategy games of all time. I can't wait for the totally finished product. Considering how far it's come in so little time, I know I won't be disappointed.			"

												I bought this when it was like $30 and wish I had waited, when I bought it was still in early stages of development and the game ran a little clunky and there was a lot going on to handle, plus switching and deciding planets was the insanely annoying.  If you are into Commander or real time strategy I would say buy, but buyer beware there is a lot going on at once and it is hard to control everything going on in the battlefield.  The AI isn't the strongest on lower difficulties and mainly just gives you trouble on their homeworld.  I never got deep into the game as I like turn based strategy, but definitely a good pick-up I'll have to play more anyone who is into space strategy would love this.  6/10 overall since when I bought it, for the genre I would say 8/10.  I wish the combat and management system where slightly easier to control so I didn't have to do so many damn mouse clicks, but the combat and winning is fast so it is fun for a quick play.  Definitely recommend to anyone who's a casual gamer or someone more serious if you are into conquering games.			"

												Sincerely, i have bought this game on rebate @7.00$ i think. Couldn't be more happier with my purchase! i Have near 40hours as of now on this one and not tired of it yet! learning curve is a little bit steep as you have to control a lot of different type of units (sea,land,air,orbital) but once you get used to it it's quite fun! There are some bugs here and there (unit pathfinding, ai bugged etc etc) but nothing really gamebreaking. I recommend it. Even at 32$ it's a good bet since most game i buy @ 70$ i usually play them for 20-30hours. Note that i have quite a good system (x99 rampage v , 5930k, 16gb ram, gtx690) and the way the game has been coded doesn't make use of ""SLi"" neither of my 6 cores and can be quite heavy to run at times (depending of the solar system you're playing on).I give it 8/10 (-1 bugs need more polishing (which they're doing right now), -1 hard on systems code is heavy for nothing IMO)Have fun !

												This game gave me what other space RTS's didnt, tangible interplanetary combat. You really do feel like the entire solar system is at war with you. The fighting in orbit definitely feels like orbital fights should be, and the land combat is just as amazing. Though the first couple games do take a little time getting used to the UI and the ""clutter"" on the screen, but not to worry, there are definitely tools to help out with these problems. I definitley recommend this game to somebody who is lookin for a new an interesting RTS to play with.			"

Early Access Review
								Hi fellow gamers, I'm sure you've all played many games that are stratergy and this one should take the cake so far.  If you've played Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander you already have a feel for this game but there's two huge differences!  There are no unit caps and you are battleing it out in a living solar system. The worlds not flat and you can travel through space in minutes to reach a brand new and perhaps uninhabited planet to extort.  The other main points of this game are massive scale macro and micro management of units and buildings. Artilery, aircraft, naval fleets, and various ground forcers all create the basic combat groups.  Late game units go beyond those even and add in satellite combat in the upper atmospheres of planets or even strapping some giant engines onto a nearby planet and making a very nice planet destroying machine! =]  A few things to note though, this is extrememly resource intensive game (hardware wise) and is intended for next generation computing.  So if you dont have a fancy computer you're going to want one =)			"

Early Access Review
								Now I had my eye on this game for quite some time, but I was not willing on spending the original $60 on it. I opened steam one day and what do I see, Planetary Annihilation for $30. I bought that instantly and have had no regrets in buying it. Planetary Annihilation takes real time strategy games to a whole new level with orbital and planetary warefare. You can attack from any angle you want in order to beat your enemy (in my case only ai's cause I'm not that great yet :O). If that doesn't work why not just jump to a moon, construct some rockets on it and launch it and them. The way you rotate around the map (planets) and then you will be looking at your base from a different angle is a bit weird at first but after about 3 hours I was used to it. The graphics were also a big change for me as I'm not usually a fan of cartoonish style graphics, but again I got used to it after a little while. I have encounted a few bugs and I always have a problem with units being slighty delayed. So if this would be a problem for you wait a little while but definitely buy it when it's fully released.After actually playing this I would have paid $50-$60 so I would recommend any RTS fan to purchase this game.

												This is definitely one of my favorite RTS games. I love this game, but i have to agree with some people, They could definitely add more to this game. It is great as it stands though. While it is on sale, get it. Especially if you are a big RTS fan. 8.5/10			"

												I've been a long time strategy gamer, and have mixed feelings about it. There are things that I love, and things that I hate.I will also repeatedly compare this game to Supreme Commander, as it's very similar (it is a spiritual successor).What I Love:Runs beautifullyGood communityGreat graphics, UI, mod support.Hits a sweet-spot of occupation - there's always something to do, but I never feel so overloaded that I can't manage it.There's excellent sets of tools for management, such as the secondary map (which is a beautiful idea).Few bugsWell done economies. I personally find it a little resource-rich, but it's pretty good.Excellent general gameplay - on-planet gameplay is very well done, and battles are always fun and exciting.Cons:Game-breaking units. This is the big one. In a good RTS, every strategy should be counterable - there should never be a strategy that has no way of being defeated. This game has too many.-> SXX laser platform - there is no defense to them coming in above your commander and getting off a single shot each. I have had countless fun and even games end with an enemy simply bringing them directly above the commander, and there is no good way of preventing it. It's no fun.-> Halleys - it's too difficult to counter a planet in motion (nothing can get to it other than teleports, and if they have halleys you probably don't have a teleporter).-> Halleys and catalysts are, in my opinion, too cheap. There cost would be better if doubled.Storing resources is also a bit too easy. Dividing storage capacity by 4 would help.Overall, this is a great game, especially for the beginning RTS player who wishes to get into serious RTS. Its economy is padded, meaning production of units is usually easy, but can still offer challenges. It runs like a dream, and is a truly beautiful game from a graphics perspective. Battles are fun and entertaining.However, once you become reasonably good at RTS games I would have to advise Supreme Commander over this game. The economy is a little too padded for competitive gameplay, and there are enough units that can be exploited, especially in late-game, to destroy advanced and many-planet games.If you've never played RTS games before, pick it up. You'll enjoy it, and it will teach well many of the skills necessary to play RTSs well. However, if you consider yourself at least moderately experienced an RTS player, I would recommend other games over it, and to be aware of the problems associated with it before a purchase.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a game I'd recommend to any RTS fan. The game does have a bit of a learning curve to it. It would be best to read up on guides, watch video tutorials or practice with some friends. The stradegy involved is completely different from your average RTS so using the ""normal"" tactics wouldn't be recommended. Though this game does have its flaws:The factions have no difference from one another except being a different name and colour. There is no in depth lore at the time of this post, but the game has a ton of potential. The potential storyline could be amazing if Uber plays their cards right and not rely so heavily on their backers from Kickstarter to write it for them.This game isn't 100% done and still has some A.I. issues where they could be inactive and have their commanders sit there as  you steamroll them with endless waves of troops. Or the troops go in completely different directions and can get stuck into buildings/enviornment.The best things Uber can do for this game are:To fix the bugs for the A.I. and make some commanders have special abilities or act differently.Develop the lore and possibly a single-player campaign and not exclusively give the backers a chance to add ideas to the lore and cut off everyone else. Diversify the Factions by at least giving different models or different troops or specialities (i.e. Making 1 faction's air troops more speed/damage/health or having 1 type more developed than the last.)Of course I'm going to expect Uber to do anything listed above, all that was posted was a mere suggestion from a lover and near worshipper of the RTS genre. If you have a chance to get the game you should, it is an absolute fun time to play with, especially with friends. Though it would be best to wait for the full release, I only bought the game because I have high hopes for the game and want to support Uber.*Please note that by the time that this game is fully released, anything listed could already be fixed and/or intgrated into the game.*			"

												I picked this up for me and my son and we just played two games against each other and we had a blast.  It does not have all the features of other AAA games in this genre but with the steam sale, this game is more than worth the 5 bucks it cost.  Being new to the game I might just not know how to do everything but I felt the following was missing:- No way to queue your build orders.  You start with a commander who builds things and walks very slow.  Later you can build other builders and get around this but I found it odd I could not queue my commander to build three things.  It makes the start of the game a babysitting job where you just follow him from building to building.- Unit descriptions need some work.  I assumed an orbital defense satellite would shot down a nuke, I was wrong.- Planets seem to rotate on you for no reason.  What was up/north one minute becomes right/east in another minute and disorientates you.  I could not find a way to rotate the planet manually but again, I am new to the game and maybe I just could not find it.  Other than that, it was great fun.  For the $5, I would recommend it if you have a friend to play with.			"

												I really wanted to love this game but it completely failed to achieve the massive feel and scale that TA and SUPCOM/FA did. The units are huge and the planets are tiny and lacking in character. The overly cell shaded style also does no justice to either of the games which inspired it and used far more detailed texturing and coloring techniques. The GW mode is just dead. It's lifeless and boring.Unfortunately, this game, though pretty enjoyable has very low replay value for me as an individual coming from TA, SU, and FA. I've played it maybe 6 times and probably won't go back.I can honestly say that this feels unfinished and is currently the biggest entertainment disappointment that I have experienced thus far.I still recommend the game at the current sale price as it is very fun for a short time and may be great for new players. But having ""been there done that and done it better"", it's not for me.			"

												This game has a lot of cool features and interesting mechanics. But the Galactic Warfare, the single player ""campaign"", is very unbalanced. By the time you have the oppurtunity to setup anything to building the enemy is sending bombers and ground units. It's frustrating to the point to where it's hard to learn the mechanics of the game in the short 10 - 15 minutes before you're defeated. I know some people just jump right on here and dominate but, for some it would be difficult to learn how to play this game in this fashion. Even with skirmish it's the same way. I recommend picking this game up but be warned, it's very frustrating to play.			"

												I played this game for a few hours, and it is rather fun once you figure out the gaming mechanics. There is a game journal option on the main menu that will go over some of the basics, but there is no actual tutorial for the game which I thought was rather dissapointing. Despite this, the game itself is fun as other reviewers have said you destroy planets and thats about it. I would not buy the game at full price but if it is on sale and you want a decent RTS to play to kill some time I would get it.P.S. There is no campaign of any kind so don't expect any sort of story or real explanation to the game.			"

												To be honest the game is still in beta. Not all the units or buildings are out and they update they are still balancing everything. However it's still nice to see an RTS that does something different. The textures are a little cartoon-y but if that's the price to pay in order to fire an army of tanks and suicide-bombing spiders out of a cannon/factory through space to land on top of the enemy and assassinate his commander, so be it			"

												This is a difficult review to write. The game is an awesome idea, interplanetary battles with amazing lazers and missiles you can strap to a moon to catapult it somewhere. However this game is not perfect.Pros-Multiplayer works well-Singleplayer Galactic War mode is great fun-Possible to make your own system to battle on-Quite addictive-Constantly updatedCons - This is where the bad bit begins-The system requirement-The glitches (so many, everywhere)-Not many varients of units,you have the tank, flame tank, anti air tank and thats all-End game orbital war is painful and slow-Not enough players to fill up the multiplayer lobby'sThis is the worstTo begin with it is interesting, but as time goes on you realise that 90% of singleplayer games are exactly the same, same tactics win everytime.Now with all cons why do I recommend it? the 10% of games that aren't repetative are awesome. If you feel like an RTS game where you spam LOADS of units (and have a good computer) this is the game for you. However If you are after more tactics and more complex and interesting gamplay the Supreme Commander series is perfect.This game is not in full release like it says on the steam page, it is still in development and maybe they will fix the issues so keep an eye on this game but only get it on a good deal. Overwise, go for supreme commander forged alliance (The steam advertising is pathetic) which is half the price of Planetary Annihilation. "

												Despite what most of the comments probably say, this game is actually quite good.Yes, it is a little buggy and the devs are a bit on the bad side but the game itself is surprisingly fun.You get to control massive armies which will pretty much take over entire planets, harvest resources from neighbouring gas giants, create units which will spread across the entire solar system, or even smash moons/asteroids/planets right into your enemies. And if that isn't good enough, take control of massive lasers which shoot straight through other planets.In the end, you truly don't just win. You annihilate!! "

Apparently they couldn't just give us the few extra units. They had to make it standalone so the people who already own the original can buy another game, just for a few extra units. This is why we can't have nice things.			"

												Imagine spending 2-3 hours building engines on a super moon. And then moments before the glorious collision the game crashes and burns in a pile of its own failure. I bought this game for £30 and it runs poorly crashes frequently and the fact that they want another £30 for the expansion is disgraceful. A game that has cost so much and delivered so little is not worth buying. Oh and the deathstar planet fires with no cooldown so its a game over as youll quickly blow every other planet up. Just buy supreme commander forged alliance instead.			"

												This is a great rts, unbalanced at times, but it's still highly enjoyable. The solar warfare system is great and well, it's an experience. The unbalanced bit comes in when you realize how hard it is to control numerous planets at the same time. Another thing is that when you play a match for long enough the game legitimately becomes a stalemate. There's no way of winning after fighting for a few hours.			"

												I wrote a review for this game already, saying that I didnt recommend it. However as you read this now, you may have realised i am now recommending it. I was one of the many who funded this game on kickstarter, something like 3 years ago, and i was honestly disappointed with the outcome. However as of late i was playing some total annihilation and decided that this game deserved another go. Before now the game didnt run smoothly, it constantly crashed and that prevented me from seeing the mechanics this game had to offer. They have seemed to have fixed the problem and i play the game regularly. The mechanics are great, I could describe them in detail and waste your life or i could tell you that they are like total annihilation in the 21st century. The graphics are perfect and simple, the satisfaction of watching your buildings being built is undescribable and the combat is smooth and great + the soundtrack is up to par. The choice of commanders is great, they seem to cover every play style, whether you like relentlessly slaughtering your enemies in the earky game or conducting a large scale battle in the late. The explosions are wonderful aswell, especially when planets collide, not quite universe sandbox 2, but very good none the less.Things i dont like: The movement of units that travel between planets seems grainy and undefined, especially when your moving a planet.The planets don't rotate as time moves forward which strips the realism out from your hands.You cannot collide planets into the sun.Very little solar system customization. The Halley's (engines you use to move planets) are available way too early in the game and provide an unbelieveable easy victory for your combatant. They seemingly havent tried to balance this at all.However I think that this game's positives outweigh its faults and therefore give this game a somewhat clean bill of health. Possibly has a mild cough.			"

								I highly recommend this game, however, for those of you with... not the best of computers- like myself, be warned, your computer WILL turn into a 747 engine. Even with graphics turned down to the lowest settings, my computer is very loud when this game is running. With this being said, the game is highly addictive, and as slow as it runs for me (not the game, it's my computer) I still feel the need to finish- despite my problem with my graphics (once again- MY COMPUTER- not the game). The strategy aspect of this game is intense, fast paced, and even if you aren't the best at RTS's- like myself- it is easy to recover if you screw yourself. This game is amazing, support the devs and buy this game NOW. This game boldly goes where no RTS has gone before. Taking the fight to other planets, turning moons into missiles, creating orbital strike satellites, powerful upgrades to your vehicles; generators and metal extractors. This is one of the best RTS's I've played.What are you waiting for? But this game now, easily worth the money!			"

												Besides for the devs scamming me and not letting me upgrade to the Titan version after hiding this game on steam(At least the game won't appear when I search for it)This game is the biggest waste of money you could spend.It's an attempt at an ""everyone's equal!"" Sort of game but here's the thing.All the same units. You get 4 commanders by default and buy more with actual money. This can range from 5$ to 10$ for a commander reskin.And to top it off this game has been ""finished"" after its still unpolished and has massive issues.The only ONE way the devs could fix this in my eyes, is by making it more custom. Adding different faction units commander abilities and that would be about all.But that will never happen so don't bother wasting your money on this game. Learn from my mistakes.And don't get me wrongMap editor is cool and all,But this is just. Bad. Even with map editor my own maps won't load unless it's 1 planet half the time...			"

												Ok, so I got this game for free through a deal on a website where you had to follow certain steam and facebook pages, etc.I am so glad I got it for free because I don't think it would have been worth the $99 it used to cost, let alone $29.99.I know I only have less than an hour played, but in a game like this it doesn't take much longer than 30 minutes to know if you are going to like a game or not,The graphics are pretty, I will give this game that, but that's about it.First, when you log in, you are greeted with ads.  Boo.Secondly, there is no campaign. That is to say, there's no story mode like other RTS games, and that's important to me because I suck in most any kind of PVP environment in any game, so I love a good single player story driven campaign mode.  This game does not have that.  Instead it has Galactic War (or something like that) where you start off with basic tech and work your way from planet to planet hoping to find additional tech and loadouts.  Oh, and you can only have 4 active tech at one time, so your SoL if you want to have more.Thirdly, it seems every ""race"" in this game is the same units just different colors.  The only thing that seems to differentiate is the commanders you have who start everything off.  Fourthly, unless I missed it, I found no tutorial mode to get you used to the game, it just plunks you right in Galactic mode and you have to figure stuff out for yourself.Fifthly, stuff just did not make sense to me cost wise through metal and energy.  For example, it appeared to me I had, to start off, a max amount of metal of 1.5k.  Well, one of the buildings, I think the air one that creates satellites and stuff, cost 2700 metal, yet I was able to build it.  I also could not find a way to increase the cap on metal, but it appears it really does not matter.  If things are different then they appear, the game does not tell you. Again, you have to figure stuff out for yourself.Lastly, gameplay.  While the game felt very RTS in the way grouping, moving, building, and attacking worked, I really didn't feel excited about exploring and attacking the enemy.  I built up my forces with several different units, grouped them up, and set out to find my foe.  I found them eventually, but when I did, it wasn't exciting or scary or anything. It was just, ""Ok.""  The terrain is an actual spherical planet you travel on, and to me feels barren, generic, and very boring.  PS: I don't know how effective walls are but I built a crapton of them which takes a long time, and I saw no way to queue multiple walls (unless I miss something, but I cannot stress, the game doesn't teach you anything) and had to take my 3 builders and commander and build each wall separately.Out of a rating of 10, I would rate this game a 3.  I enjoyed the Star Wars RTS way better than this generic game.  The WHOLE game just feels lazily done and generic to me. Too much of the same thing between the terrain and the units.			"

Interface is nice and clean, works with the aesthetic (which may I add I thoroughly enjoy). The ""camera"" view you can set up is quite helpful, especially for group attacks (for example, launching multiple nukes).Overall, I love the game. Though there is some issues with servers, but as I understand they are working on that / won't really matter by the end as we will be able to host servers ourselves.			"

												First review, but I had too. I'm a big Supreme Commander player. Forged Alliance and even 2 were really great RTS games where you felt you had control. This game was a dream. The economy of the first games with the polish of the second one... all on planets!Problem is that you have zero... feel. You don't feel like you have control, you don't feel the importance of the classes, some units moves way too fast and some doesn't work the way they should. I never managed to complete a game, simply because a lot of the core mechanics are broken. I'm always insecure by what a unit will do, if my radar works, how I can transport my units and just how the whole thing works.Great potencial, but very bad execution, go buy Forged Alliance if you want a complete experence or SC2 for something more polished and simple.

												My original review of PA was made in a fury after one too many crashes, which was solved after I bumped up my virtual RAM (Which is still a tad ridiculous, as it went from 4GB to 12GB but still).Summary: Under the right circumstances, this game is a blast. However, those on the lower spectrum of the minimum specs (specifically those with anything under 8GB of RAM), as well as those looking for a single player campaign would be better off shying away. I'm also a tad hesitant to recommend even on sale since those who backed this game from the very beginning and who paid $100+ still haven't gotten promised content. The dev prematurely released this game and has since abandoned it, then did a kickstarter for another game.Gameplay: Ever wanted to blow up planets with a giant death star? This is your game. You spawn on a planet with your commander and, using the resources of energy and metal, grow an army and build a base, then eventually visit other planets and take other commanders out of play. There are four main types of units; bots, vehicular, aerial, and naval. Each have strenghts and weakness, for example vehicles move slower but complete objectives faster, vice versa for aerial units, and bots are middle ground. There are some balancing issues, most notably the gap of ease of access between metal and energy. I hardly found myself ever running out of energy, but metal was a different story. Pathing is also a major issue. Finally, there are some glitches to be found, such as units refusing to do something.Graphics: It's an RTS. They're good enough but no Crysis by any stretchOptimization: This is where this game shines, really. Much of the money for this game went to servers and it absolutely shows. I saw a YouTube video of a 35 man FFA (no AI) and there was no real lag. But that's not even close to the max ammount of players. Even in a system with a lot of planets and thousands of units roaming around, I have yet to notice major lag and fps drops besides the occasional hang. (However, I have a fairly high end system, so like I said above if you're barely meeting the recommended specs, wait until you upgrade your PC)Misc: No real single player. Galactic War is a real let down. However, you can always do a local multi match against AI (Who are pretty good). Galaxy editor is really fun and allows for fun gameplay combinations. Final Verdict: If you have a group of friends, or even just one friend who play this with you, this game is great fun. That being said, if you pay full price for this game you're getting ripped off. $6 is a good price for this game.			"

								Got it while it was on sale from the Galactic War update and I absolutely love it. Definitely worth $30, probably worth it at $50, too. Haven't tired of it yet as I am currently at 32 hours. Interface is nice and clean, works with the aesthetic (which may I add I thoroughly enjoy). The ""camera"" view you can set up is quite helpful, especially for group attacks (for example, launching multiple nukes).Overall, I love the game. Though there is some issues with servers, but as I understand they are working on that / won't really matter by the end as we will be able to host servers ourselves.			"

								Planetary annihilation is one of the best games I have played. Though I rarely like RTS(Real Time Strategy) games this one really caught my eye. The fact that you can build up massive armies of tanks and planes to your hearts content really makes me happy. I love the feel of this game and just the whole aspect of it. I highly recommend this game to everyone who is even considering it!			"

The unit movement, the planet landscapes, the construction system, it all still feels ""beta""...but, if it's on sale for like 15 bucks or less, pick it up. It's a very unique game if you can get around the incredibly wonkey UI. Plus, smashing planets into eachother is always fun			"

												Lifeless machines building machines building better machines to destroy other machines This games got little learning curve, but once you got the basics down its radicalI feel like a lot of the negative reviews for this game are from older issues that have since been solved, This early access game had a rough start, months ago when I first started playing it was a disaster. I constantly lost connection to the servers and the game were terribly balanced and there were tons of optimization issues. but I kept coming back to the game even though it has its issues, The game play was really innovative and fun, especially if you get some friends together and have intense 9 hour games on systems you get to build yourself. The Devs have done a good job fixing many problems and although the game still isn't at a perfect state, many of the remaining issues are minor and its definitely playable and being updated and improved. This game is totally worth a buy and a must-have if it's on sale.I really hope this game gets the better reviews it deserves "

Early Access Review
								It's the RTS we have been waiting for.  Simple resources, massive armies, great defences and awesome superweapons! I like the art style, it works wonders for the scale of the game.  The units make sense and have short, accurate tool-tips.  Tech progression is straightforeward but well done. The AI is fairly cleaver and diverse, it will keep you busy. And the Picture in a Picture tool is actually incredible! Seems like such a small detail, but I cannot get enough of it!  And this is all before I've played matches against friends, or figured out all the keybindings and features.  Extremely playable and fun as of this review during Early Access. As an overly brief description, its a game of pumping out units to smash into your opponent's armies/bases with a multi-planet scale.  Red Alert 2 meets Sins of a Solar Empire, along with ROBOTS, to make Planetary Annihilation.If you are a fan of Real Time Strategies, you owe it to yourself to get this game. You will not regret it.  (If you'd like to compare, previous favorite RTSs of mine were Sins of a Solar Empire, Red Alert 2, Age of Empires 2, and CnC Tiberium Sun.  PA already has earned its spot next to those titles for me.) I don't often write reviews, but this game deserves it!			"

								Did you like games like Civilization V, Supreme Commander, Total Annihilation? Then you will absoloutley love this game to bits. I have only had this game for around 3 days and my hours tell how much I love the game!Gameplay:The gameplay is great. You can always take a different route in game, maybe you want to be one of those guys who just bombs the hell out of everyone else, maybe you want to build up you army of death lasers or even nukes, well you can do it all infact you can even launch a moon into another planet absoloutley blowing it to pieces!The landscapes are not flat in any shape or form and the game has around 5 preset solar systems you can choose for your game, but once you're bored of them you can create your own!Also the matches, they can go on for ages that is the best part for example last night I was in  a 2 hour long match and I did not get bored, so much to do, so much to worry about.Graphics:The graphics are simply amazing for what they need to be, about 4-5 different graphical settings allowing from low range PC's to high range PC's. They suit the genre exacly nice and cartoony and they all blend well.The UI is also nice, it does not get in the way and is easy to find what you need.Conclusion:Overall I would have to say for a definite I recommend this game for anyone who likes the RTS genre, its amazing graphics, very long gameplay, variety of things to do and overall fun as hell!*Still is early access so does have some bugs, but good thing is they are being actively fixed and no major ones!*			"

												In both gameplay and namesake this could be Totally Annihilation's sequel but I am having a very difficult time getting into this game. I loved TA and really want to love this one but every time I play I end up getting annoyed. I must say if you do plan on buying this game, get a friend to buy it too, it is really the most enjoyable way to play as with most RTS'sI think the only thing that really bothers me is the map, the rounded surface and lack of mini-map makes it difficult to keep track of any units you have spread out but I think that may just take some getting used to.For now I am giving a thumbs up but if I can't get used to the map this is going to become a hard game to play.

The variety of tactics you can pursue is solid, and the scale of the world in which you can play in is great.The game is about defeating the enemy commander which is all you spawn with. You build up an economy to support your military which then goes on the prowl. Meanwhile, their commander may have gone to another planet to hide. Scale! If you so choose, you could build a bunch of rockets on an asteroid, and use them to propel the rock into his planet. SCALE!Love this game and do not regret purchasing!			"

												Good for competitive and relatively multitasking oriented strategy gamers. Bad for casual gamers who want to have fun and mess around. If you have friends you have a double win but if you prefer playing on your own and have a casual stroll, you might wanna skip it.I have around 300 hours of alpha/beta hours(before converting to steam a few days ago) and plenty of videos on YT and even though I loved TA and SupCom, PA became too competitive for me. I've been messing around in the single player Galactic War and that is okay but I'd love a mode with challenges or something you can play casually since there will be no campaign.Either way I would definitely recommend the game as it is a successor to TA in most aspects and you can enjoy it. Some may enjoy it more than others but thats the case with any game!			"

												I can say this game is probably the best real time strategy I have ever played. Its has some kinks, but once you get the hang of it its very good.Other RTS games I have put a decent ammount of hours into inclue Age Of Empires 2 and halo wars, so im going to draw comparisons with those games to build this review.Age of empires is good, but it has glaring flaws. The units are dumb and need frequent commands, and there is a population limit, preventing people from building huge armys. The building system is nice however, as it allows the player to put building where they want, and build more complex basesHalo Wars has a low population limit, which really bummed me out in the later portions of matches because my armies could not grow according to the ammount of recources I was generating. And the bases where small, and didnt give the players much freedom when deciding the location of buildings.Planetary Annihilation takes the best aspects of the two, and kills off the problems each of them had. Freedom when building, mostly autonomous units, no population limit, all features I love in an RTS. I can make armies of biblical proportions, have entire planets designated to harvesting resources for me, while I use the resources to build machinery that lets me crash a moon into its home planet, destroying my enemies in the process.Pros--NO UNIT POPULATION CAP (And a constant build mode on unit factories)-Lots of control over units-Almost every unit can do tasks automatically-Can build custom solar systems to fight inCons--The program itself does not run very smoothly. Long load times, temporary freezing in menues, etc.-Multiplayer can be hard to get started when playing on big solar systems-User interface is not very straight forward, but easy to use once you learn it.Overall I highly recomend this game, especially if you have friends to play it with.

												Some of the people I play with have problems getting this game to run smoothly, we also find that the friend system built in to the game doesn't work fantastically well and generally the game seems poorly optimised.HOWEVER, when we can get it working; it's extremely enjoyable. There's no better feeling than allowing your mate to think he's aiming his death laser at the planet you're on, only for it to be a decoy. Then proceeding to land an attack force on his death star, destroy his lasers, build your own lasers, and then destroy his planet with them.			"

												A pretty cool game that goes one step further than supreme commander and that it allows you to have instellar battles. I am jaded by the new release which is the same game if i can upgrade to it for $5.The singleplayer campaign is easy at normal difficulty. definitely has fun with friends and prob not for kids with text chat			"

I paid 90$ to ensure I would be entitled to any new downloadable content and future expansions as well as helping out the company. The company decided to BAIL on their existing users and are only offering a DISCOUNT to the users who already paid 90$ WTF. I'm done supporting this company what a fail.			"

								Brings the insanity of total annihalation into 2014. The UI is a little clunky, and the game has a few bugs, but by the time this is released it will be a much better game. Right now, if you loved total annihalation, or just really love blowing up huge amounts of robots, you should pick this game up.  "

								A great first RTS game, if you've never tried a strategy game before I recommend this as it's fun and not too serious. However, it's not something someone who's played dozens of RTSes would enjoy much, as they might prefer something else like Supreme Commander or maybe Company of Heroes. It's not really worth the current price tag if I'm honest, if it drops below £20, sure; I'd recommend it, but currently it doesn't really offer what you'd expect from a £30 game.			"

								Definitely reminds me of first supcom.  Minimalistic artstyle makes the game run smooth, and it's definitely simplified when you get up close.  Haven't played a vrs match mostly because I like longer drawn out games when it comes to RTS, and this game has a big capacity for that.All in all it's a satisfying play, the spherical map means you're open to attack on all sides.  It really plays over into all aspects of RTS when the map loses it's borders, especially large scale RTS like this.  Definitely still being worked on but I'm having a lot of fun playing it.  Still haven't smashed any planets but I'd recommend it if you don't mind waiting for the rest of the game to be finished while you play.			"

								I backed this at kickstarter cause i thought it was a cool idea, but now that i actually play it, it's not that good.Gameplay example:I joined the game and instantly built everything i needed to get an orbital launcher, then i launch my commander to another planet to have him safe.I start building an base on the second planet because the AI is flooding my first base with a ****load of planes. (I'm talking 200+ here).My first base is completely gone and my second base is looking good. I tell my workers to put electricity and metal miners all over the planet. (The planet is small, so yes, it's possible)I build an army that i thought would wreck the AI, and then i realize. How am i gonna get them there?I spent about an hour building about 500+ spaceships to tow the army to the AI base.I get there, and the AI is completely crazy! It's got about 800+ planes, a few workers and millions of structures. (Everything from defenses to orbital launchers)I send in my army, drop them, and then the lag starts. 0-15 fps for about a minute. When the lag stops i realize that i've got like 10 vehicles left. And the worst thing is, the AI never stop building!I put army after army in there to hope that they will find a way to kill the AI, and it works! Just when i'm about to send in everything i got, the game crashes.Good Game.If the game gets updated so that it's funnier and not totally unbeatable, then maybe i'll change my review, but right now, it's not playable or fun.

Building the Advanced tech doesn't help. THey're slow and unweildy and the enemy will destroy anything before you get backup there. THE MOST frustrating thing about this agme is trying to manage metal extractors. THe AI has guerilla forces constantly destorying yours , while amintaining there own.

My Review for this gameAt this current stage, I wouldn't recommend this game. I had so many bugs, I could barely get to end game. While the amount of concept done in the game. The bugs became more of a problem then gameplay it self. I run a very well computer, but the loading planets that are small scale is time consuming. Usually the A.I or the Player gets a headstart before I could even load planets. Sometimes in my battles, my screen is blocked out of view. So I can't even see my buildings or units. Fabricater's pathfinding starts derping. Your ""ACU"" Or commander can get stuck in a spot where you can't even go 3 steps. Do I recommend: My answer is, ""Not at this moment, mabye after a few updates, but as of 9/23/14 I would not recommend""The gameplay and concept is good, which I do like. Econemy management is similar to some of my favorite strategy games, ""Total Annihilation"", and ""Supreme Commander"" series. End game gets bit more strategic if planned accordingly. [Unless theres metal planets and Planet smashing]It gets intense as time goes on, I get the feeling after a few matches. All about scouting and other necessary stuff leading to victory.Just not now. Too buggy, too laggy. Should'nt even release at this stage			"

												I want a refund! Total buyer's remorse. I really had hope for this game: the concept seemed awesome, the comic book graphics appealed to me, and who wouldn't want to collapse an entire planet with a rocket powered asteroid? But the designers couldn't hold up their end of the bargain. Gameplay is substandard for the major league game price. Persistent online is a PITA. I can't even enjoy playing the game anymore without getting upset that I was bamboozled. And if the lackluster gameplay wasn't enough they lowered the price and left all the backers and early access buyers hanging. Never should have bought, and I hope others will learn from my mistake.

								I was pretty excited about this game way before it's alpha release. The ""gameplay visualization"" video that was uploaded at their  kickstarter page was really fascinating and a lot promising too. I bought the game 2 months after it's release for 100 USD. Back then there was only one planet that you could play on, as it was at it's earliest stages. The gameplay was quite nice but I prefered to play supreme commander back then as it was almost the same thing but sc was more complete. After  the beta release and the ""Planet Smashing"" I got really excited but it didn't last for long. After I played some time, I found out that the game was kinda laggy at loading, the interplanetary transportasion was poor and that the game was in need for vizualization and gameplay fixes. But I encouraged my self and I was keep saying myself ""It's still in beta"".27/2/2014 , the day the game was dead for me. I was really disappointed with uber. Even though they didn't finish the game in time, they got into gamma... REALLY? GAMMA? It's well known that beta is the last step before the release and beta is a testing version of the game published in a group of people who have usually pre-ordered the game, to get a taste of the game before it's release. But gamma... what's that? Gamma is here for almost 5 months and there are no BIG changes to the game except optimization and fixes. The only good feature that was introduced with gamma was the ""multi-planet"" that allowed the players to spawn in diferent planets of the system and the begining of the game, something that in my opinion should have been published a lot earlier. Even now there are few elements of the game reminding me the game Planetary Annihilation was supposed to become. Should I also say that after the gamma release (almost) uber announced another game they were being developing while Planetary Annihilation development was far away from ""ok"".*This is my opinion, and I believe that only the kickstarters and the early alpha players will agree with.

												In case you've missed Total Annihilation, Supreme Commander and SupCom 2, this is their close relative. I don't know any other game that features Air and Space levels strategy-wise (Metal Fatigue does not count), nevermind smashing planets into each other. Now onto details,The good:While it is still in development, the game is already very playable. The developers are constantly improving the balance between units and development trees. I've had it for less than a month and already there is an update. Instead of 3-tier, the game has 2-tier technology system. While this provides less variety in terms of scalability of desctruction available, it allows for shorter game sessions. 1x1, 2x2, even on big maps will last no longer than 1 hour, if you're playing totally defensive.A very fresh and innovative idea of orbital tech and moving between planets/asteroids is also very well implemented. Nothing like building a laser satellite (tame version of ion cannon) and blasting your defenseless opponent to bits. The pace of the game is faster than that of TA, SupCom or SupCom2, yet it is surprisingly balanced.Eveything you liked about TA is in this game.The bad (needs work):It feels like there is very little change between the tech branches towards the endgame, since the tech trees are so short. Regardless whether you went into T2 vehicles or T2 air at first, the end result is always the same as there are no super-units. You will have build every of T2 factory if you want to survive.None of T2 units have anti-air capability (with the exception of orbital tech). Effectively end-game requires you to keep building the flimsy T-1 anti-air units, that are made out of paper and get insta-killed on the battlefield by that time. While someone else might like that, I feel like this imposes a restriction on player's choice of how to play the game. Here the game won't ever let you switch to bigger, fatter T2 units completely. At this point it seems to me that it was a deliberate game balance choice, and it won't ever truly go away.Alerts. The game doesn't prioritize them. Your spy-satellite reaches enemy planet and you drown in alerts (Air factory found! Bot factory found! Radar found! A skeleton in a closet found! Your grandma's teeth found! Multiply by 100 for a average-size planet). While you might care about an enemy orbital launcher, I want to see where their commander is. so instead I have to move my mouse to the up-left corner and click every commander in-game until I find the one that I need. By that time my satellite might be destroyed already, so I won't actually see anything.Hotkeys.A game like this, should have a hotkey for everything. They should also be commonly used. Ctrl + A => is Select All, known by everyone. These guys decided to reinvent the wheel, so you get stuff like this:Select All Combat Units: ctrl+shift+f6Select All Combat Units On Screen: shift+f6Remapping them is a pain.Unit pathfinding really needs work. Especially if they plan to scale the game up later on. Currently units act like an angry mob in a London metro (subway) - too much pushing, not enough moving. Tie in the fact that you will be producing hundreds of T1 units per minute (remember anti-air?) in the endgame... You can see where I'm going with that.The ugly (extremely annoying):This game is still in development, but. There be glitches. About an hour into the game you might get a screen completely covered in static - wihout the game crashing. It might or might not happen. Whether it is a memory leak (16 GB of RAM, what?) or something else, I don't know. I do know that it is extremely annoying, since you're closer to the end of a game at that point. Some of the collisions between units and units/buildings will make your eyes bleed. Moving an army through a base is like moving a crowd of bling ghosts (who _try_ to pretend to be people) through a city. No multi-screen support. with a 3-monitor setup, I'd really like to use the other 2, especially since the game encourages keeping tabs on other map parts in little windows it allows to open. Also, mouse is not locked to the screen by default, which means you might lose it, like I did several times.Total: 8.5 out of 10This is a grandchild of Total Annihilation, and if you loved TA, you should totally get this one. ""Celestial movement detected!"" - uh, oh.			"

												Starcraft made by michael bay, planetary annihilation is exacly what the name says, you blow up anythign and everything that is not you.Shame there is little to no viable tactic exept zerg rush the enemy or get a bigger gun them him.The artstyle is very..simple however this its downfall since units dont feel unique, but i guess some compromises had to be made, because if this game had decent graphics you would need a nasa pc to run it, the game despite many optimizations still eats way to much resources.Singleplayer is finally implemented so i defently suggest this to anyone looking for some mindless violence, provided your pc wont melt after a 30 minute match, go for it, i still wish there was a neutral button since i cant recommend this to hardcore RTS players due to lack of tactical elements, but eh if you are in it for the fun of blowing up everything go for it.

												Planetary Annihilation is a great game. After years of playing CnC, i was looking for something new when i could no longer manage to get online on Zero Hour. I soon found PA, a cool RTS on solar-system scale. It is different from most RTS games as you have interplanetary fights and annihilation systems (death-star laser and moon-smashing). The Low-Poly art style is very appealing too.The game still gets quite regular updates, helping to improve the game. Updates usualy contain bug fixes and balancing changes. The game has an interesting single players (i have not played this much), Offline Skirmish against AI with 4 possible difficulties that are actually quite challenging on the higher tiers, and of course a beautiful multiplayer PVP.Team battles, Free For All, 1v1, 5v5, you can do it all. A nice quick battle that is quite close, or just an all out brawl with thousands of units that takes over an hour to complete, where 10 players battle it out. It is just a great experience to play and very refreshing in the RTS genre. Unlike many new RTS-games, PA is very easy to pick up and learn and your HUD is not cluttered by infinite amounts of lines and colors.A definate plus point of the Multiplayer aspect of the game is that you can rejoin a match if you got (unexpectedly) disconnected.For PA, i would give a 9/10.Why no 10/10?Well, PA lacks on a few parts, mainly servers. The servers can be quite unstable and FPS may get low due to this when many units are in the game. At the time of writing this review i also experience a bug where i have no HUD and UI when i play my first game after launching the game (the game responds quick when shutting down with Alt+f4 and starts up quick. It also let's you rejoin games that you were (unexpectedly) disconnected from, so this is not too big of a problem usually).			"

My Review for this gameAt this current stage, I wouldn't recommend this game. I had so many bugs, I could barely get to end game. While the amount of concept done in the game. The bugs became more of a problem then gameplay it self. I run a very well computer, but the loading planets that are small scale is time consuming. Usually the A.I or the Player gets a headstart before I could even load planets. Sometimes in my battles, my screen is blocked out of view. So I can't even see my buildings or units. Fabricater's pathfinding starts derping. Your ""ACU"" Or commander can get stuck in a spot where you can't even go 3 steps. Do I recommend: My answer is, ""Not at this moment, mabye after a few updates, but as of 9/23/14 I would not recommend""The gameplay and concept is good, which I do like. Econemy management is similar to some of my favorite strategy games, ""Total Annihilation"", and ""Supreme Commander"" series. End game gets bit more strategic if planned accordingly. [Unless theres metal planets and Planet smashing]It gets intense as time goes on, I get the feeling after a few matches. All about scouting and other necessary stuff leading to victory.Just not now. Too buggy, too laggy. Should'nt even release at this stage			"

												I want a refund! Total buyer's remorse. I really had hope for this game: the concept seemed awesome, the comic book graphics appealed to me, and who wouldn't want to collapse an entire planet with a rocket powered asteroid? But the designers couldn't hold up their end of the bargain. Gameplay is substandard for the major league game price. Persistent online is a PITA. I can't even enjoy playing the game anymore without getting upset that I was bamboozled. And if the lackluster gameplay wasn't enough they lowered the price and left all the backers and early access buyers hanging. Never should have bought, and I hope others will learn from my mistake.

I can't say that it is optimized, that it is super visually stunning, or that it is my absolute vision for a perfect space game.  But it could be. If it ran perfectly, had some diversity in play styles and unit compositions, and had more interplanetary features (weapons spaceships etc) then I think this would be a better step in the right direction for the space rts sub-genre.

												Amazing. Game.An amazing way to pass the time, Planetary Annihilation is a worthwhile title to pick up, on sale or not. Construct bases with defenses, mass armies and build defences to keep others at bay. This game is one that you will not regret. Great for both singleplayer and multiplayer, Planetary Annihilation has a Galactic War feature which allows the player to wage many battles against AI in a single player venue.++ Pros ++ Amazing game Simple, yet fascinating graphics and animations to match them. Three different technology paths to choose from (Air & Land & Water) Orbital and interplanetary combat and travel add to the already vast combat experience. A good game to play with friends and pass the time in a competition friendly environment.-- Cons -- The differences between Air & Land & Water are menial if you don't bother massing armies and build armageddon weapons first thing Time passes very quickly when playing this game. The game can become repetitive as well as on the edge of straight up frustrating when one of your friends is leaps and bounds ahead of you. The DLC/Expansion is very expensive, and after enough playtime passes the tech will become boring.Definitely worth the buy at current price, and even more worth when on sale. This game will prove worth the money you spend on it and will provide hours of singleplayer and multiplayer gameplay.			"

												I don't normally post reviews but for this game I will make an exception. I had high hopes for this game but the bugs just keep flowing in any time I begin to find myself actually having fun. For one the single player seems like an after thought. The pacing is slow, the combat boring and the AI basically lays down and takes whatever you give it. All of this equals a very shallow experince. 2. The multiplayer....well I cant speak to much on that because the game is so buggy that I am amazed that I can even connect sometimes. But then again its only a matter of time that either the game stops responding at all or worst yet the game breaks and all units just stop. At this point I can not recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Though this game is an interesting jaunt into RTS game play, it doesnt come anywhere close to something like Total Annihilation or the Supreme Commander series, including SupCom2, which is saying a lot.  The galactic war is just annoying.  It was an interesting attempt, but quite frankly who has 12 years to play a campaign of that magnitude even with a relatively small galaxy setup.  And god forbid you die even once, well that 11.9 year campaign you were working on, all that time lost in a void of drama failure wimper.  Is the game fun, well, it has some entertainment value.  I would say minimally, but present.  The robot design is lacking, the planet detail is worthless, the path finding, though better than initial ""launch"", is♥♥♥♥♥♥poor pathetic.  I would not categorize this game as ""launched"" or ""released"" though.  It feels very unfinished and if I were to judge, 30% completed.  I kept asking myself if this game was ever going to truly look better than a game almost a decade older than it.  Quite frankly I feel duped by the purchase, but suppose for say 2.99, I might purchase it.  Is it no wonder that my purchases on games that are supposed ""early release"" has hit an all time low.  It is titles like this one.  Full of promise, but nevertheless under deliver.			"

When I did manage to find it, I found that I have to open it through the actual folder it is located in. The best part?

												Spent an hour trying to get this game to work because you need an account on a website to play. That part was easy. The part I spent an hour on is why, after I logged into the game and linked my Steam with the website account, I couldn't even play it. Looked around and there was little info on it. When I did manage to find it, I found that I have to open it through the actual folder it is located in. The best part? I can't add the actual working game to Steam because it askes if Steam is open when I open the working PA through steam. Worst 6 bucks I have ever spent.			"

												As far as I have played, what I notice is that we don't upgrade buildings like we can do it in eg. C&C...BUT, we still have structures, bigger and better and advanced structures, which can do more than the ones we start off with.We crash planets into other planets, set them on routes... it just goes on...All the negative reviews does not make sense.Personally, I really like this game!

												I agree with alot of people this game is lacking in some areas but they are way over exageratign in my opinion. Granted I wasnt following it forever but this game is ALOT of fun even if it is lacking so i will list out pros and cons.(The pros do outweigh the cons in my opinion)Pros1.Nice graphics (Could use a bit of optimization though using gtx 660)2.Awesome Gameplay 3.Fun multiplayer4.Like how it's played on round playing field5.More that i can't rememberCons1.Campaign map screen has some wierd lag2.The multiplayer creation screen also has some wierd lag3.Add more buildings4.The AI is REALLY had for beginners there needs to be easier options cause im just startign out and the ai has like a whole army already (also the same with my friend and he's really good at rts's)5:there is times when my units will get stuck and cause other people to get stuck and there should be and option to roam the map automaticly (if there is one i can't find it)6.Also more that I can't rememberOverallGreat game would most defently reccomend it esspecialy when it's on sale (When I bought it)Great concept just need more implemeted to itSome wierd lag in certain menusMake multiplayer more customizble like where there ca be 2 people and 10 planets (for a long fun game)  "

												[Please note that im not a newbie, i am a Alpha backer so the ""Time played"" is a little misleading as ive only just converted to steam]Ok decided to overhaul my review. the old format was a bit to serious for a simple steam review. So here is a Reduced and more overall review.This game is rather good. However it is kind of a ""Niche"" Strategy game catering to players that enjoy ultra-massive battles with thousands of units. Where your success mostly depends on having a economy capable of building more weapons of destruction then your enemy while trying not to forget something that can be your undoing. The game uses a specific art-style which (tough minimalistic looking) fits the game pretty well while allowing rendereing of the thousands of entities. The people who made this have shown they knew exactly what they were doing, The Orchestral soundtrack gives the game that ""EPIC BATTLE"" vibe you want to hear when massive armies clash, the AI (made by a former modder known for creating the Sorian AI mod and the AI of supreme commander 2)  is quite intelligent, sometimes making decisions you'd expect from players (like fleeing off a planet when facing a unsurmountable odd if they can) and most suprisingly not subject of the old ""AI is a cheating b***ard"" trope. Gameplay is mostly straightforward with the UI being easy to use and high customization of Keyboard macros. The main gimmick of planetary annihilation is interesting, providing opportunity of high-stake actions, wether using to criple a enemy's economy or denying them possible teritory/Escape possibilities.As for negative aspects:Well its mostly the planets themeselves. it can be very dissorientating and intimiditating to newer players not familiar with it or not experienced with handling more then 1 planet simultanously, this game has a bit of a steep learning curve cause nearly everything you know about strategy games don't apply here. IF you want to get good you gotta be tenacious and keep on learning... Also the microtransaction system allowing you to buy a commander skin kinda sucks since most of them cost 5-10$ EACH... just for a different appearance when you bother looking at your commander.Favorite Moment:When i used Haley thrusters to send my enemy's planet on a collission course with another enemy. 2 commanders, one very big stone!Lastly let me address the 2 elephants that have been staring at me angrilly while typing....RELEASE:This game is not really done. the developers made a collossal mistake by releasing the game prematurely, The AI wasn't done yet, things vital to interplanetary warfare such as the Unit cannon weren't done yet, certain computers still had problems actually starting. it was a mess and PA got to endure low scores which honestly it deserved. This game should currently be in the supposed ""gamma"" version and not actual retail. Many defend that it was partly due to pressure by the community that wanted to play the game and complained that PA was taking longer then expected, but release wasn't the best optionEXPECTATION:Its a kickstarter game. People believed they were pre-ordering a game which promised stuff rather then support a project that wants to achieve goals, PA encountered some things that had to be ammended so the game didn't turn out exactly as they hoped and people yell betrayal. Honestly the game is pretty much as advertised. sure some things had be compromised but that is to be expected. some people will tear this game appart because it didn't comply to their wishes rather then tear because its broken so if you see someone complaining about how Uber betrayed the community and so on please take it with a grain of salt.

The release version has little difference from the beta, and is still missing important features.   No offline mode.  No matchmaking.  No ladders.  Wonky balance.  Poor optimization.Wait a while until more patching happens to make it a finished title, or wait for the 90% steam sale.			"

												I don't normally post reviews but for this game I will make an exception. I had high hopes for this game but the bugs just keep flowing in any time I begin to find myself actually having fun. For one the single player seems like an after thought. The pacing is slow, the combat boring and the AI basically lays down and takes whatever you give it. All of this equals a very shallow experince. 2. The multiplayer....well I cant speak to much on that because the game is so buggy that I am amazed that I can even connect sometimes. But then again its only a matter of time that either the game stops responding at all or worst yet the game breaks and all units just stop. At this point I can not recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Though this game is an interesting jaunt into RTS game play, it doesnt come anywhere close to something like Total Annihilation or the Supreme Commander series, including SupCom2, which is saying a lot.  The galactic war is just annoying.  It was an interesting attempt, but quite frankly who has 12 years to play a campaign of that magnitude even with a relatively small galaxy setup.  And god forbid you die even once, well that 11.9 year campaign you were working on, all that time lost in a void of drama failure wimper.  Is the game fun, well, it has some entertainment value.  I would say minimally, but present.  The robot design is lacking, the planet detail is worthless, the path finding, though better than initial ""launch"", is♥♥♥♥♥♥poor pathetic.  I would not categorize this game as ""launched"" or ""released"" though.  It feels very unfinished and if I were to judge, 30% completed.  I kept asking myself if this game was ever going to truly look better than a game almost a decade older than it.  Quite frankly I feel duped by the purchase, but suppose for say 2.99, I might purchase it.  Is it no wonder that my purchases on games that are supposed ""early release"" has hit an all time low.  It is titles like this one.  Full of promise, but nevertheless under deliver.			"

Just to make this perfectly clear Planetary Annihilation Titans is the exact same game but with more to it, and if you have Planetary Annihilation you Cannot play Planetary Annihilation Titans you have to buy it separately. By making these two separate games they also divided the community even further. By coming out with this game they also cheated and scanned their Kickstarter backers and everyone that that back them before the game officially came out.			"

												Incredible game! One of the best (if not the best) RTS games I've ever played. Crushing my friends and then getting beaten just as handedly shows the diversity in strategy in a massive scale RTS. Playing it is as much fun for RTS lovers as AoE2 was in its day, and the custom planets and solar systems give the player was to create their own battles. If you liked RTS games in the past, this one is a must. By far the greatest RTS since AoE and maybe even better.			"

												Contrary to the popular bashing i feel this game has alot to offer to veteran RTS gamers and newcomers alike. PA breaks all the rules for conventional play including the commander win condition, the spherical maps in multi planet systems. The complete lack of unit cap or finite resourse systems means you can pull off some real crazy stuff. The fact that there is only one race means you dont need to learn all the units and their counters to be able to play and all of this adds up to a phenominal game that is certainly worth picking up and with its frequent sales theres no reason not to.PA has had a small esports team going for months now and has an official ranked system for those more competative players. Custom maps and games are also completly open, want to have a 10 man free for all in a replica of our own system? Go for it.Yes this game has had problems, but i dont think that the ""Helpful"" section of reviews big long line of red thumbs really applies to the current build and certainly dosnt reflect the game itself in its current state. Unit changes happen from time to time and a new building is being added soon and all this may change the game for the better yet again.In short, dont let the ""Helpful"" tab get you down, personally i cant reccomend this game enough.

												While this game is not complete, and is in fact still being updated, everything I have seen so far indicates that Uber plans to keep supporting and updating this game until it is the gold standard of RTS games. The current game is very fun, but don't expect it to run perfectly. Also, the game will eat up resources. When it says 6 gigs of RAM needed, it means 6 gigs of RAM needed.			"

												I've been a big fan of Total Annihilation, Supreme Commander, but this one is a bit short. I don't have a problem with the art style, or the core of the game itself, but the tech tree is a serious flaw in this game. The single player campain relies on luck rather than strategy to advance your tech tree, as each planet gives a random tech when conqured. Given the limited tech slots you have at the beginning, it's easy to be stuck passing on tech you can use, simply due to being out of space, only later to finally find the elusive tech expansions long after they're useful. If they manage to take the luck factor out somehow, and provide a reall benefit to successful tactics, I might recommend it. Until then, I have to say no. You're better off picking Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander Forged Alliance for your RTS itch.			"

												Instant action the moment you press go to war. A good challenge, no tips every five secconds, battling other armies on planet then sending your forces to other planets via teleportation is sweet and the campaing needs a little bit more content.None the less, the game looks amazing and plays well, i only wish more of my friends had this so i could annihilate them too.

												Planetary Annihilation if finally starting to live up to its potential!I've been closely following this game being developed since the end of their successful kickstarter, and whilebeing deeply disappointed in the direction the development went, Uber (the developer) have recently started to redeem themselves.They got rid of their annoying community manager who did anything but interact with the community and hired a new production director. Ever since we have been getting a lot of information on planned features and ongoing development.They even started listening to feedback again and incorporated much of the stuff the community wanted into the game.We have seen a major patch introducing the unit cannon and many smaller ones since the release of this game in September 2014. At the point of writing the game is still in development, although it has been tagged 'released'.The game itself is a very unique follow up to Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander, which were very popular RTS games of their times. It features combat on multiple spherical battlefields, with a focus on large armies and strategic battles, rather than small tactical ones. You control an army of robots, tanks, planes/gunships, battleships and orbital sattelites, at the head of it all being your commander, which is equivalent to the king in chess - if he dies you lose.The trick to the large scale gameplay and big armies is that you never run out of ressources. The game features a streaming economy, where each metal point on the planet you control increases the speed your metal storage is being refilled. You don't pay for your units up-front, but the metal cost is being drained as their are built.Although the planetary battlefields are a littleconfusing at first, they introduce very unique gameplay possibilities.The units seem to be strongly inspired by the WW2 era, but there are some exceptions (sattelites, suicide spider bots) and unfortunately many of them seem to be a little bland from a design perspective. This is redeemed by the strong modding capabilites and already existing mods out there which introduce new units, game modes, visuals and UI changes. Head over to the Uber forums to find out more about this topic.There are false rumours floating around the net that you need to be always online to play - this is obviously wrong since you switch to offline mode anytime in the settings menu. This will make the actual game simulation run on your pc, which requires a pretty decent machine for bigger games.In conclusion Planetary Annihilation is still not finished, but is improving every day and finally on the right course. For the current price it is an absolute no brainer.			"

												Incredible game! One of the best (if not the best) RTS games I've ever played. Crushing my friends and then getting beaten just as handedly shows the diversity in strategy in a massive scale RTS. Playing it is as much fun for RTS lovers as AoE2 was in its day, and the custom planets and solar systems give the player was to create their own battles. If you liked RTS games in the past, this one is a must. By far the greatest RTS since AoE and maybe even better.			"

												Contrary to the popular bashing i feel this game has alot to offer to veteran RTS gamers and newcomers alike. PA breaks all the rules for conventional play including the commander win condition, the spherical maps in multi planet systems. The complete lack of unit cap or finite resourse systems means you can pull off some real crazy stuff. The fact that there is only one race means you dont need to learn all the units and their counters to be able to play and all of this adds up to a phenominal game that is certainly worth picking up and with its frequent sales theres no reason not to.PA has had a small esports team going for months now and has an official ranked system for those more competative players. Custom maps and games are also completly open, want to have a 10 man free for all in a replica of our own system? Go for it.Yes this game has had problems, but i dont think that the ""Helpful"" section of reviews big long line of red thumbs really applies to the current build and certainly dosnt reflect the game itself in its current state. Unit changes happen from time to time and a new building is being added soon and all this may change the game for the better yet again.In short, dont let the ""Helpful"" tab get you down, personally i cant reccomend this game enough.

								So, downloaded the game that has been in beta for over a year and is now in 'gamma' whatever that is supposed to mean. The full version was supposed to be released in December of 2013, but we're half way into 2014 and it still isn't finished. I have been following the game for some time with great interest and saw that it was finally being sold for a reasonable $40 which was the promised release price. I installed the game and lo and behold the graphics don't work on my system. I saw nothing indicating an issue with my video card and when I look up this issue on the forums and see that it is a known issue and they offer NO SOLUTION. I opened a support ticket and I'm waiting to see what they can do if anything, but if they can't it appears I'm out my $40 as there are no refunds. I feel mislead and I'm very irritated a game I bought in good faith doesn't even work.			"

								This game still needs some work. The feature set is good, but the game lost track of my mouse when I was playing my second map in their Galactic War single player and the only thing I could do was alt-F4 to get out of the game, and I haven't played it since.I was hoping for the Galactic War to be a little more interesting too. It looks like a series of AI skirmishes. I sort of had the idea that it was more of an open world continuous system where you moved from planet to planet or system to system in game with the tools they give you instead of having an abstracted campaign map. Not counting this against it, just giving some description in case anyone else has the same confusion.This is an awesome game, and an awesome idea, but I just don't feel like it's quite ready for primetime yet. With a bit more bug squashing and usability enhancements I think it would be very playable, but as it is I can't really recommend it yet.			"

												Okay, game is no longer in Beta, time to update my review....This is my second favorite RTS of all time. My first favorite won't be created for another 8 years yet (I did say ALL time, not just time up until now!)Massive robots, micromanagment (although possible if you want to) is replaced by macromanagement... quickly and effortlessly being able to manage battlefield sprawling armies....Wait, got to correct myself...... solar-system spanning armies. Effortlessly able to manage solar-system spanning armies. Stuff runs without you having to nitpick every little detail, but you instead focus on your (very) grand strategy. Able to fly from planet to planet, in single player campaign, you can try to conquor a galaxy. Tech trees are replaced by building prerequisites (can't build a space transport without a space dock, can't build a space dock without a dedicated builder, can't build a dedicated builder without a factory for it). This leads to a ""what you see is what you fight"" mentality. You know what your enemies are capable of when you finally can see them, instead of hidden variables and upgrades. Battles can range from small, to massive depending on your map. This has seriously everything I've ever wanted in an RTS (except for one feature, which no RTS has had... hence why I'm still waiting for it).			"

								Only been in since right when Gamma came out, but even in that amount of time this game has changed an improved a lot. The UI Is simple and easy. Still have trouble finding certain units/buildings sometimes, but i blame myself. The Art and effects look even better, and the Planet smashing fantastic(Although recently my past few games have crashed when planet smashing occurs). The battles are just the greatest part of the game.... no... the part where you come up with a plan, and see everything build up from there into an amazing strategy of Victory! The Community is really awesome for this game, and its always a joy to play against people. I can't wait for later and the finale build of the game to come with all it's features. Well worth the money if you love the RTS genre and have played games like TA, Supreme Com. and Supreme Com. 2. Support these amazing developers please and join this amazing community.

												Have been an early backer, backed it within 24 hours of hitting Kickstarter. And I regret it.Despite these devs apparently having quite the repertoire, their failure to listen to the community, them breaking their promises and making weird design and marketing decisions have let this great concept fall into mediocrity.Although the price is very reasonable (much lower than it was for backers; An outright backstab to your most loyal fans), the game has been released too early. It's still filled with bugs/glitches/compatability and connection problems, the content is far from what was promised to be in the full package and the game simply doesn't feel right.I see no reason to recommend it. I suggest you wait a year or don't buy it at all.			"

								This game sucks, here's why!-Note: I'm going to be covering different things in different orders, sorry for not making this look amazing-Okay~ So these guys apparently have been in the RTS biz for atleast a decade, apparently more, I dont know much about total annihilation, but I've played the supcom series, and both games were a ton better than this, without the planets.The idea was certainly good, but they arnt living up to expectations.The whole idea that you can have tons of units on the screen at once is fine, but I dont understand why Supcom 1 could do 2000 units per player years and years ago, but this one has 1000 units for one player and it magically fps drops to like 5 frames a minute.The devs are kinda awful additionally, they're top of the line, and apparently cannot even make this game enjoyable within a year, look at say...Kerbal space program, or minecraft, both games were made on a small budget, and granted dont have the scope of Planetary annihilation, but they also dont have the experience, so why do these guys keep wanting more money, then complain that they dont have enough money, then ALSO say ""Well hey, we're doing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ job, because we're on a tight budget""I also dont understand their time management, it's like they took the idea of Early Access, and decided to abuse the hell out of it, I expect more than a few bug fixes and the addition of a couple of units in 2 months worth of updates, that's pathetic.The game lacks anything that actually makes you WANT to go and make bases on other planets, I play 2 hour games where I'm the only one that dares go to another planet, because there is really no point unless you plan to do economy and manage two+ bases, otherwise, you'll quickly lose your first base, or have the planet raided and easily get killed off.The Dev's sense of humour is quite cruel to the people that backed them, I've been waiting for a unit cannon since beta release, you'd think by then they'd implement that already (Especially since you can make the orbital launcher target other places...It's a small modification of the code to make it launch units) Instead they put fake destroyed unit cannons on maps that say ""Out of order"" and rename the basic tank to ""Unit cannon"" as a joke :lLets talk about galactic war! It's new but...Very unimpressive, It's basically skirmish except with a map, no customisation for your matches, and you get random tech.. I expected raids on planets, huge fortresses waiting for me to capture them, defensive missions where they attack you, they havnt even implemented an infancy stage of that yet! Instead, they just added a map to skirmish and called it THE BIG GALACTIC WAR UPDATE ZOMG!Finally...Units! Units are the most popcorny things ever, I hate them, they dont do anything, they fire 2 shells and die, I like the whole idea of gigantic battles, but it's ♥♥♥♥ing boring to see tons of units just die instantly.Two other things off the top of my head..1. No singleplayer, you play on servers, so consider it Always Online2. Somehow, in the last 3 months that I havnt played it, it's gotten worse? I cant even play the game without it crashing anymore, and I cant at all join friends.Minor edit: When saying FPS drops, I meant the engine, I have no performance issues at all with the game, the engine and/or server cant handle that many units----Update----Friend was like ""Oh it had an update! Try it now!""Okay well, it looks prettier...but my friend and I have spent more than 10 minutes on the new loading screen waiting for a SINGLE planet to load, that apparently also takes up 4gb of RAM, and I'm even more disatisfied, atleast in the last update, I could load, and then it would crash, now it doesnt even load.For the commenter that said ""Oh you cant complain about performance on early access"" Well I'd agree, but this is different for a few reasons:-Deadline was months ago, then they had a lil spastic rant about how they think they should finish it when they want to, instead of rushing it.-They have decades of skill under their belts.-They have STILL forgotton simple things that should've been added or fixed ages ago, that would have fixed a lot of the playability issues (Bigger transporters? Or unit cannon? Or anything that means we dont just spam bots at eachother until the game gives up),-And finally, somehow they've gone backwards, as mentioned, in the last few months, one update caused me to crash upon loading a game up, and this update wont even let me load a game up.For those who dont know what I mean by the game gives up, once you have around 2000 units on the screen (Altogether, not per person like other WORKING games), it just starts getting to a point where it takes 15 seconds for the units to move, the FPS is a solid 60+, but the engine itself runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												How can it be that the single-player 'campaign' in this game is no better, and possibly even worse, than Total Annihilation which was released 17 years ago? The TA campaign had different factions with different units, different planets to fight across over several missions, different situations (crack the base, hide in a corner, fight with limited units, etc etc etc), a storyline greater than some pointless text about a progenitor race that goes nowhere, excellent narration, quality, meaningful sounds, unit animations... I could go on. That sentence really wasn't intended to be that long, but there was no end of things that bothered me. The music is good, TA's was great, I'm giving that to TA too. The single player here is:Spawn, build Metal Extractors on the numerous nearby points, churn out tier 1 land units, attack-move around the world, win.I backed this game on kickstarter. I don't begrudge them that small investment, but I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this now if they want a quality single-player experience. The multiplayer that I've seen seems one-dimensional and flawed from what I've seen, too.			"

												It's a great RTS with a steep learning curve and amazing (but shallow) interplanetary warfare. You will find yourself in love with this game if you enjoy massive basebuilding or huge strategic ground battles.+ A minimal selection of units  from Air, Infantry, Armor, Navy, and ""Orbital""+ Unique artstyle featuring meancing overtones+ A mostly friendly community with interesting chat+ Commander and nuclear explosions are very well done in terms of visuals and sound+ Map Creator allows for making of custom battlefields, with features you would never expect from an unmodded RTS+ Allows 5v5 battles, which are rarely avalible in RTS titles but massively fun- Factions have no unique units and Factions can not be selected outside of Galactic War- No unit is amphibius and naval units are very clippy and clunky- Game is still unfinished after release..(And is charging players that already paid for the full game (Titans release)*-  Units outside of the boundaries of a planet can not be controlled and will pathfind poorlyVerdict 8/10  -  There are better RTS but this one has a great deal of features that really make it stand out.

												Was seriously unimpressed with this game. The UI is very poorly done, which hurts because the gameplay is very fast-paced. The info on units and structures is very unclear: I should never have to wonder 'can this unit aim up at air?'. The entire process of building a base and producing units seems needlessly manual and prone to accidentally cancelling your entire order queue. You can't add additional builders to a planned construction unless it's already started being constructed, so you'd better have selected the right number of builders to start and not had your situation change before the queue completes (that's sarcasm, the game moves fast). I love the idea, but I was expecting more from this. So disappointing.			"

												So I was a little bit worried about all rewiews that are not recommending this game, but anyway I managed to buy this game on sale, and I am happily surprised. A lot of people say that this game has a lot of issues, but I dont find them that big. Here is a little list of pros and cons about game:Pros: 1. Really massive, tons of units and structures to build2. Grahics are very nice, cartoony3. ANNAAHAAALAATEEEE !!!!!4. Ground, Air and Orbital Units.5. AI is suprisingly intelligent, does something even on lowest difficulty6. DA NUKEZZZZ.7. Good resource gathering system.Cons:1. HW Requirements, I have pretty average notebook, I5 Dual Core, AMD Radeon 7500 HD, 6GB RAM, but I was able to run game without problems, FPS dropped when there was a lot of units, but still playable.2. Price, I got in on sale, I wouldn't buy it for full price, thats kinda overhit.3. Basically no Storyline, you are stuck with Multiplayer and Skirmish, there is also Galactic War mode, but you will see it's almost the same as skirmish.4. Devs should look more on the engine optimalization.Conclusion:Well, thats simple, If you are fan of really fast and hardcore RTS this is clean choice. Try to get it on sale, it is not worth of full price. 7/10 for me because of price and requirements.Some performance tips:If you are having FPS issues try to download Razer Cortex, which will turn off unnecessary services and therefore reserving more processor time for game. In task manager, assign maximum priority to the Game Process. You might also try to run CCleaner to collect garbage, but it won't help much tough. If you are AMD GPU user like me, definitely set up maximum performance in Catalyst Control Center in exchange for quallity (it wont affect display quality at all, but it will heavily increase your FPS). Finally, configure your AMD Switchable Graphics for the game it might help a bit.			"

Not Recommended: A game buggy from the onset that never got fixed, anything of virtue in Planetary Annihilation is borrowed from its predecessor. Technically deficient, the game frequently crashed to desktop during play, occasionally the UI crashed and necessitated quitting the game via the Task Manager.  The visual design is very cheap mobile game seeming, and the game balance is non-existent, with air and space power utterly dominating. Furthermore, the AI presents very little challenge, consistently getting caught going in circles, sitting right under orbital lasers and dying, and not really presenting any tactics beyond ""send all my units at this guy"".  A definite pass unless it's on an aggressive sale, a game of many broken promises and none delivered ones.Read the full review on Highland Arrow here[www.highlandarrow.com].			"

												Do. Not. Buy.Many gamers supported this project a long time ago, they payed the price of around 60 bucks when PA was in the early-access-phase. The devs grabbed the money, but the support for the game was sloppy all the time.After all, the devs released the same game with a new name, called ""Planetary Annihilation: Titans"" - charging the customer to pay the price of 30 bucks to get it. Or, they are so ""generous"", that they allow you to ""upgrade"" your old version of PA for ""only"" 13,99 to the ""new"" version.This is a big scam.			"

								Robots, Deathstar like Lasers, Nukes, It's like a game of planetary marbles!The game will be released in an hour so I will give new players a brief heads up.Brilliant RTS with some great features, great comunity, simple economy, and great re-playability (in my opinion).Some things are missing though that should be added soon such as offline play and multiplayer Galactic War.Smooth controlls and well optimised with some clever features such as screens within screens so you can watch two sections of the map at one. I think that the orbital stage could do with a bit of camera work because I find it hard zooming to the correct layer to manage orbital activity but that is a small gripe. Overall one of the best rts games I have ever played. (SoASE - R Being the best) and well worth the money!Glad I could help!			"

								Two things before I begin:1.) There are tons of disclaimers and warnings telling everyone that this game is in alpha/beta and is not finished. Quit whining, it's not their fault you're not observant enough.2.) The price is fair, because it's what the backers paid on Kickstarter, except they didn't get the game when they backed it. Just wait if you want it cheaper.Now that's out of the way, Planetary Annihilation is really a blast to play if you like RTS games. Especially Superme Commander. They're very similar, yes, but that's to be expected when they share devs and designers. While they're similar, PA has an extreme scale and sandbox feel with the solar system creator that's not achieved by anything except the likes of Spore. While there are issues with performance and balance, changes are coming! Without those issues, you have a fun game to play with friends (a lot of friends... up to 40 players) and share a team.			"

								This game is great!! You don't play on rectangular maps. Your armys rolls over planets - so you can attack from any side: directly from the front, behind or even from the orbit. The managment of your units is simple and well-suited for such huge battles.The best thing is: if it is too hot for you on the starting planet, just travel to the next one, build your base there and while they are still searching for your commander you can overrun his one with your secretly build army through a teleporter. If this no option - throw a planet on them and annihilate his hole army within seconds! ;)			"

												Considering the grand promises that were made, and the rather mad price this title started at in the early stages. PA is nothing more than another bland RTS, this time with a generic Sci-fi setting and absolutley nothing as generous as a plot.The UI is a nightmare, and not at all suited for managing the masses of rather boring units the game requires you to control. The aim of the game seems to be a race to see who can zerg rush who first.Really nothing special, the resources  management feels like a cheaper version of the one used in the earlier ""Warhammer: Dawn of War"" games, and the gameplay itself feels like a shiney version of old school ""Command and Conquer"".

								It's a RTS and here are the issues because of it being a RTS I've noticed. (This is only around 3-4 played games but these won't change)- No Camera Panning (Yes there is a attemped version of it in-game but its really derpy)- No Tutorials (You're learning from scratch... It'd be helpful if they even add a basic unit displayer about what can do what but nope)- Laggy controls make it feel like you playing with 250 ingame Ping- Multiplayer seems dead for now (There was only approx 20 games being played when I checked during a hour of playing)- UI for units needs ALOT of work, even the building UI feels bad- Needs heavy optimization, playing on UBER graphics preset starts to cause noticable lag once your past 800 unit battlesWith all that being said, I'm assuming sometime this summer most of these bugs will be fixed and will make it a enjoyable game, if you're looking for some good things about this game here you go;- Correct idea for PvP- No Unit Cap- Unique Graphics Style (Minimalistic to help prevent lag from 500+ unit battles but still looks good)- Soundtrack is the best thing about this game so far- You can blow up ENTIRE PLANETS			"

I don't say this lightly as I thought Uber wouldn't be like Hi-Rez or Double Fine and skip out on development. Boy was I wrong!Planetary Annihilation, while in a state of full release, still feels like an early access game.  For example, It took them MONTHS to put in a simple offline mode! It's still missing ALOT of things. It feels like they had a good concept and simply gave up on it.  There are massive balancing issues even with the AI. I played this during Galactic Conquest update and uninstalled it after nearly 3 hours of disconnects from AI skirmishes and just flat out bored.  What are the promises right now? ""Oh yeah, We're still here. We're still working on it. We're not planning a failure of a kickstarter for a new RTS no no!"" That latter part came true by the way.  So this game sits in my library. One more wasted purchase next to Postal 3 and Miner Wars. Yep.			"

												I don't know why this game has ""mixed"" reviews. It's a quite good and fun rts game with some interesting campaign features. For instance, you only have so many ""upgrade"" slots for improved tech, so you have to pick whether you like fighting with mechs or airplanes, artillery or spaceships... etc. The branching mission structure of the campaign mode gives some choice, but I think the most interesting feature of the campaign is permadeath. That is, when you lose... that's it! It's harsh, but also a nice extra challenge. Are there things they could have done better? absolutely. AI could be better, the campaign could have more story and could use more meaninful choices. I haven't played multiplayer, but I feel like it would be difficult to balance to make this a really competitive rts game. Fun with your friends? Sure. It's probably not the next Starcraft.			"

There is no real tutorial, there are no factions, the unit designs are all minimalistic, and everythign can be destroyed in one burst after some buildup.

												I wait till games are released generally before reviewing them and was quite surprised when Planetary Annihilation came into official launch out of nowhere.   No big patches, no major announcements of any features being added.    Nothing.  This is literally the same game that was in beta just yesterday, with no change.As it stands, there is 1 faction.  Yes, One.    Supreme Commander: FA (A comparable RTS game) had 4 factions, each of them unique in art style and in unit stats.    There was a much larger variety of units and buildings available in SupCom as well, barring of course the space units that were added in PA.    The UI is a terrible attempt at making a slick and non-intrusive UI, and instead serves to provide minimal to no information as to what each button actually does in it.    The Gameplay itself is nothing spectacular, being not too dissimillar to SupCom in nature, though seemingly simplified, with many features that existed in SupCom, including the Adjacency bonuses for placing economic buildings near other structures, being removed.With a higher cost than SupCom:FA, graphics that aren't objectively superior (I personally prefer SupCom's graphic style more than PA's), an ingame DLC store for cosmetics, and similar gameplay - what purpose is there to someone buying this over SupCom:FA?

												it's ok but needs help from devteam. there are systemic design problems among them:late game unassaultability of planets due to no real assault units, or one way teleportersthis means that any game with moderately skilled players turns into a stalemate where no one can kill each other besides with stand off weapons like the metal planet megalaser or a reorbited rock; still, if you don't have those two things you're boned. they will always have more units on planet than you will, and there is no way to effectively create a beachhead that won't be immediately slaughteredno experimentals (regardless of what uber says, these are necessary; in particular: unit cannon, space fortress, one way superteleporter. this would improve the game immensely.)orbital: kind of a cool idea, but effectively it's just airplanes with a slightly different look shooting at each other; when they said on the pitch that there would be orbital units i expected space warships, solar megalasers, etc etc. what we got were ""boring space to ground weapon"" ""transport"" and ""dinky little space fighter"" for civilizations at the end of the tech tree, what's capable of being built in orbit is PATHETIC. you can also not freemove in space, making it pretty bad for anything but ""i'm going to put these units in orbit so i can't be assaulted teehee"" actually making the lategame WORSE.radar is bad; it's incredibly simplified from FA. there are no stealth units ? i mean, why? stealth units were cool as hell and had a very nice niche. no offline mode (actually a straight lie)no saving (why is it that saving is so ♥♥♥♥ing hard? modern programmers forget how to do it or something? surely it can't be damascus steel-tier difficult?)units are still pretty boring toohonestly the first one is the biggest, and clearly a design flaw. no amount of tactics can win you a fight because the defender has an unestimable advantage because of local superior EVERY TIME. units are so easy to create that any buffoon can have enough radars and bombers to instantly end any planetary assault. you won't ever manage to create a gateway and bridge in enough units to win the fight, so why even bother fighting? the game's OK, but honestly it still feels like alpha. not all of the features they even said were going to be in are in for ♥♥♥♥'s sake. several design problems STILL REMAIN, as pointed out by pretty much anyone with a clue for PA's entire development process, and yet it's ""released"" now. humbug.

												RTS game.Poor to non-existant tutorial. Game mechanics are not explained well. Cannot find hotkey instructions / hot keys for groups.The resource collection system is not explained at all. There is no discussion on population caps, resource gathering and collection. The game devolves into a rush for resource nodes in the beginning and then being able to out produce the other player. The AI is unforgiving in the first mission I played. While still trying to understand the mechanics of the game I am also having to deal with complete army production, resource management, pacing, etc. Not a fun experience when the AI obviously understands how everything works and I am floundering around.

												Why read this review?Have you played Supreme Commander 2?Did you like SupCom2?If so this game will defiantly grab you'r attention.To me this game was always on my whishlist but now i have gotten it...This game is beautiful, fast pace, many units, buildings, randomly generated battles and universes.The campaign alone is just amazing. Randomly generated galaxies you fight through until you'r technology gets better and better. A vast amount of different battles you encounter along with the boss map (as i call it) where it's just you (Maybe with an Ai, if found) and you face off about 5 different commanders in one planet! Its freaking insane! You have to control the ground from: Tanks, bots, aircrafts and boats and then of all things you have space to protect from invasion.If getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by many robots sounds like fun, then most certainly get this game.Pure amazing and also multiplayer is fun (Lots of good players out there though)My review summaryLove it! amazing stratergy game. 9/10 (Would like if there was a reserch tree or something) "

												If you think that the ""Mostly Positive"" User Reviews at the top is a good indication that this game is good, do not buy into the trap. Because it is far from Positive. I don't think I have to state what all kinds of wrong is with this game, and the devs who made it, but there's a buttload of thumbs down reviews that should give you an idea of why YOU SHOULD NOT BUY THIS GAME! At least not at the moment.Keep your money. Trust me, this game is far from finished. If you end up buying it now, you're most likely going to play it for a while, then realize that it's full of rough edges, and then decide that you'll want to play it ""someday when the devs HOPEFULLY finishes it"". And then you'll end leaving this game to gather dust in your library until your wishes are fulfilled.You have been warned.			"

												Lets just say I sold an unusual hat to but this hypebeast for $90. I had no regrets about this and defended the game during its development as I looked forward to the final product.Needless to say when I logged on to steam onday and saw the game had been ""Released"" I was very angry.0.1/10 for a good idea. Devs are money grubbing jews and even had the ♥♥♥♥ing nerve to post the kickstarter for their next ""Project"" on the news feed of this half developed filth.Strongly do not reccomend stay away at all costs.

												Edit: Uber Entertaintment has gone ahead and pushed it's limits to become even more of a bunch of Top-rated #ssholes. They decided to release the FIXED version of the game as a stand-alone game, and telling the players who have the original that they only have to pay 13€ to enjoy it. No. That's just wrong. Fixes should NEVER be done like this. They should be FREE. We PAID for a game that never got finished, AND NOW THEY EXPECT US TO PAY MORE FOR THE FIXED VERSION!?Sorry, but I'm done. Uber Entertaintment, you're now officially worse than EA. And I hope I NEVER have to see any of your games EVER again.Damn. This is what I get for only reading the text on the Store that said ""Reviews of this game are mostly possitive"". Should have gone below and read them.I watched this game when it was a Kickstarter proyect, and even though I didn't donate crap (was spending my money on medicine and♥♥♥♥♥♥, I tried to follow it. Shortly enough it hit Steam with the Early Access program. The thing is, I couldn't follow the game much there because for some reason, they decided to put the game in the Early Access with a pricetag of 90€. Yeah, you heard me right, 90. Maybe it was so people wouldn't buy it just to play it, and only to help it grow, BUT COME ON, THEY EXPECT ME TO PAY 90€ TO BETA-TEST AN ALPHA!? Remember when Beta-testing was a job and people actually got paid for it? Yeah, screw that right? Lucky enough, they dropped the price when it reached Beta to 60€, and 30€ in the final release, but at that point I just forgot about the game, until a day or two ago, when a Sale dropped the price to pretty much 5€. I watched the trailer again, saw the game had ""Mostly possitive Reviews"", and decided to use the spare money I had on my Steam account to buy it. What happend, then?The game is not finished. Not by a long shot. The f#ck happend here!? It looked EXACTLY as it looked in Alpha, BUT IT TURNS OUT IT LOOKS WORSE, since the polygons and stuff has been downgraded so most PC's can play it. And that's nice, but here I am with my Back-up computer and I can't barely play it. And let me remind you, this computer can play Skyrim filled with mods at stable 30 frames on Medium settings, but it takes arround 2 minutes for a match to load, and afterwards everything looks bland, lifeless and just ugly.The singleplayer mode that, for what I've read, it was added recently is called Galaxy Wars, or something like that. Tried it for a while, want to know what it is? It's literally a dumb map to pick up fight after fight with the same bots. Is there anything different? Yeah, your tecnology isn't there, how do you get more powerful stuff? Make investigations, maybe? NO, YOU GET TECNOLOGY BY SEARCHING INTO OTHER PLANETS. Yeah, THE SAME PLANETS THAT COULD ALSO HAVE ENEMIES. So yeah, I ended up being forced to fight an AI who has flying units and sh#t when I can only build tier 1 stuff. I got blown up to pieces in 20 minutes. How is that even fair? I would have tried it on a lower difficulty until I learned how to play properly, but the lower difficulty is normal, so yeah... And that's another thing:No tutorial. I mean, it's not really THAT needed, but the guys who made this game find that a good tutorial is just a page with a few random tips and Gifs that barely resemble what you should do. Nice. You know you're playing a big piece of crap when you're forced to look for a tutorial in the Internet, because the game lacks anything close to that. The game also has microtransactions. A Strategy game with microtransactions. Are you f#cking kidding me, right? Well, aparently not, these guys decided it was ""SMART"" to put a store where you can buy new big robots. Funny thing is, that only changes the model. Let me ask, WHAT'S THE POINT!?I was giving up on this game, but I decided it to give it another change, play a bot-match instead of trying that HORRIBLE Galaxy War crap. The match was actually starting to be a bit entertaining when the planet blew up. Yeah. That just happend. I'm not sure why it happend, but aparently everyone lost. The match had 2 AI's beside me, only 1 planet and one moon. For what I understand, the AI decided to smash the moon on the planet or some crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ and made everyone blow up into Oblivion. Maybe the AI is unfinished too? Who knows, maybe it was embarrased of the game and decided to commit sudoku, for what I care.Want to know the best about this Planetary Annihilation failure? The guys who made it decided to start a new Kickstarter about a new game, instead of fixing this game. And the fans went there and managed to make them cancel it. These guys deserve no respect. They have violated the laws of Kickstarter by releasing an unfinished game and then stoping to work on it. Not only you should stay away from it, but you should also spread the word, NOONE should buy it, and if possible, Valve should take it away from the stores. This Indie company has managed to become as low and pathetic as Ubisoft, Activision, Sega and EA. And that's no easy achievement, I hope you guys get an anal evacuation and enjoy the money you guys stole from backers on Kickstarter and people who where willing to play 90€ to support and beta-test the game. Why I'm I being so rude? Well, I'm usually calm about stuff, but I also usually say that ""If you expect others to respect you, you should respect others first"". Did these guys do it? They did NOT respect the guys who funded their stuff, thus deserve it NOT.I just hope they would at least give refunds, I rather buy Ride to Hell Retribution than this now that I know about it, but I might as well play it a bit more...

												I didn't personally enjoy the game:tl;drThis is a fast-paced mass unit RTS title that is still in Beta despite claims otherwise. It has an intrusive DRM, demands high user input, and is lacking a strong single player or tactical options. Do not buy this in its current state, but do follow it as it has the potential to be something great.The single player is lacking in depth or replayability. Play it once and you've seen all it has to offer.The unit design is lacking, as most are interchangeable. Ground and air units largely don't offer strong advantages or disadvantages. Navy units are practically useless. And your options for space units are very limited, as is their ability to move between planets.Tactics are lacking, the seemingly only military tactic is zerg. Any tactical thought is put into economy and construction, but that just seems to be more of a test of your ability to input commands.User input demand is high, this is easily more demanding than Starcraft in that regard. If you enjoy a medium or slow paced game, then run for the hills.This game is still very much in Beta, despite claiming to have left it. Things are un-optimised, art isn't where the devs said it would be. There's also clearly more work that could be put into other areas.The network monitoring they ran during Beta, and claimed would be removed at launch, still lives. It acts as a restrictive DRM on par with Sim City's recent debacle.Combat grows stale very quickly: maps are all similar, most units are interchangeable, most tactics are just directing a zerg. "

								Planetary Annihilation is an absolutely awesome RTS game. It's tons of fun, even though it's in beta. With the ability towage war across an entire solar system, Planetary Annihilation is going to be genre changing.Similar in style to Supreme Commander and Total Annihilation, Planetary Annihilation takes RTS games to the next level with massive scale gameplay never before seen in any RTS game.New features are being added on a regular basis as we get closer and closer to release and performance and stability is improving in leaps and bounds.

												I can't recommend this game at all, when I first saw this game I thought that this would be a much better version of SupCom and sadly I was mistaken. I quickly found there to be a severe lack of variaty in units, the single player experience is just skirmish or a galactic domination which is esentually a series of skirmishes with more restrictions on what you can delpoy. Units feel slow to move and the controls make viewing the field difficult.Another frustration is that the price of the game actually dropped since early access leaving the supporters of the game feeling cheated. Early access also promised unique commander skins that have sadly not been provided but instead dlc has been added first day for said skins, more skins are available in game to be purchased...This game is just not at a stage to be beta worthy, let alone for offical launch.

Early Access Review
								To be perfectly honest, I didn't have high hopes for this game in the beginning. I saw when it was around $80 in alpha-stage, and I told myself, ""No way. There's no way I'd spend 80 bucks on a steam game, RTS or not.""I finally talked myself into getting it when I saw that it was $40 during the christmas winter sale. I take back any doubts I had about this fantastic RTS. This is the largest-scale RTS I've ever seen in my entire life. Anyone that's a starcraft fan and LOVES macro builds, this is for you. It's got a large selection of units and structures, all with pros and cons. You start out with an entire planet to explore and dominate. When you get tired of that? Build better technology and move to another planet. It's crazy how big the scale of the playable maps actually are.I spent about 2 hours just playing AI to get a feel for the game and it's the most fun I've had with an RTS to date.$60 or not, it's worth the purchase. If I had known it was this good during alpha, I still would've bought it.P.S. It's also a good way to test out your gaming rig when you set it to all maximum settings.			"

												Game has been patched up really good last patch. There are still some things that could be better (2 planets with the same size that collide has no explosion animation) but its not gamebreaking or anything.Its definately worth the 28 euro's in my opinion. I paid 45 for it and I've never regretted it. Game is hard to learn (though if you compare it to starcraft then its really easy) but there are enough ways to learn it properly. You can train against AI with galactic war which is pretty good. AI can be really tough from time to time. Multiplayer can be fun but frustrating too. Its all about your team mates. You can learn the game by checking replays with chronocam and see what your opponent did good and you did wrong. You can even replay the same match if it was played against an AI! Neat stuffThe standard maps can get boring after awhile though. Thankfully you can get custom maps by download mappacks with the planetary annihilation mod manager which makes it even more fun. unfortunately something like that isn't yet in the game (a mod marketplace or something where you can share your maps). Or you can make your own which is pretty easy too. Your choice.This truly is a next gen RTS. Maybe not yet gameplay wise but the scaling performance and speed is impressive. Especially when you know it supports linux and OSX too! There isn't a better feeling then rampaging through someones base with a massive army, believe me I've done it many times. Same goes for smashing or lazering your opponent or nuking the whole planet clean.I don't recommend buying this game if you have less then 6 gigs of ram or a crappy internet connection (less then 10mbit download) because it needs both. don't get me wrong, singleplayer is fun but the multiplayer is where the game shines very strong. Add people you like to play with to your friendslist and get some teamgames going! You'll easily get notorious with a team.Also if you don't know how to update your graphics drivers or don't want to figure out how then don't buy it either. This game needs the latest and greatest GPU drivers to give you the gaming experience you expect. (it crashes if you get out of ram or don't have the latest gpu drivers installed)Never liked supcom. Was wayy too slow for me. PA is more TA like gameplay wise. I like it. The game has so much fun things to offer.If you like RTS then you should add this one to the collection. Developers are pretty active with developing too. Balance changes are still happening.			"

												I heartily recommend this game to everyone who like RTS on an Epic scale. Where you are not limited by artificial unit caps, or building limits, or finite resources.This game is all about area control on a truly intergalactic level. You can build truly giant armies of robots, vehicles, aircraft and orbital weaponry, and use teleporters to send those to invade other planets. Pummel the enemy into submission with ortbital deatlasers. Blanket a hostile moon under a carpet of nukes with the click of a button. Use moons as weapons by crashing them on top of the enemy commander. Hell this game lets you create deathstars for the ultimate carnage.If you like Total Annihilation and/or Supreme Commander (the original one and Forged alliance), then this game is definitely for you, because it is those games, but even greater!

It's everything you would expect from a massive '90s RTS set in space, with land, naval, and air combat, epic artillery strikes, interplanetary warfare, and most importantly planets being used as kinetic weapons.

												Games pretty good, however the latest addition to PA, Titans is a significant improvement to the game. Unfortunately this is being sold as an expansion rather than an update. Which is leaving a pretty sour taste in the community. The added items are more units, higher tier units which could be classed as an expansion, however some of the other expanded items such as a full tutorial would seem more like updates for the original kickstarter backed game. So the backlash is partially justified. I can't honesty recommend this game as a finished product as it just isn't. PA:Titans adds the 3rd technology tier of super units, something that was already present in the previous games (Supreme Commander) before it. By all means get PA, but expect that you will be required to also purchase the Titans update/expansion to play the full game.			"

												Finish the game and maybe it will be a good game, also on another note what was with you releasing the titans expansion as a VERY expensive seperate game which i though was going to be added to the main game. I would also like to add the game is unplayable, it lags and crashed on everything. me and my friend tried loading a private session and after 4 goes i successfully loaded into a lobby, but my friend couldn't even press the button.DREADFULL			"

												The developers overpromised and underdelivered by a large extent.It's too late for me to refund this purchase because I waited in good faith for this game to meet the promises and expectations fueled by official announcements. So if you're reading this and haven't bought the game yet: Stay away and take a look at the stand-alone expansion instead that was created in place of finishing this game.			"

												Game is a lot like Empire Earth. It is a really cool inter planetary Real Time Strategy game with a lot of strategy possibilities! It is really fun to play and it is definitly worth it!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: You might say i shouldn't be reviewing the game like this because of the time played, but it's just impossible to enjoy. Reading all the reviews I've realised how much Uber has dissapointed the people. Now I don't really care about their Kickstarter being false and all that because I didn't Kickstart it. But I can say this: The game has huge potential and is really cool, but for beginners its just impossible to do any learning about it because the AI is way too hard to play against, and so are players. Graphics dissapointed me and developers released this game before adding much. I bought this expecting there would be more features ready. Guess I can keep waiting...			"

												I had so much hope for this game. I spent countless hours on Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander 2, which were both sudo prequels. I purchased Planetary Annihilation while it was in beta to support the company even though it wasn't a finished game. The game was good for a beta and I was satisfied with the development so I put this guy on the back-burner and waited for the full release... which finally came in the form of a DLC package.I have nothing against DLC for a good game, but Planetary Annihilation wasn't even finished before they asked for more money.

								(I understand it is still in Beta)There are some issues with this game. For example, as of now you cannot choose to spawn on a planet seperate from the AI, if you are playing solo, and a VERY aggravating issue is that you only get around 5 minutes to build anything, then an armada comes roaring in and destroys at the least half your base, and if you're unlucky wipes you off the map.But, this game has much potential, good grahics, smooth animation, and is overall a very well done RTS game that this fan of Total War games enjoys. Sending hundreds, if not thousands of units to invade and conquer planets? Heck yea, count me in!			"

								This game is definately a work in progress.  I appreciate the work that they have done here.  I am a huge fan of SupCom, which this plays very similar to.  I have a 3 monitor setup which this works with without a problem (eyefinity, 7850).  The game gets a little rough for me to play at times though it may be due to my C2D processor (upgrading soon).    Pros:  This game is very much like a larger SupCom.  If you enjoyed SupCom you will feel right at home here.  Cons:  This is a work in progress.  Not a whole lot of variation between races.  Difficulty when starting is higher than what I was expecting.  Difficult to get off of first planet.  I haven't found a way if there is one to start on a different planet than the enemy.This game has a lot of potential and I look forward to updates that will be coming.			"

								*Just a little note, when I wrote the review I didn't realise it needed an internet connection to work.  Not a problem for me, but if your connection is wobbly you may wish to avoid until they put the offline stuff in*FInally got this game as the price dropped and I love it.  There's a problem with AI path finding that stops me doing anything other than messing around, but as it's still firmly in Beta I'm sure this will get fixed in time.So far I've played a single player game with some bots on sandbox ai, which basically means they don't do anything, leaving you free to mess around.  And mess around you can.  I built a massive army and then started building in space.  After a little confusion with some of the units I ended up with a builder vehicle on the next planet.  Step forward an hour and I had built around 4 engines on my way to flying the planet into the main one.It was at this point I read up about planets and which ones you can move.  Both planets were to big so I slaughtered the computer AI and started again.  This time I started creating my own galaxy and before long had various planets spinning around each other and the sun in the middle.  Starting the game showed my commander and the chaotic orbit of the other planets spinning around mine.Unfortunatly I'd run out of time, but I shall be back to fly my moon into the other planets and seeing what else I can do.  For £20 this game has an insane amount of gameplay, and it should only get better.  Personally I plan to mess around on my own for now and learn the gameplay, then on final release take on other players; I can see the path finding problems ruining proper games right now.  However if you buy this with some friends, there's a whole galaxy of messing around already waiting.			"

												A bit disappointed with this game at first.  I loved supreme commander and I was hoping for an updated take on those games.  I love the resource management and the overall old school feel of this rts.  I was a bit sad at lack of unit variety between opposing teams but I realize now that it really makes the rock paper scissor aspect pop out, if someone is spamming one unit type you immediately know what units to produce to counter.  Neat.  The devs have been making updates, I'm happy to see an offline mode, and the galactic war mode is a nice boon for people who dont play online.  Playing against the Ai can be challenging, however the Ai pathfinding is terrible which takes some fun out of playing offline.  Units seem to get stuck on objects just trying to cross the map.  I thought the online was dead because I saw no games hosted, the problem was on my end with my vpn settings.  If you hate the single player Ai multiplayer is where its at.  I was under the impression that development on this game had stopped but I was wrong.  This game got off to a rocky start but with a few more updates could be amazing.  I would love to see some customization of your army/commander, like colors or emblems.  Also we NEED a save/load feature for games.  But that seems to be coming so, cool.  TLDR; If you loved Supreme Commander and Total Annihilation you'll probably love this.  And if the game keeps getting updated it will be great.  I guess at this point I would recommend it.			"

								In its current pre-release form this game is a jewel. The game is difficult to get used to due to the planetary scale which makes it difficult sometimes to fight multiple enemies at once however, after a few games against the AI (which is incredibly good) the game becomes somewhat easier to play. The only problem I can see in this game is the relatively demanding graphics, older integrated graphics cannot play the game even on low without problems. The game is fairly stable and many promised features have been included making the game enjoyable both to win and lose, after all, what is more fun than watching an entire planet explode?			"

								This game is very good. Even in the beta phase it is relatively bug free and the occasional glitches you see while playing are nowhere near game-breaking. Appropriately balanced (However I believe Orbital Death Ray needs a buff) there is no particular unit to mass that will automatically make you win, however some are notably more cost effective than other. The worlds are cute and look great, though shadow rendering could use a tweak, and are ,as claimed, always different. Note: You might notice I only have like .5 hours played, let me explain why. This could help you save 15$!!!I went to their website and on Ubernet.com (the game creator) you can buy it for 45$ instead of 60 and you get all of the same benefits including orchestral score download and bonus wallpaper and beta access. Same exact thing but not on steam and 15$ less.			"

								Now I'm a huge RTS fan and I love the genre, this game reminds me Supreme Commander. In a good way, I like having the command unit, makes me feel like I'm actually helping my faction. This games selling point is being able to hop over to other celestial bodies on a whim, planet hopping at it's finest. It's crazy entertaining to learn the gimmicks of this game. Plus crashing a moon into another planet is very satisfying with regards to removing your enemy from the equation.			"

								Planetary Annihilation is a RTS. It is a HUGE RTS. You can have 2 battles that can take place on two different planets! And if you don't like a planet (or it just looks at you funny), well just grab A MOON AND SLAM IT INTO THE PLANET. The resource managment system is like puberty, the more you grow the more problems you get. It can make getting into space fairly difficult (which I love), that is if you survive the Grand Strategy Master AI the game throws at you whenever you do offline skirmish. Also you are buying the game in Gamma, which means it is going to crash, a lot. I have given up on playing it till all the bugs are fixed.			"

												When this game functions properly, it's a blast to play.  A planet destroying blast.However, the game suffers from the developers making some poor choices in terms of functionality.  The engine is not optimised very well, and I have no idea what it is about their choice to use Coherent UI, but it does not play nice with many a system configuration.  The result for my setup in particular being the interface actually dragging the whole system to a near unresponsive crawl...  In the MAIN MENU.  In actual gameplay, 3D is smooth in most any instance.  However, a lack of proper distance filtering to clear objects that are far away or too small to be rendered as anything other than single-pixel dots from the actual render process can result in instances of a busy planet in the distance passing across the camera view instantly slowing the frame rate to a slideshow.  That and apparently the engine's lack of optimization also rears its ugly head when attempting to build systems chock full of super planets.  Starting at barely handling one, slowing to a crawl at two, and forget going any higher if you don't want to heat your home in the winter from CPU and GPU cycles alone.The option to build more than at single 1000-size planet is there Uber, you need to fix the engine to ensure more than one planet of this size can work on the average system.  Some of us like absolutely gargantuan maps.And no, gas giants don't count.Overall, the game has so much hype and promise, with a grandiose soundtrack and enjoyable amounts of INSANE overkill, but the game has absolute buzz-kill problems in its core functionality.  Some of them being conceptually simple fixes.  Rendering needs a filter for objects too small to even make pixels out of.  Gigantic planets at a distance, or really, anything not in your central focus needs to have a simplified render layer applied to them, and whatever the heck makes Coherent UI decide it wants 100% of a CPU core to do literally NOTHING with needs to be addressed.If this were a car, it would be like it was sold to you with an engine that runs rough, idles at 4,000 rpm in PARK, and needs a tire rotation after one trip.  That's not professional work, and nobody in their right mind would pay sticker price for such a thing.  Why do so here?As trained engineer and programmer, I can understand the difficulties in hunting down these bugs, but with the release of the Titans addition I discovered just prior to writing this review, I'm appalled that they consider adding what amounts to a few (if giant) units to the game a higher priority than ensuring that existing features work, if not smoothly to the limits of what has been allowed for the player to manipulate, at least to expected levels of what is advertised in the launch and teaser videos.Adding a few units and calling it a 'stand-alone add on' is not going to refresh sales, Uber.  Fixing critical, if spotty game breaking flaws will.  I can see the motivation behind this move, and it is flawed thinking.To the prospective buyer of this product, I will say that there is a good game here, if you don't mind restarting steam in its entirety after a few matches, or watching your computer nearly brick because you TRIED to push the planet creation even slightly.  There is a good game in here.  One that takes everything you've played before in an RTS, and gives you the tools to actually upscale to commanding an army so large you'd swear your PC stepped on an ant hill.  However, don't you dare pay full listed price for it unless there is a community noted improvement in functionality.For now, I have to down-rec.  A game that is not playable 'hassle-free' is not a game I would tell others to spend their money on.  Maybe the combined might of all these downvotes will send a message to Uber [/civ v ai]. "

												DO NOT BUY THIS EDITIONBuy PA: Titans. It's EXACTLY the same with more units, Titans (big units), better orbital combat, better terrain and better balance among other things. Unfortunately if you already have PA you can't get it free even though it doesn't add nearly as much as a proper expansion usually would. They do however offer a £10 upgrade for those who own PA already, so if you enjoy the game go get the upgrade.			"

												When i first bought this game, i had high hopes for it.Now with the announcement of the ""rereleased"" version of this with ""FIVE NEW UNITS"" I feel ripped off by this company.The game is incomplete, and what should have been an add-on, is a standalone ""pay for it all again"" scenario.  no doubt they will leave this incomplete at this point.I wish i could recommend this game as i had in the past (because it had such awesome potential) but getting screwed over by the company is just simply unacceptable, and I will never again purchase a game developed by Uber..

												Brilliant game! Its fun and large, but as many others say, its still incomplete. They released it much sooner than it should have been and now they have released a DLC for a few units. $40 dollars. A few, giant dudes to squash little dudes. Their trailer showed asteroids, and now we get them months after 'release' when the idea seemed solid at the time. Planets are smoother than ice. But it is still incredibly fun and insane with multiplayer games. IF the titans were given to players who had already bought the game before the 15th, I probably wouldnt be writing this. Steam needs to add a mixed option, because as I already said, its fun, but incomplete at release.			"

												Don't purchase this trainwreck. Devs just released a new PA game that just adds more units when it could've been a free update. But let me elaborate a bit more.I purchased this in Early Access, and that's where I played about 86 of my hours. And it was a blast. But right after the game was released, the performance on my PC degraded exponentially. I ran it in Early Access at around 45-60 fps constant on a GTX 560. With that 560, shortly after the game was released, performance began to just die. These problems were never fixed. The game feels incomplete as well, especially now that they're trying to take $40 from us for some new units.I had high hopes for this game, but alas, the Early Access plague strikes again.Don't buy this. Don't buy PA: Titans either. Maybe if Titans goes down to somewhere near $20 I'll try it. But thankfully we have Steam Refunds now, to protect you from this kind of crap.(Yes I'm aware Titans on release day is made about $13 with 66% off. Doesn't change the fact that's going to turn into $40 within a matter of days.)Also, if you didn't notice: This game was released on September 5th, 2014. Today's date is August 18th, 2015. Did you see what it said in the System Requirements? Additional:These specs are still being determined. Additional:These specs are still being determined.

DON'T GIVE THE DEVS YOUR MONEY.EDIT: Apparently Titans is 66% off for people who already OWNED PA from Steam, but free to backers on Kickstarter. Because it's not like Kickstarter backers paid $20 for the same game us Early Access buyers paid $90 for. I'm not saying Kickstarter backers should get the 66% discount while EA backers get it for free, I'm saying that anyone who backed PA early, or even bought PA before Titans was released, should get this ""game"" for free.

								In its current pre-release form this game is a jewel. The game is difficult to get used to due to the planetary scale which makes it difficult sometimes to fight multiple enemies at once however, after a few games against the AI (which is incredibly good) the game becomes somewhat easier to play. The only problem I can see in this game is the relatively demanding graphics, older integrated graphics cannot play the game even on low without problems. The game is fairly stable and many promised features have been included making the game enjoyable both to win and lose, after all, what is more fun than watching an entire planet explode?			"

								This game is very good. Even in the beta phase it is relatively bug free and the occasional glitches you see while playing are nowhere near game-breaking. Appropriately balanced (However I believe Orbital Death Ray needs a buff) there is no particular unit to mass that will automatically make you win, however some are notably more cost effective than other. The worlds are cute and look great, though shadow rendering could use a tweak, and are ,as claimed, always different. Note: You might notice I only have like .5 hours played, let me explain why. This could help you save 15$!!!I went to their website and on Ubernet.com (the game creator) you can buy it for 45$ instead of 60 and you get all of the same benefits including orchestral score download and bonus wallpaper and beta access. Same exact thing but not on steam and 15$ less.			"

You can take control of a solar system and bash planets into eachother. You can launch nukes and control literally thousands of units while all trying to defend your planets.

I was hoping the single player campaign would have more flavour with more than one body to build on in each system (there are some, but too few, that has 3-4 planets/moons).Overall, this is not at all the game we were promised in the original kickstarter promotional trailer. It's a disaster.			"

												No, just no. I was very excited for PA, I thought it to be the Atlantis of RTS in an age where the best ones were forgotten in the seas of time. A game with massive scope (literally) and plenty of hype to go with it too. Then I bought the game. It had no singleplayer, no ability to play offline and oh so full of bugs plenty of which were game-breaking. Now, think of your favourite RTS (Age of Empires, Rise of Nations, BFME, SupCom; [technically what PA was supposed to surpass], whatever floats your boat) they all have one thing in common, which is VARIETY. be it different races, techs or whatever there is always something that makes them unique and encourages different playstyles. None of that in PA.Before you say ""Well that's best for balance you bonehead"" no, no it isn't. There is ONE thing to do in every game( or two), flood the screen with all the units you can and hope your opponent hasn't beaten you to it, or just smash a planet at enemy commander ( I guess that makes two?...  either way, is THAT how many ways to play a strategy game should be?) Example: Playing defensively is not an option AT ALL, you'll be steamrolled so quickly that you'll actually not have the time get angry over it.Example 2: Want to sneak in opponents' base and wreak havoc? What a laughable idea(in this game). Even if you did manage to get in undetected (nigh impossible because of radars and lack of stealth) even an unprotected base will easily churn out a force 5 times the size of yours before you can destroy anything. Sound familliar? No! Because in no other respectable RTS is this the case!!!Moving on, the AI (neither yours or the opponent) doesn't work well at all. Yours are barely capable of handling tasks they are supposed to. Example: You: Alright, go build 5 of these here.AI: Sir yes sir!5 mins later...You: Why isn't anything built??AI: Sir, the space appears to be occupied.You: YOU ARE THE ONES OCCUPYING IT!!!! CAN'T YOU MOVE OUT OF THE WAY AND BUILD?!?!?!AI: ....-Then you move them manually and hope they don't get stuck while building the next one-The only thing your AI opponent will ever do is send wave after wave with each wave being more crowded than the last if you let him have his way. Can't really expect too much though, with things to do being limited as they are.And now, they ""released a new game"", PA: Titans which is regular old PA with give or take 21 more units. Yeah, that's about it. Oh but you can't get those shiny new stuff as DLC or god forbid, A PATCH, you'll have to pay up.Regular price: 40$if you bought PA at any point: 13 something $if you backed the kickstarter: 0$(of course, all prices may or may not be higher of lower depending on your region)Since it's PA + 21 new units the 40$ isn't THAT unreasonable (but you can find more on that in its own store page)But wait, then why is that such a bad thing, you ask? Of course you do, you poor little indulgée of the blissful nectar called ignorance.It's A SEPARATE GAME, meaning multiplayer, the high point of the game, is now impossible between anyone playing this and PA:Titans. ( I blame Scholar of the First Sin for this, but then again, at least THEY added some content to old players through a patch! Also, they didn't remove the original from the steam store, more on which I will write below)AND, as the bleeding icing on this prank-cake they made the original PA unavailable for purchase! You know what this means? I'll tell you what it means, IT MEANS THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A SINGLE NEW PLAYER TO A GAME WHICH IS ALMOST ONLY MULTIPLAYER! It means that if you don't want to shell out some more cash(or credit, or hell, even bitcoin, none of my business how you pay) you might as well Stockholm Syndrome yourself into liking the bots CAUSE THAT'S ALL THE ACTION YOU'LL EVER BE GETTING! (It also means this review is completely pointless and a waste of time, both mine and yours. Not the best idea, in hindsight)tl;dr: Go buy Supcom: FA, almost all of what's good in PA is taken from there anyway. Nighty night.			"

Paying for the TITANS Expansion is not exactly fair for those of us who bought the game. Though we get a Discount, $43 for the Extra content it promises doesn't quite seem worth it.6/10Gameplay is fun, bot's can be a decent challenge, you can build a Death Star, or smash a Planet with another planet.

												With The new titans game being released all I can say is Don’t Buy ether of these games until Uber Gets its act together.Bugs from the early access are still prevalent to the point where it is no longer acceptable after such a long development cycle, I have planes acting like subs going through the ground.I liked this game, and would still play it, however the actions of the developer have now made me doubt any product from them and now, in order to get a simple expansion and maybe bug fixes, I would have to pay £30.00.Just like the kickstarter for Human Resources, Monday night combat and its free to play version, this game is now getting abandoned and the loyalty for this game has been abused, this is why I can no longer recommend this game (and the fact that it’s no longer on sale doesn’t help)Oh but if you have the game, Buy the DLC'S if you want to show Uber your support FOR £26. Thanks Uber, EA would be Proud.Edit: If you buy the DLC and then buy titans, I dont think you get the DLC again.(I need to be fact checked on this, this is why its an edit and not the main body)			"

								By smashing astroids into planets, you can effectively defeat the enemy; however, it can take a long amount of time to get to the point to where you can propel planets, but it is satisfying nonetheless. The combat in the game is very balanced, and the upgrades to the units, though basic, can differ. For example, if a unit is anti-ship and anti-land, it may be just anti-ship in the next tier.			"

								*Just a little note, when I wrote the review I didn't realise it needed an internet connection to work.  Not a problem for me, but if your connection is wobbly you may wish to avoid until they put the offline stuff in*FInally got this game as the price dropped and I love it.  There's a problem with AI path finding that stops me doing anything other than messing around, but as it's still firmly in Beta I'm sure this will get fixed in time.So far I've played a single player game with some bots on sandbox ai, which basically means they don't do anything, leaving you free to mess around.  And mess around you can.  I built a massive army and then started building in space.  After a little confusion with some of the units I ended up with a builder vehicle on the next planet.  Step forward an hour and I had built around 4 engines on my way to flying the planet into the main one.It was at this point I read up about planets and which ones you can move.  Both planets were to big so I slaughtered the computer AI and started again.  This time I started creating my own galaxy and before long had various planets spinning around each other and the sun in the middle.  Starting the game showed my commander and the chaotic orbit of the other planets spinning around mine.Unfortunatly I'd run out of time, but I shall be back to fly my moon into the other planets and seeing what else I can do.  For £20 this game has an insane amount of gameplay, and it should only get better.  Personally I plan to mess around on my own for now and learn the gameplay, then on final release take on other players; I can see the path finding problems ruining proper games right now.  However if you buy this with some friends, there's a whole galaxy of messing around already waiting.			"

								This is an amazing game, and even more so considering it's still an early access title.  Got it during the steam summer sale 2014, 66% off.  Total price was like $16.99.. awesome deal.  Big props to Foss for convincing me to buy it.Pros- Plays like Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander- No unit caps, huge battles- Highly moddable with PA Mod Manager, very easy to use- Soundtrack adds an epic feel to the fights, won't need Foss to play Imperial march outside of the game!Cons- Units get stuck / pathfinding kinda goofy on certain planets- Spherical landscape camera panning is weird, but this could be my personal issue- Planetary explosion was a bit of a letdown, hopefully it improves as the game is updatedBuy it!

								Planetary Annihilation is a RTS. It is a HUGE RTS. You can have 2 battles that can take place on two different planets! And if you don't like a planet (or it just looks at you funny), well just grab A MOON AND SLAM IT INTO THE PLANET. The resource managment system is like puberty, the more you grow the more problems you get. It can make getting into space fairly difficult (which I love), that is if you survive the Grand Strategy Master AI the game throws at you whenever you do offline skirmish. Also you are buying the game in Gamma, which means it is going to crash, a lot. I have given up on playing it till all the bugs are fixed.			"

This games selling point is being able to hop over to other celestial bodies on a whim, planet hopping at it's finest. It's crazy entertaining to learn the gimmicks of this game. Plus crashing a moon into another planet is very satisfying with regards to removing your enemy from the equation.			"

												ok, this is absolutly crazy. i get the need for funding, and i get that they probably wanted to preserve the old game and create a new, better game by releasing titans rather than changing this one. But $40? when i already owned this one? OH BUT WAIT! I GET A DISCOUNT! yea well 66% off isnt anything when from what i can see id just be effectivly adding DLC to this game. and the best part? you want to know the absolute best part? People like me who didnt back the kickstarter and who are only getting 66% off have a time limit to claim thier discounted copy of titans! SERIOUSLY?! if i dont purchase by october i have to pay full price?! what a joke, seems like a big *we need money quick* skeem. they can say what they want they werent looking out for thier community or fan base and in my opinion they screwed up royaly. actually, i wasnt even that upset until i say the price of titans and the limitation on when i could redeem my discounted copy. now im enraged with the whole thing.UPDATE 6-30-16 i was just gifted titans by a good friend of mine and was told that it is now on a discounted price for good for prior PA owners. Not to mention the price has been cut. While the above mentioned still upsets me they have made good progress in redeeming themselves.			"

												This the alpha and was never fully developed.  DO NOT BUY THE TITANS VERSION since you are supporting a system that kicks the people who supported this company in the nads.  This is Planetary Alpha no Annihilation. Uber tried to do another kickstarter for another game and found out that people will not support a company that will lie to everyone's faces.  Support real companies and not money grabbers that don't seem to know anything about making games just ""business"".Some things that I personally didn't like.  No tutorial unless you consider a page with very little information.  YouTube helped but not enough.  Supreme Commander's first stage was a great tutorial and most RTS have great first stages to teach you things you need to know.  I one time was making air to protect my base and every single one after being made vanished.  I had no way of finding them so I just threw up my hands and said I will just play a real game that cared about quality.			"

												Still to this day I love this game, it brings back nostalgic memories of playing the old TA when I was just a wee kid. The game balence has long cycles and the moment it gets stale you can start at modding. The modding community has a good base and a good set of mods that show uber what this game could be. However, that said,  uber continues to lose my faith. Patch after patch the same core issues are there. An example of this is defense is worthless, another style of play(expand and attack) hands down wins you the game. You cannot effectively defend points, its much easier to be on the offense. This creates a large noob trap as a large part of the shiny looking structures are useless(except maybe anchors). Patch after patch nothing is done about this.There a list of numerous issues like defense that just make the game a stale linear meta all the time. At any point of the three years I've owned this game I could log in and play the exact same way and win desipite the fact that numerous balence cycles have happened. From patch to patch nothing really changes except the most explotive stragey gets slightly nerfed and nothing is really brought up to par.Uber refuses to fix core issues within the game and ignores its community, and wonders why their game falls short / has a small dedicated user base. Which is sad because this game has such a potential to shine in the current rts genre. It does so many different things right, yet fails are the core basis of the rts style of gameplay.Ubers solution to the above is to create a DLC. Fine but...The meat and potatoes of the new dlc is a bunch of core missing features to any game or fixes for problematic features to any base game such as: not having a tutorial, ui fixes & better notifications, balence fixes, actually finishing story mode, and a small flush out of the current units. These are all things that we have been asking for ages that should be included in the base game.I can count more mods than I can count fingers that address these issues and actually fix the game for free and would not be surpised to see a TITANS mod come out and spark some large controversy between the modding community and the devs.Lastly, we now have a new dlc listed as a whole new game. I understand why partially, to give new players that buy the dlc the base game as well, however to the existing loyal base this seems like nothing more than another cash grab. You have to buy the game a second time because the dlc is not avalible standalone. You have to REDOWNLOAD THE EXACT SAME GAMEFILES, so effectively having both is nothing more than a waste of space on your hard driveUber has a habbit of doing cash grabs as well. In past when the game was originally 60 dollars or more if you were kickstarter or backer you got the game and then on release they sold it for as low as $10. With nothing more than ""thanks for the money guys"" and ""we will do something for the ealeier purchasers"" type messages. Without actually following through on them. For once they actually did something for the kickstarters(gave it to them free) with this dlc but the backers basically got another slap in the face.Sadly due to the developers track record with this game, I would not recomend it anymore to anyone. Do not buy this version of the game buy titains.Chances are you will most likely have to buy the game all over again the next dlc as well and so on.			"

												Ok so this game used to be awsome it was fun to play but needed some optimization for bigger systems. Then they decided to release a new update!!. Oh wait you have to pay 16$ even when its 60% off, doing this completly ruined the game. I was hoping for updates that would add new units, well I didnt get that I am never paying for this ridiculous expansion/update. I had high hopes for this game this is its downfall, the greed of the company. Anyway atleast I wated until it wasnt 80 dollars so thats good for me. I hope the devs change this or im just done with this game.			"

												This game, although fun for a little while, was not worth the money. It is plagued with issues, and lacks much needed content. And yet now there is an expansion being sold for the same price as the base game containing things that belong in the original game. This is a mockup successor to Total Annihilation.			"

								Totally recomended. There are of course some issues, at least on the Mac OS X version. The gameplay is totally new and different and the possibilities are endless. It however needs a singleplayer mode that allows you to practice and learn how to play. At first it is really hard to play. But once you get the hand of it, it is fun and enjoyable beyond belief. 100% worth it.			"

Today I played the ""Galactic War"" single player mode. It is amazingly fun and addictive. If you enjoyed any of the previous titles. I highly recommend getting this asap. the scope of possibilites for this game are huge and they seem to know it and are constantly pushing it further. GG, see you all in game.			"

								This game has great potential but it is still rough around the edges.  I do recommend this game and I enjoy it very much but I do have to point some things out to potential buyers.  Until the game is released the engine will be run server side.  This means no offline play and no private servers.  This limits everyone to play on ubers servers during alpha/beta/gamma which are less than ideal and succeptable to lag during peak usage.  This limits game scale for a game that advertises massive scale.  Game mode is limited to assissation, funny how annihilation mode is not available yet for a game with annihilation in the title.  Strategy is currently limited to unit spamming and army movement.  Orbital play is completely broken so single planet games are much more fun.  Galactic war is at first pass and the sub commander AI is pitiful.  However the standard multiplayer AI can train pros.Uber does however listen to the community.  You really can get involved in the development of the game by commenting in their forums.  The e-sport participants and organizers are the vocal minority on the forums and Uber does tend to lean their way however.			"

								Pretty fun game, servers cannot handle very large scale events but that looks to change for the future. Wars are quite complex to a point but then the game tends to just drag out. Very cool system designer with alots of customization but you need to keep in mind that the servers cannot handle a full blown solar system with a giant planet that has 30 somethings moons. Besides that short note the game is overall pretty decent at its current state, is it worth $50.00 currently? Hell no but for its potential then yes i reccomend you go and buy this game if you are able to.-Jake			"

								I can't play the game because of the constant stuttering/hitching that occurs the entire time. Every few seconds, everything locks up for about 1-2 seconds. It's impossible to play and extremely frustrating. Fixing this problem would make this an extremely fun game and I can see it's huge potential. I hope the developers are at work on this problem because I've seen plenty of other people complaining about the same issue, and it's a shame to see such an excellent game ruined by such an intrusive bug.

								*Just a little note, when I wrote the review I didn't realise it needed an internet connection to work.  Not a problem for me, but if your connection is wobbly you may wish to avoid until they put the offline stuff in*FInally got this game as the price dropped and I love it.  There's a problem with AI path finding that stops me doing anything other than messing around, but as it's still firmly in Beta I'm sure this will get fixed in time.So far I've played a single player game with some bots on sandbox ai, which basically means they don't do anything, leaving you free to mess around.  And mess around you can.  I built a massive army and then started building in space.  After a little confusion with some of the units I ended up with a builder vehicle on the next planet.  Step forward an hour and I had built around 4 engines on my way to flying the planet into the main one.It was at this point I read up about planets and which ones you can move.  Both planets were to big so I slaughtered the computer AI and started again.  This time I started creating my own galaxy and before long had various planets spinning around each other and the sun in the middle.  Starting the game showed my commander and the chaotic orbit of the other planets spinning around mine.Unfortunatly I'd run out of time, but I shall be back to fly my moon into the other planets and seeing what else I can do.  For £20 this game has an insane amount of gameplay, and it should only get better.  Personally I plan to mess around on my own for now and learn the gameplay, then on final release take on other players; I can see the path finding problems ruining proper games right now.  However if you buy this with some friends, there's a whole galaxy of messing around already waiting.			"

								Well, I must say, I got this game on Steam Summer Sale 2014. And to be honest, I wasn't going to buy it due to the intitial release of a unfinished game for 80 to 90 dollars. I get the whole kickstarter argument, but still, It came across as poor form and so I was hesitant to get this.  However, all that to the side. It's actually an enjoyable game. It may be a little overwhelming at first but it's not overly complicated. I bought it for 16 bucks and it's worth it. After playing, I probably would have paid 20 to 25 for what I am getting out of this game. But let me be clear, this type of game isn't usually the type of game I would play as I am more of an RPG or FPS gamer. However, it has held my interest. Hope this helps you decide your course.			"

This limits game scale for a game that advertises massive scale.  Game mode is limited to assissation, funny how annihilation mode is not available yet for a game with annihilation in the title.  Strategy is currently limited to unit spamming and army movement.  Orbital play is completely broken so single planet games are much more fun.  Galactic war is at first pass and the sub commander AI is pitiful.  However the standard multiplayer AI can train pros.Uber does however listen to the community.  You really can get involved in the development of the game by commenting in their forums.  The e-sport participants and organizers are the vocal minority on the forums and Uber does tend to lean their way however.			"

								i love this game, wether you like RTS and micro-management, big explosions or just flat out destruction, this game is for you, sure this games expensive, but its worth it, this is one of my new favorite games, and with galactic war implementation, theres also single player at a manageable difficulty, this game has tons and tons of content allready, and is adding more, i give it 11/10 and highly reccomend it to anyonequick note, this is 1 game where i cant stress enough to check the specs, as its a waste of money to buy a game this expensive then only be able to run it at 1 fps, or not at all			"

								Pretty fun game, servers cannot handle very large scale events but that looks to change for the future. Wars are quite complex to a point but then the game tends to just drag out. Very cool system designer with alots of customization but you need to keep in mind that the servers cannot handle a full blown solar system with a giant planet that has 30 somethings moons. Besides that short note the game is overall pretty decent at its current state, is it worth $50.00 currently? Hell no but for its potential then yes i reccomend you go and buy this game if you are able to.-Jake			"

								I can't play the game because of the constant stuttering/hitching that occurs the entire time. Every few seconds, everything locks up for about 1-2 seconds. It's impossible to play and extremely frustrating. Fixing this problem would make this an extremely fun game and I can see it's huge potential. I hope the developers are at work on this problem because I've seen plenty of other people complaining about the same issue, and it's a shame to see such an excellent game ruined by such an intrusive bug.

 The good and bad  This review is for the current beta, many things could be changed or added after this review. It was very hard to review this game, Planetary Annihilation  THE GOOD:       This is has everything you would ever want from a space stragety game, you can explore and take over different planets/moons, build vast armies, and defensive towers. You can even build orbital strike cannons, and nuklear missiles.  THE BAD:       Currently (December, 2013) Planetary Annihilation costs $45 American dollars. Which is an outragous amount, It is currently that because it is still in beta, and your paying to build the game, and keep it going. Also the game does lag, im running on a very good gaming computer with 8gigs of RAM and a good graphics card, but the game can lag, and have some connection issues. Im guessing these will be addressed in later patches. VERDICT:       The game is great, its so fun to play and even more fun to play with friends, its all you could ever want from a strategy game. But at the same time is crippled with a very high price tag. I suggest buying it at a later time, (possibly when the full game comes out) when the price is lower.        7/10 "

								Coming from a huge Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 fan, I can say with certainty that even though this game is technically still being made (I'll update this review once it officially launches), that this game is incredibly fun. Simple RTS mechanics let you build up an army of infinite size which you can use to fight AI or friends to the death.Unlike a traditional RTS though, you're not limited to a flat, square map: you have an entire planet at your disposal. Planet biomes are randomly generated and can be customized to your liking as well as entire solar systems. You can even build an orbiter and leave the planet and start constructing your units elsewhere for some interplanetary combat filled with nukes and satellite lasers.The final nail is the ability to turn a small planet into a projectile and hurl it into your enemies base crushing them and a nice chunk of the planet into oblivion. Absolutely a gem RTS, and possibly the birth of a new franchise, that will be played for generations to come.			"

								This is really fun, and seemingly quite hard.  I'll admit I've never been a strong resource-management-game/sim player.  I've been watching the progression of PA development through alpha and beta.  Since they've hit gamma (yeah-- that's a bit of  stretch) and many of the early bugs have been worked out, the game is quite playable.  The devs are also in Kirkland, WA-- a stone throw from me so it's time to support them! The YouTube vids out there are informative as hell.  The AI is insanely good, because it doesn't have to stop and think for a moment.  It's a rush out of the gate to get the proper resources going without any hesitation and in a correct order so that your economy doesn't stall in the beginning at all.  I find I get flustered as things become massive, and while I'm expanding fast-- I'm not taking pot shots at the enemy soon enough and very quickly I'm overwhelmed and stomped into oblivion.  I would love to have a poor-intelligence AI level selection to at least learn the game more and get some understanding at what the various units can do, before a trial-by-fire of the real game.  Still, it's worth the time and energy to play it because I'm having a lot of fun.  Picked it up on a weekend discount, and I'm happy with the $30 purchase-- which makes this one of the costliest game purchases I've made in my sizable collection.			"

												I dont understand your decision to even go with the always on internet connection. I cant even finish a game before I loose connection to your servers and its usually a hour to two hours into the game so I loose all my progress. Games that require internet to play never work out for me. I bought this nice computer that surpasses the reccomemded system requirments just to have a server take it over for me and its not even a good server. Once you get a large army (Which what the developers talk about so much) The game will lagg so much. I advise you to hurry up on the offline mode because I love the game a lot. Its just really annoying to loose connection to the server after I invest 2 hours into one game and it all goes away because the servers cannot handle it or my internet is too slow. I would definitly reccomend the game because it is fun...BUT the servers should never have been put there in the first place which I would have expected gaming companies to learn from the previous games that employed always on internet connections that bombed on launch (And some still stink if you know what game im talking about) Overall I do understand this is a WIP but like I said before the servers should not have been there. I hope you guys get offline mode done soon and to those that havent bought it yet wait for offline mode which is on their to-do list. I also advise you guys to get more servers if you are going to alow 40 player games because me and a AI lagg really bad.ProsSuper FunNice twist on stratagyGreat units Cool mapsAwesome system editor Cons Internet requiredLaggy servers/COnnection to servers lostits a WIP Still recommended though! :)-------That was my old review, the game has long since changed. There is no more required connection to play :)Still, though, it feels like a far cry from what they advertised it to be on the kickstarter page			"

								Be warned this is a BETA version STILL! The game was released over a year ago and it still has issues, see below:-Units will get stuck behind and next to buildings, with no way to get them free-Units will forget build orders and/or only build half of what you tell them-Units will forget patrol or attack orders and just stop at random points on the map-If a Builder is attempting to build something, and another unit is in it's way it will not inform you of the issue, nor is the unit which is in the way smart enough to move out of the way to allow the construction to proceed-Has trouble connecting to the sever, which is needed for single player games as well, often times have to save and leave and come back to continue with a battleI am not sure why after more than a year the game still behaves like a Beta. I am even more confused after playing it, since most of these issues were addressed and correct in the later Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander 2. Surely Planetary Annihilation can tailor those fixes for their use, or at least use them as a reference point. I hope that at some point, maybe within the NEXT year, they correct these issues. Despite all these issues, I do recommend the game, it is a fun RTS with a mix of many elements from various industry leading games, such as the Supreme Commander I previously mentioned. It also offers many multiplayer and co-op options. This games will certainly entertain you for hours,  while it both frustrates and thrills you.My final recommendation is to buy this game ONLY if on sale. In its current state it is NOT worth the current list price of $49.99. I bought it during the Steam Summer Sale and got it 66% off, or $16.99. If you can by for 50% or more off, I say go for it.

								Planetary Annihilation is definitely an evolution from from the normal RTS games like Starcraft. Not being confined to a single playing field expands the scope of play for a more complex level of RTS, not really seen before. Not to mention the very different ways in which one can getto play; Ground, Air, Orbital, etc., which kinda makes it reminiscent of FTL. Looking forward to playing a good amount more and really getting into it.			"

								By smashing astroids into planets, you can effectively defeat the enemy; however, it can take a long amount of time to get to the point to where you can propel planets, but it is satisfying nonetheless. The combat in the game is very balanced, and the upgrades to the units, though basic, can differ. For example, if a unit is anti-ship and anti-land, it may be just anti-ship in the next tier.			"

								For starters this game is in beta and isn't nearly feature complete and still has some crashing/bug problems. Aside from that what is in the game so far is very fun to mess around with, you can build your own solar system with a load of customization options, you can crash moons into planets and get in some very satisfying matches. There is currently no SP campaign but there is an offline vs. bots mode, the AI isn't perfect but they aren't straight up pushovers either. Multiplayer is fun and the community is welcoming. The devs are commited to fixing the game and making it the best it can be, they are VERY in touch with their fans. This game is very much worth the price and as long as you can tolerate bugs and crashes now and again then I wholeheartedly recommend it. As stated before they are very in touch with fans, if you report a bug along with a DxDiag file you shouldn't be surprised to see it fixed in the next changelog. "

								Well, it's a pretty decent RTS, but the main selling point seems to be that the maps are ""entire planets"".  They are the SMALLEST ""planets"" ever, with many of them being smaller than the original TA maps.  It's still a good strategy game at its core, but don't be fooled by the hype - the map sizes are greatly exaggerated.			"

								At the moment, the game is simple in concept, but difficult to interface with. Supreme Commander and Total Annihilation was easy to interface with and had difficult concepts. Finding idle workers, assigning build patterns, and flat out attacking, tasks such as that, was difficult to do. This game is also in its early stages of development and there is much work being done on it. Maybe in a few years it will be the polished finished state that was Supreme Commander.			"

								I've put in a few hours or so. Definately harkens back to the endless nights I spent playing Total Annihilation when I was a pre-teen.Major issue concerning interplanetary assaults. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but there doesnt seem to be any way to attack a conquered planet or moon without a sh*t ton of transports. If said planet or moon is heavily defended, a stalemate is easily reached. Please, for the love of god, there needs to be a way of attacking another moon or planet from your established base that compliments whatever invasion force you build. Cannon, missiles, whatever.All dramatics aside, this is shaping up to be fantasballs.			"

								I remember when I first saw this game on Kickstarter, and I though, ""Wow that looks really cool!""I then saw it was around $100 for early access on Steam, and decided to give it some time. It then went down to $50, and finally during the Steam Sale it came down to $25. I got the game, and convinced many of my friends to do so as well.We have not been disappointed. The game is absolutely fantastic! I have not had this much fun in an RTS is a long time. The game looks very nice, and runs extremely well for still being Early Access. To get right down to it, the game is just a blast to play with friends. Maneuvering your command around the system while your enemy throws moons at you. It leads to plenty of big ""WTF"" laughing moments as everyone. There are a few minor cons. When I first got it I had to update my driver to get the textures to show up, but that was easily fixed. Another issue would be the AI. It is hard . . . Like you are not going to win balls bustign hard. Even on the easyiest setting it is a challenge just to survive. What I really recommend is playing this with friends or strangers online. Finally since it is still in EARLY ACCESS not all of the promised feature are in the game, but as it stands it is a complete game in my eyes.All in all I regret not picking up this game sooner. It would have easily been worth the $50 price point, hell maybe even the $100 price. The game is fun, and has brought my friends and I a new game to bond over.Now if you will excuse me I have a moon I need to smash into another planet.			"

								For anyone on the ropes about this game, let me say a few things: 1. This game is an RTS that reminds me a bit of Starcraft. It is very fun and addictive to build a massive army of fabrication bot, to than build rocket boosters onto a plant, than use that planet as a giant nuke and take out the enemies.2. I bought this game when it was on sale (40% off, $30) For that price I would say the game is worth it, but not for more.3. Right now, the game is in beta/alpha (althought the devs say it's in ""gamma"" or whatever) it is early access SO THERE WILL BE BUGS. Currently the game has lots of crashes, loses connectivety randomly, and has terrible lag spikes. Especially if you spawn 10 million bots everywhere.Overall I'd give it an 8/10 pick it up if its on sale, but if not just wait for the sale or release.			"

The speed of the game is fast, and your foe can come for you from all angles, so you have to be on your toes at all times and that makes it som much more fun, including that the whole universe can be your playground makes it great.I used to play RA and SC alot in single player, not that much in multiplayer, but the problem there was that when you had a good base and footing the enemy stopped being any real threat, but they have changed that and i for one think its for the better because you have to be alert the whole time.But to sum things up, if you like RTS and want a challenge i recommend this game.

Its a whole new style of RTS and man is it good.100% would recomend even if youre not a huge RTS fan, who knows it might turn you :q			"

								**** 4/5 stars.  Reason= Beta       I would still be playing Total Annihilation, if it weren't for all my unit id conflicts. Up and out is the only logical next step. To the stars. Kudos to you for taking it there. Not quite a 4X, but as close as you can get to it in the RTS realm.        Very rough cut, but definitely a unique precious stone yet to be seen in the gaming industry, but moreover MORE Annihilation! "

								''Best game''I have been playing this game for a while when it was still Alpha, And yes by that time it had bugs but wat do you expect from AN alpha, There where not much people to fight against since it was still expensive, but since beta came out and now the game, the community became bigger.They Also added a campaign where you can just choose your own path trough the gelaxy you can explore new content like constructions etc.The good thing about this game and developers they listing to people so if u want something to be in the game. they would actualy think about it to implent it. by that it still gets new updates with new constructions.Right now 26-12-2014 it is not to expensive only 5euros it is worth it .. even worth the normal price.GL HAVE FUN ;)			"

								I LOVE THIS GAME. This is the type of strategy game I wanted. The whole solar system is the battle ground. Ground, Air, Sea, even orbital units that you can use to make your army. Not to bring up all the structures that can help in battle like artillery. And the game ender the planet engine to lunch entire planet at your foe.   It might still be in beta. So the game has some problems like it does not seem to be optimized. And some units and building aren’t in the game yet like the unit cannon in the video but I read that they plan on adding it. Even with the small problems I would recommend it to anyone who like large scale strategy game even with the price. "

Obliterate you enemy with a planet, simplistic art style that looks clean and easy to read. PA does have its problems with clunky UI and the occasional bugs. If you can see past the bugs and UI they you will be humming the amazing orchestral music that it provides for that epic scale battles that planetary annihilation just excels in. "

								So Planetary Annihilation isn't quite finished yet. It still needs some work on the end game and there are still a few bugs to iron out. But If anyone liked total annihilation or other stupid huge RTS games its already amazing and I would recommend it. I just got done with a three hour game that only ended because my opponent conceded because I owned two planets and he owned one and we were fighting over a moon that we were trying to strap rockets onto to slam onto the opponents Capitol world. And by fighting over the moon I mean we both had portals on the moon and our worlds were covered with factories for warmachines driving through the portals and exploding in huge waves against each other and we were trying to fling enough nukes through the void to overcome each others defensive sites and failing.

The graphics are oh so great. I mean this game is Forged Alliance with steroids, and all those other goodies that make you feel good and strong. But you can't forget some of the downsides I have noticed in the game so far. When you create a game against AI and lose connection, that game will be gone forever. Which makes me a sad gamer when I can't enjoy a game with my crappy internet. With the one downside I have seen, there are so many upsides for anyone to not want to buy the game. I feel that there is always improvement for any game, but with an amazing AI system like this game has I don't know if there needs to be improvement.			"

								This game has lots of good things and a few bad things. The first good thing is the graphics are beautiful,the texture quality,and cool 3d sprites. The next good thing about is its not your usual RTS why you might ask, because you can fight on different planets you are never limited to on map also you can create your own solar system! Another good thing is the option to choose bots,air,or vehicles.The final good thing is its more of a traditionaly RTS, what that means is you have to build a base, manage your econmy,and create an army all at the same time. The first bad thing is there isn't alot of micro management and your units just blob together.The next bad thing is to beat an oppenents army all you really need is more units most of the time, sometimes this deosn't happen.The final bad thing is the price, 60$ is alot for the content the game has at the moment though it is gamma so they still have time to fix it.

								Total Annihilation will always be my favorite RTS game, and I played it all the time throughout my child hood and then still every so often. This game is made by people who worked on Total Annihilation, Command and Conquer, and etc. I'm loving this game and it reminds me so much of Total Annihilation except incredibly more awesome.			"

								(1/1/2014) Best way to describe planetary annihilation? The original game 'Total annihilation' with less units, with a spherical theatre, multiple planetary bodies and launchable satelites, without the krogoth.... It is still in early access, so i wouldn't be surprised if it turned up later down the track!Graphic are stylised blocky, which almost feel like it is a war of lego, but it works.Its that old style build a million things send it against the opposing base and see what breaks first...With that old twist you can litterally fling planets at one another.I've only seen one faction so far, so variation is a bit bland at this stage... Same with gameplay, no campaign, and odd mix of game 'types' (e.g. no ai allies at this stage)Still very enjoyable, with just niggling little problems in a still in development game  has a LOT of potential, definately one to watch, if not snatch up and support.

								Still a work in progress game, but I totally love it.  It hits every button that Total Annihilation hit for me when I was in middle/high school (so... about 10-15 years ago lol), but still adds fresh elements that totally (ha) keep the game interesting.  I don't know how they did it, but they tweaked some of the gameplay mechanics from Supreme Commander to get it feeling a bit more tactical again, and not so incredibly sloggy where you just send wave upon wave upon wave of armies at your adversaries, and it's useless to try and keep tabs on individual battles.  With PA, it seems worth it to individually guide raiding parties against opponents in order to maximize tactical outcomes while simultaneously managing your large strategic buildout.Keep in mind, I've only played a few hours of single player thus far, but it already hits all the right buttons for me!  The only criticism I would maybe add would be that the sound effects need a bit more punch, a la Total Annihilation, as well as the explosions.  The white flashes of explosions in TA seemed a bit more visceral than the slightly more cartoony ones in this game.  Again, audio: more boom boom, less pew pew.			"

								Damn, i play this franchise since Total Annihilation and this game as it successor does its job perfectly. The scale is huge: multiple planets of multiple environments and sizes; wars waged in the air, land, sea and the orbit; As far as I seen games are up to 10 players by now - if you turn on dynamic alliances, it gets really interesting. Want to smash some guy with that asteroid over there? Here you go! Or maybe sneaky-style-teleport-your-units-behind-their-lines? Sure! What about frying them up using an orbital death ray? You have it all. It even works smoothly on my kind of outdated PC, no matter how huge the battle is. BUY IT!			"

								The AI is utterly unforgiving. I only just get started and already I am being swarmed by bots that seemimgly already know where I am. There is no easy mode, or medium, or hard, it is set to Insane right off the bat.Other than that, though, it is really quite fun. There are a few glitches here and there (the map will suddenly just spin out of control for a second sometimes after using the middle mouse button to look around and the tut video will freeze the game if you haven't logged in yet) and I would like to see the AI have a variable difficulty, so that us noobs aren't bombed to hell beore we can even get a grip on the control and for those of us who just want some cathartic moon drops.The streaming resources is a brilliant idea. I've always hated having to wait around while my resources collect in order to buy something - here I don't have to wait, I can just set it to build now and let the resources flow in after. Also means you can build a bunch of defences on the fly if you are getting hammered; no more crying ""If only I had ten more points I could have bought that wall/gun/vehicle and not suffered that humiliating defeat!""That said, you will be humiliatingly defeated. Nothing says overkill like having a moon dropped on your head.Over all, practically done already, just needs that last little polish to make it truely remarkable. Can't wait to see this finished!

Now imagine building a rocket ship to take you to another map, and giving you the ability to control yet another army on a completely different terrain while you simultaneously control your conquest of the previous map. That's what this game is all about. Conquer one planet. Conquer two planets. Repurpose an asteroid into your own personal doomsday weapon. It's all possible in this game. Future updates promise even more amazing options from opponents starting on seperate planets to having multiple solar systems involved in a single galactic war.			"

												I dont understand your decision to even go with the always on internet connection. I cant even finish a game before I loose connection to your servers and its usually a hour to two hours into the game so I loose all my progress. Games that require internet to play never work out for me. I bought this nice computer that surpasses the reccomemded system requirments just to have a server take it over for me and its not even a good server. Once you get a large army (Which what the developers talk about so much) The game will lagg so much. I advise you to hurry up on the offline mode because I love the game a lot. Its just really annoying to loose connection to the server after I invest 2 hours into one game and it all goes away because the servers cannot handle it or my internet is too slow. I would definitly reccomend the game because it is fun...BUT the servers should never have been put there in the first place which I would have expected gaming companies to learn from the previous games that employed always on internet connections that bombed on launch (And some still stink if you know what game im talking about) Overall I do understand this is a WIP but like I said before the servers should not have been there. I hope you guys get offline mode done soon and to those that havent bought it yet wait for offline mode which is on their to-do list. I also advise you guys to get more servers if you are going to alow 40 player games because me and a AI lagg really bad.ProsSuper FunNice twist on stratagyGreat units Cool mapsAwesome system editor Cons Internet requiredLaggy servers/COnnection to servers lostits a WIP Still recommended though! :)-------That was my old review, the game has long since changed. There is no more required connection to play :)Still, though, it feels like a far cry from what they advertised it to be on the kickstarter page			"

								Be warned this is a BETA version STILL! The game was released over a year ago and it still has issues, see below:-Units will get stuck behind and next to buildings, with no way to get them free-Units will forget build orders and/or only build half of what you tell them-Units will forget patrol or attack orders and just stop at random points on the map-If a Builder is attempting to build something, and another unit is in it's way it will not inform you of the issue, nor is the unit which is in the way smart enough to move out of the way to allow the construction to proceed-Has trouble connecting to the sever, which is needed for single player games as well, often times have to save and leave and come back to continue with a battleI am not sure why after more than a year the game still behaves like a Beta. I am even more confused after playing it, since most of these issues were addressed and correct in the later Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander 2. Surely Planetary Annihilation can tailor those fixes for their use, or at least use them as a reference point. I hope that at some point, maybe within the NEXT year, they correct these issues. Despite all these issues, I do recommend the game, it is a fun RTS with a mix of many elements from various industry leading games, such as the Supreme Commander I previously mentioned. It also offers many multiplayer and co-op options. This games will certainly entertain you for hours,  while it both frustrates and thrills you.My final recommendation is to buy this game ONLY if on sale. In its current state it is NOT worth the current list price of $49.99. I bought it during the Steam Summer Sale and got it 66% off, or $16.99. If you can by for 50% or more off, I say go for it. You should be pleased.			"

								Planetary Annihilation is definitely an evolution from from the normal RTS games like Starcraft. Not being confined to a single playing field expands the scope of play for a more complex level of RTS, not really seen before. Not to mention the very different ways in which one can getto play; Ground, Air, Orbital, etc., which kinda makes it reminiscent of FTL. Looking forward to playing a good amount more and really getting into it.			"

								This game is promising. I feel as though a couple more big updates should make this game very enjoyable. Currently it is somewhat smooth with occasional hitches. The single player map is quite a mess though. Scrolling around is a pain. Since I spent bulk of my time playing multiplayer, here are my thoughts:- The structure placement needs a lot of improvement. It would be nice to have a grid pop up to snap the structures in place. Sure it makes placement less flexible, but when you have 100s of buildings, its nice to have them organized.- Performance: (Note: I have a very decent machine which can chug through most games on Ultra. So the choppiness should not be due to my specs) The game starts off fine but pile on 20 to 50 units and there are frequent choppiness. I tried playing around with the settings with no luck.- AI - Normal AI seems quite powerful at the moment but I am sure with more practice, I will be able to catch up.- Graphics - The game looks beautiful. Its a very cartoon-ish look. Explosions are very minimalistic which fit the game's overall tone. For an early access game, I am quite pleased with it. Hopefully it is updated regularly with meaningful fixes.UPDATE: The lag went away for me when I downloaded the standalone launcher for this game. There is still a scrolling lag however.			"

								Well, it's a pretty decent RTS, but the main selling point seems to be that the maps are ""entire planets"".  They are the SMALLEST ""planets"" ever, with many of them being smaller than the original TA maps.  It's still a good strategy game at its core, but don't be fooled by the hype - the map sizes are greatly exaggerated.			"

								At the moment, the game is simple in concept, but difficult to interface with. Supreme Commander and Total Annihilation was easy to interface with and had difficult concepts. Finding idle workers, assigning build patterns, and flat out attacking, tasks such as that, was difficult to do. This game is also in its early stages of development and there is much work being done on it. Maybe in a few years it will be the polished finished state that was Supreme Commander.			"

								I've put in a few hours or so. Definately harkens back to the endless nights I spent playing Total Annihilation when I was a pre-teen.Major issue concerning interplanetary assaults. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but there doesnt seem to be any way to attack a conquered planet or moon without a sh*t ton of transports. If said planet or moon is heavily defended, a stalemate is easily reached. Please, for the love of god, there needs to be a way of attacking another moon or planet from your established base that compliments whatever invasion force you build. Cannon, missiles, whatever.All dramatics aside, this is shaping up to be fantasballs.			"

								I might not have played this one as much as I did the first Total Annihilation but I can say the game needs tweaking well the early access verson I got into sure did. I haven't put more time into it yet mainly because when I first first played it it was so hard I could barely even figure out the game before getting totatlly annihilated by the PC they added adjustments so you could scale the difficulty down and make it playable and that's been a big improvement I'm likely going to hold off on the game more till the Beta is complete.

								This game has lots of good things and a few bad things. The first good thing is the graphics are beautiful,the texture quality,and cool 3d sprites. The next good thing about is its not your usual RTS why you might ask, because you can fight on different planets you are never limited to on map also you can create your own solar system! Another good thing is the option to choose bots,air,or vehicles.The final good thing is its more of a traditionaly RTS, what that means is you have to build a base, manage your econmy,and create an army all at the same time. The first bad thing is there isn't alot of micro management and your units just blob together.The next bad thing is to beat an oppenents army all you really need is more units most of the time, sometimes this deosn't happen.The final bad thing is the price, 60$ is alot for the content the game has at the moment though it is gamma so they still have time to fix it.

								(1/1/2014) Best way to describe planetary annihilation? The original game 'Total annihilation' with less units, with a spherical theatre, multiple planetary bodies and launchable satelites, without the krogoth.... It is still in early access, so i wouldn't be surprised if it turned up later down the track!Graphic are stylised blocky, which almost feel like it is a war of lego, but it works.Its that old style build a million things send it against the opposing base and see what breaks first...With that old twist you can litterally fling planets at one another.I've only seen one faction so far, so variation is a bit bland at this stage... Same with gameplay, no campaign, and odd mix of game 'types' (e.g. no ai allies at this stage)Still very enjoyable, with just niggling little problems in a still in development game  has a LOT of potential, definately one to watch, if not snatch up and support.

								This game is definately a work in progress.  I appreciate the work that they have done here.  I am a huge fan of SupCom, which this plays very similar to.  I have a 3 monitor setup which this works with without a problem (eyefinity, 7850).  The game gets a little rough for me to play at times though it may be due to my C2D processor (upgrading soon).    Pros:  This game is very much like a larger SupCom.  If you enjoyed SupCom you will feel right at home here.  Cons:  This is a work in progress.  Not a whole lot of variation between races.  Difficulty when starting is higher than what I was expecting.  Difficult to get off of first planet.  I haven't found a way if there is one to start on a different planet than the enemy.This game has a lot of potential and I look forward to updates that will be coming.			"

It would also be great if you coudl add a offline skirmish where i could play against AI's of a lower difficulty as im getting used to the game and fail to keep up with the preset AI's. i still 100% recomend the game			"

								If you enjoy RTS's with a Sci-Fi touch that doesn't come near Star Trek, this is the deal. Seriously. This is the best Strategy game I've ever played. You've got all the tools you basically need for a nice RTS. First of all, it's build up on an economy system, which i enjoy a lot. Second, there's no lack of units. Units don't get boring as easy as in other RTS's. Nothing is ever the same. The graphics have a cartoony style, but without that weird outline of every character like in the Borderlands series. Since the last update, it has become much easier to run, due to a logical stability fix. Although i've experienced an error with the game, which happened to my friend. On some computers, Planetary Annihilation won't start with the error sign ""Pa.exe is not responding"" and afterwards crashes. This really needs to be patched in future updates since i haven't been able to find any solutions so far.I've got one reason for you to buy this game... YOU CAN SMASH PLANETS INTO OTHER PLANETS, AND IT LOOKS AWESOME.It's definitely worth the spending cash... "

								Some of the early access games I have backed up usually end up in disappointment. I have supported this game since it was $100 and it has yet to disappoint!  They have come a long way!   I will say that if you play a match that lasts awhile and you don't attack the AI enough to keep their armies to size the game will start to lag due to their large numbers!!!!! So I suggest, for now, just play in a system that has one planet and a moon. That way you don't have tons of planets filled with armies. Anyone who likes/liked Supreme Commander will definitely enjoy this game since it plays a lot like it. A friend and I were playing on a system with 2 planets and 1 moon. We conquered 1 planet while the AI had planet 2 and the moon all to himself.  We built teleporters so we could send our large armies onto the moon and wipe him out. Then the problem arose...how does one attack a planet when he has control of the ground/air/space..... I built 3 large engines on the moon and tried figuring out how to get them to work while my friend attempted numerous times to make a foothold on the planet. Upon getting the engines started I started laughing.... it was awesome! The moon moving fullspeed towards the planet!  Moon collided head on with the enemy commander and we won!  That was by far the coolest thing I have ever seen in an RTS!!!!  To think this game isn't even done yet! There is more to come!			"

												Game idea was brilliant. unfortunatly the company that made this game are greedy and they give you the bare minimum when you buy the game which is the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing I have ever seen. you have around 5 commanders that are exactly the same they just look different and you have 5 units for air, 5 for land and 5 for sea. the only redeaming quality was the planet destroyers that you get VERY late game. this game is shockingly bad and it had true potential just like Human Resouces, but unfortunatly the company are more into the money then making the consumer happy. Hope you are happy with yourself Uber. OH also you know the Titans that they were so proud to make. Yeah thats a 15 quid DLC. doesnt come with the base game....			"

								This game is definately a work in progress.  I appreciate the work that they have done here.  I am a huge fan of SupCom, which this plays very similar to.  I have a 3 monitor setup which this works with without a problem (eyefinity, 7850).  The game gets a little rough for me to play at times though it may be due to my C2D processor (upgrading soon).    Pros:  This game is very much like a larger SupCom.  If you enjoyed SupCom you will feel right at home here.  Cons:  This is a work in progress.  Not a whole lot of variation between races.  Difficulty when starting is higher than what I was expecting.  Difficult to get off of first planet.  I haven't found a way if there is one to start on a different planet than the enemy.This game has a lot of potential and I look forward to updates that will be coming.			"

												RTS fans rejoice, this is THE new game to play as it is one of the most well crafted and overall best game I ever played. The art is beatiful, the lighting engine is spot on, the models have a nice chunky robo feel and have very nice and smooth animations, you can zoom out and enjoy as your little markers march forth to destroy the enemy or you can zoom onto one unti and follow its adventures.The detail and care going into the art and the animation are great, even the planets look great, with different biomes and randomly generated forests, crevaces and others. Even if this can result in some misplacement of textures it doesn't stop the game and it doesn't look bad, just a minor detail, talking about the planets there is a great little tool that helps you generate very customizable planets, you can't change the individual trees but you can still choose the biome, size, orbit and more. Creating and then playing on your system feels great, this allows for extra wacky ideas, fun or interesting maps.the menus, the little tabs on your screen when you play all display inportant information that can be ignored if you really want to get into the action happening on screen. The sound is of good quality even though sometimes it doesn't match up the animation it is hardly noticeable and it can still be fixed . The galactic war is great for co-op or single player campaing and has some great inovative ideas and twists on the multiplayer which even if it can take some time nearly always functions perfectly.Gameplay is the standard RTS commands and it works well, the feel of changing seemlesly from planet to planet or from one side of the globe to the other is fun and really makes you feel in control. The different units and buildings are all well made and well balanced, the different styles of play are plentiful and the strategies endless. You can spam out hundreds upon hundreds of tanks and lead a great charge right into the enemy base or you can carefully flank the enemy while launching a nuke at his commander or just smash a planet into him. Planet smashing is challenging enough to pull off and doesn't always guarantee a win but is very satisfying and looks extremely badass. And don't get me started on the Catalysts, those are beast!In conclusion; this is a game summoned forth  by wizards who managed to make (in my opinion) the best game ever. Although the price is quite steep,  the developers deserve every penny that I gave them.			"

												Huge disappointment from Uber.  The game was not complete to begin with and then they release Titans just to escape their bad reviews. Thats low.  Last thing i'll ever buy from Uber again.			"

												Absolutely frustrated and utterly dissapointed. Bought this several months ago & was not impressed. Decided to give it time... Then I see the game I purchased ""pre-release"" alpha has already been released with a full-price expansion. What a scam. The developers should be ashamed and customers should avoid purchasing. Maybe worth $5, expansion included. The game has hardly changed or improved since I left it. Still full of exploits and terrible AI. Still extremely repetitive and lacking the grandoise feeling of planetary combat it was marketed as. The maps are small, the combat is weak, and the game is completely uninteresting after very little time. This is a dishonest and manipulative trick by Uber Entertainment, that saw their game's declining sales, and instead of working to revive a failing project, decided to release the game as is, package their recent additions into an overpriced expansion, and make as much money as they could with what pathetic little content they had. I've reported this product to Steam and recommended they take action against the developers at Uber Entertainment.			"

								A very intresting strategy game that's set apart from its bretheren by the unique environment of combat. This game allows for the classic RTS mass-unit armies to storm across planets, but it also adds the dimension of other planets, making for a unique gameplay experience. Build Satilite laser platforms and rain death from above, fabricate nukes and fire them into your foes base, or crash a moon into your own planet.I absolutely recommend this to anyone who enjoys RTS-es, even if it is pricy.

								The following I wrote after misunderstanding terminal messages after running the PA executable.  The game has a UI based Chromium and if you had Chromium with the pipeligh plugin for things like watching netfilx, you will see references to wine and pipelight in the terminal.  I am changing my review to recommended after researching further and finding that the development team is quite active and responsive and truly do their best to support Linux.   Don't panic like I did: I cannot reccomend this game for Linux users.  As good as the game looks in videos, I was hoping that thedevelopers promise as ""Linux Support"" would mean that at least the menu would open.  This is not the case.  I get a window with a black screen.  I have tried the numerour work arounds only to discover that this game installs WINE and SILVERLIGHT!  Wow.  Seriously is that what ""Linux Support"" means?!  I have installed and played lots of great, complex games that are native to Linux without issue.  I have also had lots of success running games in wine such as Skyrim, Guildwars II, Borderlands 2 etc.  I have also used Netflix using wine/silverlight and at least I was truthfully told what I was getting into.  This seems like a deception to be told that the game supports linux, when it cant even run and even installs/modifies wine in a .wine folder in your home without asking or warning as well as Silverlight.  The developers really need to be honest and really need to look at other games to LEARN what LINUX SUPPORT really means!   I jumped to 64 bit Linux just to play this game and I can get all of my other Linux and wine games running fine on Xubuntu 64.  There is really no excuse for a game that has developed as far as it has without basic real and honest support to claim that it runs on Linux.			"

												As a long time Total Anhilation then Supreme Commander player. This game was always on my radar. Im so pleased with the way it turned out. The music score is epic and really suits the mood. Jumping between planets is really great and adds a really strategic element. My best advice is dont turtle. Build build build and then build some more!			"

								What can I say this game is perfect in everyway including my favourite part as you can tell in the title of the game (planetary annihilation) and that is destroying planets to destroy someone's base. I would recommend this game to anyone! 10/10 and It is  outstanding nothing will beat it unless the same company make a different game that is this but different title :D....In total I think none should even think to buy this game they should just buy it!!

												This game is not ready for launch. The servers are still awful, crashes all the time, no matter how beastly your system is. The games will start to lag 20min in. This game still feels like it is in alpha, just keep that in mind if you're putting forth thy money. Besides the negatives I have just brought into fruition... The game is a really fun RTS.			"

								If you have a crappy GPU don't buy this game. It lags like♥♥♥♥♥♥ especially with the whole ""Always Online"" aspect just like SimCity had before they updated. Otherwise, great game. Lives up to the standard of Total Annihilation and is very pleasing to the eye holes.			"
