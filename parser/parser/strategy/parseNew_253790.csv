												On the face of it rymdkapsel looks like an isometric  type  tetris clone, but in reality it's a surprisingly good minimalistic  space  RTS come Tower Defense game where you have to build corridor like  capsules (that look like colored tetris  pieces) such as weapon rooms, living quarters, kitchens, gardens, reactors  and resource extractors.   The aim of the game is to complete  several tasks such as  researching  monoliths that once unlocked  gain you extra attributes such as  speedier minions, slower enemies, increases the range of your weapons or  makes for faster resource production. Other aims are to complete  all four monoliths  within 45 minutes and to survive the 28 waves of enemies that get steadily harder as you progress.   You race against time between  enemy attacks to build your various  modules.  The sensible thing is to  concentrate on aiming for one monolith at a time and  building   one each of   the modules  in turn till  the cycle begins again.   The sortest route to each monolith is  the optimum so use  the pieces  that appear at the top left of the  game field to decide  when to build a new corridor.  As your work force increases you can manage them via the  task bar at the bottom of the game field, swapping  minions between tasks as and when needed.  The game gets progressivley harder as your corridor like space capsule spead out like a spiders web,   reaching for the   four  monoliths.  Once you connect with  one of these you have to research it using a minimum of one   minion or a maximum of three.  The faster you   complete the research, the  sooner you can use it's attributes.   To ensure the survival of your minions you  need to place weapons capsules strategically throughout your maze of corridors as each  module only covers a small area no more than a couple of modules in any direction.    Enemies attack  minions which can only take a few hits   so   you're constantly having to create new minions at the end of each attack via  the habitat  module (but you need resources from the kitchen to create new minions).  Before an attack is imminent you get a brief red flashing warning.  At this point you  should    swap all  minions tasks to   weapons    to ensure that all of your weapon stations are manned by minions.  This is the safest location for a miniom during an attack.  Once the attack is over  you should then  retask your  minions  to return to their previous tasks ASAP.  This is done by dragging   them via a task bar at the bottom of the game field to where you want them to be.  There's an alternative method of returning to previous tasks,  which you're informed of in the tutorial, and which I didn't really take note of it at the time, as I found using the task bar  easier;   I think its done by  clicking on the appropriate modules that were being worked on previous to the attack but not 100% sure..When you first start the game  there is a short tutotial that  holds your hand through the first few module builds until the first attack is imminent.  I failed miserably  at my first few  attempts trying to send out  corridors to each  of the  monoliths without  building the support services and because I ignored the tutorial.  You have to ensure you have a constant supply of living quarters  and food  to be able to increase the size of your colony and to sustain it as well as  build extractors, and reactors to ensure you have energy and resources to build.If you are into strategic games and tower defense games coupled loosely with a space theme you'll love this game.  It looks  minimalistic, but it sure gave  me a buzz playing it.  It's one of those games   where you don't relaize  where the time has gone after looking away from the monitor.  I'll surely be playing this for a long time to come, or at least until i've managed to complete  a few rounds.  The    games name rymdkapsel is derived from the Swedish  name for space capsule.			"

												Rydmkapsel is like an isometric Tetris where you have to lay down blocks. But the twist here is that these blocks are populated by... well, I'm not sure what they are, but they look like rectangles. Each block has a function, so you have a block for defense, for harvesting, for gardens, for cooking and a few more. You have to combine all of these blocks together to create a living world where the main goal is to explore and survive. You can't build a straight road unless you're lucky because each time you construct something a random shape is generated so you have to work with what you get.At the bottom of the screen you'll see a bar filling up. Once it's full enemies will attack. It starts with 2  enemies that can easily be defeated, but once the wave is over, the bar will refill and new enemies will arrive. The longer you survive the faster the bar fills up and the more enemies will appear. It can get very hectic, especially if your workers can't get to their battle station in time or if you have too few people left to defend it all.And that's where the exploration part kicks in. There are monoliths to be discovered that can positively alter stuff. Like, for example, making your workers move faster. These seem essential the further you get and it's recommended that you discover and analyze them as soon as possible. There are also multiple objectives to complete, but at the moment for me it's not entirely clear why they're exactly there. Maybe to give you a goal, I don't know.Graphically the game has a very minimalistic look. There are no bells and whistles, just the essential stuff. The music is also very soothing... until you get that battle alert at least. So nothing fancy here but it does look sharp and colorful and has a style of its own which I can absolutely appreciate.The game also feels very relaxing... until, well, things are about to fall apart. Just like how the real Tetris feels. Anyway, I like Rymdkapsel. I like it a lot. You should too.[Rating: 79/100]			"

YouTube™ Video: rymdkapsel - PC HD - Space Strategy Game - Review/Gameplay/First Impression 

			Views: 1,800		

			Brbteabreak takes a look at rymdkapsel, a space strategy game which has recently come to Steam. Subscribe or Bob and Greg/Steve Die! Get it on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/253790/		

The goal of video games as an interactive medium is to engage the user as much as possible through their interactions. Games are unique because of this and are enjoyed because of this interaction with the medium; this is where rymdkapsel separates itself from the competitors.  Its goal is to have minimal user input without souring the experience, macro problem solving would be a good way to describe it. The objective of the game is very simple, survive. This is done by constructing a well-fortified station with the help of your minions. You are attacked at set intervals by an enemy and during the downtime you have to prepare and explore. The mode is quite simple and to be frank starts off very slow, and while it may pick up in pace later on it goes from one extreme to the next, due to the poor AI a lot of the time you can’t even perform an action during the break. There are some missions to help break the monotony but they’re very bland.The minions are not controlled on an individual level, instead you’re given an overview and decide how many minions you want in a given field of work. This can cause some hilarities and frustrations as your minions walk around like sheep and try to build your masterpiece as they all focus in a singular area even though only one minion will be needed. The same can be said for their fighting as they only can work in groups of two, and if you get some unlucky RNG with the enemy grouping they can wipe you out even if you have overwhelming numbers.The game has a pseudo 3D art style which uses vector based visuals which are quite a treat to look at, and for some this will probably be the biggest draw to the game. With the strong use of colour to help dictate certain areas of your station a colour blind mode has been added, which is greatly needed for those who suffer. Why more games don’t have colour blind modes, we’ll never know but it’s good to see it in rymdkapsel and they should be praised for noticing and rectifying this possible flaw in their game. The soundtrack is quite ambient giving off a space feel while still being quite simple, sound effects on the overhand are a little lacking but nothing that will turn you off. The game was originally on PSVITA and as such we have to discuss the port. While it does run smoothly it really lacks a decent options menu, no audio sliders, UI is locked to 4 presets (though better than none at all) and there is a total lack of keyboard support.rymdkapsel lacks a lot of things that would be considered micro, causing the player at times feel useless. This plays as a strength and a weakness to the game and may turn people off. For what it’s worth, rymdkapsel is very interesting and unique, while not perfect you should still be able to objectively view it and see some of the great ideas it has. How many strategy games can you play with one hand, while the other gets that itch which is always behind your left ear?			"

												☺ Nice minimalist style.☺ An interesting challenge.☹ Little variation in tactics.☹ Some inefficient AI.☹ Limited replayability.A game for fans of refining tactics and efficiency based challenges.Rymdkapsel is a minimalist resource and time management game where efficiency is of utmost importance. Your goal is to expand your space station by placing down rooms as effectively as possible taking into account their shape which is somewhat random and inspired by Tetris as you stretch out through the void heading for your ultimate goal, the research of four mysterious Monoliths.To do this, you command your minions to fulfil a specific task, such as construction or research and watch as they do their best to fulfil their roles while you oversee expansion and reassign positions as needed, like switching up an engineer who usually boosts resource production into a defencive role to thwart incoming enemies who periodically attack your minions.The game uses a collection of known variables and tasks you with using them as best you can. As such, its the type of game that might appeal to those who enjoy refining a strategy or simply improving on a previous attempt. Don't expect a great deal of variation, you'll likely learn everything you need to during your first attempt and from then on, its a matter of using that knowledge efficiently to succeed.Just like the resource you collect in game, there is enjoyment to be extracted from the game...I just feel it runs dry sooner than you'd expect, not helped by AI oddities such as your builders quite happily doubling up on resources for a construction or the lack of direct minion control can lead to mild frustration.It's an interesting game and one that I'd like to recommend, but feels a little bit like a proof of concept rather than a fully fledged title. What's there is good but slightly limited and as such I'd strongly recommend waiting for a discount as even if you really enjoy it, it could prove to be very short lived.			"

												A very stylish, spacy RTS-lite that has you commanding your little block men to mine resources, build, research and defend, with the ultimate goal of reaching and researching the four monoliths in each corner of the smallish map. The gameplay is as minimalistic as the graphics -- you have seven building structures to choose from, and have to balance your construction of them based on your available resources, while at the same time making sure you don't put your block men too far away from their battle stations at any time as they must fend off the occasional attack wave, which increase in frequency and strength as the game goes on.Without balance and a fair (but not frustrating) level of difficulty, this game probably would have been too simple to be anything but a flavor of the minute, the type of game you play for a day or two to never return to. But it is well balanced and challenging, and the minimal graphics and excellent space synth soundtrack (my wife walked by and asked if I was listening to Pink Floyd) allow this game to succeed in both style and play.

												The game looks simple, and that's because it is. Some may find it's options limited, but what it does, it does well. The AI does a lot of the work, you have no direct control over your blocky minions. Rest assured the AI does it's job pretty well, I rarely got annoyed by the AI doing things inefficiently.If you're looking for a challenge you can up the difficulty by going for the harder modes or attempting some of the more difficult achivements. All of a sudden efficient placement of your tetrislike rooms becomes a lot more crucial!In short, definitely recommended for anyone who is into this kind of strategy/management games. If you're looking for a game with a lot of different options or want control over your ""troops"", then Rymdkapsel might be too niche for you.			"

			Today I'm checking out Rymdkapsel, a gorgeous space station game that mixes both simulator and puzzle elements. Your goal is too survive off the resources you have against the waves of 'space worm'...		

This game surprised me with being quite simple to understand, yet still engaging and addictive. The core gameplay comprises of placing rooms, unit and time management. It also requires a bit of forward thinking, to make sure you don't get stuck in an economic situation you can't get out of.There are three modes, normal (from the tablet version), zen mode (no enemies) and hard mode (I haven't beaten it yet, it's hard!). The crisp graphics and sound help to focus you on the gameplay. A couple of achievements are available, I unlocked most of them on normal mode. Overall it's a pretty fun game, but the starting price might be a bit high for some people, so add it to your wishlist!			"

												Wow. This was a nice little surprise. It's a little game with simple goals and it doesn't stress player too much. My first game took 71 minutes and I got to 26th wave. Its a nice combination of different games, little bit resource management, tetris and tower defense and then ofcourse little bit their own design and style.			"

												It has been quite a while since I experienced time loss playing a game, but rymdkapsel did it for me. I got so into the game I played for 3+ hours without realizing. I thought maybe 40 minutes had gone by.It did a couple things right for me personally to achieve that: enjoyable base building and management of units, despite the minimal approach + short, challenging, make it or break it runs to achieve various goals. The first level/difficulty of the game was a blast, easy enough to keep playing though challenging enough you will die, reassess your strategy, and start over a few times. Next level/difficulty is more challenging (I haven't gotten all the achievements yet) but similar. Build, manage, gather and grow resources, power ups, fight enemies, die, reassess strategy, try again. It's quite fun and sucks you in!All of that works really well and I'd recommend it. The downside is that it's a small, short game. Once you beat those two levels/difficulties and their set of achievements you're done with the game. Personally I'd love to have seen several more levels and maps and more enemy variety. Maybe a couple more game mechanics. Also, a zen mode, super easy mode, or a huuuuuge map that you could really put some time and effort into a base instead of the many shorter bursts. Just any game mode that you could play an extended game on.But none of that really took away from the fun. Get it on sale if you want, it's fun and worth playing for a bit if you're into RTS games.

rymdkapsel is, dare I even make this comparison, like a good piece of IKEA furniture: Swedish names and manufacturers aside, both boast functional, elegant, and intelligent design, aim for broad appeal, and will require some work on the part of the buyer in order to dissect and construct the product into something beautiful. It's a simple game, echoed in its minimalistic graphics and intuitive control scheme, but it's surprisingly deceptive. Complexities are handled with exceptional grace; in many ways it's evocative of Tetris, that king of the casual digital pastime, not just in its mechanics but in its accessibility and gripping power. rymdkapsel deftly balances pensive downtime (building your station, managing resources and units) with punctuated bursts of frenzy (enemy attacks), and the difficulty gradually ramps up as your area expands and proper resource management becomes increasingly tricky. Every element is of critical importance to each other, and the agency provided means that no two games should play the same way. You can play to relax or to pursue a number of larger goals that provide replay value and foster a sense of ongoing improvement. These tasks may seem few, but you likely won't achieve them all in a game or two, nor does the game expect you will. You must work for these milestones, and before you know it you'll find the hours flying by as you drive the push out to the next monolith or fight off just one more wave of enemies.Some might be turned off by the game's slow pace, especially in the early-going, but those that stick with it will find reward, even if it outwardly seems short-lived. Once you’ve picked apart the game’s elaborate system and discovered the path to completing every task, there’s nothing else to see aside from a harder variation in Plus mode and a Zen mode that feels incomplete without periodic enemy invasions. Still, if you like puzzle games or real-time strategy, this meditative space odyssey is a killer time-killer.			"

												What you've got here is Dungeon Keeper with minimalist neon graphics, and achievement hunting instead of a campaign. There are only two levels (which are nearly identical), and if you unlock the four core achievements for a level, you get that level's ending. I'm a big Dungeon Keeper fan and I enjoy achievement hunting, so I really liked Rymdkapsel.			"

												Zen-like base management with a superb soundtrack. Or.. It's zen until it's not zen, and when it's not zen it's a whole lot of pewpew no no pewpew MORE FOOD pewpew JUST ONE MORE WAVE and then you start it over and it's all... Zen. Again. The new + mode is fun, and quite a bit harder. Optimization becomes more important than before, and hubris is struck down with red lazer beams from nasty evil enemies. Only thing I feel is kinda lacking would be keyboard shortcuts, but then there's something kind of nice and tactile to actually pull your little minions to their next job. It also makes it a bit more exciting when the enemy waves comes more frequently and you actually have to start moving around with some speed. As good as it was on the iPad, only now with more content. The sound is also way better when you plug in some nice speakers. A fine job by Salkinitzor!			"

												I really want to recommend this; it's got a neat 'space minimalism' theme going for it, the tetris-RTS gameplay is kind of its own thing, and it is really fun ... for the first playthrough or two.  Unfortunately, this is the sort of strategy game where the first time you play, you realize all your mistakes five minutes after you make them.  The second time, you realize what's pretty much an optimal strategy for the game.  From there, all you can do is tweak that strategy a little bit.  Also, there's a pretty obvious and easy way to futz the tetris-block-placement part of the gameplay and once you start doing that, the game is more about how OCD you want to be with the building placement than anything else.Fun for a couple of hours, but then the overall fun-to-work ratio gets much worse.  A pity, because like I said, there are some legitimately neat things about this game.			"

However it was critically acclaimed and so I gave it a shot having picked it up at the new lower price from the Steam sale. Boy was it worth it. Several hours in I find myself enjoying this very simple RTS strategy game with elements of resource management, building carefully and wavelike tower defense enemies. The game is simple to start and get into but before you know it an hour has passed and you are looking for more.There is a reason this game is lauded, it is addicting and fun. I reccomend you try it and see for yourself.			"

Tropico and other indirect controls just can't compete ))). The main purpose of the game is to build a colony with limited resources under the periodic attacks of the enemy. The buildings and colonists are schematic - but who really needs them? It's as always only you and the contest. All the others are schemes. Always. And this game only shows it in it's simplicity.

												Rymdkapsel is a decent little game, though I'd definitely recommend waiting for it to show up on sale before picking it up - it really only warrents a couple playthroughs - but it is a nice mix of the randomization of tetris and the strategy of a tower defense.

												The mix of resource management, tower defense and ""city builder"" makes an interesting genre combination.  That is all rymdkapsel is: an interesting idea lacking any substance. It is like a good puzzle game, but rymdkapsel does not give you a variety of challenges you would expect to get in a puzzle game (""it is too short""). If you don't mind me oversimplifying - you choose rooms to construct which are randomly tetris-shaped - then your job is to assign tasks to your minions (to construct or defend). But you do not control your minions directly, you only assign tasks, and if lucky the AI will do exactly what you want. Periodically waves of enemies will invade randomly destroying your minions and resources. You need to be challenged but the way the enemy work feels like your success is more based on luck. The graphics are simple pleasing geometric shapes. The soundtrack adds to the casual atmosphere and you never feel too threatened - until you suffer a major collapse of your minions and die the next wave. If you are interested in playing a time sensitive puzzle game, then rymdkapsel is a worthy purchase if it is on sale.			"

												A casual game with solid mechanics that, despite the weird looking screenshots, are perfectly balanced with its precise visuals. It is the kind of game were you are left wanting more - in fact I was just now desperately searching for more games like this - but sadly not the kind of game were playing the same levels again on a higher difficulty will do. If it came with an ""erase memory""-button, it'd be worth tripple-A money. As it is, it does not and is not, but I value it precisely as I would two beers at the price of one, which is to say highly.			"

												Tough to review but lets give it a shot.This game is wierd... but fun. I loved it the second I saw it and I don't know why, I guess its wierd in the way I like it.Basically, you are in space, and you have to build a 2D space station to defend against waves of enemie space ships which get progressively harder.This game is a great time passer if you are waiting for a game to update or the like...but it does have flaws, like the ability to replay the game, how is that a flaw? Well, there aren't many maps, when I played, it may have chanced, there was only 2, in the later game the enemies get stupidly hard, its just a waiting game until you die, and resources are limited, as in, none renewable.Why do I recommend it? I DON'T KNOW! Its a great little game and I loved it despite these flaws.			"

												I recommend you buy this one in the sales.It is a nice little game, emphasis on little, but made well. If only the idea was expanded with a little more depth then it would be a great game and would justify the price which I think is a little too much for what it offers as I am bored already.Maybe I will go back to it and try the further modes which offer more of a challenge by way of time constraints later.

												A surprisingly good game. Minimalistic but yet very involving, addictive and it's a game with replayability. The learning curve isn't too steep, the controls are basic but the strategy is definitely something that's going to take some practise. I really recommend this game, at first the look and concept sold it on me. But in my personal opinion I really am enjoying rymdkapsel immensly.			"

												At first, i saw this wonderful piece of minimalistic art on the app store. After I googled it, I saw that it is also available on Steam. i bought it and i love it so much. Everything works so well. the developers said to themselves that they would rather make a game without big gameplay elements or ultra realistic graphics, but instead make a game that works. And that it for sure, this game works!!! If you have some Steam money, buy it. It is definitly worth it. But i think it would be cool if there was an update that features new(bigger) maps, maybe one or two more enemies, and maybe some customisation to the weapon systems or something so that is like a rts with some tiny rpg and td mechanicsBut I recommend this to anyone!

												A fun and interesting game, rymdkapsel keeps you entertained for some time. Although it does have some fun to it, it is difficult to enjoy when the game is made in such a strange fashion that it begins to lag up your computer. 7/10 because of the laggy game and because of the overall price.

												Is your time of value to you? Do you seek to get the most out of every moment? Are you prepared to pay a few quid to make those moments special, if onl;y in your imagination?If so, move on quickly. Don't waste your time on this game, or even this review.There's about an hour's worth of ""entertainment"" in this game, most of which is the unrequited anticipation of the game expanding in ways you imagine it might. At first I did worry about those finite resources (the little pink flakes) and I was right to. Once they are exhausted the game is all but over.You have weapons that are never upgraded, enemies that never change, base functions that are never enhanced.The zen mode is particularly pointless. If it was a matter of building a functioning base, with resource management and exploration playing a part it would be fine, but there's none of that.Your minions are born when you create ""quarters"" which implies that the quarters will be required to sustain the minions, but once the quarter has spawned it's allocated two minions you can reclaim it and the minions are retained, sleeping when idle wherever they fall!Once you figure that out the main strategic aim of the game (to survive attack after attack) becomes much easier as you reclaim the resources of quarters after each spawning. Use those resources to build weapons. Get to the monoliths.Yaaawwwn.It's like the first level of a good strategy game.			"

												Minimalism is, counter-intuitively, a complex idea. What begins with the simple maxim, ""Less is more,"" evolves into a study in negative space, contrast and juxtaposition, color, and the quintessential expression of an idea. It's an incredibly challenging discipline to adhere to and execute faithfully.It's easy to see that rymdkapsel is a minimalist game. Stylistically this much is obvious. But this game embodies the whole spirit of minimalism. It does not merely conflate low-fidelity with minimalism, as some 8- and 16-bit styled indie titles do.Rymdkapsel is a space sim. You control a tetrad-bound space station with little people in it. The presents you with one essential goal: survive. The fundamental strategy to do so is easily explained with the in-game tutorial and involves a handful of room types. How these rooms behave play into a neat and concise set of rules with no caveats and special cases.There is a fine balance here between simple game play and flexibility of strategy. It might seem that there is a master strategy one could use, but the expression of that strategy allows a great deal of variance and keeps it interesting from game to game.You could say that there are optional goals like ""research all the monoliths"", but those are just advanced constructs of the same root goal. Researching monoliths provides passive improvement to your space citizens, so the purity of the one goal is not diluted. You are never really required to pursue this. Artificial constructs like 'achievements' might goad you to, but in truth, you don't really ""get"" anything for doing so.Games rarely last more than an hour. A natural escalation of aggression guarantees that, in the end, you will lose. Recall that the goal of the game is to survive - the metric, therefore, is how long you can. Consider: a strategy game that terminates like an endless line runner. The elegance of this solution is a little mind-blowing.I enjoy this game quite a good deal and would recommend it to anyone looking for an engaging sim with low game-to-game time investment. This was a hit on tablets and I waited for the PC version to pick it up; it plays wonderfully and I don't get the sense that anything was lost in translation.			"

It's good for about 3 hours of play time until you beat everything in it at this point, which is not worth $8. It would be awesome if the maker would release the source code, or at least some of it so it could be modded. Overall, 2.5/5, only because it's too short.

It's harder then it looks and it's a real challenge to get the achievements lik ""Survive for 28 waves"" or exploring all the monoliths within 32 minutes. The Zen-mode is a nice addition to the game with it's more slow gameplay without enemies. One playthrough takes approx 1h and it takes a few games to ""master"" it and then there is the + level which is a bit harder. It's somehow alot of gameplay for the money and such a simple looking game!    It's minimalistic but at the same time a ""big"". 9/10			"

												It seems good in the beginning with a great concept but it is very repetative and becomes frustrating. It is very slow paced so expect to waiting a lot while your minions take forever to do anything; then at a certain point the waves become so frequant that it is impossible to move them out of their defensive position. Also, since there is a limit to how close you can build your defensive rooms the enemies can all spawn together, coming from the same direction and nothing can stop them. I feel that this game really need to be re-worked and isn't worth the money to buy it (I think I spent about £8 on it)			"

												I bought this game yesterday on a whim, because it looked like a neat RTS base building game, of which I am a big fan. The main complaint I have is that the AI in this game is incredibly stupid. Multiple (if not all) of my minions will work on the same project, hauling the same parts, even if that part isn't needed. Any time that the minion's ""orders"" change, it pauses and thinks for a solid second before moving again. It is also frustrating that you do not have control over which minions get moved to which jobs, it just grabs at seemingly random.I plan to play this game more in the future, but I am still somewhat flustered over the mobile port aspect. I would recommend this game, hopefully they remedy these issues a bit.			"

My only complain, and it's a pretty small on in my oppinion, is that the Zen mode is literally the normal game but without enemies and acheivements, I don't mind that all that much, but I'd honestly been expecting to at least explore a larger world, eventually I just ran out of materials to build with, and had to stop playing the Zen mode or would have had to restart it.

												Short and sweet, “rymdkapsel” is quite a feat despite its simplicity.  I find that it has an addicting quality about it, almost begging me to find the perfect station layout even though the block shapes randomly generate in the que.  It’s simple enough to where the learning curve is light, but challenging enough that I feel compelled to do better the next time around.  While this game has been out for over a year now on other peripherals (Android, iOS, etc.), I’m very glad that it came to the PC as I probably wouldn’t have known that it existed…considering how much I enjoy playing “rymdkapsel”, that would have been a real shame.  My only gripe is the lack of game modes and options…after a game or two, you’ll see all there is to see.  Still, do yourself a favor and try “rymdkapsel”…you might not be able to pronounce it, but by gosh, you’ll more than likely have fun playing it. Final Verdict: 9/10You can check out the full review and video play sessions here:http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/rymdkapsel/

												It's a neat little time managament game, sorely lacking the ability to order specific units around. Often times you'll have units across the station respond to an order, while a closer unit ignores it. That in itself is annoying, but wouldn't be so bad if the the minion AI wasn't stupid. In addition to selecting units across the station to perform a task instead of a closer one,  you will frequently see your minions carrying more resources than are needed to a room.Do not buy in current state.

												This is a really good space strategy-sim which starts off real slow and with each passing enemy wave, gets quicker. One playthrough would last around an hour.The game has two levels compared to just the one on mobile. You'd need to play each level probably 3 times to master it, and then another few times to complete all objectives. It can be a bit repetitive in that sense, where you replay the same level again and again, but the objectives/achievements should spur you on. Game runs well enough, soundtrack is meditative and the visuals minimalistic yet exquisite. Not everyone will like this game though. Same may point to its repetitiveness, some to the ""dumb AI"" (if there ever is such a thing), but I do. Try playing the game without seeking tips/guides. Reason is when you discover these ""tricks"", the game will just be a chore. Over time, you'll see what I'm talking about, but better you discover them for yourself after a few playthroughs.			"

I do all my reviews in a similar fashion so I can cross-reference and check whether I'm being honest with myself. Ratings for categories range from 0-10 and the final rating ranges from 0-100 but is not the sum of the other ratings - they do not all have the same importance. I'm trying to be as objective as possible, but needless to say this is a subjective view of a user.I only play games on PC on Windows and Linux with mouse and keyboard, so I cannot give any analysis to how well games work with controllers or on Mac.Playtime at last review update: 2.3 hoursDescriptionRymdkapsel is a light/casual strategy game.StoryNo story.0/10VisualsIt has very simple isometric graphics, which is largely fine for the game. Unfortunately even that simple graphics style could have used a little refinement. Especially the background is downright embarassing - it's a spinning black background with stripes on it. Even if you like the graphics and think they fit the game as I do there's nothing special here.3/10SoundThe background music is monotone and annoying. The sound effects are minimalistic but fit the game, but also nothing special here. 2/10ControlsYou control with the mouse. The controls work fine for what's offered. 10/10OptionsNearly no options in this one. Colorblind mode, tutorial messages on or off, sound on or off (no separate options, no sliders), fullscreen or not and screen scaling, which zooms the game in or out (I assume that's for the lack of resolution options). This is one of the most minimalistic options menus I have ever seen. It doesn't even have a real difficulty setting or save slots. 0/10GameplayYou have a couple of minions that are responsible for everything that's happening on your space station. There are a couple of ressources that have to be transported and some building blocks that you can place and your minions have to build. All you can do, though, is assign minions to certain very broad tasks (or should I say task groups) like construction, base defense, food supply and so on. This is not inherently bad and clearly the idea of the game, but it just doesn't work at all with their AI. Example: one task group is construction. Let's say I put all my 10 minions into construction with 4 building jobs on the space station available, each one needs 2 kinds of ressources. Then all the minions will attempt to do the same thing, i.e., move to the ""first"" ressource, load up, and run to the first construction site. Of course, because they have the same speed, all of them will arrive there at approximately the same time at which point the 2nd to 10th minion will realize that that ressource is no longer needed because the first minion already supplied it. They will then look for another building that needs that ressource or go get another ressource. So basically there's no point assigning a lot of minions to one task because their AI doesn't realize which ressources are already being supplied. This pretty much breaks the game because time for movement is of essence in this game. The idea was good but the execution is terrible in my opinion. I assume this could have been patched to something more enjoyable in a matter of a few hours. Even if it would work a little better there's not much to do. It's pretty much a waiting game. The strategy is not very deep. The game modes available are pretty much all the same, just with easier or harder waves of enemies or no enemies at all. 1/10ContentAfter you've played a game you've pretty much seen it all. If you're not completely bugged out by the broken mechanics at that point you might play a few more to get better at what you're doing, but content wise there's nothing there.1/10PlatformsAvailable on Windows, Mac and Linux/SteamOS and runs fine on the first and the last of those. 10/10PerformanceThis game is almost 2d and has around 20-30 colors including shades. You can run it on a glorified toaster.10/10ExternalNo external EULA or similar crap.10/10Price (relative to content)Full price is 6.99 EUR or regional equivalent. On sale you can get it as low as 2.79 at which point I would still not get it because it has nearly no content. In my opinion you're better off playing some flash games online for free. If you desperately want to play this still, wait for it to come out in a bundle or be on really heavy sale, because my bet is you'll be disappointed. 2/10DLCNo DLC.Fortunately.Other/Indie or not indieIndieFinal CommentsBelieve it or not, I like simple strategy games like this one a great deal. But this game has really disappointed in its mechanics. I don't care much for graphics, but the gameplay has to be fun, and this game brings nothing to the table at all. That being said, if you still think this might be for you, the price is relatively low as an absolute value, so you won't have to go hungry if you get it and find out it sucks just as much as I said it did.

												...But it's a cautious recommendation. Just be forewarned that the game has limited replayability, though it wouldn't surprise me if Rymdkapsel is the kind of game that I'd play for a session of two every month for the next year.This is the kind of game that one can write a reasoned review for after just a couple of hours. The minimalist art style is at once efficient and iconic--the kind of style that, if adopted by other games, one may remark: ""Oh, yeah, that's very Rymdkapsel-ly."" A bit awkward for the mouth, but like Rymdkapsel, efficient.Rymdkapsel is a real-time, pausable strategy game in which you select from a series of 4-block segements to build a contiguous base--they call it a space station, but it would work for a variety of genres. You must manage three different resources--which, like the rest of the game, are represented by simple geometric shapes of differing colors--all of which have slightly different generation mechanics. The modules of the station are few, the minions relatively mindless, but the mechanic is tight: a stubborn completionist should get several hours out of the game before figuring out how to complete the last ""mission goal"".There's not much of a tutorial to speak of, nor multiple play modes, nor much of anything outside of the primary mechanic: ""given this limited toolset for this type of problem, how do you solve it?"" Your first two-three playthroughs may seem a bit harried, especially toward the end--warning/spoiler: don't bother trying to build anything after wave 22--but as you warm to the mechanic it'll become an exciting quandary to tackle.Much like Sudoku, this game is initially difficult to learn; one derives the most pleasure from solving it after the first 20-30 tries; but once you've got it down pat, it's much more of a lower-state-of-consciousness time sink. Not that that's bad.			"
