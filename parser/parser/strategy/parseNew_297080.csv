SummaryAn airplane landing control tower game set in space. The game mechanics work and it's pick up and play, the space environment sets this game apart from other airplane landing games and it works. It has some bugs and I have a few minor quibbles with the gameplay, but it's worth the purchase.PROS:   Fun and absorbing. The game sucks you in as you try and move ships from one wormhole to the other. You have to compensate for inertia, asteroids and even other ships, all while doing it as fast as possible.  The devs didn't reinvent the wheel, they just made it cooler. You're going to be familiar with the game concepts almost immediately and that's a good thing. Sometimes you just want gameplay mechanics to be tried and true and in this case they are. The difference now is that the mechanics incorporate the realities of space flight instead of terrestrial flight. It's a clever twist on a theme that we know works.  Station Building. In gameplay terms it's sort of like having to land the airplane while building new parts of the airport at the same time. It adds some tension to the game and makes it far more interesting than your average control tower game. It adds a whole new tactical element to the game because there are potential upgrades if you pass a level, which in turn might make the next level easier.  Responsive Devs. This isn't really why the game is fun per se but I mention it because this is an indie game and it has some bugs. The steam forum page has a bugs sticky and they listen to the bug reports and send out game patches. They also included a bug reporter within the game so all you have to do is copy-paste the text in the forum to let them know what went wrong.CONS:  You can't remove stations. I don't understand why this can't be implemented. It seems so basic to be able to click on one and delete it or sell it for some of your money back.  It's Buggy. I've experienced crashes to desktop, my right mouse button not working, and a misalignment of text vs where you actually click. I reported all these things to the developer and they've been able to send out a patch within a day that solved a number of my problems. I still get some bugs, but the response rate from the devs is great. "

NavpointThis review was last edited when I had completed the 4th levelShort ReviewI found this to be a very addictive and fairly challenging 2D real time strategy game which at the time of this review was the best new game I'd played in 2015. Highly recommended.Long ReviewBest described as a space traffic control game this game is one of those rare gems where a novel idea is well executed with extremely addictive gameplay. Gameplay is in 2D, real time and whilst it can get quite frantic there is a large strategic element required to win the game.The game is entirely mouse driven, can run in a window and can be paused. To get you started there is a small tutorial that took me around 15-20 minutes to complete and gave me enough of an insight to understand the basics of the game. Your progress is saved at the end of each level and there is an option to restart any level.The basic premise of the game is to direct space craft that appear through jump gates to their destination, avoiding other space craft and obstacles such as other space craft, asteroids etc. This is done by selecting a direction and speed but with the added complication that current velocity is also taken into account. You have to constantly move from space craft to space craft, fine tuning its path to its destination.You can also spend money to build space stations to perform such tasks as refuelling, repair & customs checking, directing any spacecraft into the statons sphere of influence for them to take advantage of the services. Some space craft have a timer for their destination to be reached. Alerts can happen at any time and add a bit of spice by introducing events like doubling the number of space craft appearing or having to keep a named space craft at maximum speed for a set duration.The objectives vary depending on the game mode but are basically to maintain as high a rating as you can by keeping the number of ships lost to collisons to a minimum and to earn as much money as you can by successfully getting a space craft to its destination and also from bonuses such as refuelling. There are two modes you can play in:Standard Game These last around 5-10 minutes. Your aim is achieve a rating of at least B in the time allocated. Your game ends if you lose too much money or too many space craft. For successfully completing levels you are given the option to purchase enhancements and a new level is opened up to youFree play These go on indefinitely with shifts of around 5-10 minutes. Your game ends if you lose too much money or too many space craft. At the end of each shift you are given the option to purchase enhancements. Successfully completeing a shift opens up different levels.ProsNice simple, ""clean"" graphics displayNovel conceptGreat gameplayRe-playing the same level gives different gameplay depending on the strategy you employA game that can be played for just 10 minutes or several hours at a timeConsMy main gripe is that the game still suffers from a number of bugs, i.e. it does occasionally crash to the desktop, options can sometimes be unselectable such as the  the build menu, and when in window mode I have to click above where you would expect to click. However, I have to say that these are minor gripes and irritate but do not spoil the overall gameplay.Once things start to go wrong I generally find it is too difficult to pull them aroundThe playing area on my monitor is slightly larger than my screen area and so I need to scroll an inch or so to access the edges of the playing area and I have to say this adds nothing to the gameplay; it's just irritatingThe mouse is sometimes a little unresponsive when trying to set the space craft velocity. This only only really an issue when the game is at its most frantic I'd have liked more levels with a more gradual increase in difficultyMarks Out Of 55) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted1) Not worth getting even if given away freeWhere I got the game fromI paid £2.94 on   IndieGala  Store [www.indiegala.com] and at that price it was an excllent dealPlatform Played OnIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, Standard Mouse. Played at 1440x900 resolutionMy best guess for a PEGI rating7 : The only criteria I can see that could increase if from 3 is the reference to people dying when ships collide. However, I doubt whether many children below 7 would actually have the ability to play. It is well beyond my 6 year old son.			"

Product received for free
												Great little indie game. The gameplay is pretty hard after all this is a space traffic strategy meaning, that you have to deal with asteroids, smugglers, ships that need mid-flight refuels and repairs, as well as ships that need to drop off cargo for another ship to pick up. Gameplay does get tough at making you take tough choices on what ships to repair and refuel.			"
