												Play this game! There's nothing to lose! I could really see this game become a top-strategy game with enough time. Galcon 2 is a free-to-play game that truly deserves to be called free-to-play. The game is quick to learn, with a helpful tutorial right off the bat. The strategy aspect is cleraly evident and this game is 100% skill-based. I'm hooked to this game and, if you don't mind. I'm gonna get back to playing the game now.			"

												For a game as easy to get into as Galcon it is incredibly deep and rewarding. I've played previous iterations of the game and I've enjoyed them all and Galcon 2, with the addition of its online play, is a worthy addition to the series. It's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of Real Time Strategy games.			"

												TL;DR Galcon 2 is a high quality, fast paced, indie RTS and it's totally free. No matter if you're looking for something to play for a couple minutes to pass the time, or you want an RTS that you can really dig into and master Galcon 2 is for you. Actual review: Alright, I may as well throw a review out there for Galcon 2. Long story short I've been playing different versions of Galcon since mid 2008. I've always loved real-time strategy games, and Galcon (being the very core of what makes them great) hooked me instantly. Galcon takes the idea of an RTS and condenses it into it's purist form. No spending the first 5-10 minutes building up your base, scouting the enemy, making sure you build the right units to counter your opponent. You have planets that generate ships, those ships can be sent to attack other planets to generate more ships or left to defend your planets. Now add 8 or so other people and you get an action packed fast paced arcade style RTS. The game is super easy to learn, there's a tutorial, single-player bots with a wide range of difficulty levels, and even a co-op mode to play with your friends against bots. Once you've got the hang of it, multiplayer is a whole new world. Galcon 2 is the very definition of easy to learn, hard to master.To top it all off, this version is totally free. The only micro-transactions are cosmetic, running a tournament, or running your own server which you really only need if you want to run mods (did I mention the game is modable?). You don't need to pay a penny to get the full experience, plus you can earn the in-game currency over time (but I'm not going to dive into that system here).The community around this game is also dedicated and nice, there's always someone willing to help teach you if you'd like to learn more, just visit the forums and ask.Anyway, I'm absolutely biased, like I said I've been playing versions of this game for 5 or 6 years now. I also currently help moderate the forums, and have admined past versions of the game. But I've only stuck around this long because I really do love the game and it's community.If you've ever got any questions about the game, want help getting better, or just a friendly face to play some rounds with, feel free to message me (Chi-Ro) on the website and I'll be happy to help!https://www.galcon.com/forums/msg.php?action=compose "

												I boot up the game, flash through the tutorial, and quickly get onto multiplayer to rek sum n00bz:Game 1:5 seconds in my neighbor sends all his ships at me, making both him and I lose all our ships and get swept by someone else.Game 2:I decide to wait out Free-4-All untill people get to their senses about how the game works...and move on to team battles.I spawn between the other team and get double penetrated hard as my teamates watch in horror. We lose.Game 3: I head back to FFA to try my luck again. I spawn in a dense planetary area with low capture requirement. My neighbors were too buisy killing each other from the start and I held out expanding my empire of glorious dongers untill it was time to strike. Everyone else was worn out and most large planets were captured by me while the pesants were fighting their futile wars. My final enemy had 1 small planet left...I sent all my glorious dongers to make them watch in horror as waves of them flooded this planet.Before the game ended I decided to be chivalrous and surrender the game for the hell of it....I realized the dammed purples had another small secluded planet left which was shrouded by all my glorious white dongers in the epic final battle...Purple won that game.10/10 Would play again.I've played Galcon Fusion for may years, I was overjoyed when Hassey Enterprise decided to bring out another Galcon game to the series...Its free also which is a surprise. Believe it or not but this game needs stratagy, little triangles take over galaxies may seem innocent at first...once you delve into this game there is no going back. This♥♥♥♥♥♥is addictive and free.TL:DR- Play it, its free. Always suicide purple. Always. "

												If you want a game to play for a few minutes, Galacon 2: Galactic Conquest is the right choice.Galacon, is a colourful point and click zerg strategy game that focuses on destroying the enemies planets.(It also has a helpful tutorial for begginers)Although this game is free, it does offer pay options which are purely cosmetic. (like ships skins etc)Overall I give this game a thumbs up, And I reccommend this game to everyone to try.			"

												Holy sh*t this game is underplayed. Its good. Real good. This game is like agario - not the gameplay, but the fact that you can just jump in and play quickly. Joint with AdVenture Capitalist, it is currently my favourite game on steam. As far as I am aware, you can't pay for gameplay bonuses, merely aesthetics. Its a really quick download so just try the tutorial and you will see. Come and increase the community size today!Edit: still playing with 75 hours, game's still got depth and there are still people much much better than me (though I am now better than many). This game is timeless and awesome. Just discovered tournaments - where all the big boys play, here you can stay longer if you've more time on your hands. If you've read this review then you've no excuse to not come and have a good time, so join in!			"

												Galcon is an EXTREMELY fast-paced RTS game. In fact, most Galcon matches take less than a minute to be decided. However, due to its learning curve(plus game-specific quirks), new players will lose matches very quickly, very often.The game supports microtransactions, but they only include cosmetic items(and it's possible to earn premium currency by winning tournaments, bets or by being given them by other players as a ""good game"" reward). However, time played still plays a massive role in how likely a player is to win matches, partly because of skill differences, partly because of an upgrade system based on gameplay frequency allowing players to receive more units at a match's start or produce/move them faster. New players get the advantage of being able to see how many forces opponents have, but this isn't very useful as more skilled players tend to not send all of their ships at once to an enemy planet, can produce enough ships to stop the attack, or send in reinforcements to that planet before your ships arrive to attack it.The upgrade system uses diminishing returns for match rewards as an anti-poopsocking mechanic similar to CSGO's weekly XP boost/reduction, but with a continuous reset. A player playing for 15 minutes 2~3 times a day is going to get as many points as someone playing continuously, disincentivizing grinding. As such, it's possible to get a sufficiently competitive upgrade level by playing the game casually for 1~2 weeks.			"

												Loved Galcon Fusion and this sequel is an overall improvement; the best minimalist strategy game that I have tried. Learning curve can be a bit steep, but it's really rewarding once you get the hang of it.Galcon 2 brings (slightly) improved graphics and, most importantly, an already larger player base. This means way less waiting time compared to Galcon Fusion.My one complaint is the F2P structure of the game. I do not like that in order to change your color in-game, or to setup a custom map, you need to spend in-game currency. Initially you have to buy currency, but afterwards it is possible to have your ""investment"" grow through the betting system. So in theory, if you're good at it, you could just pay once, and then just slowly build your fortune of in-game currency. But still, I would much rather just pay once and own the game and all features.Overall though, still an awesome game. Try it!			"

												I recommend this to mac users who have been craving a simple RTS like Red Alert 2. Only this time the only unit in the game are Engineers which take over bases. And that the bases are actually Planets. Oh and the Engineers are actually triangles. Great game, I've played a couple of hours straight so far and have not noticed many overpowered pay 2 win players Pros: Friendly Community, Addicting yet satisfying gameplay, and it's free. Cons: Encountering a highly upgraded player is a bit cheap, thankfully though they made a lobby for newbie players like me :). "

												Galcon 2 is the RTS genre boiled to its core. Its simplicity is really the only thing that makes this game great.tl;dr RTS fans should try, improved from previous game, can get quite repetitiveI played a lot of Galcon Fusion (this game's predecessor) where there are only 2 popular modes: Classic and Teams. Classic is a free for all, which means the last man standing wins. Games often take longer than they should, and the inevitable fact is that camping is usually the best strategy. Some rounds can even last over an hour, and for a game like this, that's far too long. On the other hand, Teams games are extremely brief and therefore more engaging, but it can often feel more like a ""clicking competition"" than a game of tactics.Thankfully, Galcon 2 added several new modes, including King of the Hill which is my personal favorite (it combines the strategy/independence of Classic with the intensity/speed of Teams). The new modes are definitely the greatest feature, but there's some other new things too. Betting and tournaments both raise the stakes and keep things interesting for advanced players, although clan wars are unnecessary and really don't work well with this kind of game. Almost like the developer said ""Clan wars sound cool... idk, might as well try it!"" That doesn't matter though, you can just play the actual game!So it's a great game, but you have to realize that it's both free to play and limited in its features. Don't expect countless hours out of it, and don't expect you won't get bored of it... but definitely try it. Fun to play once in a while.			"

												Although there's definetly some fun gameplay behind this game, it's shrouded by the toxic views towards new players, kinda like League of Legends except much less salty. The thing that really gets me about the game is that you have to pay, with real money, to actually obtain the money that you won in your game, taking away from the overall sense of victory and achievement. Overall, the idea itself is good, but it's infested with microtransactions and generally mean players. I'm glad I haven't wasted any money on this yet.[Edit: Turns out the pay2win aspect was purely cosmetic. Still, I hold my views.]			"

												Honestly, pick it up. No premuim pay to win, (Exept for galcoins, Those i have no idea how to get without paying, but of course, i can't find a gameply-changing use for them either) Free so no hole in your pocket even if you don't like it, and gameplay-wise, It's a very cool simplified conquest game. For new players: (I'm not a swarming veteran, but i have collected a few hours of play-time) Watch out for Free-For-all - There's some insane strategy that allows you to have hundreds of triangles swarming a planet in a matter of seconds. I don't use it and have no ideo how it works, but it will kill you if you don't have more than 1000 Triangles To spare. Devs, Take that simple advice as a point to fix- I wanna play FFA, But i can't because of this swarming strategy. Or i could be a babbling idiot, I'm not a Dev myself and have almost no idea what i'm talking about here. But Hey! It was free, so nothing lost. I just prefer Co-op.			"

												0.5 hours into the game: have been obliterated by someone, nuked, obliterated and pulverised a bot.Ok, so that was the IGN joke that has been used 1,000,000,000,000,000 times, now let's be serious. This can run on any ccomputer that can run steam, is free to play, and not the free to play with microtransactions EVERYWHERE, but the free to play where you have optional cosmetics. I don't think you earn currency (Galcoins) but you start with 50 (enough to buy 2 planet colors). And other than that, that's all I can say other than PLAY IT NOW! RATING 8/10			"

												Fast paced strategy, simple rules and complex tactics.  This is the best Galcon yet.  It is a unified version that pits iOS, Android and Steam players all in a single lobby so the full experience is present in every version be it portable or not.  Additional game modes, clans and tournaments are nice, but what I've noticed is that a single tweak has completely removed the long stalemates between two stubborn Grand Admirals.  An extended peace leads to a revolt to the largest player, meaning that the game actively encourages the largest player to end the game quickly.			"

 Galcon 2  is a RTS game at its simplest form, where you capture planets which produce troops, and basically wreck some peeps (or get wrecked) with armies of triangles!!! (lines, snowflakes and other shapes also available). The community is usually very helpful and you can have some banter while waiting for the next game to start.There are sometimes tournaments on where the high ranked peeps battle it out for some IGM (In Game Money) and you can bet on who will win...The only way to see if you like this sort of game is to play it!You can have illuminati troops			"

												Galcon 2: Galactic Conquest is a simple free to play PVP game.  It worked, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  If you play PVP, the strategy is to take over many of the large neutral planets faster than the opponent and then start taking out the opponents planets.  There is a simple AI map for tutorial. Has clans, CoOp, team maps.  This is a cross-platform game.Try it, maybe you might like it, if you like PVP.  If you don't like losing or playing against players, you might give this game up.For more info:

												Galcon 2 is one of the best strategy games to come out on Steam this year.  It is free, fun, and has a huge community of players.  It is a real time strategy game where you send your ships to take over other planets.  There are four main modes, FFA, Teams, Co-Op, and Frenzy (FFA but all planets have an owner).  It's free and a small download so I won't waste your time talking about the intracies of a game that appears to be so simple on the surface.  However, I want to commend on the pure of speed of getting into games.  You can be from click play game on Steam into an actual match  in less than 8 seconds.  I'm not exaggerating, it is so lightning quick and easy. Finally, I want to bring to your attention that the Free to Play model of this game is one of the best implementations in gaming.  There is no way to buy anything that will make you better.  Galcoins only allow for customization, creating groups, or creating servers.  I already have 80+ hours, and I fully recommend this game if you enjoy strategy gaming.			"

												For a quick little game that keeps you entertained, it's awesome.Draws you in with it's quick game play, and easy difficulty setting.Then slowly lures you into harder and harder difficulties, causing you to hate how the computer and click on multiple things at once. Frustrating. Did I mention there is a frustration mode where the other side has a stupidly huge advantage and you frustratingly tear your hair out while they slowly conquer the entire world as you know it?11/10 would pay nothing for this great game again.

												It is good, but it could be great. Its simple, yet comlicated, like a game of checkers, but lacks any sort of charm. It needs to take its self a little more serious. Like maybe wood backgrounds, and the little ships are marbles going towards indentions in the board. Also I think this is being a turn based games has much more promise then how it is, which there is a mod for.			"

												I like Galcon 2, it reminds me of a fun flash game I played once. In my opinion the game is simple, and the most important thing to master is speed and timing. The objective is to move your ships from one planet to another capturing as many as you can, each planet produces more ships. To win you must capture all of the enemys planets. Galco 2 is multiplayer free to play. so there is no harm in trying it! the game is pretty small, so if you want a game that takes up little space, or has low requirments, this is also a good bet!

												A neat little game. I'm not the best strategy gamer so don't take my word for it, but it seems like this game has some pretty deep strategic depth to it. This makes this game genius because it's based on such a simple concept that one could pick up on in less than a minute. The best thing to compare it to is Risk except it's live instead of turn-based, there is no randomness, and there is no explicit indication of how strong your enemy's forces are. You have to rely solely on skill, quick thinking, and your ability estimate your opponent based on your awareness of the battlefield.I haven't missed out on any gameplay elements that I'm aware of even though it's free-to-play. It seems like all transacations in the game are for cosmetic changes. You have nothing to lose by trying it out, and if you are an RTS fan this really ought to be something to try.			"

												The maps are not big enough and the spawns are too close together. If the developer really wanted the game to be fair they would spawn the players farther apart on MUCH larger maps. The maps as they are are WAY too small for any kind of real strategic gameplay. If the developer decides at some point to add much larger maps where the players spawn much farther apart this game will actually be a strategy title and not just a cluster ****.			"

												PROS:This game has the best story I have ever seen in any game, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, and even fell a few times.The motion capture graphics are the first thing that struck me when playing this game, absolutely stunning, it is optimized so well almost any computer could easily run it at max settings and maintain 60 fps, it even made me cry a little bit. The spaceships in “Galcon 2” are the most realistic physical depictions of spaceships in a video game to date. The amount of technology available overwhelms the player.FREE GAME! Honestly, this should be priced at $60, maybe even more.The combat: It is amazing, you have high-detail next gen spaceships at your disposal, ready to attack enemy planets. There are so many different colors you can be, every time I am a new color, I feel like I am being born again, there is so much variety in the colors and the way they attack.Multiplayer: With internet getting about 4kb/s, I feared I wouldn't be able to play online, boy was I wrong. For the first time, I was able to play an online game without lag. I played with my friends and we worked together to conquer the planets. There are so many different gamemodes to pick from, I felt overwhelmed. Soundtrack: The music in this makes me want to get up and dance in the middle of my game. The song is constantly stuck in my head all day, but I actually like having this song in my head.Extras: +While playing the game there are neutral planets, all of these have clever, realistic names to them, adding more atmosphere to the game. +I just can't stop talking about the graphics, I literally fell backwards when I first opened the game, I felt as if I was actually in space. +Online, with eight people playing simultaneously, it's hard to even put into words. There's just so much happening at once, so fast, without any lag too.Galcon 2 might be the craziest, most intense video game experience I've had in years, but it's also amazing. With stunning graphics, beautiful music, intense, fast paced battles, and so much variety, I couldn't think of one way to improve this game.Final Score: 11/10 - Best game I have ever played in my life. Game of the century. I would be shocked if I managed to find a game better than this. "

												Ah Galcon the game of numbers and rage quitting because you got your♥♥♥♥♥kicked.Don't let the downvote fool you, I LOVE this game and have been playing it for a long time, probably have 150+ hours on my phone, but thats it. I prefer it on my phone.This game was designed to be played on a phone or  tablet, its touch and go. The controls for PC are horrid, I found it hard to play, the planets were WAY too big for the screen... to the point that the only way you would be able to play it properly is if you had a wireless mouse and could sit 3 meters back to see everything.Thats the only downside, other than that this is a fantastic game and I suggest that anybody and everybody play!

												idk what strategy thsi game was planning but all that thinking goes away when it comes to higher leels of play, what i'd consider the basic level of play becuase after the tutorial, i couldnt see enemy numbers anymore....  i dont get what is going on or what enemy planets are weka anymore or anything like that.right off the tutorial, the game had me go up against an AI who seemed to have an unlimited supply of ships, after tkaing a few planets there was just a massive swarm of ships from his side to mine.... i could no longer strategize in this game because there's no longer any planning if i cant tell how many numbers are on the planets or even how fast the growth rate is.  the tutorial was good and short but this massive jump in difficulty killed the game for me.  im not sure how online play would work but im guessing itd be simular to what i experienced, not knowing anyhting useful except for your own planets' growth adn the nuetral planets.... thats not strategy.... strategy requires thought and consequences for actions, i cant strategize agianst a foe that has all their information unknown and hidden to me.  at that point, anyhtign i do to conquer their planets is going to be either ""they jsut captured it so there's less numbers on it"", or simply ""i dont know"".  this isnt strategy, this is the opposite of strategy, planning and consequences are strategy, not whatever optimization the computer has done.  the game is full of glitches on my mac, every steam notification makes the current menu screen vanish till i bring up a new one.  this makes doing anything rather cumbersome and only hurt the experience more for me.  a personal point but still.

												This game directly markets itself as a Strategy game it may be true if you are first Lucky, and don't get hosed by the RNG declairing that all of the nutral planets around you are highly defended to conqure, or if you are Lucky enough not to get singled out by the random people you are matched with.  Currently the blatant false advertising of games is getting anoying now they are on the free market with direct lies about their product.  Personally the massively RNG based portion of this game out weighs any strategy that you can come up with, not only is this hostile to the new players but it means that like most action movies you cannot plan ahead until your Luck shows up.  I cannot recomened this to anyone that i play games with nor can i even point out on a stream, or game review that strategy has anything to do with an RNG based Risk type game.			"

												This game is terrible, since getting I haven't slept for three days, my work think I'm ill with laryngitis, my wife's threatening to leave, but I still can't stop playing :(And that's not the worst... I can't focus on anything more than a foot away, everything looks bland and colorless, people look like planets, words look like triangles, is this enough yet? have I beaten you now? or do I need to use more ships ?10/10 would ruin my health again.

												This game used to be very good, in short, it was entirely based on skill, take other planets, be the last man standing, micromanage wiselyWith the GEMS update, Phil decided to slow everyones ship down, and upgrade/grind for gems, which are used to bring your stats back up to normal, as if it were before the update, which takes the skill out of the game entirely~ElMeiser Tl:dr good game, bad update (Fixed, partially)EDIT: Re recommending this game because Phil did remedy this, he made all accounts created before the update to get auto upgraded, ignore the previous statement above, still good game			"

												Well this game ws a shock to me. When i first happened upon this game i thought it was just your basic little flash game copy... Well it is a hell of a lot deeper than that! Theres a bloody galactic map and factions and bunch of other general mishmash that is extremely uncomon for this genre. The base gameplay is that of a better than average cheap flash rts. But the community (Still somewhat small) is quite nice. This is game that is mostly played by people with ipads nd phones... BUT for a app store game gone steam its not bad at all. Altough i do admit it is more challenging to play with a mouse than touchscreen.  All in all i would recommend this game. (Played 2 hours as of this comment)			"

I don't see any strategy in this game, it's just a race game in which players compete who captures all the planets fastest...			"

Even I can tell its fun from my short game time. The soundtrack is good, the community are great and the fun to find is greater. 10000/10 for me.Fun hint! go into the ""mods"" tab on the menu.

												Very good game so far! Basically what you do is send your ships to different planets to capture them. When you capture planets, they start generating more ships. Use your ships to capture every planet on the map, but beware! The enemy force will be trying to capture all of the planets as well, and will even capture your planets! Overall, very enjoyable and fun, no glitches, bugs or errors! 8/10!			"

												This game can be really frustrating sometimes. This game is about 60% luck and 40% skill. With its randomly generated maps, you may have a great advantage with nearby planets of a huge disadvantage having a barren environment. I hope this game will make officials maps to make it much more fare when playing. I give it a 6/10.			"

												TL;DR - Great game, insanely fun, awesome community. PLAY THIS GAME.Full review - After playing Galcon since I first found it back in the days of Instant Action, I've loved it and it's great to see that Hassey's kickstarter for Galcon2 succeeded and allowed us the constant and renewed enjoyment of this fantastic game. Believe it or not, triangle warfare takes some serious strategy and bodes an insane addiction. The game is easy to get into, has great tutorials, and an awesome community (on the whole, there's always some arrogant beansprout somewhere insulting everyone because he's the best player 2k17, but in what game does he/she not exist). You'll find yourself with a rapid boot time, a slick and easy to use interface (due to the game being multiplatform - which also adds an even greater community) and a quick but fully informative tutorial. From there you can join any game of any of the modes you choose. You start at the lowest rank, and games you join will show the average rank of the players in that game, which really helps you navigate to a game of your skill level. From there your addiction to Galcon will ensue. You'll rank up, meet new friends and battle new enemies - and if you decide to join a clan, you'll find yourself enjoying the game even more.			"

Its one way thinking like a shooting game with 1 gun and no grenades or anything else but objective to kill them and not being allowed to play with friends or do a quick match or customise anything its a one way i am the best at killing you game with a little strategy but not much...and if youre worried about my spelling this game is for you because youre just like it.

The thing is the community has descended into the♥♥♥♥♥♥filled toilet. Let me explain why;Say you have a new player, about 2 days old. He shows interest in the game and tries to win, naturally the aim of the game is to take RISKS and ATTACK other players, so instinctively he goes for a player in an effort to expand his territory and thus his ship [triangle] production. He kills the other player but then a third player swoops in and eats the newbie. What does the newbie get? ""♥♥♥♥ YOU NOOB! GTFO! UNINSTALL YOU RETARD!"" and such. Of course when the PRO players do the EXACT same thing, they aren't killed. Oh NO, instead they are kept alive and allowed to rebuild. This taps onto ANOTHER ISSUE. The issue of ""teaming"". It is WRONG to ask another player to help you attack a third player. Any sort of cooperation between two players in a Galcon match, if not a team based mode, is WRONG. Funny thing is, when the PROS do the same thing, its OK.Then there is the descent into♥♥♥♥♥♥which is highlighted by the Galaxy Map [GM]. The GM is a sort of meta game in Galcon, which is where clans own stars and attack the stars of other clans. The wars are won within a 24hr period and are fought by gaining ""hits"", which are won with every victory in game. Now this GM, is FANTASTIC. BUT nonetheless is RUINED by many, many, many players who take the game way too seriously. You have shenanigans, backstabs, intrigue. WHICH IS GREAT! part of war right? ALL Galcon war leaders want this, but when it is conducted on one's self...OML THE WHINING, THE ♥♥♥♥♥ING, THE CRYING.... they act as if they have been horribly wronged and accused of murder. Gosh the drama. Then they look for scapegoats, they ALWAYS find someone and ruin THEIR game for what is ALWAYS their mistake. This really ruins the game.Then there is tournaments. Special lobbies where you play the game but when you accumulate wins you can be rewarded with an in-game currency prize. Now the PROS team there, like♥♥♥♥♥♥ they team like there is no team-orrow. When you as a new player get in and play as you want, you get banned from the lobby....see? its sad...very sad...what's even sadder is you can get banned for WINNING and KILLING THE HOST. Corruption much? This is what i mean by a♥♥♥♥♥♥community and the community, to this game, is one of the core aspects and is what made it fun about 1 1/2 years ago. But this has changed and is no longer fun because the community has become♥♥♥♥♥♥ ~~~The gameplay itself is what it is, you have a circle which produces units and its a 1:1 combat, click and drag, double click and drag, etc. decent.The graphics are great, you can adjust them from battery -> high~~~~~This game is meant to be fast paced, fast, its meant to be RISK, WAR and INTRIGUE. But it is not. Because you have people who limit the game by classifying taking risks as SUICIDING another player and brand you with that making you an instant target for hate. When you see an opportunity, when player2 eats player3, you want to get planets so you take a chunk out of 3. Oh the hate that follows, woe betide you. So yeah, the players are crap in their attitudes to new players, i wouldnt call it exactly a ""healthy environment for new players"", its not a bad game, gameplay wise, but the community directly and indirectly tries to ruin your fun. Right now, with what the community has become over the past 1 1/2 years, I cannot possibly recommend it.P.S when i say community is generally mean the PRO players, the Longterm players and the Clan leaders and Clan Warchiefs [aids to the clan leader on the GM]			"

												i dis like this game because it is not as good as phage wars and it lacks quick match pr even to play with friends. If i were you i would be makeing it more like phage wars and allowing people to customize youre  nano bots or what ever they are in perfecting a certain area if you want speed or strgenth or numbers or attack defence with low production or have the game have its own set of nano bots you can use which i dont mind as well as you put what some one would like to mess around with if it has speed to movement or strong defence or both  or main defence with speed to go back to a defending cell that is outnumberd because youre defence or be a balanced in the middle of all or try to infect the most cells as possible and try to overwhelm youre foes or use strgenth tactis and break into new cells or use speed reproduction strength starting amount of nano bots or defence so things to add would be custom nano bots and i will play it a better quick match system and with nano bots i can make and i woudl like to be able to just play and not mess with upgrades unless its single player. but in multi player you need more maps new things added and im not gouing to say any more if you cant think an be creative but right now the game sucks. Its one way thinking like a shooting game with 1 gun and no grenades or anything else but objective to kill them and not being allowed to play with friends or do a quick match or customise anything its a one way i am the best at killing you game with a little strategy but not much...and if youre worried about my spelling this game is for you because youre just like it.

												I will say this if you cannot learn strategy stay away from this. PROS:1.That being said I love this game the community is awesome constant gg's and well played.2.It's free I mean that alone is reason enough to try any game.3. It's super small maybe only 500Mb so it wont take up any space.4. Any system can run this it has almost no requirements and is not intensive even during the largest of battles.5. I enjoy this game even when I am losing constantly.6. The practice and training mode in the beginning will teach you the fundamentals well and allow you to jump straight into the game and start having a blast.7. Multiple game types mix up the game and change the dynamics greatly team battles etc are awesome and so are all the other game types.CONS:1. There is currently a slightly low population in this game (however i would like to mention this does not prevent you from getting into matches by any means people are always joining and leaving).2. In order to create custom rooms where you can earn in game cash you have to pay a small fee of $5 a month or there are some other small micro transaction fees.(this does not affect gameplay however).OVERALL I would recommend this game if nothing more give it a try for an hour if you dont like it then its probably not for you.I say one hour because in that time you can probably run about 40 games some are under 3min long depending on the game type you are playing as there are multiple game types.

												A very good game. It's basically an Online version of the Nano Wars Flash Game. It's definitely a fun way to kill time. Only complaint I have is that there's no free way to earn coins. This game is good, but it's not good enough to purchase extras. I think it would be good it they game you a few good game tokens each day, especially since its Christmas,  just so there could actually be some currency circulation. Not a lot of them, and they're just for giving to other players.			"

												What can i say about galcon.Well i can easily say it is one of the best free to play games i have ever played.What is it?Galcon is an rts that is so simple yet addictive. The object of the game is to take over planets in a small galaxy. It may sound easy as it is being said but the trategy element is high. while you collecting planets someone else may swoop in while your weak and undefended. The games usually go for around 2 minutes - 5 minutes and by the end it will be at least 1000 troops vs 1000 troops. And adding to that some more the largest game i had was 7 people so we ended having huge wars over a planet in the middle.I have to say it is also one of the most addicting games to play as when you get on you will struggle to get off of it and it is only a small download so go wild about downloading it.Concerns?yes i have a concern about the game that brings this review down quite a bit. Ingame currency. im not complaining about the small things like different planets and being a colour becaue the devs need to have support but my biggest concern was that you have to pay to be in a clan.I am very dissapointed at this since i am in one my self and i dont fancy wasting some money on creating a clan where me and a couple of friend and people can go in and have fun together. The next thing that i dont like is that i couldnt fine a feature to invite friends to a game. This was strange aat first but my friend managed to join my first go so invites would be nice.I have to say that this is still a great game although it's set backs.overall score i would give a 8/10Gameplay is very addicting and fun but the in game currency and no invite option set it back alot.

												this game is amazing. it's not difficult, very simple, but very addicting and it is free on steam. in this game you play as a panet with triangles trying to conquer other planets. simple right? no not really the ai is sometimes really difficult and other players decimate you in seconds when you do not pay attention. but when you get the hang of it it is a really enjoyable experience. the game is focused on multiplayer and for now there are threethings you can do: co-op with other players against an AI, free for all with other players and team deathmatch. sounds like not so much but it is definetly worth your time! wat a killer of a game!

												What can i say about galcon.Well i can easily say it is one of the best free to play games i have ever played.What is it?Galcon is an rts that is so simple yet addictive. The object of the game is to take over planets in a small galaxy. It may sound easy as it is being said but the trategy element is high. while you collecting planets someone else may swoop in while your weak and undefended. The games usually go for around 2 minutes - 5 minutes and by the end it will be at least 1000 troops vs 1000 troops. And adding to that some more the largest game i had was 7 people so we ended having huge wars over a planet in the middle.I have to say it is also one of the most addicting games to play as when you get on you will struggle to get off of it and it is only a small download so go wild about downloading it.Concerns?yes i have a concern about the game that brings this review down quite a bit. Ingame currency. im not complaining about the small things like different planets and being a colour becaue the devs need to have support but my biggest concern was that you have to pay to be in a clan.I am very dissapointed at this since i am in one my self and i dont fancy wasting some money on creating a clan where me and a couple of friend and people can go in and have fun together. The next thing that i dont like is that i couldnt fine a feature to invite friends to a game. This was strange aat first but my friend managed to join my first go so invites would be nice.I have to say that this is still a great game although it's set backs.overall score i would give a 8/10Gameplay is very addicting and fun but the in game currency and no invite option set it back alot.

												If you've played galcon for playstation, galcon on instantaction back when that existed, or own galcon fusion you might like this game. Mods are really neat, including a breakout clone called bricks, a version of galcon you can play with other people in the room, as it's completely turn based and more like a board game. And then there's the weird mirror mod where you can control both teams and have to dare I say it play with yourself.Galcon 2 mods use lua. Online multiplayer with galcon is always hard unless you're good at strategy games, so if that's not your thing you probably won't like this game, even though it's simpler then other RTS games because the goal is take planets and shoot triangles at other planets.

												What a fun game. In Galcon 2, players try to conquer all planets on a map by colonizing planets. Planets under your control will produce ships, which can then be sent to nearby planets to spread your territory. Planets of different sizes will produce ships at different rates, but may cost more or less depending on their production times. So larger planets will produce ships faster, but will be harder to reach and harder to acquire. Smaller planets will be more accessible, but will produce ships slower. The goal of Galcon 2 is to find the right balance and utilize strategy to conquer as many planets as possible.What I enjoy about Galcon 2 is how simple it is to play. There are no complicated colonization protocols. Any planet may be colonized so long as it contains fewer ships in storage than the amount of ships attacking it. That's it.However, there is an interesting level of strategy to Galcon 2. First, only gray neutral planets will display colonization cost, ie. a neutral planet might cost 25 ships, making your decision easy in whether to attack it. However, planets colonized by other players will *not* show colonization costs, so pay close attention to ship traffic locations from enemy player activity to guess where their weak spots are.Second, diplomacy often comes into play in large multiplayer matches. Games will begin as mad rushes to colonize planets and begin producing ships. Then, as the number of neutral planets dwindles, conflicts begin to arise. Players must juggle whether or not they can take over their neighbor's territory, and if doing so will make them appear vulnerable to other players. There is a certain strategy in trying to incite conflicts while biding time to make a proper attack.Third, though Galcon 2 is typically a free-for-all game (designated team matches exist, but are not as common), teamwork finds itself arriving in the most incredible of situations. In a three-player skirmish, when one player assumes large control of the map, the two other weaker players may realize silently they must work together temporarily to stop the growing threat. Galcon 2 is full of spontaneous blasts of teamwork, but also backstabbing and surprise attacks.Galcon 2 is one of the most accessible and friendly real-time strategy games on the market today. I myself am hardly a strategy player, preferring simple and obvious games, yet I have so much fun with Galcon 2. Now that it's free there is no excuse not to give it a try!			"

												Well this game ws a shock to me. When i first happened upon this game i thought it was just your basic little flash game copy... Well it is a hell of a lot deeper than that! Theres a bloody galactic map and factions and bunch of other general mishmash that is extremely uncomon for this genre. The base gameplay is that of a better than average cheap flash rts. But the community (Still somewhat small) is quite nice. This is game that is mostly played by people with ipads nd phones... BUT for a app store game gone steam its not bad at all. Altough i do admit it is more challenging to play with a mouse than touchscreen.  All in all i would recommend this game. (Played 2 hours as of this comment)			"

But this also pushed you further and made yourself better!My Username was Manjini on it btw. :) To some Veterans this shouldnt be a unknown name. :p Hopefully they gonna release a Galcon 3 because I am confident that even those old legends on Galcon 2 will return and we would all meet up again and form Splitters Reborn!

												Good game and if you played the first one in the appstores, it really follows it and is still great adition I would recommend trying it first before than passing up on it, and it's free and doesn't take up space however I didn't like the fact didn't have a solo player mode and the multiplaper can be a bit overwhelming at first and hard to tell who's who, but at least try it.

												What a fun game. In Galcon 2, players try to conquer all planets on a map by colonizing planets. Planets under your control will produce ships, which can then be sent to nearby planets to spread your territory. Planets of different sizes will produce ships at different rates, but may cost more or less depending on their production times. So larger planets will produce ships faster, but will be harder to reach and harder to acquire. Smaller planets will be more accessible, but will produce ships slower. The goal of Galcon 2 is to find the right balance and utilize strategy to conquer as many planets as possible.What I enjoy about Galcon 2 is how simple it is to play. There are no complicated colonization protocols. Any planet may be colonized so long as it contains fewer ships in storage than the amount of ships attacking it. That's it.However, there is an interesting level of strategy to Galcon 2. First, only gray neutral planets will display colonization cost, ie. a neutral planet might cost 25 ships, making your decision easy in whether to attack it. However, planets colonized by other players will *not* show colonization costs, so pay close attention to ship traffic locations from enemy player activity to guess where their weak spots are.Second, diplomacy often comes into play in large multiplayer matches. Games will begin as mad rushes to colonize planets and begin producing ships. Then, as the number of neutral planets dwindles, conflicts begin to arise. Players must juggle whether or not they can take over their neighbor's territory, and if doing so will make them appear vulnerable to other players. There is a certain strategy in trying to incite conflicts while biding time to make a proper attack.Third, though Galcon 2 is typically a free-for-all game (designated team matches exist, but are not as common), teamwork finds itself arriving in the most incredible of situations. In a three-player skirmish, when one player assumes large control of the map, the two other weaker players may realize silently they must work together temporarily to stop the growing threat. Galcon 2 is full of spontaneous blasts of teamwork, but also backstabbing and surprise attacks.Galcon 2 is one of the most accessible and friendly real-time strategy games on the market today. I myself am hardly a strategy player, preferring simple and obvious games, yet I have so much fun with Galcon 2. Now that it's free there is no excuse not to give it a try!			"

												I had fun until I meet admin that wanted to ban me because I team (not even teamed cuz I didn't know a guy but he wasn't going for my planets) with weaker player when he was big as we both lol (how are you gonna win it another way?)then he suicide me next game and was salty as f... so I did sucicide on him next game and I got warning.. he made video evidence and scared me with ban lol and he didn't even wanted to answer to any of my questions.. so watch out cuz you never know when mad admin will enter your game even tho there is many obvious teams in ffa modes... anyway, game is good and I wasn't realy able to find anything better multiplayer wise... but this admin make me uninstall in few minutes and I'm not gonna waste more time on game with so poor administration, even ubisoft can answer a question without scaring you with ban lol... Im glad I didn't pay any money for cosmetic items wich I wanted to do because they are cool looking etc.. there is also kinda poor playerbase so its not easy to find server what you want			"

												OK so im editting my reveiw, something i should have done about a year ago.I've been playing this game for close to 3 years now, through a variety of accounts. The thing is the community has descended into the♥♥♥♥♥♥filled toilet. Let me explain why;Say you have a new player, about 2 days old. He shows interest in the game and tries to win, naturally the aim of the game is to take RISKS and ATTACK other players, so instinctively he goes for a player in an effort to expand his territory and thus his ship [triangle] production. He kills the other player but then a third player swoops in and eats the newbie. What does the newbie get? ""♥♥♥♥ YOU NOOB! GTFO! UNINSTALL YOU RETARD!"" and such. Of course when the PRO players do the EXACT same thing, they aren't killed. Oh NO, instead they are kept alive and allowed to rebuild. This taps onto ANOTHER ISSUE. The issue of ""teaming"". It is WRONG to ask another player to help you attack a third player. Any sort of cooperation between two players in a Galcon match, if not a team based mode, is WRONG. Funny thing is, when the PROS do the same thing, its OK.Then there is the descent into♥♥♥♥♥♥which is highlighted by the Galaxy Map [GM]. The GM is a sort of meta game in Galcon, which is where clans own stars and attack the stars of other clans. The wars are won within a 24hr period and are fought by gaining ""hits"", which are won with every victory in game. Now this GM, is FANTASTIC. BUT nonetheless is RUINED by many, many, many players who take the game way too seriously. You have shenanigans, backstabs, intrigue. WHICH IS GREAT! part of war right? ALL Galcon war leaders want this, but when it is conducted on one's self...OML THE WHINING, THE ♥♥♥♥♥ING, THE CRYING.... they act as if they have been horribly wronged and accused of murder. Gosh the drama. Then they look for scapegoats, they ALWAYS find someone and ruin THEIR game for what is ALWAYS their mistake. This really ruins the game.Then there is tournaments. Special lobbies where you play the game but when you accumulate wins you can be rewarded with an in-game currency prize. Now the PROS team there, like♥♥♥♥♥♥ they team like there is no team-orrow. When you as a new player get in and play as you want, you get banned from the lobby....see? its sad...very sad...what's even sadder is you can get banned for WINNING and KILLING THE HOST. Corruption much? This is what i mean by a♥♥♥♥♥♥community and the community, to this game, is one of the core aspects and is what made it fun about 1 1/2 years ago. But this has changed and is no longer fun because the community has become♥♥♥♥♥♥ ~~~The gameplay itself is what it is, you have a circle which produces units and its a 1:1 combat, click and drag, double click and drag, etc. decent.The graphics are great, you can adjust them from battery -> high~~~~~This game is meant to be fast paced, fast, its meant to be RISK, WAR and INTRIGUE. But it is not. Because you have people who limit the game by classifying taking risks as SUICIDING another player and brand you with that making you an instant target for hate. When you see an opportunity, when player2 eats player3, you want to get planets so you take a chunk out of 3. Oh the hate that follows, woe betide you. So yeah, the players are crap in their attitudes to new players, i wouldnt call it exactly a ""healthy environment for new players"", its not a bad game, gameplay wise, but the community directly and indirectly tries to ruin your fun. Right now, with what the community has become over the past 1 1/2 years, I cannot possibly recommend it.P.S when i say community is generally mean the PRO players, the Longterm players and the Clan leaders and Clan Warchiefs [aids to the clan leader on the GM]			"
