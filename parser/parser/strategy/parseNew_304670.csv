												To be honest, this game was surprisingly good. I wasn't expecting this much fun from a game that costs $2.99 (not including the discount!) It's scaled very well, and despite being a multiplatform release, looks pretty good on pc and does give you the choice of using a keyboard, a mouse, or a combination of the two. The enemies aren't stupid and winning on normal can often be a challenge depending on what faction you are versing, and hard is actually pretty challenging. Also, the research and upgrading tab means you can actually use different strategies and it isn't just the same game over and over. And finally, the idea for a ""Scrambled"" faction is brilliant! If you are looking for a short video to show you what the game is, here's a link to a 2 minute one:

												Pretty neat strategy game! You don't directly control your units but you have abilities and controls the unit buil flow. There is no base building either but a research tree for upgrades and unlocking ships, plus an extensive upgrade shop to improve the armies. Kind of like a tower defense, minus the towers so it's more like fleet attack+mothership defense. All in all, I was missing PC strategy games so variants in the genre are always welcomed.Some of the battles feel like massive wars of attrition where you desperately upgrade and send ships non stop at lightning speed clicks. Stuff can get fairly intense as you realise the enemy is pushing to your side and fending off your fleet.Maybe it lacks the depth of other strategy titles but for the asking price it's hard to say no.

												For what it is, is a rather short game that focus exclusively on your ability to overwhelm your enemy as early as posible. There is not much to the mechanics,and most of the strategy is purely brute forcing your rival's base. The game features local multiplayer and matchmaking, but these are dead as hell on the PC version, so dont count them towards your judgement. Not a bad game per se, but once you beat the main campaing, there is absolutely nothing else to it besides the absurd and fruitless grind that requires getting a 100%. get it for less than o.70 on a sale only if only you really donty have anything else to spend your money.

												Sometimes games are too expensive without worth of it. But sometimes games are too cheap and they worth much more. Aeon is a game of this kind. I got a discount on it and was like ""why not to give it a try?"". So I did and I was amazed by this simple but very good casual gameplay. It is very similiar to tower defence + MOBA games. Actually it is the wonderful indie child of Starcraft and Dota.Pluses+ Beautiful graphic(it's simple but still has deep atmosphere of it)+ Nice music and sounds(it is not anoying like it happens in some casual games)+ Great system of developing+ Nice campaining and plot(it's kinda usual but still keeps the smell of casual space strategy, could I ask for more?)+ Multyplayer(play this game with your friend is a good chance to solve some argues. Jokes aside!)+ Additional plus... I don't know why. I just love it. :)___Would love to see in the game...Actually not minuses at all, just my wishes.- No modes(there is the only map. And I'd like to see much more ways to fight with an enemy)- No characters(yes, the game is beautiful designed, but I would love to see some characters, like commanders or alians in there)- No quests(why not? There is a huge area to make some plot twiestes)Thank you, delepores, for this great game. I will spend a lot of my free time in there. Quite so!			"

												To be honest, I wouldn't have bought this game were it not for the huge discount I got for it. So I went into it not much expecting, but I am getting some pleasant surprises. Don't expect anything fancy from graphics or sound - they do the job, but that's it. As for so many Indie games, this one is all about the gameplay.Basically, this is a tower defense game: you have to gather resources (happens automatically), build ever more powerful units, and research upgrades for them. With these spaceships, the goal is to reach the mothership of your opponent, at the other side of the playfield, while at the same time defending your own mothership against incoming attacks.Since there is only one path between the two bases, most of the time the two opposing fleets meet somewhere in between, slowly (or faster if you're good) progressing towards the enemy's side. There is not much more to it: the core gameplay is dead simple, but it has something about it that keeps the attention going. One does have to make important and micro-strategic decisions: does one invest the resources gathered into new ships, or rather into upgrades? And there is a neat supra research-tree, which allows you to spend resource points that affects all or any of the three factions in the game.Part of the attraction of the game surely lies in the excellent way it is embedded in the Steam cloud, with achievements, trading cards, multiplayer options, rankings, etc. Name it, and this game has it. So for the moment I want to try going up on the ladder, or win my first multiplayer. It's a simple game, but it does what it wants to do pretty good.Gameplay: 21/30Graphics: 10/20Sound: 5/10Longelivety: 14/20 (MP looks promising)Technical: 6/10 (I had one very bad crash after exiting)Personal rating: 6/10Overall socre: 62/10060-70/100: a good game, worth purchasing if in discount or if you like the genre			"

												Aeon Command is a deceivingly challenging tug-of-war game with strategy elements that almost reminds me of an RTS. You don't have to command units, they automatically attack the enemy. The only thing the player does is manage resources, applies powerups (buffs, debuffs), deploys weapons (nukes, emps), and purchases upgrades for units. The more obvious thing players must do is build units. I found it relaxing, rewarding, and late games were challenging and exhilarating.There's 3 factions to choose from and they all have their own unique appearance and they all have their own weapons. However, they have similar basic unit types which keeps it fairly well balanced. I say fairly because there are some different support units for each faction. The similarities will be noticeable in attack units. I had little trouble identifying an enemy ship and launching the appropriate counter. Watching the space battles unfold is quite interesting, it reminded me of Battlestar Galactica for some reason. A word of warning, this game starts off unforgivingly and you may lose many of your first matches. Does it get better? Yes it does, because of two types of upgrades. There are game-wide upgrades that you can upgrade from the main menu and these are purchased using ""gear parts"" you acquire from destroyed enemies. These upgrades are applied to every game thereafter. The second type of upgrade is the in-game upgrades which must be purchased with scrap and these only apply for the duration of that match. Generally, upgrades modify weapons and armour but there are also resource collection upgrades which I researched first because the best economy almost always wins.The campaigns are short and aren't full of narrative. If you want a deep story, you won't find it in this game. HOWEVER, I recommend this game because of high replay value and the gameplay is well polished.The soundtrack is more like ambience and I found it added to the atmosphere. Sound effects from weapons to explosions are also well done. The only sound effect that drove me nuts was the spacial anomaly sound effect which you'll only hear in 1 or 2 campaign missions anyway.Pros: RTS elements that still keeps you involved in the battle. Well balanced units that still stand apart and look interesting. Nice sound effects and music. UPGRADES HERE, UPGRADES THERE, UPGRADES EVERYWHERE! \o/ Straight forward tutorial. Unit and upgrade prices are reasonable.Cons: Short campaigns with little narrative. No unit descriptions except one-time descriptions in the campaign. The enemy will sometimes spam tugs which will tow your entire fleet to their dooms.Neutral: Unforgiving for new players.I had a lot of fun with this game and I am absolutely astonished that (as of purchasing this game) no one in my friends list has this on their wishlist or owns it. So if you're reading this, I highly recommend it for it's replay value and the great gameplay. 8/10			"

												Well, this game is a bit hard for me to recommend or not recommend. I enjoyed my time playing it, but after beating the main campaign and playing a few skirmishes, it leaves me with a thought in my mind that says, now what?Obviously, multiplayer would be a grand option...but no one is active in the multiplayer, so unless you have friends who play this, it is unlikely you will ever find a real human to play against.Replaying the campaign doesn't change anything either besides getting a better high score. Sigh...So after 3.5 hours, it appears I have maxed out my time with Aeon Command. A game I thoroughly enjoyed playing but ended up short with little replayability. Even after all that, the game is priced fairly and is something I can see improving if the Dev ever decides to revisit this game. I did enjoy my time with this game. I did like this game. But, there isn't much to do after beating the 2 hour long campaign. This game is for those who want to play a game for a few hours and then ultimately move on to other games in their inventory. A good distraction.			"

												Aeon Command is a streamlined space RTS.  You start with a mothership and are tasked with collecting resources to build space craft to take on the opposing mothership.  You really just have one collectable resource which is metal.  You also have eneregy to use abilities but that is automatically generated over time or collected as power-ups from the wreckage of defeated enemy ships.  Once you get some resources flowing you can start to build ships to assail your enemy.  Once built your ships will automatically seek out and attack the enemy.  You can't directly control combat but you can influence the battles using special abilities to buff your troops or debuff and even damage the enemy fleet.  The trick comes down to what ships to produce when and what improvements to research.  You can research better ships and improve your ships armor and weapons during play.  You can also permanently augment the ships and abilities of the three different playable factions by spending upgrades collected in the campaign and skirmishes.Aeon Command contains a single player camaign and a skirmish mode.  The campaign is a tutorial and campaign in one.  The campaign is pretty easy with a difficulty spike at the end.  Once you start to really understand resource management and research you'll dominate the campaign in no time.  I have not tried the multiplayer but I imagine it would be pretty fun to battle it out with a friend.Overall a fun game.  It probably won't occupy you for too long (the campaign can be beaten in a couple hours) but for a few bucks it's a pretty fun space game.			"

Posted: May 15, 2015
												This is a game modeled after the mods for the RTS sub genre typically found for mods of Blizzard games called ""Tug of war"".I wanted a game like this that I didn't need to run Starcraft 2 or Warcraft 3 in order to play, but I have to say that I'm quite disappointed. If you don't know what a tug of war game is, let me explain: A tug a war game is where you typically have 2 teams. Both teams have to build a structure which represents a unit which will continually spawn after set times in waves, those units will (usually) all spawn at the same time and without any control from the player, will run towards the enemy base, attacking your enemy's army as it encounters them. As time progresses and you farm more and more resources, your army gets bigger and so does your enemy's. Certain units counter certain other units so it's really up to the teams to figure out how to counter their enemy and destroy their base first. It's a huge amount of fun and very addictive.Unfortunately, this game just has no heart at all. It's a 1v1 tug of war which will basically wear out your left mouse button as all you do is click repeatedly to create a unit. It's created instantly and there are no waves. There is, however, a spawn cooldown. It's short but it's there, which means rather than armies pushing each other in waves, you get long strings of individual ships which may or may not gather up if they stop to fight. Ships will not automatically spawn either; you click on their build icon and they spawn there once and that's it.Incredibly boring and nothing compared to the custom mods you get in those games. I would say that if you have never played a game like this before, this might be a nice cheap (if you get it on sale) place to start. If you have Warcraft/Starcraft and want something similar to Desert Strike or Black and white, don't bother; this can't compare.			"

												Aeon Command is a game I've been lucky to follow throughout its original days in Desura, iOS (Iphone and Ipad2/Air) and now onto Steam. The game has made great strides and for what the game is intended to be, that is casual, it delivers. I'd recommend this game to anyone. Also, the music is unique in that I don't feel like my ears are being blasted at unnaturally loud volume levels. The music seals the deal, in the calm atmospheric tone  paired with its simplified controls and overall ease of use.			"

												A very good space RTS game given the $2.99AUD price tag or the equivalent in your area! Like it says in the description this is a 'tug of war' style game where you gather resources and produce units to proceed towards the enemy mothership (base) and destroy it, engaging any enemy fighters along the way. You do not have direct control over your units, however you can turn the tide of battle with abilities which cost energy points to use that slowly regenerate automatically. These include abilities that can heal your ships, stun enemy ships, or nuke a small area. Graphics are pretty unsurprising given the budget and it looks like a glorified flash game, however thankfully for a strategy game graphics are easily forgiven, not to mention expectations are low at this price point. Games are short (~5-10min) making it the perfect bite-size RTS, you will not find a huge amount of depth here and some strategies can be exploited to easily win matches against AI but it even includes a multiplayer mode to play against your friends! A great value game, despite its shortcomings. 7/10			"

												This is a great little casual game and is certainly one thats easy to learn and hard to master.It is a tug of war strategy game, where you control a unique faction to help gain dominance over the Aeon Nebula! There are 3 factions to be played with in all  to complete the campaign mode, each containing 8 segments. You will need to gather resources, produce and protect ships and eventually destroy the opposition mothership. Don't forget to use your upgrades like I did for half the game.It has trading cards, the achievements are relatively easy to get and the multiplayer mode could be fun but i've yet to try that.This game is worth its full price on the catalogue but does appear in bundles every now and then...

												Aeon Command is one of those games that's fun in small doses, and with its low price it's actually worth paying for those doses.  The graphics are certainly more than adequate to do the job, and the audio fits the art style and theme of gameplay.The gameplay, however, won't win any awards for depth or breadth.  You spam numbers/clicks to build ships, use different keys/clicks to use special abilities, determine which ships to unlock and/or upgrade, and click on icons in the combat window to get resource, upgrade, or energy bonuses.Likewise the campaign is nothing to write home about.  You get a set number of missions which each introduce a new ship or skill, do the same number of missions for each race, or game mode, and that's it.  The campaign is little more than a tutorial for skirmish games.Skirmish, on the other hand, is where the game both shines and shows its worst flaw.  You get to play with all the races, all the game modes, all the range options, and even mix things up so that you and/or your enemy get a random assortment of ships and special abilities.  You could, for example, get the mining craft from race A which costs 8 resources to build (the others cost 10), a healer ship, a chain lightning ship, a railgun ship, and so on.  It will never randomly assign ships outside of their assigned slot so that you'll never get 2 or 3 ships normally in slot six, but it suffices to provide some variety in gameplay.  The game also provides three ""difficulty"" modes, and that is where the game's biggest flaw comes into play.The AI cheats, at least on Hard difficulty.  It doesn't cheat by being ""smarter"" or by reacting faster to changes than a human can, nor do AI-controlled ships do any better when run by an AI player than a human.  Instead the developers opted to give the AI bonuses to resource acquisition.  Either it gets a steady stream of the crystals and energy or it gets a significant boost to how much it gets when it gets it.This isn't a case of me being a bad player and blaming it on the game, nor is it a case of not understanding how the game works.  It's simply a matter of observing the facts.  When the AI is producing more ships than I can despite having the same number of collection ships out, and when the AI can use 55 energy skills/powers before I even have 1 energy, the AI is, in fact, cheating.  Edit:  I found a perfect example of the sort of benefits the AI gets over players.  As a player, I only get energy from killing enemy ships, but despite the AI having destroyed none of my ships it was able to pop off two EMPs and a Repair, total cost around 100 energy, at a time when I had only 17 energy, and this was less than four minutes into the game.Over the course of half a dozen games against a Hard AI using the Cyborg race I had one of my first three combat ships mind controlled when I had 0 energy, the ship had just been produced, and while it was in range of my base ship and thus nowhere near enemy lines.  Furthermore, during my last play session I used Cheat Engine four times to bump my credits up by 1k, 1.5k, 2k, and 2.5k, and the first three were not enough to build and upgrade enough ships to give me a fighting chance.  It wasn't until I did the 2.5k bump that I had enough, and enough upgrades, to fight the AI with some degree of parity.  Eventually I won by spamming the slot 6 ship which, more often than not, can be an ""I win"" button for each race if you get a large enough swarm of them going.This sort of cheating doesn't completely ruin gameplay, but it does make me want to avoid playing against Cyborgs or playing as Cyborgs on Hard.  Still, at $2.99 I'm more than willing to cut the developers some slack on shipping the game with a ""difficulty"" option that, at least for me, makes certain race/gameplay/side combinations absolute no-nos.  It's still something that should be considered if that sort of thing really irritates you.  The game is still quite fun up until Hard, and even on Hard as long as I play Human or Exile it's still quite enjoyable and winnable.			"

												I get this game on sale for around 1.5€, yet I think this game offers too little challenge,The 2D gfx are simple but quite well done, that is ok for me,I understand that this is rather a casual game, and not a complex and detailed RTS or 4X, that's also fine and that was precisely why I bought.But the bottomline is that you don't have enough meaningful choices to make either during the game or as purchasing upgrades between battles. Most choices are obvious.For example at the start of 95% of the battles you should start by building as many miners as possible, why not start with this allready built and start with more interesting decisions.Then battles ""strategy"" is often upgrade one of your units to max tech, then built as many of this type (plus a few of the other types as support).There are 3 factions, with differents units and perks. But again this has little impact on strategy, and play the same.Each faction as only 6 ships and 3 special power.It tooks me 4 hours to complete the campaign, only one of the scenario was really challening and required a careful strategy , then 1 hour to try the various skirmish modes.And now there are little replay value.Production is fine and the game run smoothly, but for content wise this feels like a draft (even for a casual game). This game badly need more depth in gameplay or more variationI found Gratuitous Space Battles more enjoyable			"

												It's like tug of war with a wet noodle.  You make ships and watch as they fly to the right.  That's roughly all this game does.  You upgrade the ships, make different ships, and use magic on occasion, but there doesn't feel like there's any strategy to this game.  Keep upgrading, keep clicking to make new ships, eventually you win.  I suppose for $3 what do you expect?  They could at least make the battles look interesting.  Have some dogfighting or something instead of lining up and shooting at eachother.			"

												Classic Tug-of-War RTS (without protagonist in play).Space themed, three races available, each with different set of ships and skills.Relatively short campaign available, after completing which you can only play single skirmishes. Every fight gives you points to upgrade your fleet a bit.Good little game for its price. Not much more to it.			"

												Surprisingly good game. Familiar to Sword and Soldiers, Alien Hallway, Paladog and many other games in this genre. You build harvesters, that mine resources and then you send waves of attackers supporting them with tech (spells,if you like) skills. The aim is to destroy your enemy's mothership. That simple. And fun. Upgrading your technologies with cogs, calculating the damage, building your great devastating/defensive troop stack to send. Good game for the fans of this genre.			"

												7/10 for a mini RTS game that made me feel like the real space commander.Those battle ships in Aeon Command are really and very different. Each of units have different weaknesses and strengths. Yeah I like it. So, you need a good plan and a good idea to rush to the enemy mother ship, because there's only direct way on every maps.6/10 for the graphic and ship details. Effects for bombs or weapons seem too many toys. 8/10 for the artificial intelligence, they have a strategy like a real player.			"

												A cool little Aeon Of Strife game in space.One of its strenghts is that you can play it in a pretty casual way, even after an hard day at work, but it can mantain a bit of depth that separates it from other casual games.I completed 2 of the 3 singleplayer campaigns and tried all 3 factions - they feel quite different from each other - units and powers give them diversity and make them interesting.That said, all in all Aeon Command can't mantain my interest for very long because it's not my kind of genre, but for those who like Aeon Of Strife-type of games, I'm confident to say that this is a really well made product with quite the indie vibe surrounding it.

												A decent little game, this tug-of-war style game is easy and fun to pick up and play.  Sadly, the campaign is pretty short and there are not enough people playing it to support the online multiplayer mode.  Having tried to find a match, I gave up after 15 minutes of it trying to find a player.  There are some other minor issues with the game, like having to open the menu and then pause (as opposed to having the Escape key function as a pause).  The lack of tooltips when in the game can be somewhat frustrating.  If you need to look up info on a skill or ship, you have to go into the menu and open the help function--which, unless you pause in the menu first, will be displayed over the still-running game.  However, when viewed as a a short-sessions arcade game, Aeon Command is well worth the three dollars.			"

												Well, my excuse to buy this one was that I had a coupon (66% or 75% off, can't remember), so I only paid a few cents for it. Also it's got trading cards, so why not?The game itself is alright, not much to do really, because all you do is build computer-controlled aircraft until you run out of money.Basically, you are placed on the left side of the screen, and your enemy is placed on the opposite side.Then you build your miners that gather dosh, then with that dosh you build your fighters and upgrade them weapons and shields, then they go and fight the enemies, until they reach their mothership and destroy it, which gives you victory. Unless the enemy do the same to your mothership, then it's game over.You don't control anything, you just build stuff and watch them go, fire at enemies, get destroyed and stuff.Skirmish after skirmish, that's how it goes in each of the three campaigns. Except that each level you get to unlock new and more powerful spacecraft, but to be honest, I always stick with the cheaper ones, because they are all just the same but you can build heaps of them and overpower the enemy in no time.It's a ""ok"" game to entertain yourself for a couple of hours and get a few trading cards to pay for it (if you bought it with a coupon, that is).7/10			"

												The player has way too little control to make this game fun. You build ships and you upgrade them, that's pretty much it. The AI takes it from there. Sure, you have some special abilities, like for example choosing where to put a healing aura for your ships. It's just that your ships don't care, they will move out of that aura regardless of if it is the smart thing to do or not. You have no control, and that's annoying.I do not understand why this game have so many positive reviews. I can't imagine this game being very much fun, even on a tablet. Maybe it takes some time getting used to or something, but I just think life is too short to make the effort with this one.			"

												Decent tug of war/space strategy. Games are typically very short with the objective always being to destroy the enemy mothership.There are 3 unique factions/races to choose from each with their own ship, allowing for a level of personal preference. Added with upgradeable units, a player can design a strategy around their preferred faction/ships/tactics. However, the game is very limited in content.Might be fun for multiplayer but I couldn't find a single game unfortunately.			"

												This game was surprisingly fun and addictive. The campaign took over 3 hours in total, and the three factions kept me interested until the end.It's a bit like Swords & Soldiers in space. The map is a long, 2D battleground. You build units who you do not directly control, but who automatically fly to the other end of the map and fight each other. The objective is to destroy your opponent's mothership. Often, it's a war of attrition - you just try to outbuild your opponent, trying to balance that with buying research to improve your ships in the long term. However, there's a decent variety of units and special powers (all unique to each faction), so there's plenty of room for strategising and countering your opponent.Outside each battle you can spend upgrade points, to do things like improve specific ships, or increase the rate at which you gain resources.Once you've finished with the campaign, there's a skirmish mode, or multiplayer. At the current price of $2.99 I can say it's definitely worth it.			"

												Aeon Command is a good game for the mere price of $3. This strategy game relies on your knowledge of the opposing team's ships, and your own upgrades and ships in order to win. Once the campaign is complete however, the game can become extremely repetative, especially when you work out the strengths and weakness's of each team. The harder difficulty can become very easy to beat, and to complete the acheivements I found myself grinding against the hardest opponents, and beating them in 5 or so minutes. For those people who collect Perfect games (100% complete), this game can be completed around 6-7 hours. The most humerous part of this game is the fact that I was defeated on the tutorial (my only defeat), as I was reading the text on screen not realising that the opposing team was building up and preparing to attack (a very steap learning curve there :3). The gameplay itself is a tug-of-war style, and once you figure out the basic game mechanics somewhat less a tug-of-war as a slaughter-your-opponent. It is unforunate that the online multiplayer option is dead, as I think that a human opponent may be quite fun with this game.This game is worth the price, I had fun.			"

												This is a really fun game 'IF' your a fan of space combat games, basically it is tug of war in space with fleets that are automated and outside of your control blowing each other up. In this game you only select what to build/deploy which makes the game a more cinematic experience then a traditional interaction heavy video game, however with all being said and done once you have completed the single player campaign the game kind of loses its appeal since multiplayer is a graveyard and skirmish against the computer is repetitive and boring, skirmish only becomes interesting if you are playing at the more challenging difficulties.I give this game a thumbs up but be warned multiplayer is effectively dead and skirmish against the computer (once you have finished the single player campaign) requires you to play at the hard or insane difficulty level for it to be interesting.I recommend Aeon Command for people who like both space and casual video games as well as for those people looking for a video game that is more of a cinematic experience.

I usually play this when I know I only have about 10-30 minutes to play because the matches don't last too long. Haven't tried multiplayer yet but I imagine it is also just as great.

But this requires Port forwarding.There is a tutorial.There is a Music Volume button bar. (1-10 and 10 is the highest volume sound).There is a Sound Volume button bar.  (1-10 and 10 is the highest volume sound).There are many Resolution sizes.You can play this game Fullscreen or windowed mode.About the game.There are 3 different nations in thegame, each with their own strength and weaknesses. Each with their own abilities and ships. But gameplay is always the same.You get some workers - they gather resources, you build new ships or upgrade the ships and then you are attacking the enemy. Your goal is to destroy the enemy ""MotherShip"". You will unlock new ships and abilitiles overtime. Workers are like ""Harvesters"" from Red alert/ C&C series. They are your economy source. They are usually around the mothership.There are 3 different classes with each their own abilities and ships.The game build up slowly in the levels in each Nation, to give you a chance and introduce new things.Its only side scrolling - left to right.Very Repetitive.You are able to upgrade ships or abilities.Good time filler.Game is not Extremely Long.Other things.Let's Try Video:

												This is a surprisingly entertaining little distraction.  It's much like the Starcraft custom maps I used to play back in the day.  Ripping through fleets of ships is very satisfying, and the game appears to be very well balanced.  However, it isn't perfect, and the low price point is very justified.The campaign is pretty short and mostly easy, with very difficult final missions thrown in at the end which accounts for most of the game's length.  While that sounds like a damnning critique, I still very much enjoyed the time I spent with this game, and I would love to revisit this game again if the devs decide to add some more missions.The interface has some pretty major problems, which I'll list:- There's no reason for the Research panel to be a huge popup window in the center of the screen, which prohibits you from picking up powerups while it's active.  The research panel should be a compact sidebar that gives you easy access to your upgrades at all times, and allows you to monitor them continuously.- There's no way to queue up units, so this game is a bit of a keyboard masher.  This isn't horrible, but definitely inferior to  an actual unit queueing system.- Map scrolling halts when your cursor hits the edge of the screen, causing you to ""drag"" the map over and over to navigate.  The map scrolling function should be free while the mouse button is held down.- I personally do not like clickable powerups in strategy games like this (a trend that I believe gathered a lot of momentum from Plants vs. Zombies, which constantly has you clicking coins and resources until you want to shoot yourself).  I think this game can keep the powerup system, but just make them pick up when I mouse over.  It's just annoying to me, and takes away from the strategy aspect of the game, which is the game I actually want to play.I think the resource gathering aspect of this game could use a bit more depth.  As it stands now, your miners are just something you max out early on and replace if they get destroyed, and they allow the enemy to snowball you if they get the upper hand (which is fine, a match has to end somehow).  You also can't mine into your enemy's territory, once you hit the end of your half of the map, you can't mine anymore.  Because of this, the game misses out on fun possibilities of map control.Despite all my complaints, I like this game, and I recommend it based on the low price point.  It's a fun way to spend an afternoon on the weekend.			"

												Aeon Command is a linear game, where your mother ship is at the left end of a space area and the enemy mother ship is at the right end.You mine resources and then use the resources to build ships (there are extra ships to unlock, research to be done, and upgrades to be had).The unlocks are on the main menu; not in game, as I had expected, so it took a while to find them (doh).As soon as you build your warships, they head off to attack the enemy.You can't issue commands to your ships, such as getting them to attack a particular enemy, hold position, retreat, or whatever - so that sucks; it limited the tactical abilities of the game severely.As an aside, I'm not sure if one achievement is broken or not, ""Destroyer: Destroy 5,000 ships.""Despite destroying many ships, I have 0/5,000 for this achievement.Maybe it's only for multiplayer games (if it is, it certainly doesn't say so), but when I tried to have a multiplayer game, there were no other players available - so, maybe that says a lot for the game in itself.This is a very limited game. It might be ok for 5 to 12 year olds, who don't have high expectations.Apart from that, I wouldn't bother with it - unless you have some time to waste and nothing better to do.			"

												Similar to how the tower defense genre distills the RTS down to its immobile defensive elements, Aeon Command simplifies the RTS into a 1-dimensional clash of mobile offensive units.There is simplified resource gathering, there is a simplified research tree, but mostly this is about spending your resources wisely and, most critically, TIMING and COMBINING your deployments for maximum effectiveness.If you find RTS games a little too overwhelming, if you like tower defense but need a change of pace, or for that matter if you like Gratuitous Space Battles but want to be slightly more hands-on, this is a light and fun game with a decent amount of replay value. I'll be coming back to this game periodcally for quite a while.Short learning curve, lots of tactical variety, perfect lunch break game.A no-brainer on sale. No regrets at full price. Frankly, worth more. I'd love to see an expansion pack.			"

												Aeon Command developed by Bat Country Games & released on 3rd July 2014 for the PC version. It has an average user score of 6.8 on Metacritic  (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/aeon-command) & is categorized under the ""Strategy"" genre. You'd be surprised to find out that Bat Country Game is an independent game company comprising of only  2 developer. Does Aeon Command live up to it's promises? Marketed as a strategy space game, collect resources and fight among 3 faction to take control of Aeon Nebula. As a RTS *PC* gamer, I will cry foul over the game's description but coming from a mobile device gamer, I certainly welcome Aeon Command. Does that sound confusing? Read on to be enlightened!The controls are very simple. You can play the entire game by just using Mouse clicks. You also have keyboard shortcut keys to execute production of units/skills on the fly.The visuals are just fine for me. This is a 2D space battle game. The space background & the ambient sound sets the tone for being in space. Each faction will have different designs of ships. Each ship will have different animations and audio for their weapons. The User Interface is kept simple and clean. Nothing fancy/cluttered. The StoryAs the game is marketed, there is  3 faction to choose from in the campaign mode, each having 8 levels - so making it a total of 24 levels. At the beginning of each level, you will be given a balloon message that describes the story@scenario to you - and what follows after that is..well a tug of war of endless wave of space crafts.You practically try to overwhelm your enemy by mass producing space crafts and the ships will fly to the other end of the map trying to blow up the other faction's mother ship by themselves. You have no ability to control them. You only can decide the sequence of space craft to build. That's it. It is a 1 Lane tug of war and the best part is that you will be doing the same exact thing for 24 times regardless of the ""story"". Sure, there are a few levels with twist in the story, take for an example where you have to survive for x minute against the cyborg faction who are sending endless suicidal crafts. After X minute, you'll have to eliminate them.  It's just sending 1,000,000 space craft to the other side of the map. for 24 times! Do not be mistaken, this is not a MOBA or Tower defense. The exact description would be a 1 Lane control. That's it.You must be wondering how is this even possible for a game with such dull, uninteresting, repetitive game play is receiving ""very positive"" feedbacks on steam? For a RTS fan, you certainly would be utterly disappointed. There is very little ""Strategy"" involved. It's designed to be as a macro level management kind of game. One that is more suited/geared towards casual gamers. Its ""fun"" when you can overwhelm your opponent with 1 gazillion space craft. especially on multiplayer.Aeon Command gives players the option to upgrade your space crafts and also your factions(think of it like a faction bonus). The spacecraft may look and feel different however they will always remain in the same ""type of class"" for every faction. Your first space craft will always be a close range combat craft followed by a long range craft and then a support craft (healing/shield/disabler etc). It may feel slightly different from each faction but that's the general concept. It's not like starcraft/warcraft/red alert/supreme commander where you really have different kind of units! Even plant vs Zombie has more ""strategy"". I am sorry but that's how I feel/see this product as.On multiplayer, you have  3 game mode: Classic: Your typical normal game. Close: Your typical normal game but with an inch closer to each other. Resource: Your typical normal game with no-cap limit on your harvester unit.I don't understand the minor differences in Close and Resources mode. Is this the best the design could come up with? The game engine limitation? If this was a tug of war, the close mode is like having a shorter rope by an inch and for the resource mode, you can have endless of people to pulling the rope. It may sound like a visible idea but in reality, the result doesn't mean anything! There is no difference in strategy/approach of playing. I always perform the same step - across all faction - on all level difficulty.My SummaryAeon Command is a straightforward game - which can be fun - however for any serious RTS fan, stay clear of this title, it is not what it's marketed to be. For me, the story is non-existent. There is little strategy. No, I dont take upgrades as strategy. The game play was uninteresting. Some flash games could even provide me with better gaming experience/fun. Overall, I had a dull gaming experience. Do I want to see another game made with this concept/game design? No! On the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Aeon Command is a 4/10. I am sorry Bat Country Game, you'd have to do better than this. The product feels like a flash game with uninteresting value. No replay value. No challenge. If there was an option for players to secure some sort of critical resource point, or upgrading the ship with different abilities (not just increase the damage or hp), the ability to move your mother ship for base expansion - something that can get player to engage with the game - so that players can feel some sort of strategy is involved, introduce new game mode in campaign apart from obliterating your opponent; escort mission, reconnaissance, explore other planets/moons/etc maybe? Anything but a dull straightforward obliterating your opponent 24 times. TWENTY FOUR TIMES! T.TI didn't even get a chance to interact with a faction; no interaction at all apart from blowing them to bits. Story telling department leaves much to be desired. I am speechless at this point. I don't dislike this product, in fact I want to see a better version. I hope you can think this through for your future games because you are an  independent game company, you are not bound/tied to other company restrictions. You have the freedom to develop something in your vision. Good luck in DYE & I hope to see something interesting/fresh from you.			"

												Although the game works well under Linux, it offers little substance. You click on the corresponding buttons to deploy new space vessels that travel to the right side of the screen in order to attack the enemy (either human or AI). However, there's no way to control at which rate the vessels spawn, what kind of strategy they might employ or even what units they might attack. Feels a lot like a tablet game and I think that if they had given you a bit more control over things, it would have been more entertaining.I realise it is part of the 'tug-of-war' game-mode but it also makes for a very boring and repetitive game and you can blaze through the campaign missions in no-time.

												4.7 Hours on record - here's what I think.All in all, I enjoy the game.  It's not a particularly complex, or in-depth strategy game, but to those who enjoyed the flash game Age of War, it will be entertaining.  The interface allows keyboard commands, which increases playability significantly.  There are campaigns to go through, but my favorite part is playing scramble in scenario mode, where each unit is randomly selected front one of the playable races.  It's generally a resource management game, where you try to mine as much as possible and upgrade your units as fast as possible while keeping the enemy at bay so you can eventually overwhelm them.  It is surprisingly replayable, because there are times that I have had matches lasting 3 minutes, and sometimes they last 10.  I would recommend this game as an intermitten time waster, because if you sit down and drill through, you will beat this game very quickly.			"

												DISCLAIMER: This recommendation is based on playing the game in short and casual spurts and buying it on sale.Aeon Command is a simple RTS with a few mechanics here and there that make it great to pick up when you need to waste 5-10 minutes really quickly. And for that, it does it well.PROS: -Campaign that walks you through all the mechanics of the game in an easy to understand way-Nice and simple art that gets the job done. -Performance is good. Runs smoothly on my 2012 laptop.-Has three different modes and three different factions. Also gives you the option of scrambling all the units and factions together in skirmish mode (1 on 1 against the AI)-Steam achievements that force you to play in a few ways you would not normally do. CONS:-Lacks variety of gameplay. The three types of skirmish modes are not that different from each other-Inability to control ships. You are mainly making strategic decisions on what and when to build. You also have some tactical decisions to make when using small perks/abilities like healing, nuking, etc.-Limited tactical/strategic depth. The most you'll get out of this is scrambling your units in skirmish mode and figuring out the best strategy to use the mix of units-Less tug of war and more ""quick momentum""  type game. You can rarely recover from a bad decision and once the AI takes advantage it's basically over. -Multiplayer is nonexistentOverall it's a good casual time waster. It looks nice and I like to play it for 15 minutes or so when I'm listening to podcasts or music. Judging from a casual game perspective it's a good buy. Otherwise, just get it in a bundle or on a good sale.  "

The first few campaign missions are incredibly easy and quick, then I got stonewalled somewhere in the middle because the enemy ships aoe damage was too much too ever get a big enough fleet to win. I tried a few different fleet compositions but nothing really worked. In the end, I just got bored ~1 hour of play time. Kind of a waste, even for the <$1 I paid.			"

			Often representing three dimensional space in two dimensions is a tricky task but 'Aeon Command' solves this problem by reducing it down to just one dimension.		

Often representing three dimensional space in two dimensions is a tricky task but 'Aeon Command' solves this problem by reducing it down to just one dimension.The basic formula is sound but without the ability to control or even group units it leaves the player with barely anything to do but press the 'make ship' button until the momentum swings to their side.  There are multiple upgrade paths that will add some variance but little can be done to improve the game's snail pace and lack of interaction.			"

												This game maybe isn't for me._____________________I was reading other comments which said good things about this game. Art style, soothing music and design were all mentioned. Some mentioned tidbits about rewarding gameplay, from my experience this is completly wrong.Once again I was to say that maybe it's not the game I was looking for.Cons-------------------------------This is a space stragegy game about 3 races or factions that fight against each other. When you open up the game for the first time though, 2 of the races are locked. It seems that you have to finish each campaign before the next is unlocked. While this is all fine and dandy, it's not something I like becaise I can't just go in and play as well as something later.The tutorial is dreadful. The game has a skirmish mode and a tutorial mode. Why do I bring up both? Because they are the same thing apart from that the tutotorial has white text overlaying the screen. The tutorial isn't a smaller easier bite-sized part of the game. It's just throwing you in and then giving you commands that come to late for you to comprehend before the AI kills you in its standard skirmish mode. There are comments where people have only beaten the tutorial after ~30 hours. While this may be hypebole, I find this to be horrible. A tutorial should teach you how to play, not be a standard difficulty challenge with overlay.Campaign_________________I was never able to beat the second level of the first campaign. The reason being that no matter how fast or slow I macro, by the time a single one of my ships reaches their mothership a group of 5 ships magically appear from the enemy. Now this wouldn't be to bad as a swarming enemy is quite normal. What is horrible is that in combat a single enemy basic fighter can easily take down two of mine. It's not even a fair fight from the power standpoint let alone that they have 3 fighters and 2 bombers.Game Design)_________________Nothing about this game apart from having 3 campaigns tells me this is more than a simple flash game. Its a simple click to create units and earn money game. Simple create more units and send them along a path. If I could micro the units then it would make more sense, but you don't. They ride on rails and follow and AI.NOT WORTH TIME OR MONEY.			"

												This game is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It pretends to play something like a tower-defense game, however while giving you absolutely no control over your units, your enemies will recieve a hefty advantage over you when they choose which ships to focus attacks on.Did you just make a squadron of back-liners to follow behind your tanky ships? guess what, it doesn't matter! Why?, Because the enemy ships will IGNORE YOUR TANKS AND ATTACK THE BACK LINE ANYWAYS. SERIOUSLY, THIS IS WORSE THAN LOADED DICE. 0/10 no skill, 100% enemy handicaps.Also, just as an extra slap in the face; You die before the tutorial is finished explaining things. Your ship is literally destroyed by the enemy and you have to keep reading through the tutorial with the sign ""DEFEAT"" in the background blocking the text.			"

												I do not recommend this game because it is kind of dull. It's a sort of ""match the counter to the enemy unit"" game, but all you do is send your units to their death. Absolutely no micro managing your units. Honestly seemed like a waste of time, ever for cheap price.I would not recommend spending your time on this game,			"

												This game doesn't get how a campaign works. You have a tutorial but it only gives you a little information and then never explains more about it. You still have the first several missions of the game function basically as tutorial and it locks off units for you so you can't use them till it teaches them to you. Problem with this is that the game doesn't lock off the enemy in fact your enemy always has enough units in such numbers that you are outnumbered from the start and when it decides you need to fight well your enemy has a 7-1 advantage against you. Its not good.			"

												I got this one for 50% off. It would have still been a rip-off if I had got it for 100% off. This is the same as those crappy flash games and Android games where you just sit there and make units all day and they just mindlessly march toward the enemy base. If you like that kind of game, save your money and go play Stick War: http://www.stickpage.com/stickwargameplay.shtmlIt's basically the same game, but you at least have slightly more control over when to attack and defend.

												Recomended when it's on sale, or when it's not.  It's a good, low-intensity ""real time strategy"" game where you can't control your ships, you only control what's built and area healing/attacks (think psyonic storm).  After two hours or so you can find a pattern that always wins, but it's still relaxing to blow up ships, and the price is right.			"

												Excellent but simple tower defense/real time strategy in space. Seemingly all you do is collect resources and then send out ships, but there's quite a few types of them and many special powers and abilities, so it's all very satisfyingly detailed but not too complex. There are three campaigns for three factions, and even though i just started it looks like you could easily get ten hours of single player time with this, not counting multiplayer. Plus the music is excellent, just don't expect a detailed story - there's no voice overs or cinematics, very simple but great enjoyment. 8/10.			"

												This game is simple and fun. You just build ships with resources that you collect to defeat the enemy. Though it's much more complex than that. If you don't make the correct ships at the right time, then it can cost you a lot of wasted resources, and an injection of resources or energy from your destroyed ships.It still needs work, though. For one, the tutorial is just an extremely basic overview of everything, and the actual tutorial is in the campaign. So I would recommend to make the CURRENT ""campaigns"" into the tutorials, and make the campaigns more difficult as you progress, with maybe even some changes in rules sometimes to give some missions a bit more of a challenge. It would also be great for tooltips to exist, or at least a ""library"" of sorts with each ship's information. Perhaps give the game some more visual flair to make it look better.All in all, it's still a pretty good game. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a rather cheap game with a rather simple concept and some little bits of fun. I just wish more people were playing multiplayer...			"

												A tug of war that would be heinous if priced higher, but at 3$ without discounts, it's a good buy.Pros:Provides quite a bit of gameplay for its price tag.Cons:Enemy AI is overpowered in skirmish. Simply put, they get resource ramps, multiplied by difficulty, that results in an un-fun, artificial (not influenced by your gameplay or strategy whatsoever) challenge on anything higher than easy.Matchmaking is non-existent due to lack of players.Abilities, the sole direct influence you have on the battlefield, are unnecessary if you know which ships to build and upgrade. The AI abuses them with nearly unlimited amounts of energy on anything above easy.Completionist achievement expects entirely unrealistic amount of time devoted to harvesting skirmish wins for upgrades.Why do I recommend it with such glaring flaws?

This is a fun and challenging game, with many decisions that must be made quickly and on the fly as each encounter develops. Build a reinforcement now, or ""save up"" for a small fleet of reinforcements? Build a quick fighter, or wait for the resources to build a stronger ship or a support vessel? Victory or defeat depend on the choices you make. In many ways, the strategies of this game remind me of tower defence games.

												Not gonna lie, there really isn't much here and the factions are crazy imbalanced. It's a bit of a toss up as to wether the Exiles or Cyborg are better but the Empire is far inferior simply by design alone.With all that said: I had a ton of fun with my $3 game. I am still playing with the intention of completing all the upgrades and achievements (which are still few). I actually load up skirmishes freaquently just for fun. Getting upgrades is a happy side effect of the good times I am still having with this game.TL;DR: If you liked Castle Fight, Nexus Wars or, Desert Strike and would like playing that on a smaller scale with space ships then this is for you. Should be roughly a day of content and is a steal when on sale.			"

												If there is something this ""tug-o-war"" game does a little bit more differently, it's indeed having a ""full-scale"" ""2D-plane under use instead of just a left-right, meaning that shots can be missed which allows some mixing with unit-spams.Otherwise for the most part there isn't anything ""new"" brought to table alongside a number a similar games (e.g. ""Alien Hallway"" and ""Swords & Soldiers""): The strategies are quite similar as in others similar to Aeon Command (max the resource gatherers, don't trickle the units but instead mass spawn, etc.).But I do recomment getting this for a dollar or whatever one considers a ""single coin""; it's still well build and stable software-coding and such-wise.

Since it is just me and Hank who own the game. Though, how fun would multi-player really be when endgame on hard can be won in under 4 minutes consistently. It would come down to who can build in a specific order the quickest. Which is pretty much how I beat the game in the end. Still a fun game.			"

The gameplay is pretty good. The story is not that special but u have 3 characters/races to play and that's pretty great. Every race has 6 different battleships and 3 different special powers. After you finish the story mode you probably won't replay it but there is a multiplayer that looks pretty promising. When you play it you need to be a little strategic.

												First off, the tutorial is a joke!  It made me laugh pretty hard!  lol That alone was worth the .74 cents I bought this game for! lol  Anyway, during the tutorial a real game is running in the background.  You read some text and then try some things in the real game.  You do this for a bit.  Problem is, the enemy is building up forces while you're reading and learning!  The enemy killed me way before the tutorial was over, so I couldn't do anything but quit! The text I was reading and the game over screen were mixed together making it unreadable!  LMAO!!!  Great tutorial dev's! lolI played a skirmish after the good laugh that I had, but it was a constant tug-of-war game.  I had to quit the skirmish too as either side was not going to win and it got really boring and repetitive.  I did not play the campaign yet.  There really isn't much to do other than click on buttons to build ships, upgrade your ships and mine for resources to build more ships, which is also automatic.  Your ships move towards the enemy mothership and try to destroy it automatically and the enemy is doing the same.  That is where the problem lies with this game.  Since you cannot control your ships, you can't stock them up.  Plus there is a pause between building ships, so your ships are sent out one at a time and usually get killed.  It's a bad design choice IMO.Graphics and sound are okay.  Sometimes the battles are fun to watch.  You do get a few defensive weapons that you control.   You just seem to never build up enough ships fast enough to win and neither does the enemy.  I recommend this game to space combat junkies!  At the moment anyway…  I'll update this later when I spend more time with it.  I just wanted to post this real quick.It play's really smooth on my 6 y/o Mac laptop!

												This game is a fun little time waster. It's definitely casual and the strategy amounts to timing the launch of your units so that you have complimentary units supporting one another and receiving reinforcements steadily as they move across the map.  You also have research trees that steadily improve your units though not adding new abilities and each race has three special abilities.  Not bad all told and certainly worth the low price.Its not a complex game and it can be completed in a few days, but its got an almost zen like sense of fun once you get started. Worth a look.			"

Great tutorial dev's! lolI played a skirmish after the good laugh that I had, but it was a constant tug-of-war game.  I had to quit the skirmish too as either side was not going to win and it got really boring and repetitive.  I did not play the campaign yet.  There really isn't much to do other than click on buttons to build ships, upgrade your ships and mine for resources to build more ships, which is also automatic.  Your ships move towards the enemy mothership and try to destroy it automatically and the enemy is doing the same.  That is where the problem lies with this game.  Since you cannot control your ships, you can't stock them up.  Plus there is a pause between building ships, so your ships are sent out one at a time and usually get killed.  It's a bad design choice IMO.Graphics and sound are okay.  Sometimes the battles are fun to watch.  You do get a few defensive weapons that you control.   You just seem to never build up enough ships fast enough to win and neither does the enemy.  I recommend this game to space combat junkies!  At the moment anyway…  I'll update this later when I spend more time with it.  I just wanted to post this real quick.It play's really smooth on my 6 y/o Mac laptop!  Here are my system specs:  15"" PowerBook Pro, Intel Core 2 Duo 2.66 GHz, 4 MB system RAM, NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT with 256MB dedicated video RAM, running OS X version 10.6.8 (10K549), HSF+ Extended file system.

												You might think that a side-scrolling space game would be short about two dimensions of being  a game worth playing by current standards. You would be quite wrong. This is a fun and challenging game, with many decisions that must be made quickly and on the fly as each encounter develops. Build a reinforcement now, or ""save up"" for a small fleet of reinforcements? Build a quick fighter, or wait for the resources to build a stronger ship or a support vessel? Victory or defeat depend on the choices you make. In many ways, the strategies of this game remind me of tower defence games. BUT ... you have here a strong recommendation from a gamer who finds tower defence games—and most side-scrollers—to be tedious.			"

												I got a discount from making badges for this game and thought it looked alright for a couple bucks and the reviews had me buy it.I haven't played hours and hours but I think i've played enough for a fair judgement.I think the first thing to note is this, quote, from the official site, ""How long does each game last?Between 5-10 minutes. Our goal was to make a casual strategy game that could be played over a lunch break.""And it does just that. I tried it late at night when  i wanted to play something chill and relaxing to end my day nicely and go to bed soon after. So I ran this game for the first time and had some fun, got the cards and made a badge too.Multiple factions to play and face each with unique ships. Upgrade system, 24 missions, classic 3 difficulties and cross platform multiplayer (i have not played MP). You can't go wrong with $3USD at all.If you're looking for a chill game to play after a long day or to play when you only 30mins-1hr of free time and don't want to commit to a bigger game, or even if you want to buy it and fully complete it straight out, this game is worth picking up.Also if you have children or younger siblings who like to game and especially like SciFi stuff, then I feel this would also be fun for them too.

												Fun Game, very good for when you have a short time to play something.  After going through the tutorial challenges  (which are fun and challenging) to get to know the various ship and weapon types of the three races, I started in on skirmish mode, where I can pick the Range (Close or Regular), the Resource Availability (10 asteroids or 25), the Difficulty of the AI opponent (Easy, Medium, or Hard), and I can set my Side to be ...Regular, Random, or Scrambled. Scrambled sends you out with a fleet comprised of vessels from all three of the races, so you never know what you will have for your battle fleet.My games last from about 4 minutes...  to the longest game ran 21 minutes for me.  So its a nice ""I got 15 -20 minutes to Kill '  game.   I also very much enjoyed that hint of a BSG feel to the ship construction in some of the fleets.All in all, its a game I enjoy and will go back to again and again for a quick mental refresh and an entertainment 'pick me up'.   I definitely recommend it.			"

												Great little game, though unfortunately somewhat short single-player campaign mode. I found the tactical element in the end not as important as I first thought, and overall the game was somewhat different from what I expected based on its description. This is more of a casual little in-betweener if you don't expect to much depth from a game of this kind. Still can get pretty hectic at times, and may require multiple attempts for some of the missions.Depth: CasualSetting: Sci-FiType: TacticalMy Rating: 8 out of 10			"

												A surprisingly simple but very okay game.I'd vote against getting this if you expect some super dramatic and graphical spaceship war game, but if you know what you're looking for - a basic Build-and-Watch tactical game - then this would be a very good bet. I'd not call it 'bare bones' so much as admit it's a very simple game that focuses more on the planning and gameplay than anything else; that's not to say that they ignored everything else, but you can easily see what their best aspect is.Difficulty-wise, I'd say it's too easy. I like a challenge now and again, and the thing here is that with a simple game comes a simple A.I. - one that needs a bit of a boost (resource-wise) to keep up with an actual planning player (and will nearly always still fall short to one who's actually on their feet and assiging commands properly). That's not to say the game's not fun - there's still a simple satisfaction in playing it and seeing your amassed army do the dirty work for you.Achievements-wise, this game will take you a while. It's rather easy to hit 100% since the story mode is a glorified tutorial and introduction (with smatterings of plot, I guess) and the career achievements are really ones that would take you a fair bit of time. It wont even take you that long to come up with a winning build that could consistently win you games at 4-5minutes each and it's just a matter, then, of putting in the hours.Overall, I would recommend it. It's simple but good, and the for the price, matches expectations.			"

												Very fun little game. Took me around 4-5 hours to go through the campaigns but it was very pleasant. Plan to definitely play more now and then.This game does the ""hands-off"" -approach well - instead of microing you need to think about the fleet composition and when exactly to launch your ships and how many/what kind. For example, ships in a cluster kill targets fast and don't really take much damage in return..but certain ships have AOE-abilities that really hurt clusters. There is also the question of whether to research upgrades or to send out un-upgraded ships faster. The activated abilities require good timing to get the maximum value out of. I felt like the difficulty only really picked up some in the last campaign, so I think the campaigns could have been harder and/or have couple more ""hard"" missions near the end. But that is a minor complaint.So overall:+ gameplay+ graphics and sound+ concept - it works+ upgrade/research system+ addicting - felt the need to finish it as I was enjoying it - campaigns could have been harder..especially near the end would have liked couple more tough missions - but overall the campaigns were still pleasure to play through			"

												This game is a fun little time waster. It's definitely casual and the strategy amounts to timing the launch of your units so that you have complimentary units supporting one another and receiving reinforcements steadily as they move across the map.  You also have research trees that steadily improve your units though not adding new abilities and each race has three special abilities.  Not bad all told and certainly worth the low price.Its not a complex game and it can be completed in a few days, but its got an almost zen like sense of fun once you get started. Worth a look.			"

												This game is simple and fun. You just build ships with resources that you collect to defeat the enemy. Though it's much more complex than that. If you don't make the correct ships at the right time, then it can cost you a lot of wasted resources, and an injection of resources or energy from your destroyed ships.It still needs work, though. For one, the tutorial is just an extremely basic overview of everything, and the actual tutorial is in the campaign. So I would recommend to make the CURRENT ""campaigns"" into the tutorials, and make the campaigns more difficult as you progress, with maybe even some changes in rules sometimes to give some missions a bit more of a challenge. It would also be great for tooltips to exist, or at least a ""library"" of sorts with each ship's information. Perhaps give the game some more visual flair to make it look better.All in all, it's still a pretty good game.

												If there is something this ""tug-o-war"" game does a little bit more differently, it's indeed having a ""full-scale"" ""2D-plane under use instead of just a left-right, meaning that shots can be missed which allows some mixing with unit-spams.Otherwise for the most part there isn't anything ""new"" brought to table alongside a number a similar games (e.g. ""Alien Hallway"" and ""Swords & Soldiers""): The strategies are quite similar as in others similar to Aeon Command (max the resource gatherers, don't trickle the units but instead mass spawn, etc.).But I do recomment getting this for a dollar or whatever one considers a ""single coin""; it's still well build and stable software-coding and such-wise.

In a cross between the resource collection of traditional RTSs and A.I.-controlled armies of Nexus Wars-style games, AC has you manipulating and abusing the A.I. through strategy instead of clicking faster than your opponent.

Music isn't distracting nor annoying when looped and it has a bit of a Faster Than Light feel, so if you like that game, I highly recommend this one. The campaign can be challenging, particularly since each ""race/faction"" requires a different strategy to use the various ships. The three groups, Alliance, Cyborg, and Exile, are very well balanced within themselves and against the other races/factions. The only minor glitching I saw as an occassional enemy controlled ship flying off the map and self destructing, other than that, its a smooth run.Pros:-Simple to Complex RTS-Great art, style, music, game play and story-Entertaining and fun-Easy, if not a little grindy, achievementsCons:-Felt a tad bit short-The escape menu in game does not pause the game (don't find out the hard way lol)-No way of directing a ships path (aka, make a ship not fly through a poisonous cloud/sit in it like a tard)Overall: 9/10			"

												Fun. Easy, Quick attack/defend.Easy way to kill 5 minutes or 3 hours....I highly recommend setting resolution as low as possible, because the view zooms in much more. The details seem better and faster as well. I usually keep it as HD as possible as I am playing on a HDTV via HDMI. It looks great that way.			"

												This is a reasonably fun game, but the upgrades are absolutely worthless. I tested all three exiles dragon upgrades vs a player with no exiles upgrades, and we both sent one dragon vs the other. The result was mine winning with maybe 2-3% hp left.			"

												It's a fun little quick game. Almost kinda like plants vs zombies, but without placing anything (ships auto attack). I was hoping for a bit more depth to the customization of the ships and a slightly longer campaign, and wished the three races were a bit more different from each other, but all in all, a quick little game that was enjoyable to play.

												If you're like me and you like a tug-o-war like game just like the mods/maps in WC3 and Starcraft2 then you'll find this game right up your alley.PROS:Beautiful looking gameSuperb soundtracknice progression (you don't get overwhelmed with stuff and you're gradually given access to every aspect of the game)CONS: Campaign way too easy (I beat it in 2.7 hours)Short campaignCan win by spamming the same unit over and over and upgrading it.But would still recommend it, thoroughly enjoyed it. As short as it was. "
