												I don't understand how people could complain about this game being the same as the previous one. I think it's obvious that it's a direct sequel to Banner Saga.The game is great, the characters and their abilities are even more original in this one. And I hope we will see Banner Saga 3, even if it's going to be ""the same"" - I will still play it. PS: One of the characters is literally based on Thomas Middleditch's face. How about that huh?!:https://www.instagram.com/p/BAz87Y8xDpO/ "

												Superb improvement over an already decent original. The combat is more interesting with a greater variety of both allied and enemy units and more in the way of battleground terrain and structures. The storyline is also improved over the original   and the better quality of writing is almost instantly apparent. The training tent is also not so much of a white elephant and now periodically contains training puzzles which boost reknown on completion. The somewhat boring travelling sections have also been given an overhaul and creating a good balance between fighters and clansmen is no longer just random as clansmen can now be trained into fighters at the training tent. These fighters will consume twice as much food as clansmen and clansmen will now actively scavenge making them more than just the dead weight they were previously. It's certainly an advantage to have played the original (and the final save from your previous adventure can be imported) as continuity is maintained with regard to storyline and base mechanics. But despite this BS2 remains a better and more well rounded game than the first making it a must-buy for story driven TBS fans. The only valid reason I can see for not getting hold of BS2 is if you absolutely hated the original - and why anyone would have is beyond me.			"

												The more i play of the Banner Saga, the more im reminded of Dan Simmons epic novel about the doomed Franklin Arctic Expedition ""The Terror"". In The Terror, Captain Francis Crozier tries desperately to save the lives of the 120 souls still alive in his command as they fend off starvation, scurvy, mutiny and hauling thousand pound sledges across Sea Ice, all while running from an unstoppable threat that is hunting and killing his men one by one. Every decision Crozier makes seems to reult in more and more deaths but the alternatives are even worse.In the Banner Saga 2, you continue your journey as Rook, leading your caravan of fighters, clansmen and giant horned blokes as you fight off mutiny, starvation, and a relentless enemy that is hounding you literally to the ends of the earth. Every decision you make for the good of your clansmen might seem straightforward at the time but will generally wind up biting you in the♥♥♥♥♥down the line as you struggle to keep morale and supplies from running out, and your people safe from the rampaging Dredge. 10/10 but could really use some kind of Scurvy stat for my starving clansmen			"

 Banner Saga 2 Review Banner Saga 2 is finally here and it carries on where it left off. This review will analyze the amazing amount of fun I had in my first playthrough (many more to come) of TBS2 and the moments that were less than pleasant. I aim at comparing the second game's structure to TBS1, and measuring the good, bad changes. Alright lets break it down. Story Very much drawn up like a Tolkien-esque world, Banner Saga 2 plays out like the Two Towers of Tolkien, great fantasy writing accompanies the 2nd novel in a great trilogy that builds up to an upcoming climax in the third. Although it stumbles in a few places, the story proves to drive this epic adventure well into its second episode. The story starts off at a meager pace and suffers from bogged down streaks of fighting(explained in gameplay section).  However, these negative aspects are QUICKLY and STRONGLY forgotten when thrown into the heat of the carvan's struggle of getting to one story sequence after another. Tolkien's Two towers is the worst of the best and the same can be said for this game. The first Banner Saga had a more complete narrative that was well supported by its characters and driven by tension from one scene to the next. Banner Saga 2 struggles to build tension or as intense interest in the beginning than the first game did, but with the option to start where your clan left off, this breathes continuity in the epic and gives it a semblance of being one game. Because of this, the first saga helps drive the second extensively. It does not fail to set up a Banner Saga 3 to outperform this entry in the series.+Great story is continued+sets up for a climactic finale-story does drag in the beginning                                                                                                   --- 8.5/10 --- Characters The old group is back headed by the two protagonists Rook and Iver. These characters that are brought about from the first installment led with remarkable chemistry prompted by great writing. Unfortunately,   many supporting characters don't get the screen dialogue time to continue developing themselves and create the sense of a united clan that was present in the first game. This is because the cast of characters grows too huge during this game and many characters were left behind either too late in the game or appeared not enough. Many new characters are ho-hum and plagued with some poor character designs that mimic the original cast slightly.  Its only a select few of new characters that shine through and represent the new regions visited. These select new characters bond and become a part of a character driven exchange that works well with the story.+Original characters are great+A dynamic interplay between characters-Too many new dull characters -lack of further development in some older characters                                                                 --- 8/10 --- Gameplay The gameplay consists of leading a clan across the tundra and forest making decisions that effect the outcome of the story and the survival of the clan. When battle ensues, characters can be chosen to fight in a tactics style form of combat. Gameplay differs from the original in a few good ways and many uncessary ways. Firstly, the caravan system is now unbalanced. With the ability to find food far more easily and obtain renown especially too easy, management of food is almost never a problem. More renown is gained every battle, almost exponentially as the game goes on and this plays to TBS2's detriment. This leads to mass upgrading of characters and not as great care to tactical upgrading. The renown needed for upgrading is also designed incorrectly. The satisfaction of leveling up a character and feeling as if a distinction exists between levels is muddled. I found myself with the majority of my characters being able to level up 3-4 times in a row because of the previous kills that carry over to the next level. This also led to most of my characters being OP throughout much of the game and very little difficulty in combat. Combat soon became tedious at parts because battles would consist of enemies that presented no challenge at all for stretches of the game. The great aspects of the combat are still there however, and thats what makes this game's battle system amazing despite the related shortcomings. EDIT: I played this game on normal and that should represent the adequate balance of difficulty and story telling. But in the end, the combat was too easy.+original combat has not changed-leveling and character progression is shoddy-difficulty has been nerfed from the last Banner Saga-last fights proved to be far too easy--- 7/10 --- Presentation The main aspect of this game that makes it great and separates it from every other game is and always has been -- its presentation. The atmosphere created by its authentic Celtic/Nordic music and a throwback art style that is captivating and adds so much to the game. The art is beautiful and haunting when it needs to be. The characters are represented well save for a few new characters that look awkward.+Music is perfect+animation is classic and unique to games of this day.+Creates an atmosphere that is an ensemble of perfection-New characters have questionable designs--- 9.5/10 --- Conclusion The second Banner saga was amazing and amped up the story to an amazing height that can only get higher in Banner Saga 3. It was easy to tell when the first Banner Saga came out that it would turn into something awe inspiring and it has. A game I immediately want to play after beating it is a rarity for me, but now it just seems ritualistic to me with Banner Saga. Don't hold out on this one, it is one of my favorites and the game is truly a gem.--- 8.25 --- TOTAL SCOREEDIT: TBS2 is by no means a perfect game, and the story is very well constructed, its gameplay is poorly integrated at times and the 2nd game is a step down from the previous. This game deserves more criticism than it is getting and the amazing story should not blind the analysis of the game as a whole. This game should be paid more attention to, its originality has sparked the creation of other games following its lead.			"

												In 2014 I had the pleasure of playing through Banner Saga 1, and I had this to say in my review:""There's something about this game that I can't put my finger on. It might be the entracing music, the Disney quality hand-drawn art, or perhaps it's the fact that everytime I play this game it's always 30 minutes later than I expected it to be. The combat is simple, for the uninitiated. As you begin to dive into the character types, their respective special attacks, and equipable items, you'll soon realize that there is a depth to the combat that will keep you coming back. When the odds are seemingly against you, and you do in fact manage to reduce your foe to a single unit vs. one or more of your own, you will feel like a champion. A real champion.What has surprised me the most about The Banner Saga is the number of choices and chances the game allows. Every combat decision, every discussion, every step on the map brings consequences.I can't tell you whether or not you should buy The Banner Saga, but I can tell you that you would almost be a fool not to.""Even though I've (so far) only played Banner Saga 2 for an hour, I am happy to tell you that 2 years later everything I adored in TBS1 is alive and well in TBS2. The art, the music, all of the hard and rewarding decisions are back.Anyone that loved The Oregon Trial, enjoys turn based combat, or just wants to experience a really well made game should pick up The Banner Saga 2 now.Oh, and your save from TBS1 can be imported. If you didn't play the first (and I highly recommend doing so!) you can press a Recap button on the main menu to get up to speed.I look forward to playing this game over the next 15-20 hours and salivating over The Banner Saga 3 for the next year+ :)			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: StoicPublishers: Versus EvilInitial release: April 2016Genre: Strategy, RPG, Turn Based, Dark#Worth/NotWorth: #AbsolutelyWorth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationThe Saga continues.......... and is improved in almost every way. What was an incredible game the first time around is even better as the story continues. Up front you are given the options for importing your save or selecting one of the characters to be your main leader. As I am not of the group of people that attempt to play sequels before their former experience has been gone through I cannot speak to how approachable this is if you did not play the first Banner Saga. As for what should be quite obvious I imagine, this is a highly narratively driven game. The combat system remains very similar but is vastly improved. More classes and more abilities. Maxing a stat now gives you options to further improve that stat. Options like Robust or Divert. Being a percent chance to resist strength damage and avoid armor damage respectively. Among many other ways to specialize. You lead your caravan as you did in Banner Saga 1 but even this is improved. Clansman, fighters and Varl still aid you. Helping in foraging and fighting. The tough balancing act of having fighters to aid in battle at the expense of using up more supplies on the road. As well as attempting to hold some morality in the events that take place. How it is improved is that the consequences your actions are having are much more clearly conveyed to you. Including the very real effects of morale on your caravan. Training at camp also has added functionality in that you can now train clansman to fighters. Additionally there are challenges to be had in training as well.  The party also splits and is told from differing perspectives. As it seems tradition for the series. The actual story telling is also even higher in production value this time around. Extremely well animated cut scenes and quite a bit more voice acting is present. The hand drawn art style continues to be vastly gorgeous. Though the main crux of the story is told through text.If you enjoyed The Banner Saga 1. This game is that and plenty more.Follow my curation for more "

												Before you read, note that English is not my native language, so expect errors and for that I apologize in advance. Let me fill you in if you have no idea what the Banner Saga is. You are nobody and you wake up to find the world that you and everyone once know is breaking apart. You struggle to get by and are forced to make tough calls, so that you and your people can survive. And through these choices you are bringing changes -- though small, they may escalate. I am not going to tell you the exact plot, since it would spoil the fun.TL;DR:+Decent story+Super amazing music+Even more super amazing art style-Lore not very friendly to people new to the seriesVerdict: Recommend, and I recommend you to play BS1 as well if you haven't played it yet------------------------------------------------------When I recommend BS1 to my friends I'd say ""a perfect game, if not for a lousy lack of unit variety and customization"".Well, it's a good thing to see this time the ""if not"" part gets improved greatly. While inheriting the already-interesting move-based system, Stoic put a lot of work in character development. Compared to merely investing stat in BS1, in BS2 you can get talents (passive abilities), characters get more abilities through progression and some of them got to choose one from many, which allows players larger room for customization. Even though the optimum is easy to find, it's still an amazing improvement compared to the system of BS1. Of course there are new units introduced to both the protagonist side and the enemy.Not much to say about the art style. I did enjoy the look of BS1, so here I enjoy BS2's too, and they include more cutscenes this time I think. Notably there are some more boldly designed godstones compared to mere faces engraved on a rock in BS1.Music is composed by Austin Wintory as well. I personally prefer BS1's music rather than this one -- maybe because I know what to expect this time. I'm particularly impressed by the song in the end.The game itself is shorter than BS1 and I see people grumble about that, but it gets more immersive this time IMO. Some say the ending leaves things hanging, but you know how a trilogy works: the first one introduces the setting, in the second things escalates and followed by the third, the grand finale. I hope I can live long enough to play BS3 before darkness consumes the world. :(Update: tBS3 is happening. Successfully kickstarted. Another remarkable thing is that your save from BS1 can be imported. It's not super impressive since we all know Bioware's been doing that the whole time, but it's still decent enough: in an unforgiving world where you are forced to make tough decisions, save import reminds you that your choices have effect.I could, but I am not going to discuss in-depth since the new review showcase policy is discouraging (volvo only cares whether you give a thumb-up or thumb-down, not the decency of your writing), but I think my point is crystal clear: I recommend this game even at full-price to those who have played BS1. And for folks new to the Banner Saga, I suggest you to buy them both. Honestly, this game is amazing and it's sad to see BS2 doesn't get as much attention as BS1 did.			"

												10/10 - I Guess You Can’t CAN Improve on Perfect.It’s always nerve racking when I begin a sequel of a series I adore. I believed this high standard that was established couldn't be lived up to… and it wasn’t… it was exceeded!! Your choices from the first offering can be uploaded and change the dynamic of the second game, but it’s not required to enjoy this title. The story picks up where the other left off, following our heroes as they continue to battle against impossible odds in an attempt to circumnavigate the ever deteriorating wasteland. Making matter worse; our heroes must stay ahead of a deadly enemy that is sweeping through the world destroying everything in it’s wake. The most notable improvements on the first game include a pretty sweet survival mode that consists of 40 waves; any characters you have unlocked during the campaign can be called upon to form your army. This is straight waves of turn-based combat but definitely worth a go… and it’s in beta so it will continue to evolve. Next, I was impressed with the combat improvements. I felt the AI was much more intuitive and found myself struggling to survive in the beginning; since survival of your group is the only objective this can cause some tense moments and cause you to carefully plan for combat. Overall, this game really improved on an already stellar offering. You get another 10-14 riveting campaign and a fun survival mode which just adds to the depth of content. Worth full price; usually on sale now so grab it!(Vacation Review #4 of 28) Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

												Since I really loved The Banner Saga 1, I made sure to pre-order the second as soon as it became available, and started playing it on the same evening it was released. Well, it took me around 12 hours over three long evenings to beat the game, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to begin again very soon. At the time of writing this review, Steam says I've been playing for 8 hours, but it didn't take into account around 4 hours of game time in which I was offline.For those of you not familiar with the games all, The Banner Saga is a series of Tactical Role Playing Games. While the game's environment is a fictional fantasy world, it is somewhat connected to the norse mythology. I don't know much about the norse mythology, but I did notice some connections, such as Hogun and Mogun, and I suppose there are others as well.Anyway, just like in the first game, in The Banner Saga 2 you alternate between leading 2 different groups of adventurers (for a lack of a better term) on their continued quest. The game is a direct continuation of the first, so while you can watch a recap of what happened during the first game and start playing the second one immediately, I really suggest playing and beating the first one first, so you can carry your savegame over to the second, and continue with the exact same party you ended the first game with. The battle-system is interesting, refreshing but simple enough to learn. I know some people have been complaining it's too simplistic, but I don't share that view. The graphics are great and so is the soundtrack, but what makes this game so much fun for me, is the story. It's refreshingly dark and interesting. Also, the choices you make have a major impact on the game, which also means you'd probably want to play through it more than once, to explore different options and see what happens when you choose different directions.Also, it seems like the developers managed to take some of the problematic aspects of the first game and improve them. For one, The Banner Saga 2 is much more flexible than the first, when it comes to promoting your characters. You get much more freedom in choosing which ones to level-up, which in turn, gives you more tactical options in battles.  Not only that, you also get a much larger veriaty of characters to choose from. In addition, this time there are training scenarios, in which you get to learn to use your characters' most important special abilities. I really like this game, and would recommend it to anyone who likes tactical and story-driven RPGs.			"

												Can't say I'm good with worsd so I'll be short and compare it to its prequel.The Banner Saga 2 is the direct continuation of The Banner Saga and uses the same mechanics but better is all terms.The fights have been much better crafted making each of those different from others. Now with different goals, battlefield shape and better balanced, they inscribe themselves much better in the story.The enemy variety has more than doubled (most likely tripled) with more types and a new race.Levels now go to 10 with a second skill choice at rank 6, getting a new unique skill for some characters and a same base class skill for others.Overall difficulty is better balanced.The story feels darker and most pressed than before with big revelations .Importing saves from the 1st game will make you feel this is YOUR story (in a way), somewhat more to me than with the Mass Effect games.The only part that I think needs more work would be - as with the last game - the Caravan with its clansmen and fighters.Now clansmen gather food which replenishes your supplies and fighters protect those clansmen, which gives a renown bonus in fight depending on the number protected.Unfortunately this still feels like a missed chance to make something deeper. It is better than TBS but still could be more useful and impactful.Overall I greatly suggest fans of good stories and TRPGs play this game, even if they haven't played the 1st (new games are well supported, balanced to be a little better than average import). I loved it even more than The Banner Saga.Oh, and Austin Wintory made once more a great OST by adding more instruments (I believe) and adding the Islandic band Árstíðir to already great names (Malukah, Peter Hollens...)

												Amazing, amazing game. If you enjoyed the first one, this is a no-brainer instabuy. The story is still fantastic, and the gameplay has had a few tweak that improve it, as well as lots of new depth with the higher level characters.For those of you who haven't played the first, go buy and play it immediately before you even think about starting this one. They're essentially parts of the same story, and you won't know wtf is going on unless you complete the part one first.Now, for slightly more detail: what you have here is a great example of what people mean when they talk about video games as art. The graphics, while not top-of-the-line 3D freakshow perfect, are gorgeous for what they are. The art stlye is really distinctive, and all the characters look great. The music and sound effects are well done too, with the former appropriately mournful and exhilirating while the latter adds a lot of impact to everything the text describes. There is only minimal voicing of dialogue for key moments. Mostly, you're reading everything. Thankfully, the dialogue and plot are tremendous, really the highlights of the game. You'll make a lot of meaningful decisions, and second guess almost every decision you make.But the combat is great too. It's a basic grid-based, turn-based system with a few significant deviations from the norm. Instead of a single health bar that needs to be brought down to zero, you've got armor and strength. The first is what protects you from damage, obviously, while the second is both your attack power and your health. So as you get weaker and closer to death, you are able to dish out less damage. This leads to a lot of interesting strategic choices, as you can attack each separately, meaning you have to decide when to sacrifice damaging strength in the short term (and thus limiting your own strength damage on counterattacks) for armor damage that will give long term benefits in future attacks. It's quite a balancing act.On top of that, each side alternates a single attack before the other side gets to attack, regardless of how many characters are alive in each group. So a pair of fighters battling a group of six would basically each get three turns in the same time the other six got one each. The only time this changes is when a team gets down to one character, which switches combat to pillage mode. In this mode, the single combatant gets one move, then the entire other team gets to move. It's usually a quick mop up at this point. But this leads to even more complexity, as taking out weak enemies first (a staple of turn-based combat) only means the stronger enemies get more frequent attacks. Generally, spreading out damage evenly is more effective, as it means more of the enemy attacks will be weak. In fact, it's ofter better to leave a bunch of weak enemies alive instead of finishing them off until all enemies are weakened.These twists keep combat fresh and interesting. Combine that with the story, and you've what I'm calling my game of the year so far. I only beat the first game a few months ago, and was thrilled to find out the sequel was coming out. I have not been disappointed one bit. I'm completely sucked back in and loving it.One note: there is a third part coming, so, as with the first part, this one ends with the story still unfinished. But as they say, it's the journey, not the destination, and this journey is phenomenal. If you like turn-based combat, or good plot and dialoge, or any combination, get this ASAP.			"

												Banner Saga 2 might not be a straight copy of Banner Saga 1, but it's not far to be.There is nothing really new and big, but there are numerous little additions in the combat/level up department:- Heroes can level up to 10 levels- Player can level up heroes in training tent- At level 6 each hero will have the possibility to get a new ability, sometimes Unique (Rook, Alette, Eyvind), sometimes from the pool of other classes (Egil can get the ability of a trasher or other)Here is a reminder of the classes: http://bannersaga.gamepedia.com/ClassSo basically, after level 6 you can dual class.- On top of that, each stat that is maxed (STR, ARM, EXE, WP, etc.) can now get a passive, that usually comes with a % effectiveness. So the game becomes more RNG than BS1.You can have for instance 10,20,30% to do a crit. or 20% to avoid 1,2,3 str damage, if you maxed out STR on a certain character. - New enemies: There are about 3-4 new kind of enemies.Out of combat, there is one little addition, you can now train your clansmen into fighters.But this is where Banner Saga becomes so dull.It doesn't matter how many clansmen or fighters you have. It doesn't matter at all.They are just number/stats, that do not have any impact whatsoever.And to prove further that they are just numbers, Stoic had the good idea to let the player hire fighters on the road in flat numbers.For instance, if any fighter group decide to join you, it will bump your numbers to +50,+100,+20.It's like all the attention to detail to the music, lore, dialogues, etc. sucked Stoic focus, and your clansmen and fighters are the least of their concern. While... you are playing a caravan chieftain that is suppose to pay attention to its men.That was the whole point... the people that you protect...Well, they are just numbers, so, you better prepare to role-play, because nothing in the game will support the fact that they are real number.Enjoy a game with 0 clansmen and 0 fighters, and the inconsistencies of the dialogue and adventure will slap you in the face.I think this is the biggest flaw of the game.Other than Iver loosing his right arm, and then switching to left, switching back to right, and left, and right...But where BS2 really shine is for its choices/consequences aspect. It just expand over Banner Saga.The way I see it. You could compare Banner Saga to a growing tree with 3 branchs, those 3 branchs would reflect the number of choices you made during the game. Now, with BS2, you can add 3 more branchs on each previous branchs.There are a lot more choices to make, and I would say 2 major choices are actually not tied to dialogues, but through combat.Also, there are 3 different ''direct'' ending to this one.I would like to rate BS2 a solid 8/10, I so much want. But the problem is the constant not caring of the devs for the serie issues. None of BS1 issues have been fixed.How is that possible?And for me, there are really just two issues.The dull caravan numbers, and Iver's arm switching there and there. Oh and... yeah, people wound switching, governor hand switching... So for me, it will be a 7/10.			"

												So far the sequel is better in almost every single way. You have even more tactical decisions to make, be it while on the road or in battle. Your heroes can be promoted to higher ranks and they can also learn new abilities which you can choose at rank 6. Also, you keep and struggle with all your heroes and decisions from previous savegame, so I strongly recommend to play The Banner Saga first.			"

It's better in almost every aspect with the exception of even more open ending (but it's a middle part of the whole story, so I expected it to be like that). Core gameplay stays the same, but it's much more diverse. Developers added more unit types, skills, more type of enemies and a race of horseborn with unique skills and atributes. Another novelty they added are battlefield objectives - so not every battle requires You to kill every enemy on the field but fullfil some task instead. Visuals are stunning as in first saga. It's pleasant to look at. And there are more cutscenes, animations and voiced monologues to enjoy.Without going into any details that might lead to spoilers - story was captivating and kept me hungry for more trough the whole playtrough (and because of the open ending, I'm still hungry even after finishing it). Choices still matter and some have very harsh consequences. You can start with one of two different main characters (based on the choice from previous installment). I have yet to discover how much different the story will be.Those who liked the previous game will enjoy the second even more. I recommend to play first saga before going to second, because without it You'd be boarding a moving train. "

												The Banner Saga is, and always was planned as, a trilogy. The second installment starts just after the end of the first one, and continues as natually as it could get.Stoic did really well to upgrade the gameplay without ruining the balance, and bring more drama to the storyline. Story-wise this game is somewhat shorter than the first one, but the tactical challenge of combat got to a new level with all new abilities, classes and strategies!The only downside to this game is that we need to have another ~2 year wait to get Banner Saga 3, and the story got so packed and ends abruptly without answering many of the questions so it leaves one itching for the next game.

												Amazing, just like the first game.The story is just overwhelming, there is a ton of different choices and consequences wich leads to so many different paths, whetever it's from choosing actions such as setting camp or risk eating unknown berries wich might prove toxic, to trusting people and much more wich has lead me to a very tough end to bear with.Definitely get both The Banner Saga 1 'n' 2 if you're in to vikings and such.Desperately waiting for the third Banner Saga.

												The Banner Saga 2 it's more of a continuation than a sequel, but the improvements that this game has over the previous one make this game incredibly enjoyable.I know some people found their experience on the past game quite challenging or even frustrating but in TBS2 trust me that you will enjoy this ride like you have never ever enjoyed a Turn based strategy game.Improvements in common gameplay!The caravan system has been vastly improved, now those lazy clansmen actually bring much necessary food/supplies to you! By hunting and foraging and thus keeping up your survavility rate! This allows you to do something that in TBS1 would be unimaginable and that is Purchasing Items from the market! Can you believe it? Well neither can I and that's just awesome! There are awesome items that are worth every renown point.Also random encounters generate higher morale stats which was something very rarely heard in TBS1.Also it has as you begin the game, it explains to you with simplicity and in great detail on how the game works and how each thing works and why is it there and what it means. It's just like they took everything from TBS1 and made it a million times better and added a bunch of new cool awesome stuff.Improvements on heroes!Speaking of which, now your heroes can reach level 10! And whilst in TBS1 it costed a lot of renown, now it's much cheaper. PLUS! they gave us the introduction to new perks! Perks can make your hero into a tank, regenerate will power or armor or simply become a whirlwind of death.Heroes can also obtain a new ability once they reach level 5/6! And this is fantastic as it brings more variations and new strategies to play with.Art Department:As expected of Stoic, TBS2 explodes to unbelivable levels of Awesome and beautiful when it comes to their art department, If you thought that TBS1 was beautiful just you wait until you see this one! The journey overall it's more epic, you see more of the world and it makes you feel like you really are a part of an animated fantasy film! But in this case of a different piece of narrative and art.The music it's beautiful and if you are fan of game/movie music I highly recommend to get the soundtrack, because it just nails it and gets ""them muh feels!"" I would even compare the combination of both to a Jame Cameron movie in the sense of complete immersion.The Narrative it's way more smooth, it gets more interesting and intense. Build up from the 1st game is given fruits on this one and naturally the gae keeps branching on it. We learn more about the world of TBS and it's people. Also the new Godstones are bautiful and interesting.This game has more replayable value than you can imagine, specially due to all of the branching that it has ""not only depending on how you finished the first game"" but also on the decisions that you take during this one. Even if the story is sort of lineal, it is really an RPG since your decisions really take a weigh and reward in this game.It also left me wanting for more because it was awesome, and the new animation segments are great!Seriously, maybe you think its going to be hard but this game it's actually easy BUT! it can also be challenging if you wish it to be so! It also has many surprises depending on what you decide.So yeah! Go for it because it was worth every penny.			"

												Like TBS, TBS2 is a great story game with a terrible strategy game attached to it. The turn-based combat is a drawn-out slog where the best strategy is to delay every fight as long as possible to setup a full team kill, so that weakened enemies waste turns in the meantime. The game also poorly explains many of the new mechanics and skills, and fails to give proper guidance on many missions, forcing you to fail to actually figure out what the win conditions are.The story or ""Oregon Trail Lite"" would be acceptable if you weren't arbitrarily punished by your decisions. There are no difficult decisions to make about what to do, because every choice is either right or wrong. You either pick the right choice and get a bonus, or you pick the wrong choice and a crucial party member is killed or half your caravan is destroyed.---What I originally wrote was just supposed to be a short review, so let me clarify some points. Admittedly I was melodramatic about the game destroying half your caravan and party for a bad choice. That only happens once.Now what makes a good game? Choice.What makes a good story game? Making you feel like your choices had meaning.How does a story game do this? Giving the choices you didn't make, a real impact to the plot.This is why I consider TBS + TBS2 good story games. They have several key decisions that have a major impact on the plot and give your choices real heft. Unfortunately TBS2 is still a good story game with a worse strategy game attached to it.It's important to understand that there are two distinct parts of your strategy in TBS. The turn-based combat part, and the ""Oregon Trail"" part where you basically play a choose your own adventure book. The problem is that the choose your own adventure book only has a few pages where you make a meaningful decision. The other hundred or so pages are just you being rewarded or punished for a choice, and then the story continues.Why is this a problem? When you replay a good story game, trying out the choices you didn't make the first time is rewarding. When you play a bad story game, you realize that the other choices didn't matter or just led to game over screens. TBS doesn't end the game, but it does punish you. That little plus or minus of morale or clansmen is a sign that the choice you made was either wrong or right. And if the only real choice you have is to make the right choice or the wrong choice? Your choice becomes meaningless. The game hides this of course with text, but it doesn't change the binary nature of most of the choices you make, and it muddies the key decisions that really do matter in TBS. If TBS was just a story game this could be ignored, especially because you don't get hit by a game over screen, but unfortunately TBS is also a strategy game.What makes a good strategy game? Being able to implement clever tactics against a clever enemy. Being able to make calculated decisions to win against the adversary.What makes a bad strategy game? Having no real indication of how your choices will affect you. Having a single correct choice instead of multiple. Now TBS2 actually has a solution to the problems I see in it, but before that I'll get to the turn-based combat. Now if you agree with what I said about what makes a good strategy game, you might not understand why I dislike the strategy in TBS2. I actually liked it. In short bites. I had fun on hard until i got halfway and decided to switch to easy and just bruteforce the fights.The problem with the combat is that the campaign rewards cautious behavior too much. Much like in the first TBS, maiming enemies to the point of uselessness and forcing them to waste turns is still the best way to play. Now you have some more options to waste time admittedly. You have more crowd control to play ""keep away"" and lock down dangerous enemies until you can whittle them down into nothing, but the best strategy is still basically slow erosion broken up by a few mass cullings. The highlight of the combat is when you can basically slaughter a half dozen enemies in one go and ride out to victory. And I mean, it's great. It feels like a great way to end a fight, but when the best way to end every fight is doing that? It loses its charm along the way. Real people could be different, but the AI's only real plan is rush you until you die, which is what makes the strategy so effective in the first place.What could fix all of this? For ""Oregon Trail"", if instead of being punished or rewarded for the random events, you instead had to choose how you took the hit/ gain. I.E. choose whether to save fighters or clansmen while your ships are sinking, gather extra supplies while you have time or scout ahead to avoid a battle. TBS2 has a few choices that actually adhere to this (most of them being the key ones I mentioned earlier), which makes it mind boggling to me why it wasn't just used as a format for all of them. Likewise TBS2 also fixes my problem with the turn-based combat in its survival mode, removing enemies from the turn order when they die, and giving you a double turn that allows for much more aggressive tactics and flexibility in your playstyle. Again, why wasn't that just the default, or at least an option.Still going to buy TBS3 probably.			"

												Better than the first game definitely, this game continues last games story (which I highly recommend) but features a longer seeming story (which is nice). Combat will come naturally to veterans but might need some practice if you're new to this series. The story has some awesome twists and and secrets (some mind nukes are dropped), though the effect will be most acute for previous players. Overall I'd say this game is a good 9/10 in my book, perhaps a little expensive for those without income but well worth the investment if you enjoyed the last game. This game also features a survival mode which was a bit more dissapointing for me but is still engaging for people who loved the combat side of this game. It features a combat challenge with time limits and ever more difficult battles. It's effectively a minigame to measure how hardcore your skills are with this combat system.Clan Improvements in BannerSaga 2:Foraging: Villagers now forage food, if you balance fighters with clansmen just right you'll never starve.Training challenges: The camp now gives you challenges to complete (ex: kill the spear men but only with specific attacks) which you can be rewarded for completeing.Conscription: You can turn clansmen into soldiers! Soldiers wont forage well and eat more food, but will even the odds in war. This effect is not reversable.Suggestions for the future of Banner Saga:I'd personally love a scenario mode (possibly multiplayer) where you survive as an non-specific clan feeding your soldiers, training people, dealing with randomized events, and facing ever growing assaults by dredge. I understand this would be difficult but if combined with the steam modmaking community players could create some EPIC user generated settings and plots. Such a scenario mode (perhaps with some scenario creation tools) could create really interesting fan stories. Alternatively a charachter creation tool would also be interesting if it could be implimented, so players can put themselves in the story with individual charchter designes. This suggestion I'd argue is the easier of my two suggestions to impliment in future Banner Saga games and would still create further player engagement.			"

												First, I will say that this series is one of my favourites with this entry, the first game was fun and unique but it's just that. The second game is amazing and just blows me away, so know that I am a fan, and proud of it. The third game could be cooked walruss drible and i'd still buy it just to see where the story goes, so take my opinion with a grain of salt, and know that any complaints I have with the game are born out of love and shrivel in the awesome might of my veneration for this studio. In fact Right NOW buy both games, despite anything bad I say, YOU DESERVE TO PLAY THIS. Now on to the review: 1. The story is by far the best thing in the series. Unlike telltale games which mostly give you the illusion of choice and the game will continue regardless of your choices unless you miss a quicktime event; Here if you ♥♥♥♥ up, your♥♥♥♥♥is done. It is completely possible for your choices to end up with losing one of your units which you put very valuable resources into training permanently and if your clasnmen die the fights get harder since you are outnumbered, so not only hero units matter. I don't wish to spoil but the very first chapter ends with a brutal culmination of all your choices throughout, and if you were an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or made a stupid call letting people take advantage of you, you could easily find your numbers reduced by half, making half of the remainder of the game comically difficult. Also the game autosaves whenever you finish making a choice so good luck savescumming becouse if you arent hapy you need to restart the chapter to remake choices.  2. The gameplay is good, flowing, tactically sound, and addictive. It has its bad and good moments but every fight folds out depending on how you spend your resources. 3. The Sound and atmosphere are amazing, and I almost never notice sounds as integral to the game, so imagine how amazing it must be for me to say this. That said, I do believe the soundtrack for purchase is a rippoff,, The sound works best when complementing the visuals which are also amazing, to create a masterfull atmosphere, but by thmeselves, the songs are good, but not great.4. There is not enough of it and ends in a cliffhanger. While this might not sound so bad, the first game understood that the story was the main draw and had a satisfying open ending. This game ends in one of the biggest sudden cop outs ever, just when several storylines from this game and the last are about to be explained in detail, the game ends. This is the game's biggest flaw and might as well be a giant middle finger to any fans on the edge of their seats. It was as much an apropriate ending to this game as a swift knee to the crotch is to wedding vows.			"

If you want to keep and continue your character's stats from the first one, just have the saves in the original folder (no need to re-install the game) and you will be able to import them easily.Also, the same negative aspects from the first game apply here:Lots of text to read and again the game ends unexpectedly in order to be continued.

												Better in so many ways than it’s parent, The Banner Saga 2 is a gripping, tense and inspiring experience.I must have taken screenshots every 5 minutes – the art is fantastic. Every landscape is a wonder to behold and this beautiful world is a great backdrop to the terrifying, cruel and desperate things unfolding in it.Playing the game felt like Star Wars without a guaranteed happy ending, with death-defying odds, plot twists, tough decisions, soul-gripping soundtrack and engaging writing. Be ready to sweat and worry, as you try to keep your characters alive, no joke.If the tough combat gets too challenging and you’re not a fan of deep strategy or tactics – no worries. Change the difficulty to Easy and enjoy the game – you don’t need to be a chess master to play this.Taking in to consideration all of the above, I’d say that The Banner Saga 2 has something for everyone. I highly recommend it – give this experience a try and you’ll be surprised how easily it will grow on you. "

												The Banner Saga 2 is a story driven RPG with a turn based combat system. It picks up right where the previous game ended, with your caravan of Viking style warriors and civilians desperately trying to escape the constant attacks of the Dredge.I thought the first game was good, but not great, however this sequel has significantly improved on some of BS1's flaws, and as a result I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of Banner Saga 2.The Good Stuff•	Turn based combat system functions the same as before, but now has more depth and variety. Higher level heroes have access to more special abilities. One of your heroes, and a new type of Dredge, can turn invisible to set up a stealth attack. Another hero can summon an ally to help out. A new type of cavalry unit can retreat a few squares after making their attack. A couple of battles have special win conditions instead of just ""kill everyone"".•	The choices that you have to make along the journey are tough, and can sometimes have unexpected consequences. Its impossible to save everyone, but there were definitely some times when I think I made the wrong choice, which resulted in lots of people dying, and I felt pretty bad. •	The story is very well written. Its pretty intense and exciting for the whole game, and it ends in such a way that makes me very interested to see what happens in the next game.•	Music is excellent, sets the mood perfectly.•	Roughly 14 hours long, worth a full price purchase.•	Flawless technical performance.Stuff that I would like to see improved in BS3•	Only a handful of key moments have voice acting. I want the whole game to be voiced - and keep the Scandinavian accents, because they're a perfect fit for the theme of the game.•	BS2 has a few animated cutscenes that allows the player see the action, rather than just reading about it. These cutscenes look amazing, so I want more of those.•	The player will encounter several traders along the journey, where they can buy items to equip on heroes and buff their stats in combat. But why can't we sell unwanted items?ConclusionThe Banner Saga 2 is an excellent game, and it gets a really strong positive recommendation from me. If you enjoyed the first game, this is a must buy. If you never played BS1, I would advise playing that first, because if you start with BS2 you probably won't understand the story or who the characters are (there is a short recap, but its not really that useful).

												Story: The previous game had a good ending with a satisfying final battle that paced itself well in terms of progression, but this game ends just short and leaves a bad taste in your mouth with a bunch of loose ends and more plot devices that need explaining. You finally get to the main city you've been marching towards all game and you're there for like 5 minutes  and then..it just ends. I expected to pan back to rook/alette in Aberrang after the ""final boss"" but you don't, it leaves you with a terrible cliffhanger ending. The horseborn also felt rushed, they show up at the very end of the game and aren't written very well at all. I would have also liked more dialogue from the Varl and humans in general but that fell short tooGameplay: The battle gameplay is better with some new abilities and talents but the amount of fighters and varl in your caravan matters less than the first game, there's zero reason to train fighers, there's no big battle mechanic from the first so it does not matterOverall 7/10, could have been better if the final stretch of the game wasn't rushed. The developers should have kept it to a couple of good plot devices, not a bunch of weak ones with barely any explanation. The ending is absolutely horrible, and with all this new BS introduced I doubt 3 is going to even be able to have a coherent story.  The first game was better(8.5/10), pick this one up on sale			"

												Fantastic visuals and very beautiful. Rich-story line, every dialogue and cutscene is special and worth it, it's bad if you miss one. Your choices affect the game by increasing/decreasing your morale, losing your soldiers or families you are carrying with you. I love how the parties split and you get to play both of them until you reach the destination. Combat is well done, easy to learn; hard to master. Very difficult if you do not have a Varl while on hard mode.11.5/10			"

												If you liked the first episode, you will love the second.The basics of the gameplay are unchanged. You are the leader of a caravan of survivors. Your job is to make tough choices during the way and to control the best fighters of the caravan during important battles. You can bring your heroes up to level 10 this time, unlocking new skills and new tiers of previous skills. The variety of both units and enemies is noticeably improved, and each battle is an interesting tactical challenge.Sadly, the same can't be said about the ""tough choices"". While there ARE several interesting choices where each option is reasonable and no option is perfect, and you'll really have to reflect on what's more important to you, almost all of the small choices you'll find along the way are random ""gotcha"" moments, where you'll be punished for not having read into the developers' minds. There are no interesting tradeoffs or moral ambiguities there, just arbitrarily right choices and arbitrarily wrong choices.Despite the annoying arbitrariety in the results, though, these small events work very well as a way to immerse you in the story and make you feel like the main character feels, a leader who hasn't chosen to be one and who is learning the job as he or she goes along.It's very difficult to talk about the story without making spoilers, so I'll just say that it's good. There are new characters, several climatic moments and towards the end you even begin to get a few parts of the answers to the big misteries that have been looming in the background since the first episode started. The third and last episode will make or break the story, but this second episode does a great job of building up towards a great climax.			"

												Disappointing.While there is some improvement in the tactical battles (several new features added), it feels like the story/travel element has been seriously neglected this time around. The first game had a really good structure - the story was split in two, with you alternately leading a rag-tag band of refugees, or a rock hard army of giant monster killers. The characterisation was pretty good - the motivations were clear, and there was some belivable and interesting interaction between the characters in your groups. As the game went on, things got progressively worse, and since there was (at least for me) a serious danger of starving to death, I felt as if my decisions were pressured. This time around - there are too many characters, and very few of them have anything to say or much to do with the story. I guess this is due to the problem of branching and the fact that, due to previous player decisions, many of these could have died - it must be difficult (or at least time consuming) to give these characters meaningful story lines - and the developers haven't. (Though a few of these disposable characters did pop up to say things like ""I can't believe I'm not dead"" and ""Maybe I would be better off dead""... and then proceed to try and get themselves killed.)Again, depending on the decisions made in the first game, one of your main characters may be a young girl/woman (not really clear how old she is) - it really strained credibility for me that she should be (seemingly) in charge of everything - in the first game there was a clear sense that leadership was given to the most experienced and trusted person - that seems to have gone out of the window this time around. The other main character is supposed to be a ruthless mad man, which I didn't really identify with. In general, the dialogue seemed a lot less interesting - the characters have been blandified (introduction of much faening swearing slightly jarring) apart from the completely mad characters, who are incomprehensible. In the first game there was an element of mystery as to what was going on, but the basic motivations of the main characters were crystal clear. In this one, I just got more and more confused as the game went on - having seen the ending - I'm still none the wiser as to what was going on or what the point of half of the narrative was. Several deus ex machina devices used, and in contrast to the first game, the travel sections get easier and less pressurized as the game continues.Also slightly annoying how many of the varl die in every battle - aren't these guys supposed to be rock solid?Anyway, sadly, I'm going to have to hang up my banner (or whatever) and give future installments of this series a miss. Bit sad, because I really enjoyed the first one! "

												I have about 80 hours in the original game, which is finishable in 10-15. You might say I like it a little. So I'm probably a little biased in writing this review, but I honestly wasn't guaranteed to like this game upon release, since I was mildly skeptical of some of the changes the devs had hinted at implementing. I think a lot of times when devs try to change up a formula in response to criticism, they end up creating new problems that are sometimes worse than what they'd started with (looking at you Bioware and the way you stole my dialogue wheels in Mass Effect).But Stoic Studio, in my opinion, successfully navigated the balance between resolving criticisms and weaknesses of the first game without undermining or changing what made the original great. Every little tweak made the game better, not worse. A few important changes: the morale system  is so much clearer-- in the original game it took me multiple playthroughs to pick up on the interaction between some choices and morale shifts; the cutscenes are more dynamic and the voice-overs more frequent so that it has even more of a 'cinematic' feel (but runs in 60 fps!) in the sense of watching a classic animated film; the music is even more beautiful (was that even possible?? Austin Wintory is fabulous) and most of all, the combat is much better. I was among those who actually liked the original combat, so I was worried they'd throw the baby out with the bathwater in their promises to make it more complex (especially in response to criticisms that it wasn't enough like other turn-based strategy games). But I think I can safely say that really do think they hit on just the right notes for it. The fights and mechanics feel familiar and still absolutely approachable. It’s the same bones and sinews of combat. But the tweaks they’ve added blend with the old instead of conflicting with them — like instead of just slapping a new face on top of the the body, they gave it more muscle. They took everything that was good from the old combat and embellished on it instead of throwing it away, while trimming away the weaknesses, where I think a lot of devs might’ve said ‘people don’t like the combat? Better start from scratch.’ TL;DR is: If you liked the original, you'll absolutely like its continuation because it builds on its strengths; if you *didn't* like the original, you should definitely consider giving its sequel a shot because it's fixed what made it weak before.

												Saga&trilogy feeling of Lord of the Rings meets bonding with your units that have high impact but also low survivability as in X-Com. Really good soundtrack, desire to gather more renown points and a captivating (if side-scrolling) aesthetic and rhythm   give that unbelievable craving of ""Just one more turn"". Highly recommended, same as the first part.			"

The Banner Saga 2 is a story driven RPG with turn based combat in a engaging and apocalyptic viking fantasy. I found the story and art work to be beautiful and well writen as they were in the first game but in the sequal many systems are impoved and fleshed out, with TBS2 you get the feeling the Devs really hit there stride with TBS series.In most every way The Banner Saga 2 is even better than TBS 1, also many hours of great strategy gameplay can be had with the additon of survival mode on top of the core game. The Survival Mode was released as a free patch from Stoic.""Survival Mode"" is a 40 map back to back challenge for your party along with the new skills & talents is a huge bonus if you like the in depth turn based strategy combat system.About the combat system: I learned the TBS combat system is about monitoring the order of battle and clicking on th enemy units to show there range of movment so you can predict the AI's next moves - like chess some battles you must look several moves ahead to win. There is an ellement of RNG to what enemy units you face on a given map but most if not all battles can be won given the right strategy.(They have a deal atm, if you kickstart TBS3 you can pay 20$ and get the first 2 games as well if you are looking to buy the series and save a few bucks.)

												A continuation of the Banner Saga (which I loved). The game continues with the epic tale of survival amongts a world that is falling apart. The music, the art style and the characters are fantastic! Honestly, this is one of those series that I never expected much from but I continue to love the simple gameplay and the lore of this world. Definitely recommend to those who like choice-based games and strategic combat.			"

												Banner Saga 2 is an impressive piece of video game storytelling. The guys at Stoic really do put other companies to shame in the areas of story and choice/consequence. There is no \""good decision\"" or \""bad decision\"" (or blue for paragon red for renegade) in the game. You are simply given a series of choices with logical responses. You choose the response you think is best and sometimes you are right and sometimes the decision haunts you when you go to sleep at night. This combined with a compelling battle system makes Banner Saga 2 a solid sequal to its predocessor.			"

												The art is gorgeous, the tactical battles are fun, the KoDP-style clan decisions are made interesting by the occasionally severe consequences of making a bad call. The game's great for the first 99% of it.That cliffhanger ending, though. ♥♥♥♥ that. Note to video game writers: give me some clear, definite resolution, some sort of big, satisfying victory at the end of the game. You can then set up the dramatic cliffhanger immediately after that. If your game just feels like it ends right in the middle of something, you ♥♥♥♥ed up.			"

												The Banner Saga 2 is a terrific pickup... if you enjoyed the first one.The Good:The story continues in an expectedly hopeless manner, but it throws a few curve balls and left me excited for the third installment. The artwork remains beautiful and even though you spend the majority of your time watching your caravan trek endlessly left across your screen, man does it look good.  The characters are also much more compelling this go around, but that might just be that it is fresher in my mind. Seriously, Bolverk and Iver and Hakon, hell all the Varl are just amazing. If you really get in the head of the protagonists, instead of choosing what you believe are optimal paths, the decision making weighs heavily on you.  At its heart, this game is a visual novel and to play it like Fire Emblem is just silly.The Bad:The Combat.  So many people like the Armor vs Strength combat thing, and its cool but it is so flawed. Turn order needs a serious rework for Banner Saga 3. I learned this in the first one, and  slogged through it in the sequel, but the optimal tactics are not the realistic ones. Often it is advantageous to leave enemy combatants with 2 or 3 strength rather than killing them, because it is better to have a weak enemy in the turn order.  I got it handed to me several times in Banner Saga 1 before I figured this out because I would one-shot all the weaker enemies and then the 2 or 3 remaining big dudes would alternate turns wrecking me.  My biggest complaint with the game.  But like I said, it is a visual novel at its core and there are only I think half a dozen fights in the game that have major story developments attached to them.Neutral:Illusion of Choice. This could be good, depending on your outlook I suppose. But sometimes it feels like you are at the mercy of a bad DM. No matter what you do, bad things happen to you and no decision is correct. It really plays into that hopelessness but some of the ""Surprise!"" bad things that happen to you are super ham-fisted.  For a decision based, heavy narrative RPG sometimes you feel at the whim of the writers. Maybe it plays into the despair more than I am letting on and it does feel like things are out of your control, but to me that wasn't always a good thing.The Verdict: Play it.  If you haven't played the first one, its like five bucks on sale all the time.  It isn't better or worse necessarily. It's definitely an improvement, but it doesn't quite have the wonder the first one gave you. It's like Pokemon sequels. They're better, but they aren't the same.			"

												The Banner Saga 2 is, without a doubt, a magnificent game to behold.  The sequel to 2014's 'The Banner Saga', this is a strategy-RPG that picks up directly after that game's ending, and continues on with Stoic's epic Norse-inspired fantasy story.Once again, you have a caravan that you guide through the world in a very 'Oregon Trail'-esque journey, where events stop you along the way and either prompt decisions which affect you and your people or prompt battle.When you enter battle, the game enters a tile-based strategy mode where you move your units along the outlined area and choose to attack or use special commands.While there is a recap you can follow from the main menu, to experience this fantastic journey fully, you MUST play the original game.  For veterans of that title, you can pull your finished game save points and load them in here, along with all of the choices you made from the previous chapters.  From there on, you can expect more of the same.  Stoic has added new characters and abilities, and while there is a bit too much hand-holding for the first chapter, from then on everything truly seems to matter.  They've also gone above and beyond their previous efforts, including many more gorgeous animations and larger fullscale art pieces for us to enjoy.If you like epic fantasy, if you like strategy RPGs, or even if you're just a lover of fine art and moving symphonies, this is a great game to check out.

												It's the original but better in almost every way except for the story, which gets kinda lame at the end. And that's just because it's the second in a trilogy, so expect the story to be better in the third game. The design and music are improved and much better integrated this time around, and there's not as much random empty space that sticks out either. More animated cutscenes are nice, and more interesting characters are always a plus. Shame some of the original's characters and plot threads get almost no exposure, even though i thought they would have gotten their arcs in this one.Raven segments aren't as much fun as Skogr segments but it's not a problem.You can also get Eirik to train a war bear. So that's cool.			"

												Viking Trail: Tactics is back, and while the story isn't over yet, there's a lot to enjoy here.  Stories branch in slight but significant ways depending on how you finished Banner Saga 1 (or who you choose as a starting character, if you go in completely new).  Part 3 is coming, and you'll know it near the end of the game, because a huge plot point builds up, but isn't yet resolved.Pros:Good for 2 playthroughsEach battle is designed carefully, and you can tellBeautiful artCons:Rook's story is a little more fleshed out than Alette'sThe hunger system is even less useful now that you can forage-- starvation is never a real riskNeutral:Cliffhanger, because it's part 2 of 3.

There is almost no Pc adaptation eventhough the game on big screen looks amazing.The game runs perfectly but the commands and the menus are not good for a Pc game.Pros:-art style-sound track-survival mode-decision making matters-lore/story (although not complete enough to say this episode had a good story)Cons:-too much mobile oriented-duration-some decisions are not well explained, the game is built up so you don't know what is going to happen next, but if I take a decisione and MY CHARACTER reacts in a different way as i intended, that's not good-price-lack of animations, i doubt the game started with low budget because of the succesful kickstarter, the amount of actual cutscenes might cover a total of 1 minute.I think the only way to really enjoy this game is by playing the whole Banner Saga once it's completed.

												Pros: -Pretty much everything that was good about the first installment.-Great story-Animation and beautiful art-Soundtrack and even more voice acting plus cut scenes this time, all very atmospheric-Gameplay, battles are satisfying and strategies reasonably deep. Addition of new abilities and buffs improve even further on the original.Cons:-The game commits a few sins that its predecessors didn't have by presenting you with a few rather vague choices that result in horrible actions by your main character. Now I'm not talking unseen CONSEQUENCES, those happened in Banner Saga 1 and were reasonable and exciting because your abilitiy to choose the right path was limited by how little your character knew. I'm talking about you being presented with choices, choosing the one that seems like the best one and your character going and doing something you would never want them to. For example, it's like if you had a choice: ""You're at your friend's house, he's cooking apple pie, do you want some?""You answer ""no"" and the game tells you, ""you burn down the house and slaughter your friend's family in their beds, now safe in the knowledge that you will never be forced to eat apple pie.""It's not necessarily a massive black mark against the game since this kind of thing is present in a lot of games, especially Mass Effect, so we should be used to it now. It's just a shame that it's present here when Banner Saga 1 didn't have that issue.-Similarly, the game tends to remove characters from you by having them arbitrarily killed, flip allegiance, go off on their own mission or just simply disappear. This can be very very annoying if you invested a lot in that character and they were an integral part of your strategy. It would actually be nail-bitingly exciting if these characters died in the field because you failed to protect them, but no, the game just wisks them off into the void. Also, you don't get the items you equipped them with back. Sucks to be you.-Lastly, while the story is good, Banner Saga 1 felt complete, like The Matrix. Banner Saga 2 is very much The Matrix Reloaded (remember the absolute final scenes of that film?) and just as satisfying at the end, i.e. not at all, due to the massive unspoken 'TO BE CONTINUED' hanging over it. On one hand it means we'll get another game (yay) on the other, sucky ending (boo).			"

												The Banner Saga was an interesting game, but I wouldn't call it a must-play one. By contrast The Banner Saga 2 *is* a must-play one - it's one of the best examples of a sequel fixing everything that was wrong with the original that I've seen in recent times. The story and world-building are top-notch, the combat is better (or at least far less tedious), having all of your clansmen starve because you made stupid decisions that tossed all of the supplies into the river is just as painful as it was before, and the entire thing looks and sounds even more gorgeous than the first game. It's a tremendous improvement.			"

												A fantastic instalment to an already amazing game! The Banner Saga 2 fixes and improves all the cons of the first one while adding intrestings twist to the games rich story. How did it fix the first game's problems: 1. The Banner Saga 2 features dozens of new enemies to enrich the game's brutal combat with increased tactics and better AI. 2. The story continues onwards. The Banner Saga's heartbreacking tale of sacrifice and frantic survival continue in this instalment by building onto the previous chapter and its respected choices, even the littlest ones came back to haunt me. 3. The renown system has been replaced with a more forgiving one that allows you to spare more food and supplies towards leveling up your caravan's heros. 4. Rather than punishing you with starvation at every turn, the Banner Saga 2 places a bigger focus on the choices and the picture at large. It WILL punish your every mistake swiftly and viciously! 5. Finally, the heros change and grown in a way that is much more visable and rewarding to the player. It could be as simple as watching Rook coup with his loss, or Bolverk's slow descent. Either way the game leaves the impression that you have just watched an epic saga take one more step on its journey.  (Please note that I played the game offline, so the hour count is incorrect)			"

												Disclaimer: I was a huge Banner Saga 1 fan, my only complaint being it was too short.  I have not finished this yet but it seems like it will be longer as much as I have played.Okay, on to the review.HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥This game improves so much upon the mechanics from the previous installment.  There are more levels!  One slight pet peeve of mine is that now leveling takes a good bit less renown, so I feel like I wasted a lotta renown in my last run, but thats okay.  There are new ""talents"" which you unlock after maxing out skills, and puts those excess skill points from more levels to use.  You can level to level 10 now.  That about covers leveling.Camp and markets are largely unchanged.  Dialogue seems a lot more tense and enjoyable in this game, which is saying something.Anyways, so the combat system is as far as I can see mainly unchanged, but its been spiced up.  There are barricades which people can take cover behind or attack to destroy. Core mechanics remain quality, and some exciting new abilites are popping up with the new recruits.I have not encountered the new race but I hold out hopes they will be great.  Will update this later when I know more.Overall so far rating of 8.9/10.  Great game, buy it if you were a fan of the first.  If you weren't, go buy/replay the first and get convinced, then buy this!UPDATE:I have finished the game.  Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is it fun.  The systems have been improved upon greatly and the new race is a blast.  Rebalances have made the game a bit more fair, and the new level cap means your old characters are not obsolete.  New enemies (and some old ones) reappearing prevent combat from becoming boring or unsettling.Now for a sad thing.  I have encountered a bug (Thats ONE BUG in an entire game).  It does not affect gameplay significantly, but occasionally during combat characters will become invisible.  The outline below them remains, and the health indicators do not disappear, but the player model is invisible.  This applies to both heroes and enemies.However, since in 29 hours of gameplay I have only encountered a single bug in an otherwise masterful game, I am willing to forgive a small sin.As others have said, this does lack a bit in story due to it being in the middle of a trilogy.  However, this entire game beautifully rises in dramatic action, with perpetually escalating conflict and a permanent sense of impending doom that really ties it all together.Updating score to 9.4/10.

												This is much the same as the first game.  The only new feature are  these pointless annoying barricades, which only serve to make combat go longer as you spend 2-3 turns getting around the bloody things.  The story is much the same as before, you think you are making chocies along the way but you really aren't.  An example of the so called choice the game pretends to offer the player, one of your fighters wants to leave, you say no, he leaves anyway, if you say yes he leaves.  So whats the point of giving me the option to make a choice in the first place?  This is pretty much how the whole choice system goes in the game, give the player a few options, and they all lead to the same outcome.  Lazy game design. One change i have noticed from the first game, is the clansmen, fighters and varl in your group matter less than they did before.  As there are no large battles anymore.  You can really just let them all die and not worry about finding food all the time, jsut use your renown to upgrade your key units.The biggest issue with this game is the last battle, it doesn't matter if you win or loose the game ends exactly the same way.  So again what is the point of a game that pretends to give you choice and has already predeterminded the outcome.  A few new units have been added to fight against.  Overall it is a bit flat in the content, the mechanics haven't been improved and the whole thing is a bit draining and the ending is a poor, lazy pile of crap.			"

												Basically following the same line of the first game, with the addition of some new mechanics. The story continues to fascinate and now introduced to new characters like varl-berserker Bolverk and the centaurs race. The game world is expanded and the journey now goes through rivers and air. But it is a ""half game"". The game has no end, simply terminates at an unexpected time. I did not feel good about it ... I suggest you wait to buy with the third game in a sale.			"

												The second game in the Banner Saga Series, but no less beautiful or original. The story take more than one surprising turn, and you meet interesting new characters as well as races.Pros:+ I didn't think it was possible, but the visuals are even more elaborate in BS2, with short but high end animations. No lazy re-use of old character bases or backgrounds, originality also here up to par with the first game.+ I appreciated that clansmen are now able to collect food, since supplies always were a problem for me in the first game and the clansmen were pretty much dead-weight. Also, I haven't run into any bugs so I'm guessing the devs really learned from the feedback they got first time around. + Again, the story is still super interesting, now with even more aspects and point of views. It's a fascinating way of story-telling, even though sometimes I did just want to stick to Rook's/Alette's group.Cons:- Some things in the plot did seem forced or out of character. But it isn't a major issue.- I was once again surprised by how short the game was. I was done with my first playthtough after only 12h. This is probably the only issue I have with the game series. I was pretty dissapointed and at this point I'm bound to buy the third game. It's a good marketing staregy, I guess.For people who haven't played BS1, there is a pretty self explanatory introduction, so you could start playing the second game directly. Now I wouldn't recommend it, because the first game is as much as an experience as the second, but I do suggest buying it on sale and not full price, considering it's expensive for the limited content it offers.

												Although the story of this one was not as good as the first (imo), the game somehow felt.. ""fuller"". New classes, new enemies, and more animated cutscenes that gave me chills down my spine. The new characters are well designed, Bolverk especially, and the choices you make (although you still are led down the same linear arch) really do come back to biting you in the♥♥♥♥♥and add that extra flavour which makes me feel like this is a living, breathing world.For anyone wanting a good story, the entire series is a must have.

												If you liked the first Banner Saga then you'll love this one, as it expands and improves nearly every aspect of the game. I'd buy it thrice-over. Storywise, I've found myself put back in a state of awe at how well-written it is for a team of less than four people, not to mention the soundtrack, which I find even more phenomenal than the first. It has great gameplay, believable writing, an excellent soundtrack, and another sequel on the way.			"

The combat feels better to me, and the scale is more epic. If you like tactical games, I would highly recommend this. "

												Game surpassed the expectations for the sequel in the Banner Saga trilogy, which is quite hard to do. They didn't fix anything that wasn't broken (Art, soundtrack, core-gameplay) and added few twists to the combat-system that were needed.+ Hand-drawn art and animation in the game is unique and top-notch even when compared to huge publishers+ Soundtrack is great+ Story and character development has depth, especially when you can import your old save-file + Choices matter- Game is short (tho' there is replay value)- Ending wasn't to my liking, but hey, im only one guy "

												Absolutely loving this so far.  Just like it's predecessor, it is one of the few games I have ever played where I have a deep emotional connection to practically every playable character.  The atmosphere is rich, the decisions that you are faced with have meaning and dire purpose, and it is all housed in an interface that allows you to be absorbed in the grand tale itself without distraction.  I love the minimalist nature of the writing in the sense that so much is conveyed in every sentence that it leaves you fleshing out minor details as if you were reading a good fantasy novel.  All the while, a lush soundscape exists at a level that adds to the atmosphere, but never distracts from it.If you enjoy tactical strategy games, this is a must to own.			"

												Really, really good.Very satisfying, excellent continuation of the story and it leaves me very excited for the finale. Tons of interesting stuff happpens, and I had a lot of fun playing it.Combat has also been greatly improved, with characters now learning a second combat skill and the ability to learn really useful abilities based on your stats. Only thing I didn't like was the larger amount of obstacles. The worst example is a point where I was able to set up some barricades, but I found the slowed me down more than the enemy.Admittedly, I also found the first half of the story to be much weaker than  the later half. There were no real major surprises until the middle, which is where is really becomes interestin. I also wished their were more different characters that you could choose to recruit, though too many would probably have bloated the ranks too much. These small gripes aside this game is really fun, and I couldn't stop playing after I got to the midpoint.			"

												Similar to the first one, I got this game under several friends recommendations. I really enjoyed the experience of the second game, similar to the first. It felt like they took a majority of what they did right in the first, and built on top of it. Even better, they added a Survival Mode (which is eating up all my time, the achievement goals for it really make it challenging too, if you're into that). I like how you are also rewarded for actually trying to get the achievements in the game, that's something that is quite rare, but was a nice feature for someone who likes to try and get them all anyways! I've played through the story twice, though I probably won't play through it again, if only, because I find survival mode more entertaining. (Not to take away from the story / campaign, it was awesome!)For those who want to try Survival Mode, I do suggest you at least complete the story once, so that it does not spoil anything for you! (If you don't care, then by all means, go ahead and play it)Overall, I think this game was incredible, and I can't wait to see what other RPG games Stoic can develop. (Fingers crossed for a Banner Saga 3!)			"

												A definite step down from the first game. Your character stats are capped too low in comparision to the enemies that you routinely face. There are about  a hundred reasons that your guys shed strength and armor every single turn. The level cap is higher in this one but you gain very slim benefits for heavy upgrade costs. Morale is always poor at any point in the game. The menders all share the same abilities while the enemy spell casters posses a much wider range of powers. The plot isn't as powerful as the first one.			"

The art work is really cool could be a litle longer, there is a huge world and you really only see a small part of it.

												My favourite game in a long time. It has everything I might look for in a videogame: beautiful artstyle, wonderful soundtrack, compelling plot and - most importantly - incredibly well balanced and innovative game mechanics. A turn-based RPG that is truly one of its kind.The second installment has stayed true to its predecessor, with a few fresh changes. The only addition I personally disliked was that more weight was given to chance, as the player now has to rely more heavily on crits and the like (one of the main character for instance always hits a random target among those who surround him). This makes the Banner Saga 2 a bit less of the chess-like game its prequel was, but definitely doesn't hinder it from shining.			"

Now you can finally take on the slackers that are usually left behind- Way more Renown to obtain and more supplies to buyThe story is great, and the gameplay very atmospheric.The hard difficulty expects you to use every strategy trick up your sleeve, as even on easy difficulty, you can bring yourself up in a situation where your characters are under leveled and helpless against a horde of dredge.Buy the game, if you enjoy a good turn based strategy game.

												If you haven't played BannerSaga 1 this game will leave you scratching your head.If you did like me and had a gripes with the boring way they implemented the turn-based system and ""forced"" difficulty by stripping you of freedom (choosing certain units, making decisions unclear, unclear battle map etc) and unsatisfying ending/cliffhanger this will leave you scratching your head times 2.While it retained the impeccable artstyle, soundtrack and story it exacerbated everything I didn't like about the first part:Unclear decisions had me scratching my headThe Battlefield is even more obstructed, sometimes you can't even see your units blocked by foreground art.Fights that force you to take certain types of units you don't like or are ""gimped"" (aka forced difficulty)Training tent can now give you alot of resources if you complete the challenges but again, it is a challenge you can't overcome  with your wits/units, no no, the developer chooses for you. Most of the challenges are there to teach you of certain aspects/interaction between units but in a ""real"" battle you would never use them, why position/wait for dozens of turns for one cool thing to happen when you can just kill most of the enemies before they reach you.I still love the interaction and characters, how they present themselves, the lore and tales. I switched to easy midgame and just zombied through the fights (which there are too much of). Nothing much will change I guess for the last chapter, I will play it for sure but I have serious doubts this developer can put together compelling encounters that do not rely on gimmicks.If you got hooked on the world/lore/characters in the first part, this game is for you.

												One thing to understand is that Banner Saga 2 is not a separate game—this is the second chapter of the same story which will make no sense if you haven't played the original. Also, unlike the first one, where the story felt a bit unsatisfying due to you only beating a small boss (rather than getting to the bottom of the whole plight), here the game ends in a blatant cliffhanger. More important events happen outside the camera's eye, left unexplained. Honestly, it all makes me feel that it may be smarter to wait for Banner Saga 3 before picking this up.As a continuation of Banner Saga, however, this one offers no surprises and no disappointments; it's basically the same game. Still gorgeous visuals, still wonky voiceovers, still simple but fun and challenging fights. (On the highest levels there is now actually some RNG present in them, but it works well.)The useful part about sequels like BS2 is that they offer no decision-making to you as a buyer. If you liked the first game, this one is a must. If you didn't (or haven't played it), there's no reason to buy it. It's as simple as that.			"

												The beauty that Stoic puts into these games is wonderful. The story is captivating, the dialogue smart, the characters deep. I am so in love with these games. I love that choices and your failure or successes in battle really make a difference in the overall story. I will play anything these guys make now! Bravo!Banner Saga 3 plz?			"

												A faen good game. Almost same as the first one, just continue the story, you even can import saves from previouse game and continue with characters, levels and items from BS1. I, myself, consider this game as a good and interactive book with awesome illustrations and even more awesome music. The story is rich and interesting, it gets more intense as the world keep rolling down to the end. There is more events on the road, or at least it seems so for me. A lot of characters, new and old ones. As of combat - personaly I think it's easier than BS1, but still I met some challenge.To sum this up - if you have not played Banner Saga - it is best to do so before try this one out.For those who did play BS1 - if you thinking about what's new features in this game - there is not any new ones. As I told above - this part just continues the story. A good story with stunning visuals and great music. It is an interactive book, it is an art. So, if you liked first game - go for this one, you wont regret.As I told - it's a faen good game.			"

												Loved the first one- and this feels like a solid successor. The gameplay itself, mechanics-wise is nothing special. Campaigns in which you make text-based decisions, some cool animations of landscapes and characters, and some turn based combat. All done very well, but where the game really shines is in creating an athmosphere. The lore, the story, the characters- it's all very well made, and atleast I become very immersed in this world and game. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes rich stories, rpg elements and turn based combat. 9/10			"

												Enjoy an Oregon Trail journey through an ancient Nordic-styled fantasy! Make numerous critical choices through an epic-scaled saga flavored with retro-styled animations that will remind you of the Dragon's Layer era. Battle your way through improved (and easy to learn) turn-based battles, adjusting the difficulty level to your enjoyment without altering the story.This is a series you'll love playing; you'll find yourself hoping to never reach the end... and when you do, you might go back for seconds or thirds.

												So I have more hours logged in Banner Saga Factions then any other game in my GOG or Steam library. So when Banner Sage 1 was finally released I was obviously excited to play it. And play it I did... with some varying degrees of disappointment. The combat wasn't as engaging as Factions since the AI wasn't quite as sharp as a human opponent; the rogue-like elements felt tacked on and inconsequential; the story interesting albeit bleak, depressing and full of spelling mistakes; the artwork and music brilliant.So I finished The Banner Saga happy that it wasn't a p.o.s. but feeling as though it could have been so much more.  Fast forward to The Banner Saga 2 and Stoic has gotten much, much closer to what I had hoped for in the first one with this second chapter. The story is far more exciting, tense and intriguing then the first. The artwork maintains its brilliance.  The combat is far more layered now with items to bolster stats, secondary traits for characters, more units to bring to battle, more varied landscape to travel through and some great traveling events to provide intrigue and replay-ability. It took me 20 hours to play through the first time on Hard and it was worth every penny.If I were to quibble about anything it would be that the ending is a bit anti-climatic which is far from unheard of in great games (Baldur's Gate I anyone?) and that the caravan management component still doesn't quite feel as though it carries sufficient weight to be of interest. I'm not sure how they can improve the latter but I hope they can. I have finished The Banner Saga 2 and am already looking forward to the 3rd one!			"

												If you enjoyed Banner Saga 1, like I did, then you'll get great enjoyment out of this.You'll get roughly around 10 hours (completion time for me) out of the game as a whole, which is quite good, although I felt it could do with an extra 2 hours of content, which I'll come to later.In terms of improvements; honestly, I've not noticed any. That's not a bad thing, it's just that Banner Saga is rather singular, there's only so much they can do with the game, and it is essentially as the first one was. There have been a few additions to combat (which I don't consider improvements), new abilities and such. I will say however that there is more animations for this one in terms of small cutscenes, which are done very well.And one of the favourite aspects of Banner Saga - for me anyhow - is the music. The music is still fantastic, and very much immersive. The voice overs are also well done, and suit the characters that they are attributed to very well.One thing I've been critical of concerning the series is its combat. To be fair, the combat is quite deep. Surprisingly so for a game like this. But I do think the series suffers because of that. Normally I love deep strategic mechanics, but here it feels really tacked on, and not needed. Combat in Banner Saga has always been a convoluted mess I found, and Banner Saga 2 doesn't really improve upon that. I also found myself becoming affected by abilities in combat from the enemy that were not blatantly obvious, although this didn't become apparent until later on when facing Dredge stonesingers and so on. As the game continued on, I found combat to be more of a chore than a pleasure to play. I enjoyed the story and narrative, and simply felt that the combat just dragged things down. A much more simpler mechanic (but not overly simplified) would certainly benefit this game.And now comes the bit about the length of the game. 10/11 hours is a fair amount. But considering how the game ended, I'd say it wasn't enough. This has already been brought up in the forums concerning the ending. Banner Saga 1 left on a high note (or a low note depending on your perspective). It finished at just the right time. You felt vindicated and rewarded for your efforts. You felt you played the first game to its conclusion. It really did feel like the end of a tv show, a series. A proper end.Banner Saga 2... felt like a mid-season finale than anything else. And nobody likes mid-season finales because usually it means ending rather abruptly. That's exactly what happened here. Without going into spoilers, lets just say that certain story threads felt unfinished.Obviously it's a setup for the next game, but that's not the point. The next game should continue from the previous game's high point. Banner Saga 2 did not reach that high point, and honestly, I was hoping to get more out of it. I was hoping for a better conclusion than the one we got.Regardless, TBS2 is highly recommended, and I look forward to TBS3! "

												It's been awhile since I waited a whole year or more to play a sequel.  But this was definitely one of those moments.  It certainly didn't dissapoint.  The developers have managed to marry the old with the new and some more visually exuberant graphics in The Banner Saga 2.  I have to say I've enjoyed it immensely so far at 10 hours of game play.  I keep hoping I'm not near the end becuase I don't want it to end too quickly!!  The newer game features and ideas are interesting.  Additional modes of battle and a few tweaks here and there are good.  As someone else said looking forward to more.			"

												The Banner Saga 2 is a good follow-up to the first game. The battles are vastly improved, giving more options and tactics to be employed. The story is still good and you're fully immersed in the journey that the characters are on, but you definitely feel that this is the middle of the trilogy. There weren't many answers, yet you have more questions.There were a few choices that I wasn't sure as to what to pick so they might warrant a second playthrough, which is a good thing because TBS2 is definitely a few hours shorter than the first TBS. TBS also had a few choices that warranted another playthrough, but the endboss in TBS was just so tedious and RNGbased that I never got around to another go at it. In TBS2 however I never encountered anything that was particularly unfair, so no problem there.Looking forward to the final installment!			"

												Great little sequel to Banner Saga.  They've certainly tidied up game-play, and made it easier to keep organized, and level your units.  Most of the kinks have been ironed out, but there still were some frustrating times, like having to retake a conversation because you died in battle, or having to load a save file only to have to take the cutscene (No skipping non-animated cutscenes), all over again.There was a little bit of imbalance when it came to controlling the two different parties: For instance, items were hard to come by with your second party.In terms of story, it was amazing, and beautiful as always, but it ended extremely quickly, and the last boss fight (In polar opposite to the first game), was far, far too easy.8/10			"

												Banner Saga is a developing game trilogy inspired by Norse mythology where you lead a caravan of refugees fleeing a world-shattering catastrophe. It consists of story driven strategy gameplay with tactical turn-based battles. Don't expect frantic action requiring lightning reflexes, in Banner Saga you take your time with your decisions, as their consequences may prove heavy. While playing the first game isn't strictly necessary, I strongly recommend it, it will greatly improve your experience. Second Banner Saga improves on what was already great in the first one. It offers new characters, new classes with new abilities, couple of new enemies, new victory conditions, training missions with objectives for bonus renown, improved caravan management, more animated cutscenes, insanely gorgeous art, great music, apocalyptic story reminiscent of Tolkien's works (complete with the strife and hardship). Plus you can import your save from the first Banner Saga with all consquences of your actions (hero roster, items, clansmen, supplies, renown) which may ultimately affect some of your decisions in BS2. Having the ability to play as either Rook or Alette gives you additional replay value, since dialogue options vary depending on who are you playing as (the main story however remains the same). Easily the best game I've played this year so far. If I were to point out some negatives, there would be minor issues like the battle screen occasionally being a bit disorienting - they've introduced destructible obstacles with their own strength bars, so if you like to have strength/armor bars visible at all times like I do, the screen is cramped and it's harder to click the correct tile.And perhaps the pacing could have been improved as the final battle feels only as a warm up for the big finale we can expect in the third Saga. Ending with a cliffhanger with final part approx. two years away can be considered criminal :)Anyway, go buy it, it's great !			"

												TL/DR: Flat 9/10, great tactical RPG. Beautiful artwork and music, huge improvement over the prequel.-----Review-----Admittedly, I love tactical RPGs. Shining Force, FFTactics and X-Com (old and new) are amongst my favorite games. So, this genre is important to me. I want to voice this disclaimer before continuing.Ever wonder what happened to beautiful artwork and awesome gameplay? That's one good reason to like games: Don Bluth style animation and immersive experiences. This is hard to find in the 21st century with all the CG/3D modeling out there. Although 3D games have truly grew into great experiences in their own right, nothing will replace beautiful 2D illustrations with vivid, scintillating colors. Pair it with awesome core gameplay, and you remember the reason you're gaming in the first place: this title delivers on both of these fronts.The combat system, which is the meat of the game, is original and strategic. The depth with a simple system that is offered from The Banner Saga is staggering; there are only two main stats, armor and health. Armor protects you from damage, and health is obviously how much HP you can sustain before falling in battle. However, as a twist, health also determines how much damage you do: damage is calculated in The Banner Saga by [Enemy Armor] - [Attacker's Health]. This is the tip of the iceberg for this straightforward, yet complex gaming system. If you like turn-based games or tactical RPGs, the game mechanics alone are worth buying this game for.Banner Saga's story is truly engaging as well. While some gameplay elements have been sacrificed from the first Banner Saga (mainly out-of-combat scenarios and game mechanics), it is for the better as the game now has a greater streamlined feel from start to end. Decisions you make will determine whether your main characters, or your clansmen, will live or die. Although some of the main story arcs ultimately conclude to the same outcome in either case, it's still satisfying to think about and scrutinize your decisions during gameplay, as the consequences are great enough to have an impact on your experience.Aside from story, the animation and music is excellent as well. This only makes The Banner Saga 2 an even stronger Ensemble in conjunction with it's core components: it's great to see good games like this still exist in 2016.Finally, compared to The Banner Saga 1, this game is overall an improvement. The Banner Saga 2 has a story which does a better job of retaining your interest, is it more polished than it's precursor, and the battles are far more enjoyable as well; The Banner Saga 1 at times had some insipid, tedious battle encounters. Moreover, The Banner Saga 1 also had skewed difficulty within some of their encounters at times, probably to emphasize the hopelessness and brutality of the story. Unfortunately, as a consequence, it created an unenjoyable experience during some portions of its original campaign.In conclusion, The Banner Saga 2 is rated flat at 9/10. This is a really good game. It is somewhat short, but the depth of this game along with it's price tag easily overcomes this downside. The story branches just enough where replaying the campaign is a possibility as well, whereas The Banner Saga 1 did not have that quality of interest for me.			"

												Fantastic story telling in a turnbased, tactical RPG. Improves on the first installment in many aspects, while continuing the storyline right where it left off. Great music, Great Characters, Great Story, Great Gameplay.  I'm currently enjoying ""Survival Mode"", a series of 40 battles where you start out with your choice of most of the characters from both games, and if any of them die, you lose them for good until the end.  Really nice if you enjoyed the battles themselves, though this does not include the army management or storyline aspects of the main game.  I have a few complaints, but these are very minor gripes, and overall this is a fantastic game. Spoilers Possible:Total Main Game is very short for a game with a 20 dollar pricetag.  While i love the music, one of the tracks was recorded oddly, and at the start of a battle every once in a while will begin with this terrible ear piercing screech.  So you will wince in pain 2 or 3 times throughout the game.  Not exaggerating. Managing your food, buying items, and upgrading characters all had to be carefully juggled in the first game.  This is no longer the case, most of the items for sale seem useless with your level 6-10 characters and you will hardly ever feel a need to buy food.  You can spend all of your points on upgrading characters, no problem.  You have the option of carrying over your choices from the first game, which i did.  But some of the secondary characters you chose to save in the fist game will disappear randomly throughout the game, as though they just Forgot to continue that character.  One of their disappearances creates a big problem in the end as I totally saved him from dying in the first game, but a major plot point is written in that he did die, and they just ignore that i had him for the first half of the game until he magically disappeared on me.  A great deal of the game deals with dragging the dead body of the Final Boss from the first game with you. if they had more story to tell about him, they should have just done so in the first game, not recycle him to use as a prop throughout most of the game.  There is an interesting Mid-Boss, but there is no real final boss at the end either.  Could have done better this.   "

												Fresh off finishing the first installment of The Banner Saga, the Steam Sale gave me a perfect segue into the second installment in the franchise. Overall, I have to say that I really enjoyed it, although I do have a few quibbles. There seemed to be some scripting issues where the game talked about a character in the past tense (i.e., as if they were dead) when they were still alive and in my party. And I also found myself annoyed by having a bunch of party members die but not actually knowing when it happened. It seemed like deaths were a bit more obvious and important in the first Banner Saga, so I'm not sure if that was just an oversight or an intentional thing. Besides that, the story was still pretty engaging, the cast of characters diverse and interesting and the caravan management still tough and satisfying. I have to give Stoic props for crafting a game with some really tough decisions. So many developers go for the whole ""choice"" system a la Bioware, where the options are so brazenly good or evil. So often it seems like you're either a Good Samaritan or a jackass who kicks puppies. But The Banner Saga actually seems to deal in shades of grey, and that makes for a much more interesting experience. The choice to go with a dual narrative here was also a pretty bold one, especially given the initial stark difference in terms of a ""likability factor"" for the two protagonists. But the secondary storyline quickly grew on me and I became quite engrossed in both. Prior to playing the first Banner Saga, I had read a lot of people complaining that the game ended on a cliffhanger. After playing the game myself, I didn't find that to be the case. The game was a bit short yes, but the story wrapped itself up in a way that was satisfying but clearly left room for another installment. However, with TBS2, I didn't feel that the ending was so clearly satisfying. I'm left hungry for more and quite empty inside. Hopefully Stoic is able to have a quicker turnaround with the third installment!			"

												BS 2 is the direct sequel to Banner Saga, who would have thought. The game continues seemlessly where you left off after Act 1. Depending on your final choice and how you skilled and equipped your heroes, the game starts you off with 1 of 2 protagonists. Items and level stay the same and can now be increased further up to level 10. The core gameplay remains 100% the same, so it's a waste of time to be talking about that again. Instead I'll give you the changes and improvements:- THREE branching storylines instead of TWO, depending on who leads the caravan: Rook or Alette (though this is only relevant in 4 chapters or so and does not change the overall story, just the individual's, i.e. different dialogue and different reactions/outcomes)- The battlefield now features barricades, rocks, etc. and not just a plain field- Renown is still the only resource, but levelling up a character is a lot cheaper compared to BS1- At level 6 characters get to choose a second ability- There are a ton more abilities in the game now- After you max out a stat you can now invest points into ""unique talents"" like 20% chance to crit, etc. These talents are the same for every hero though- Clansmen will now forage for food. If you train them to become fighters they can no longer do that- Almost no more actual battles with your army involved- Enemy and hero variety has been dramatically increased. You will not only fight humans, but also feral humans, Varl, Dredge, undead Dredge and Horseborn, which varies up the battles- Battles sometimes also have different objectives, like clearing obstruction or killing a specific enemy, etc.- The background art has become even better and more varied: river journey on ship, travelling through cave systems, a spooky forest, etc.- A few more cutscenes and even voice overGenerally speaking it's a great game with an interesting story and an all too familiar problem: ♥♥♥♥ing huge cliff hanger at the end, and basically the game ending too soon and you feel like something is missing. Better wait for BS 3 then...in 2018!!!! *sigh*. In the mean time, maybe you can play the story again with the other character. I'll wait for that until BS 3 arrives. The devs listened to some feedback without changing the game completely, so in the end I'd give it a 9/10.Edit: Just played through with Rook as well. Not much difference. Generally not much difference to the story apart from some key moments, but the end will always be the same.			"

												Achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s:This is not an easy game to get 100% completion. While writing this review, I’m at 60% with two playthroughs and around 20 hrs. of playtime. The first Banner Saga took me around 6+ playthroughs and 90 hrs. to get all of the achievements (with poor planning), and some of them were pretty tough when doing the hard mode ones, so I imagine I have at least two more playthroughs to complete the achievements.The Game (07/2016):The Banner Saga series is episodic. The games end abruptly and unresolved with the second continuing the story (perhaps a third will finally finish the story?), but the story is refreshing and unique with a dark theme. Be prepared to laugh, curse, and possibly cry. While the series is story rich, unlike many other story rich games, the fighting is strategic and depending on the difficulty setting, sometimes challenging to a degree of cursing at your screen.The Banner Saga 2 maintains the same gameplay as the first, with some minor but pleasant changes (such as giving clansmen a purpose in gathering supplies for the group and the ability to train clansmen into fighters).Below are similar pros and cons that I reviewed for the first game…Possible CONS:-The game is fairly short for an RPG (my first playthrough took around 10 hrs. give or take). -It is not an open world if that is what you are looking for—it is linear with autosaves (you cannot choose where and when to save, but you have access to each autosave if you made a mistake or want to try something different at various points in the game).-The game has a lot of reading involved (you rarely hear a person speak, but it seemed to be more speaking than the first game). The game plays out similar to a point-and-click choices count story, but the turn-based fights in-between reading provide excellent strategic game play that typical point-and-click games do not.With that said, many PROS to the game include:-The Banner Saga 2 gives you the option to continue your saves from the first game!! -The story. I love it so far largely because it feels unique and is well-done.-The dialogue and choices are often entertaining and feel realistic for the setting (the little bit of voice acting in the game is excellent). -The art and score are beautiful. -The game play/turn-based fights are addictive, and the fights even get a little challenging on the normal setting (I cursed at my monitor A LOT on hard mode, but I also like the challenge). Similar to the first Banner Saga, The Banner Saga 2 is worth multiple plays not only for achievements, but to also try out different choices as they can have a fairly large impact on the story. While I suggest people playthrough the first Banner Saga before the second (considering they are episodic), The Banner Saga 2 does a fairly good job briefly including descriptions of events from the first game for people who start with the second.I bought this game almost at full price (10% off shortly before it was released) and it was worth it. I will buy the third game when/if it comes out, and I look forward to the day that I finally know the end to the story, damn it! :D			"

												I don't think this game holds well on its own.Sure, if you're into turn based combat, you'll enjoy the gameplay, which has become more rich due to introduction of more classes, abilities and types of enemies, while keeping the beautiful simplicity of its core intact.But as the gameplay is solid, this is not the central feature of the game. It is the epic and intriguing story, the dramatic and thought through setting, the deep and uncommon characters, outlined with the oustandingly beautiful art along with amazing music - all of that make this game shine. And trust me, you will appreciate how the plot unveals itself much more, if you played the first one.After all, this is only a chapter between the beginning and the end of a greater story. And if you've already learnt how the story starts, than this is the game you've been waiting. So good that it brings shivers through my body at some times, leaving me with a severe hunger for more.

												I remember the first time I picked up the first Banner Saga I had thought to myself ""wow I'm going to be bored"". Absolutely not. This game and its predecessor are some of the best games I have played. I'm not joking. The story really got me into the game. I found myself on the edge of my seat plenty of times. The achievements aren't necessarily difficult, but they are a fun challenge. I put some real effort into keeping Egil alive, and it pays off; he returns in this game! The gameplay is fun, nothing too extraordinary when it comes to combat though. You have your pretty-average isometric, turn-based fighting game. Outside the fighting, it's like Oregon Trail, only vikings and bandits. I personally enjoy the characters. They're all pretty unique, and I find myself caring about them like I'm in the caravan with them. The music is really great ambience wise. I have yet to encounter any crashes, bugs, or lag. I'd say it's worth the price it's asking for, too. Overall an A+ game, but if you don't have the first one, you should play it to really get into it.EDIT: I've played a little more, and found that the tutorial is longer than it was in the first game. Not so great for me, cuz I already know how to play.			"

Although Banner Saga 2 stands on its own as an amazing game, it's impact on the player will be much greater if you played the original. I wholeheartedly recommend this game. If you haven't played the original I suggest playing that first. The original is cheaper, and you can decide there wether or not you like the story and gameplay.			"

												I really wish there was a meh or neutral option on steam. I really loved the first banner Saga so I hopped right on for the sequel. The second Act disappointed me though because the story really failed to grab me. and it feels like they skipped parts of the narratives that were really important. Another thing I felt personally they hopped around way too much to different groups perspectives making it hard to really get into any one faction's story. just when I was starting to get into X's dilemma they would hop over to Y and take me out of it. even worse than this though is that while we're hopped over to another group they skip what X was doing completely and then just pop us in later having missed everything up to that point. during a certain scene I literally stopped it and reloaded just because I thought I had missed an important introductory cutscene. nope they just left whole portions of the narrative of how Y got there and your just left making assumptions about the situation. I would say that is an objective problem with the story telling. a personal taste criticism I have of the story is they really have hit me with darkness induced apathy around the end of this installment. Our hero from the first game seems to have very little to fight for anymore rather than just Momentum and nobody else able to step up to lead(aside from obvious moustache twirling villains of course). And things get so bad all the characters really need a win. also there is another problem in that it seems the people who can actually fix things are actually secret evil jerks or turn suddenly stupidly villainous for drama's sake(this could partly be blamed on them cutting away from stuff and then suddenly coming back). then the story just ends abruptly with very little closure on this installment of anything. tried to be non spoilerly about this but final verdict I would only buy this if you love the sweet salty taste of your characters tears.

												While this game does a lot right, even going above and beyond in its predecessor's combat mechanics and building off its engaging universe, it doesn't offer a satisfying experience due to its abrupt ending, poor pacing, and rather simplistic gameplay. Pros:- It may require a refresher from the first game, but BS2 has a rich world to learn about with many unique and memorable characters. - Great artwork and soundtrack- Generally fun combat- Engaging plotCons:- Pacing. Throughout the game it's unclear how much food you'll need, when you'll need to spend/save renown, when heros will split and where you are in the story. It's not satisfying to suddenly save people, train fighters or buy food, etc. when there's little to form expectations. The sudden ending was extremely unsatisfying.- Unused game mechanics. The playable partsof the game primarily consist of an Oregon Trail dynamic, dialogue options and combat. What are my unused heroes doing? Why do I need clansmen/fights other then to scavenge? Clearly things may make a difference in the next game if you decide to continue your game, but BS2 by itself doesn't offer much beyond combat scenes and journey dialogue.- The game really depends on players carrying over knowledge, connections to characters, etc. from the first game. For this reason alone it's hard to recommend this game to anyone but people who have played the first one. While with this isn't exactly a ton to ask for an indie developer to ask for, there's the reality that this game isn't a complete whole on it's own from start to finish. Just a few thoughts, but I'd recommend waiting for a sale or waiting until the next game comes out to really reap the benefits of playing this game.			"

The pacing of the story also felt faster so traveling was an exciting adventure instead of the mindless slog that happened at the end of The Banner Saga.

												Yet another amazing journey! The struggle continues with even harder decisions to make. Sometimes you just do not know what to expect so you can only hope to make the right choice. This time anything can go wrong and your banner gets punished for it real hard so your main character really needs to become a great leader or not many will make it to Arberrang.The gameplay remains the same, with a few new things like the bigger level cap, new abilities, new races, new enemies, max stats can now be unlocked so you can get extra benefits that just might turn the tide. Many will complain about the cliffhangers in the game, but this is the 2nd part of the trilogy so be patient, i am sure answers will come in the 3rd game. All in all an amazing game. Recommended!  "

												As a fan of a genre that typically features substance over style, this is one of my all-time-favorite TBS mostly because of the presentation. I get immersed in the surreal setting and strange viking characters and creatures. The visual presentation is artistic and often stunning, and the minimalistic animations and sound effects work brilliantly. The music and chanting is wonderful, though it didn't quite raise the hair on my arms like the first one.The gameplay is challenging and slightly stressful, but with a bit of skill and/or patience it is fair. I find that most of the unusual design decisions are fresh and add depth and flavor, with a small dash of pain. E.g. I would rarely condone a limited save system as the one presented here, but if you play along, the inability to save-scum can be quite rewarding.I recommend playing though once on normal or easy (depending on skill level), and accept all good or bad things that happen, and then up the difficulty for the second playthrough while maximizing rewards. There's not much replay value beyond that for either the story mode or survival mode.Which leads me to my one major gripe with this franchise - BS: Factions was/is fantastically replayable, but it was eventually abandoned. I generally understand that the obligation to the kickstarters necessitated a return of focus to the trilogy, but damn, you had a glorious thing going there if you had just followed through. All it really needs for now is a randomizer with maybe a couple of trinkets thrown in, and perhaps a pre-fight 2-minute setup mode.  If you could apply the same amount of effort to Factions that you applied to Survival Mode, I'd be back in a heartbeat. The additional units presented in BS2 make this wishful thinking even more painful.If you liked BS1, you should like this one as much or slightly more, mostly for the increased variety in units and foes.If you hated BS1, you're not reading this.

												I loved the first game. But this game was a huge dissapointment.1. The writing is worse than in the first one... by a lot.2. They added this new mechanic that lets you train clansmen into fighters. Hey, that's great! What is the problem? It is pointless to do so. 3. The ending. Even with all of its faults I was still enjoying the game for the most part. Basically the game just abruptly ends without warning. This game is obviously unfinished. I honestly thought that I did something wrong and the credits rolling were telling me ""You ♥♥♥♥ed up, game over.""The first game was a masterpiece. What happened?			"

												Sadly I won't reccomend Banner Saga 2.  I really enjoyed the first Banner Saga, but the tactical battle mechanics in this version are horrific.  One of the biggest 'amateur' moves on the dev team's part is how turns are given in battle.  There is no strategy here, it is literally you-enemy-you-enemy....its horrible.  A Varl can be as 'fast' as a dexterous assassin.  You essentially are just throwing in meat, hoping that the AI makes a mistake in who they take out first.  There is very little strategy.  The story is of course interesting, which is the only reason to buy the game, but save yourself the frustration and just watch a youtube recap.  The devs really bombed on this one. Fail.			"

												I really liked the first one, and had high hopes for Banner Saga 2. It's mostly the same game, but that's the good part. Since launch, and with no fix in sight after months, I've been plagued by technical problems during battles, with texture disappearing or even the whole scene being invisible (HUD visible, and the rest all black). This has been communicated on the forums and was dismissed. I have a 770, which is more than enough to run the game. I just lost an hour of game because you need to do 3 battles in a row and the third one displayed only a black screen. This is extremely frustrating. On top of that, 360 controller optimiziation is simply not there, and it constantly pick up inputs I didn't give, like one of the sticks was leaning in a certian direction. Steam controller doesn't present the same problem, but the UI got messier compared to the first game and overall it's just an annoying game to play with the controller. I would imagine these are all trivial fixes that would make the game running as expected, not sure why this is still unaddressed.			"

												Aesthetically, it is a great game. Amazing audio and visuals. But gameplay is not there. Frustrating combat and leveling up system. Choices always feels like you are failing. You should never tell a player they are playing the game wrong and this game makes you feel like that constantly. Annoying audio drones happen half-way through the game which becomes too loud. No option to turn down the audio, just mute it all, which is not how game options should be.If you like aesthetic games, this is for you. If you like gameplay which feels unfair and treat you unfairly, this is for you. Else I'd stray from something as frustrating as playing this game was. "

												I haven't played the regular game at all because I remember the first Banner Saga's strange interpretation of ""turn order"". While innovative, it's also counter-intuitive, with generally the best strategy being to maim everything in sight but not finish off any particular opponent. I'm not crazy about constructing a barrier out of crippled foes while I plink away at their health back ranks, but thankfully, the second iteration of this game very nearly scratches my squad-tactics itch. My main interest is the (mostly) deterministic turn-based combat. It's really refreshing to play a game with deep tactics that doesn't rely on chance to provide a dynamic challenge. The armor/strength system is simple but brilliant and rewards careful planning and execution. So yes, full disclosure: I've bascially only played survival mode, but I've played a lot of it. If you like turn-based tactics, and don't like random-number-generated tension, I'd have to recommend this one, because it's about the only thing like it. (Incidentally, if you're reading this review and know of another game like this, particularly one that doesn't have the problem mentioned below, leave a comment and you'll have my deep gratitude.)So I've got only one gripe, but it's a pretty significant one: The game is turn-based, but there is a turn-timer, and there is no way to pause. It's also single-player only, by the way. On top of that, the interface is a bit clunky; meaning that assessing the potential movement of an enemy takes several seconds, and if there are several enemies, it's pretty easy to run out of time and completely miss a character's turn. Don't try to wait to the last second assessing your options because any action requires several clicks to choose and confirm. It is frustrating to warrant the negative review in my opinion, although, as previously mentioned, if you're having trouble finding a game that throws that stupid d20 in the trash where it mostly belongs, try this one, you might have a different opinion.I think the timer is motivated by the notion of ""leaderboards"". For what it's worth, I'm one of those people who couldn't give a frog's fart for how I stack up against other people in a turn-based tactical game. Well... I guess that's not completely true: I also play a lot of internet chess on FICS and pay some attention to my rating, so yeah... But still, I'd be elated if only there were a ""hardcore"" mode with ticking turn-timers and the like, but also a ""sissy"" mode for folks like me who enjoy turn-based tactics because of it's player-defined pacing.Anyways, if that silly timer could be disabled (it can't and this game doesn't support mods), I would give this game a REALLY enthusiastic thumbs up, solely on the basis of the survival minigame. I'm sure the main game is lovely too, if you're into that story, character development and meaningful decisions sort of thing. I kind of leave that stuff for books, movies, and the cereal aisle, but hey, whatever floats your boat.			"

												Well...We all looked back how awesome Banner Saga 1 was.We all hoped Banner Saga 2 will be awesome too.We all knew it wont be the last awesome Banner Saga.And now i can say. This game IS awesome!It is much longer than Banner Saga 1. For the first journey i needed 8 or 9 hours. Without my afk time i needed about 11 or 12 hours and do u know what Stoic? Thanks for it! As much as i liked BS 1 - it was really too short.The atmosphere if (for me) higher than Fallout or Witcher could be. Such an AMAZING credible world u have crafted here, I do never think ""aw man that is really not immersive. You failed here"". NO! All i think is ""YES! That could be a real other world""The storytelling is awesome like always. The fighting system didnt change much. Some new classes (you can have a fkn bear!!!!!!!!!!111111), some new enemies (amagawd they have bears too -.-). Your decisions are face punshing like u know it. In other games you know the right path more or less. There is a good, a neutral, a bad decision. Even the Witcher had some the clear path. But here? Man you cant be friendly everytime. You try it, but it will break your neck and i like this game for this.I wasnt sure i do really want to play it or not. Well you know... The Rook thing. :>The new ending is nice, but not that epic like the last.If you didnt like Banner Saga 1... Dont buy this game. You will absolutely not like it.If u liked Banner Saga 1. AH MA GAWD! Give stemam your paypal account, your credit card or whatever! BUY-THIS-GAME! You wont regret it!9/10 is exactly what this game deserves!Any questions? Just ask me here!			"

												I would have accepted a clone of Banner Saga.  But this so much more than that.  With different skills enemies this game is pretty much the perfect sequal.  They have added just enough while keeping the charm of the original game. The biggest impovement in my opinion is added element of the dynamic battlefield and how each of the battles feels more unique with new objectives requiring differing strategies.  The story telling does a great job of creating tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat like a great novel.  The artwork is beyond amazing, so gorgeous.  It is vibrant and colorful and feels world feels magical.  I am honestly thinking about calling in sick tomorrow just to continue the story.  Probably won't sleep tonight and will want to play it again with a different save from the first banner saga.If you liked the last one there is no reason not to pick this up.			"

												Disclaimer: I have not yet beaten the game.I played Banner Saga 1 and was excited to play this one too. From what I have played it is the same as far as fighting goes, but with a bit more advanced progression system for characters. Heroes can be upgraded beyond level 5 which is nice. The story picks up right where the first one left off and even gives you the option to load your save and choices from the other game, which is pretty cool. Overall a great game if you are looking for an amazing story, choose your own adventure style leadership, and casual turn based gameplay. This game should also provide replayablility because of all the choices you make, and also a lengthy playthrough. Overall I would recommend, but not if you're looking for a challenging nitty-gritty rpg (can increase difficulty)			"

												Its more an expansion than a new game. If u liked the first one u will like the second. I like the story is even more polished than the previous saga, U have higher levels on charakters and there are more abilities for each charakter. There are new charakters so it will keep u entertained. U can beat this game within 10-14 hrs on normal, what is a reasonable amount of time. After u finish u will want to play it again cause u have 2 main charakters from previous saga, with the same main quest, but they differ in some choises that u make along the main questline. This game is chalenging and ai is most times pretty polished. Some of ur actions will matter so u can lose many of ur playable charakters. There is not much that has been changed from the previous title story and charakters excluded. So if  expecting different gameplay dont look it in banner saga 2. If u want to continue the great story from banner saga this is ur game. If u didnt play banner saga 1 u can jump into this game with no problem. U may not understand some relationships and motivations that are in the first game, but recap that is in game will help u with main plot.			"

												For anyone who played the first Banner Saga game: Pick this game up. It continues the story very nicely and adds enough new enviroments units, and mechanical changes to make the game feel fresh. You'll like it.For anyone who hasn't played the first game: Pick the first game up, it will help ease you into how everything works and give you enough experience to appreciate what exactly is happening in the story, and you'll be able to import your save file in the next game if you enjoy it enough to continue the series.There are some aspects I feel the game still needs to work on, such as more importance on balancing the number of clansmen and soldiers you have, and having more complex war events, but those are nitpicks at best. Still a solid game, still a solid series.			"

												""No better burden can a man carry on the road than a store of common sense.""- Hávamál, st. 10In The Banner Saga 2 you again assume the role of a leader of men, as you take up the mantle to guide your clan, and your banner, to safety. The world is breaking (Ragnarok) and this is part of the mystery as the story unfolds.In many aspects this sequel continues the trend of The Banner Saga 1. But on a grander scale. The enemies are more varied, the battles have more diverse environments and other winning objectives than simply ""defeat all enemies"".The battles feel integral in moving the story along and it is paced very, very well in my view. The game's underlying mechanic is essentially getting from A to B via C via X. Confusing? Not really as the story branches out and introduces new main characters such as the war torn Varl (a race in this universe) Bolverk. A stark contrast (depending how you play and your choices of course) to the other main character.The story, and choices, are multi-layered as you make decisions as to how (not) to protect your Caravan of people at the base level. The stakes are upped when you parley with more powerful individuals, whether in regards to magic, title or simply supernatural beings, and need to make decisions that can affect whole communities or possibly the world.If you have played The Banner Saga 1, you will want more answers regarding the game's overarching plot of the world breaking apart. These are somewhat passed along to the player just like treats to a pet. They satisfy you for a bit but you stay to get more as The Banner Saga 2 augments the series' universe. The lines are blurred and your morality, as well as your view of people, will get challenged. Compared to other ""choices matters"" games it does matter here. Main characters can die, or be lost, 10 minutes after using all your ressources leveling them up.Common sense will get you far in this game, but what exactly is common sense when you are presented with possible world altering consequences?

												Banner Saga 1 was one of the most refreshing and intense experiences of the past few years. A good example of an small budget indie game that manages to transcend the limitations and expectations with good balance between simple ideas, good execution and minimalism that leave enough for the imagination to fulfil. There are few realistic big budget 3D games that manage to create as strong feelings as the 2D graphics that Banner Saga utilizes. Banner Saga 2 is a straight continuation from the moment where Banner Saga 1 ends and if you have played the first game and still have the same game available, you can import the save game and it's situation to the second episode and continue playing. Enginewise not much has changed - the game still consists of mainly three different elements: - tactical chesslike turn based battles - camping where you can decide how to divide renknown between your heroes (or save it for shopping as reknown is used both as experience and gold in this game, which makes for interesting choices and isn't as bad concept as it sounds).- storyline dialogues where you can choose between various options and see how it affects your situation, sometimes more or less drasticallyHowever, there are some major changes in relation to the first episode: the battles are less repetitive and tedious as most of the fights have some extra elements that make them more interesting. Sometimes something happens during the fight that changes the situation and makes it more interesting. There are possible extra elements in the battlefield that can be destroyed or utilized. There are also extra classes that give more choices to your party structure. Bard being one of the most interesting ones. His skill gives boost to one character and he replenishes nearby characters willpower if he's close enough to the place where an enemy is killed by singing a heroic song.All in all Banner Saga 2 offers an updated and more enjoyable version of the already enjoyable first game with deep and emotional storyline that can contain rough and sad moments - like in real life, no matter how hard you try, sometimes bad things happen and you just have to cope instead of reload.If you enjoy tactical battles, interesting characters and emotion inducing storylines in a viking fantasy world with sort of minimalistic and streamlined dialogue options, you can't go wrong with Banner Saga. But start with the first game.			"

												There are very few games that urges me to buy both the game soundtrack or the Ipad portable versions of the game, ""The Banner Saga"" was one such game(among classics such as Heroes III). With that in mind my hype for the second part in a series of three games was massive. The return of characters that you really felt connected too and tried your best to save during the first game now team up with a whole new group of flavored characters and new races to survive the enemies hunting them from the first game. Overall the story and rich lore is delivered flawlessly as expected with a rather puzzeling cliffhanger at the end (yet again) and the few complains of the flavorless combat system from the first game have some what been fixed as the game raises the level cap of all heroes and provives you with new ways to really specialise each of the characters with higher crit chances or higher chance to dodge to name a few.The voice acting and visual effects are still used to great effect just as they were in the first game but I tend to think that there are more voice acting in this game after complains about the lack of it in the first game(I guess not everyone enjoy the Visual Novel theme they were going for in their story telling). The game can easily be finished under the 20 hour mark but seeing as the price for the game have been lowered compared to the first one I find it more then acceptable, there is also the massive replay ability and the diffrent diffuculty levels just as in the first game and branching storylines to keep the player entertained for a good amount of time.

												The Banner Saga 2 is the second game in the Banner Saga trilogy (the third part being currently in development), and is basically more of the same, but with several improvements. It tells the tale of a few human and Varl, trying desperately to survive in a norse mythology based world on the brink of total collapse. The story follows two separate, but intertwined routes. One is a clan leader, trying to lead a caravan of his clansmen to the relative safety of the human capital, Arberrang. The second is Bolverk, a ruthless Varl mercenary on a quest from one of the mysterious Valka (sort of a human wizard). Both will face hard choices en route, and both will suffer the consequences. Essentialy, the gameplay comes down to three things. First is managing your caravan, making sure your clansmen are safe, happy and have enough to eat. This involves dealing with various events along the way, which is the second part of the fun. Every situation you encounter comes with a choice. It is sometimes difficult to tell what is the best course of action, and consequences can be dire - including the death of key characters. Third part of the gameplay are the tactical battles. So, here is a breakdown on what is done right and what needs some rework.The Good:+ The atmosphere of this game is incredible. Both the music and the gorgeous, hand drawn graphics make you feel engrossed in the game and the desperate struggle for survival of its heroes+ Battles are improved compared to the first game. The enemies are much more varied this time around instead of the endless sea of Dredge in the first game. The battle maps are also much more interesting, since they now have destructible obstacles and choke points.+ Added survival mode is loads of fun if you like the combat system. With the whole roster of characters available to choose from for your party, there are a lot of possible ways of approaching the combat. I recommend targeting some of the achievements for an additional challenge.+ Saves carry over from the previous edition. Because of this, you can play as two different main characters, depending on the choices from the first game.+ Choices have real consequences. Sometimes, they are really difficult to predict, so you feel just as lost as the main character, trying to do the right thing and often failing.The Mediocre:~ Sometimes, the options presented to the player are very similar, which makes it frustrating when you feel you have chosen the option slightly better suited to the character, yet get punished for it.~ We're at the second game, and there are still more questions than answers. I am beginning to fear that the third game will not have enough time to resolve everything in a satisfactory manner. Hopefully that will not be the case.~The interface is a bit clunky. This is especially true in the character screen. I get that this was done deliberately so that the game could work on touch screens and consoles, but come on, some streamlining for PC cannot be all that hard.The Bad:- Renown, the rather scarce main resource of the game, is tied to steam achievements. Each time you finish an achievement, you receive a certain amount of renown. I have two problems with this. First of all, it is easy to screw up. Hard. So, you'd probably want to load... and thus lose the renown for, say, killing 3 enemies with a certain character, which you managed to do just before loading. I get that this is done to encourage playing the game to the end without using saves and maybe trying another playthrough with other choices. This leads me to number two. If you are planning on a second playthrough, you are basically hindered from the start, since you will NOT gain any more renown from the achievements. And it is a significant amount - you could probably level a character from 5 to 10 for it, which is huge.- Still no 'Undo move' in combat. This is incredibly frustrating. Many times I have moved a character only to find out I was out of range for an attack by one square or had to reload the whole battle due to a simple misclick.TL;DR - Great game with an incredible atmosphere, consequence heavy choices and interesting combat. A must have if you played the first part. If you did not like Banner Saga 1, do not bother with this one either.			"

												I played the 1st Banner Saga Game and I totally loved how the player feels part of the story, taking decisions through the game will most of the time have consequences, sometimes some decisions will let your close companions be kill, the background music is awesome, the combat has innovative way using a pretty close point of view like real life (if your strength is low or you are wounded you will do less damage)In Banner Saga 2 for the 8 hours I was able to play yesterday, I knew it was going to be another success game from Stoic Developers since they took the enough time and were opened from feedback to add new features to this 2nd part of the saga. what I love of this game is that you will never expect what is going to happened, yesterday while I was playing I decided to help in a specific situation and the result for that action was something I never expected :(I was wondering what will happened when characters reach max stats and Stoic team add the talents features, which is awesome allowing the player to choose once more their path to victory with those talents that will make the difference in combat when the odds are against you.Here is a nice review I saw long long time ago in a website when I was researching for Banner Saga game before I decided to purchase.""Risk in gameplay: A lot of modern games play it safe- you know you'll defeat the evil and save the day. In The Banner Saga you can't take anything for granted. We want it to feel like a good tv mini-series; the world doesn't revolve around you, it's about how you deal with change."" "

												have to say i like were this saga is going so far. i love how everything from bs1 can carry over into the new game. i also like the new enemies. and how there are new things on the battlefield such as the barricades and what have you. when you have all the characters from the previous game combined with the new ones you now have so many combat possibilities that it will have coming back for more. for me the variety of choices has been the reason to play it again and again i just love making different choices to see how things play out differently in the story. i like everything they have done with this and hope the saga continues.

												The Banner Saga 2 is the second game in the Banner Saga trilogy (the third part being currently in development), and is basically more of the same, but with several improvements. It tells the tale of a few human and Varl, trying desperately to survive in a norse mythology based world on the brink of total collapse. The story follows two separate, but intertwined routes. One is a clan leader, trying to lead a caravan of his clansmen to the relative safety of the human capital, Arberrang. The second is Bolverk, a ruthless Varl mercenary on a quest from one of the mysterious Valka (sort of a human wizard). Both will face hard choices en route, and both will suffer the consequences. Essentialy, the gameplay comes down to three things. First is managing your caravan, making sure your clansmen are safe, happy and have enough to eat. This involves dealing with various events along the way, which is the second part of the fun. Every situation you encounter comes with a choice. It is sometimes difficult to tell what is the best course of action, and consequences can be dire - including the death of key characters. Third part of the gameplay are the tactical battles. So, here is a breakdown on what is done right and what needs some rework.The Good:+ The atmosphere of this game is incredible. Both the music and the gorgeous, hand drawn graphics make you feel engrossed in the game and the desperate struggle for survival of its heroes+ Battles are improved compared to the first game. The enemies are much more varied this time around instead of the endless sea of Dredge in the first game. The battle maps are also much more interesting, since they now have destructible obstacles and choke points.+ Added survival mode is loads of fun if you like the combat system. With the whole roster of characters available to choose from for your party, there are a lot of possible ways of approaching the combat. I recommend targeting some of the achievements for an additional challenge.+ Saves carry over from the previous edition. Because of this, you can play as two different main characters, depending on the choices from the first game.+ Choices have real consequences. Sometimes, they are really difficult to predict, so you feel just as lost as the main character, trying to do the right thing and often failing.The Mediocre:~ Sometimes, the options presented to the player are very similar, which makes it frustrating when you feel you have chosen the option slightly better suited to the character, yet get punished for it.~ We're at the second game, and there are still more questions than answers. I am beginning to fear that the third game will not have enough time to resolve everything in a satisfactory manner. Hopefully that will not be the case.~The interface is a bit clunky. This is especially true in the character screen. I get that this was done deliberately so that the game could work on touch screens and consoles, but come on, some streamlining for PC cannot be all that hard.The Bad:- Renown, the rather scarce main resource of the game, is tied to steam achievements. Each time you finish an achievement, you receive a certain amount of renown. I have two problems with this. First of all, it is easy to screw up. Hard. So, you'd probably want to load... and thus lose the renown for, say, killing 3 enemies with a certain character, which you managed to do just before loading. I get that this is done to encourage playing the game to the end without using saves and maybe trying another playthrough with other choices. This leads me to number two. If you are planning on a second playthrough, you are basically hindered from the start, since you will NOT gain any more renown from the achievements. And it is a significant amount - you could probably level a character from 5 to 10 for it, which is huge.- Still no 'Undo move' in combat. This is incredibly frustrating. Many times I have moved a character only to find out I was out of range for an attack by one square or had to reload the whole battle due to a simple misclick.TL;DR - Great game with an incredible atmosphere, consequence heavy choices and interesting combat.

												If you liked the first one, seems like you're going to like tbs2.  A+ so far.Playing The Banner Sagas 1 & 2has some flavors of watching a Hayao Miyazaki animated movie, if Miyazaki were a depressed SwedeFinn and liked bleak starvation-driven migration stories, with long turn based tactical combats between animated portions, team, and inventory management.We really like these games and are surprised that there aren't more cinematically animated, calmly delivered scenes with decisions that seem fraught with peril and a lot of slow turn based combat.Perfect. Keep it up.   Perhaps you could re-do The Oregon Trail, do it really well, and then probably throw in some native-north american and crazed Christian missionary end of the world story.Bleak, frozen, relentless. Poor Rook's face has gone from that of a hale middle aged man to one that looks ruined with despair.   A+			"

												I could just look at this game for hours. This is exactly the kind of game that plays perfectly on a tablet (mechanics focus on strategy, not reflexes; story is engaging, but never drags on for more than a minute without prompting a choice or action), but... Play it on the best monitor you have if you can it's absolutely worth it.The narrative itself does not wrap up as tightly as the first game, but mostly in the sense that they were obviously a lot more confident in the sequel happening than they were with the first instalment and they can afford the unresolved ending. Definitely looking forward to TBS3!If I had one critique, it would be the treatment of music during combat scenes. The scoring overall is great, but the combat loop just repeats without variation. While you might not notice as you plan your next four moves, I can attest to the fact that the repeating audio will drill into the brain of anyone else in the room until you are compelled to find a headset...

A must have if you played the first part. If you did not like Banner Saga 1, do not bother with this one either.			"

												I really loved this game and it scratched my itch for a proper RPG style tale in a computer format. To get the most out of it I recommend playing it with a role-playing mindset, that is what made it a great experience for me, trying to get under the skin of the character you are playing and make choices based on what that person would do, not what you think would get most XP for. Min-maxing party membership and other stuff is important to many people and they get their chance to enjoy their thing, but it is not required to complete the game fully.+ The setting, the story: Great stuff, some innovative storytelling right there. Trying to survive during Ragnarok is good material for dramatic tension.+ Animation: I for one love the animation on the battlefield, the little manuevers the characters perform, the little dances, the gestures. I think the animation was top-notch and a important part of the game.+ The sound: From soundtrack to voiceacting it was really well done and suited the atmosphere of the game.+ The different perspective: Playing as the Ravens was a nice touch and the different approaches between a somewhat naive Alette and a cynical Borkverk was great fun to play out. + Artstyle: The characters, the backgrounds, the fallen gods, you name it.  The battle mechanics are serviceable but not great, the animations made me enjoy them a lot even so and I had more fun fighting in this game than in Banner Saga 1 wich has the same mechanics. Overall I give this game a 9/10, though keep in mind I came for the roleplaying and the story, and I got exactly what I wanted.			"

												As an avid fan of Stoic, I couldn't be happier with what they've done here. An immersive and beautifully-designed gem of a game, the second Banner Saga improves upon the first in virtually every category. The music and art are gorgeous (as should be expected), and the writing is thoroughly engrossing, with new characters and unexpected plot points that continue to flesh out the compelling world of the Banner Saga. The gameplay is also enhanced by new win conditions, destructable obstacles, and unit classes, which together add considerable variety and depth to an already-robust combat system.If you liked the Banner Saga 1, you'll love this one. 9/10			"

												The Banner Saga is one of my favorite games of all time. No other game story has captivated me so deeply. The choices matter. Lesser men will cry.The Banner Saga 2 follows the same trend of storytelling, but with slight improvements to the combat.My only complaint is that there is a fairly serious bug involving exp and promotions. For many of my characters, it will tell me I do not have the required amount of exp, even when I clearly do. This is close to game-breaking as it is a very integral part of the game and I'm experiencing it so much it feels like something that should have been noticed and fixed before release.			"

												EDIT:Allrighty, removed old review, new one in its place since I've got a successful playthrough already. My playthrough was on Normal Difficulty.Pros:* Art, music, atmosphere remain good.* Promotion/ranks are easier in this game* Strategy has improved; the approach to the training tent can net you Renown. Better special attack combos in general.* Your choices matter in this game. Be prepared to risk losing characters you love or for fights you feel conflicted about, especially late in the game.* Ludin seems...nicer. He was a character I didn't like in BS1, and he seems to have grown in BS2.* Reasonably good way of handling/discussing sexism for the setting.* I imported an old save; I could immediately tell my choices in BS1 mattered. I saved Egil in BS1 and Alette lived, and that actually gave me a special scene in BS2 at a certain godstone.Cons:* Image flickering in Old Wood with Horseborn fight* Occasional lag* Don't expect to be playing from the perspective of a ""hero"" all the time. Bolverk is...different. He's probably the furthest thing from heroic, and oftentimes I found all of the options in conversation for him to be negative ones. He can be very rewarding, as his personal story is very rich, but in the beginning, he's incredibly frustrating, at least for me.* Ending feels a bit...abrupt, comparedto BS1. As if one is being stopped mid-tale. BS1 has a sense of closure to me; BS2 feels like I'm left on a cliffhanger. Could be a pro, depending on how you like your plot structured; it was just a bit jarring for me.			"

												I might update the review when I have played more. Basically, if you love The Banner Saga, you'll love this sequel.The sequel lets you import your save game so you can have your characters' stats and items. I wish I hadn't chosen Alette to be the martyr of the previous game. I like playing as Rook; what breaks your heart more than a grieving parent? But I would love to see dear Alette developing herself into a leader for the rest of the clansmen. In the first chapter (that is Chapter 8), you literally continue your journey (just a few days after the end of The Banner Saga) to find a safe zone when the world is breaking. You won't find many things new, but you'll find everything you love from The Banner Saga.You can see my let's play on

												As someone who (foolishly) bought the franchise pack on sale on the strength of the original game, I'd held some hope that the second would in some way improve upon or mitigate the fundamental mechanical/balance issues in the first game. It is instead literally more of the same. The setting is still excellent, the writing is reasonable, and the soundtrack is gorgeous. The mechanics are asinine and backwards, and the new talents you can put points into on levelup actually make the game worse by introducing RNG, the lack of which was one of the only bright spots mechanically in BS1 (woo now we can crit or have a 15% dodge chance. yay.)If you liked BS1 you'll like this. If you weren't a fan be prepared for more of the same, culminating in a particularly dreadful and abrupt ending pitting two protagonists against eachother. Also if you pick or import a save as Alette, enjoy being literally unbeatable in combat since her new toy at level six is ludicrously broken. Free range 8 overwatch attacks with no limit and a knockback stapled on which ends the turns of the people she hits. Put some shields around her and watch the enemy kill itself trying to approach.

												TL;DR: Game doesn't cost a lot at all, which partly justifies it's length, but if you want the whole story — you'd better off waiting for the trequel. This chapter blatantly cuts off game's story with a by-the-book cliffhanger as if it was some TV-series.Also, consider that I do not reccomend this game mostly because there is no ""mixed"" button for reviews, but the game has a bit too high review score at the moment.Pros:+ More animated story scenes and attempts to present cutscenes\storytelling in new ways, which is commendable, considering what devs have on hands in terms of game engine and resources;+ Brand new heroes with brand new abilities, who bring new strategies into the game. They feel fairly balanced and do not seem like some checklist addition;+ Survival mode with it's own achivements and therefore challenges and tactics.Cons:- Obnoxious training challenges, that force you to play in one way and require to meet all winning conditions. Randomness of opponent's type and their starting position add nothing to these challenges, and just force you to fish for better starting conditions by restarting training. One can say that it's an optional content, but you get substantional amounts of Renown for completing these challenges, and if you want to have enough supplies and leveled up heroes to get a lot of achivements — you're left with no other option other than farming these challenges;- Game divides your heroes into two different campaigns after certain point, but you have no control on who ends up in what camp. Depending on your playstyle and preferences, you will feel like one camp has much better heroes than other. You can say that such approach encourages usage of different playstyles which in turn keeps game more entertaining and fresh, but considering that unique challenges for each camp are never seen outside one-two story battles and training challenges — this is not true.- Some moments in story feel underwhelming for example: laughable reasoning behind Canary's horseborn following Rooks caravan and unlike first game, BS 2 ends with dumbed-down ""boss"" fight, which feels like a cutscene, and then cuts off story without resolving any storylines presented in this chapter.

												I'm tornI really love this game. The artwork, soundtrack and gameplay are all on point. It's not the best game I've ever played, but it accomplishes what it attempts to do, and that is delivering a very well told story in a way that melds well with the gameplay and art style along with blending multiple game styles (RTS, RPG, and turn based management) in a way that is not only entertaining, but enriching.Often times, whenever I play video games, I go through the motions of killing, stealing, farming, and looting with no remorse for my victim or their families. Many video game companies and programmers claim that their video game is an ""every decision matters"" video game, but this one truly is. There haven't been very many video game characters that make me feel any kind of attachment of discontent towards them. EVERY character on this video game has. There are very few characters, throughout my 2 playthroughs of both games, that weren't memorable, in some fashion. What I'm getting at, is that as a standalone game, it's a masterpiece.HOWEVER I have a few fundamental problems with not only this series but also with the way that Stoic games is handling this series. I'll start with Stoic games since that statment might leave a few of you scratching your heads.I have ALWAYS had a problem paying 60 -100 bucks for a brand new game. It's the reason I play so many indie games. The content has to be in harmony with the price point. When I bought the first Banner Saga for (I think it was) $15, I was a bit skeptical. There were a lot of negative reviews saying that there wasn't $15 dollars worth of content in that game, and to an extent, I agree with them. (The replayability of these games is actually quite high, which is the only reason I don't fully agree) BUT at 15 bucks, it wasn't a bad buy. It had multiple great stories that culminated into an epic that jerked a tear from my eyes.Fast forward 1 and a half(ish) years. The sequel comes out. Whenever you deliver the type of story that the Banner Saga attempts to deliver in the manner that they did it, you should NEVER make your audience wait that long for a sequel. EVER. I understand you have a small staff, but over the course of 2 years, I've given your company 40 bucks for 2 games. The content of these 2 games doesn't begin to add up to some of these AAA game titles out there. There WILL be a third banner saga. ASSUMING (which, I've learned, is a bad thing to do when dealing with Stoic) that the third game will end this series of games, I will have spent, roughly, 60 bucks on all of your video games. Assuming that the third one takes another three hours to complete, and I play every story-line available through all three games, (Banner Saga 1- 3 hours, Banner Saga 2 & 3- 6 hours each-3 hours for each story-line) I will have 15 hours of gameplay under my belt with nothing else that can be done in the game other beating the game on an alternate difficulty. Sadly, this is the direction that indie games are going. Small companies start running out of money, so they cut their story short and leave you with a ""next time on dragon ball z"" sequence as the last impression of their video game. 16 months later, they do it all over again, except charge you 5 bucks more than the predecessor. I had a really, really hard time deciding whether to recommend this game or not. All in all, if you enjoy a game for the story and experience as I do, you'll want to experience this game. If you're looking for something to dive into for the next 2 weeks, you'll have to look elswhere. I finished this game on the same day that I installed it. I know I have posted a lot of problems I have with this game, but I will definitely be buying the third game. Not for the gameplay, and definitely not for Stoic Games, but for Alette and Rook.TL;DRGreat story. You'll fall in love with the main characters; fact. Terrible pricepoint for the content. Follows a terrible precedent set by a video game company that reminds me more of a mobile app developer than a legit indie video game developer. "

												More of the same good stuff from the 1st, EXCEPT: The ending, the final battle is actually TERRIBLE compared to the first. The ending was confusing, uninspired and didn't resolve ANYTHING. It feels like the game ended kind of in a middle of the story rather than being a complete piece of it. I was happy with the game until the end disappointed me. First Banner Saga had an amazing ending with an epic battle. This was just lame and unsatisfying.			"

												I really wanted to love this game...I really did. The art direction, the characters, even the combat for the most part is really great. I enjoyed the first game...but hated the ending. This one, even moreso. It had a decent story but near the end it all falls apart and nothing makes sense and your choices mean next to nothing.I hate, HATE, that a large part of the game is having you build up your party members and equipping them with items, only to have them leave or turn against you. Sorry, that is just not fun, nor interesting.This is a game that has SUCH a huge potential, but gets bogged down in a goofy story that is really trying too hard to be ""cool"" or ""exotic"" etc.  This reminds a lot of the TV series ""Lost"".

												Banner Saga 2 feels and plays almost exactly like the first installment of the series, which is both a good and a bad thing. On the plus side, it is still an amazingly beautiful game; on the negative side, it still suffers from an incredibly stupid battle system.To give a quick recap, in the world of the Banner Saga a characters' hit points is also equal to the amount of damage they can dish out. An uncommon yet interesting concept - which is completely ruined by one major flaw: your party and the enemies will always alternate turns.If an enemy is killed, the next in line will simply take their position; this means that the optimal strategy to win is usually to beat down each enemy to its health minimum and then move on to the next opponent until the battlefield is filled with cripples. Conversely, this means that saving your own injured characters is a tactical disadvantage.It also results in the absurd fact that battles are generally the easier the bigger the enemy army, as they will waste turns moving with far away characters while you can maim everything next to your guys with no resistance. As an unfortunate side-effect this drains atmosphere from the story, as the approaching giant army of Dredge hardly seems like a menace.Granted, the developer has apparently realized how stupid their system is, and introduced a number of new talents and features which punish not killing enemies, allow for turn order manipulation, or outright alter/replace the combat system. Is it enough to save Banner Saga 2's merit as a strategy game? No. Which is sad, because it is a great narrative experience.That said, there's a few other things about the game I found annoying, but also a few improvements compared to its predecessor:Positive:- more detailed and varied battlefields- battlefields which are just squares are less common- finally a decent variety of enemiesNegative:- The ending. It is weak from a story standpoint, but gameplay-wise it plain sucks. None of the last few battles are challenging, and the final one is just a dumb gimmick involving no strategy- Choices are oftentimes mundane, and choosing anything that involves your lead character almost always nets the best result without any danger- You still made a bad choice and lost clansmen? Hard to care since they're little more but numbers on the top of the screen, serving even less purpose than before- Inconsistent character sprites. One can clearly distinguish old and new character models (the old ones have a more grey outline, while the newer ones are black); some such as Rook have some animation frames with both, and it looks really patchy once you have noticed it for the first time- RNG is a bigger factor due to numerous new talents which have a % chance to do something- The game does a lot of ""tell"" but little ""show"". An epic confrontation between Eyvind and the world-eating Serpent just happened? Here, enjoy this still image of guys standing around and talking about how amazing it was.Conclusion:A bit better than the first installment, but Banner Saga 2 is another pass. Sadly.			"

												you can still buy the game, just look at those positive comments, they are telling the truth, just like this not recommended comment does,and here am i, about to complain:1. the tutorial in the BS2 is annoying, really annoying. there is no option to shut it. shame(the previes game had same type of tutorial but significantly shorter, so that make it torelable, the new tutorial makes me dont even want to play again with another save file from BS)2. and there are bugs:-in the first battle against horseborn, i always encounter the same bug, that when the 2nd wave of reinforcement arrived to the map, the charaters in the battle field starts to flash and disapear.-crushes, which drives you crazy if it happens right after a hard battle, but the good thing is, in BS2, there are no hard encounter.3. the game is way too easy, (spoiler alert)not just the finnal battle, which is really symbolic. i played the hard difficulty, but the game is not hard at alll, because you can always REST, in BS2, the supplies are easy to get, and i havent had my caravan starved for one single day. and there was a chapter that your raven caravan has to running away from the large horde of dredges, yet you can still have some rest, yes, have some rest without any problema. but there was one encounter i havent win, it was against Sefra, a bandit leader i saved with the raven caravan in its journey, i always lost and been robbed by them.4. ability are not special for the common folk, lost of ability can be learned at the level of 6, even the axe throwing, boring.after all, its a decent game acording to the low price and nice art style & nice background story. i will still buy BS3, but hope there wont be BS4.

												Im kinda dissapointed. Nothing new compared to the first part of the saga. No new mechanics of gameplay, but thats not the worst thing in this game. The story. Well, it still leads nowhere. No real conclusions, just cliffhangerst here and there. Its getting cheap. Also its still the same painfull journey that actually leads nowhere. The montonous of it, stated to kill me out of boredom, somwhere in half of the game. Anyway - If you would take the first part, and then just mixed some graphics, changed some names, script etc - you would actually have the same quality as in this part. I doubt I will play 3rd part, as I dislike constant dejavu's. Sry form my ENG.			"

												Overall the game mechanics are improvement over the first one. The character stat customizations are nicely improvement, and additionally the new syngeneic gear is really nice. New character types like Bards and Rogue are a lot of fun.I loved the first game, but I can’t recommend this game. As a game about hard choices, consequences has been raised to overly punishing, too the point of game ending. The game has a way slap you in the face with a slippery slope that you have no hope of recovery. When you start the game again, there is no joy in the replay. Choices become meaningless, as often the best choice is to ignore them. Soullessly marching down the road, cold and careless of the other's fate.In the end the game this game is the silver arrow that puts my want to play it to sleep.			"

												Like the 1st game, BS2 is built upon a solid gameplay formula and fascinating worldsetting. Unfortunately, the execution falls apart. Stoic Studio behaves like that spiteful, arrogant artsy kid, bragging about the genius of their work but simultaneously mocks you for playing their game.If you're new to the turn-base strategy genre, the game is going to feel utterly alienating. And Stoic really doens't bother to hold your hand. You're thrown into the thick of battle to fend yourselves. You're going to make mistakes and you're going to feel it. Not in a satisfying ""everytime I retry I get a little better"" kind of way. But in a ""I'm hours into this playthrough and I just realized I don't have enough high level characters to get through this battle and now I must start all over"" kind of way.If you're a perfectionist then you're going to hate this game. The game doesn't allow you to make saves. You frequently find yourself having to replay entire chapters of the game to reverse a bad decision. Even that is frequently marred by the devs' sadistic, spiteful attempts at making life difficult for you. You want to get a power save to import into the next game in the franchise? We'll make it that the point of import is hours before the end of the game. So you'll have to replay hours of the game and watch unskippable cutscenese over and over again if you want that perfect save files.Some games feel like a labor of love. Both Banner Saga games feel like labor of spite. Spite towards Stoic's own fanbase. As you play the game you never feel appreciate. You feel like a sucker sticking out throughout the deliberate abuse the devs hurl your way. Because they want to be ""different"".Play the game game only because you want a genuine challenge, or if you really like viking mythologies; don't play the game because you want to support indie gaming. Stoic won't thank you for it. And it showed.			"

Ehmm... not, of course. Half of scenario is taken directly from other fantasy worlds/scandinavian mythology/greek mythology (here such combination of idiotic...);2) Wonderful gameplay? Haha, no again. Classical ""Press X to win"". Very easy and casual battle system. Developers have not heard about ""King's Bounty"", ""Disciples"", ""Heroes of might and magic"" series? Then I am not surprised...3) Beautiful graphics? Yes, here I agree. But why do developers make silly and banal game, if they can make the average quality of cartoons? Developers are jealous of the success of ""Life is strange""? Excellent!! Let then do cartoons, but not the game.My rating: 4.5/10. I add more information in the review later...			"

												Finished the first one in like 2 days and felt gutted by the ending. But couldn't wait for the second one. Imported my save game and finished this also in like 2 days and again felt gutted. The Banner Saga tells an excellent story, made me care about the characters and comes with a great combat system.Highly recommended for fans of turn based tactics, grand viking sagas and rpgs.			"

												The Banner Saga 2 is a sequel to The Banner Saga (obviously). If you played the first one you know what to expect but for everyone else: You lead a caravan of people from A to B and as the leader of this group you face tough decisions which influence your caravan and you.A few good and bad things about the game in my opinion:+ fantastic story+ great setting. I really like the nordic theme with the mythology woven through it+ decision making which change the story in some way- turn based combat (I'm more of the fps kind of games)- sometimes a bit slow (it has to do with the combat for me)- it got the feel of a mobile game, especially the menu.- is a sequel and doesn't finish the story! (there will be a The Banner Saga 3)conclusion:If you like a good story and don't mind the game to be a bit slow sometimes, buy this (but play the first one!). If you liked the first one, why are you still reading?			"

												I have never played the first one but it welcomes me with open arms then hurled me into an amazing adventure. What makes this game compelling even to new players is the feeling in an original story that has interesting characters to care, use or hate. The other amazing part of the game is managing your resources and time to prepare for anything ahead. The Norse lore is quite fascinating and is well integrated to the livelihood/power/pride of the people living in it. Each chapter gives a challenge to the player and helps them explore new ways to enjoy a fight. Now for the cons I mainly have gripes on a few issues like the training portions in which they have glitches of disregarding objectives or War Horn is not responding, even in normal mode you may gain 7 waves of skulking minions, some choices for outside assistance like side archers are not helpful and some of the conversation choices are just going to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off(applicable on both genders). The Banner Saga 2 as a whole is a great strategic game, cool Nordic lore and compelling combat with interesting mechanics that aren’t hard to learn or make new strategies of your own.Pros + Fun turn-based strategy + Interesting characters + Compelling story + Cool art and epic soundtrackCons- Useless assets- Few glitches			"

												Great game! Felt a bit shorter then the first game imo but the story was alot more intense. There's one downside to the game when you transfer your save from the first game. Rooks/Alette's caravan will have very overpowered characters whereas Bolverk's caravan is just a fricking pain. Characters are underleveled and you're thrown against very powerfull foes. It's a real struggle to level that caravan and I found it very frustrating. Rook's caravan in the first game feels like a walk in the park in comparison to Bolverk's caravan.Overall, the story is captivating and immensely strong and I'm looking forward to the third game!

												Major upgrade in terms of gameplay from its predecessor, and story is completely enthralling.

												The Good:This game has a gorgeous aesthetic, and a great style to it. The combat is decent, but that's not the main reason you'd want to buy the game (though it does have some interesting mechanics). The story is really what drives the game, and in comparison to its predecessor, it easily matches or equals it. My recommendation would be to not skip the 1st game, although you have the option to do so. I quite enjoyed the story that Banner Saga is telling, and I look forward to the conclusion. The universe is a vibrant blend of fanciful Norse Myth, and it is a great setting for this tale.The Bad:One of my main issues with this sequel(and I think the developers are aware of some of these), are inconsistancies between choices in the previous game and dialogue in this one. Another shortcoming is the lack of reaction/punishment for letting your caravan starve/die. There are few repurcussions or character reactions, and it kind of wrecks the tone when you've accidentally killed most of your party and yet they still act as if you're a great hero who saved everyone. It feels as if they could have done more with the choice mechanics and the party mechanics, as the storytelling is really this game's strongpoint. The combat is not able to carry the game on it's own, and could have been improved by additional features.Overall:Wonderful art and story, but could have been improved in some areas. I still like it, and would recommend to those who like plot-driven games.			"

												So, what to say?I've played the first Banner Saga on iOS and it was BRILLIANT! Though, I wondered, could they improve on the sequel?Well, the answer is an absolute YES!I'm too lazy to actually write a long♥♥♥♥♥review so I'll just list in Pros, Neutrals and Cons.PROS:+SO MUCH MORE VARIETY! (More enemies and monsters, different landscapes, more heroes and classes...)+Fantastic story, though sometimes it may be a bit confusing or the kind of  a ""Wtf is going on?"" feeling comes now and then, which isn't BAD in my opinion.+Choices truly matter and impact on what is coming next.+Very replayable! +Great tactical combat!+You can import the first Banner Saga into this game!NEUTRAL:-+There is more voice acting which is just great! Although, most of it comes only in cutscenes, which don't happen so often. That kind of sucks but it is still better than nothing, right?-+Found it quite hard to level up a character to rank 10 as renown is quite uncommon (Depending on your choices) as you use most of it on supplies (which is important to make sure your clan doesn't starve and also keeping your morale in check).-+Ended well for such a short game, didn't leave you completely hanging over a cliff, and well enough to keep you curious.CONS:-You can't save them all.-All choices don't matter as some events in the story NEED to happen. (Very few though)-Hard to catch up if you haven't played the first game. They did make a recap which definitely did clear some stuff, but some characters you got from the first game will leave you confused in The Banner Saga 2. ""Who the hell is this guy I'm talking to?""-VERY short! I finished my first playthrough in 8 hours.VERDICT:An amazing hand-drawn game with one of the best stories I have ever seen and played, great narrative and overall gameplay!8.5/10			"

												A worthy successor, BS2 has not only surprised me with its climaxes, very intricate storytelling and even harder choices to make - but has made me believe kickstarters have the potential of creating games way superior to Topselling games. This is one piece of art that excels even further in how you feel the consequences of your choices in a harsh world that is about to break. The game has developped even more skills, classes, races and enemies. Soundtracks still drive you mad with anxiety and tention while trying to win battles on Hard difficulty. At first they feel strange...but then, before you notice, it's all there, filling you with intense emotions as you try to fight for the survival of your people. I will return here with loose comments about this game ending. So far, 1/3 of Banner Saga kept me up and craving to play it every ♥♥♥♥ing time!A 10/10. I want the next part of this story right now.

Beautifully animated and well-told story with decent characterization for a game with almost no spoken dialogue. The only really big cons are how short it is (took me 8 hours to beat on normal) and a complete lack of diversty in terms of maps/levels -- they are all flat plains with the occasional barricade thrown in.

												The Banner Saga team seemed to take all the criticism from the first game and fix all the flaws that inititally turned me off from the first game (mind you, the first game I liked a lot). This time around your choices not only seemed to have a bigger impact, but it did have a bigger impact. All the little choices determined whether you got clansmen or they died/left, you could convert your clansmen into fighters, clansmen could forage for food, characters that left/died in your first game died, and the ones that stayed alive fought and had dialogue in this second game. Immersion and plot is amazing, per usual.TL;DR: If you liked the first one, this direct sequel would make you very pleased.			"

												An excellent follow up to the first game which keeps the original’s solid core while making small, logical improvements. The narrative is truly outstanding and the depressing struggles the characters face really impress upon you the story’s assertion that “the world is breaking”. Combat has been made more engaging by providing a greater variety of enemies and abilities, along with some extra optional tutorials which highlight a bunch of clever new strategies.The only negative I have is that some moments during the story are not presented clearly enough, and so their dramatic impact is not significantly felt. There’s also the inevitable issue that, being the middle instalment of a trilogy, this game’s story raises more questions than answers. Still, this tale stands head and shoulders above most others and truly lives up to the definition of the word “saga”.			"

												While I could find little to fault in the first Banner Saga, there are a few great new features in 2:New enemies types and a survival mode invigorate combat. In order to follow all the branching paths I played through the first one many times and by my fourth run combat was a daze of clicks  between travel.With survival mode’s high stakes and the campaign’s new monsters, hero abilities and characters every choice felt decisive. The story mode on the other hand was much easier that in the first. Even on my later runs in BS 1 my caravan came dangerously close to starvation and despair. The new forage and training mechanics gave me more freedom to roleplay without worrying about the impact my decision would have on supplies.The Banner Saga 2 is a great continuation to the plot of the first game with some answers to the questions of the first teased and many more questions blatantly throwing themselves at the player.

												   I really wanted to write a funny review, but this game, second in a trilogy, is pretty serious. So, The Banner Saga 2. Damn, what a game. It picks up immediately after the end of the original with the clan continuing on to try and reach Arberrang, the capital of the humans. Of course, the Choices Matter approach is implemented, and your choices do affect the caravan's welfare. Most of the choices may have small aftereffects, but some can seriously come back to haunt you. You will have to sometimes fight for your caravan's good morale, particularly under the caravan of Rook/Alette (which one depends on the choices you made in the first game), which brings me to my next point.   You can start this game off without playing the first Banner Saga, but I highly recommend playing it beforehand for a multitude of reasons. The biggest reason is obviously that you will understand this game much, much better with the help of the first games story, the secondary reason is that the first game is freaking brilliant. If you play the first game beforehand, you can import your save game and continue onwards. This being said, there is an option to start a new game completely from scratch, and you can choose to lead as either Alette or Rook. On the home screen, there is also access to a recap of what happened in the first game. I found this to be useful even as a returning player.   At the end of Chapter 2, the caravan splits, and the mercenaries hired in Boersgard, the Ravens, split with Rook/Alette. Bolverk, the leader of the Ravens, is one of the most well thought out and developed characters in any game I've ever played. The story does feel a little bit like a middle-story, but this is ignorable with the addition of Bolverk as a main character. I think the game really makes Bolverk out as the main character, and I cannot wait to see what awaits Bolverk in the third and final game in this magnificent trilogy. Rook's caravan, meanwhile, goes south and encounters the horseborn. These centaur-like creatures are one of the many added combat bonuses in the second game.   I have played through both games on Normal Difficulty, and I have actually found the first game to be much more difficult, battle-wise. The AI in the second game is not quite as well programmed, but it is more varied and enjoyable which makes the poor programming negligible. Despite the AI, the combat is much better, and sufficiently challenging. I greatly enjoyed the turn-based battles.   A new game-mode has been added, and I have found it to be very enjoyable. Survival Mode has all the characters that you can fight with in story-mode, but once you pick your initial 6 characters, you don't have access to the others unless you recruit them with renown you earn through battle. You then proceed to fight in 40 battles that occured throughout the game. I have found this gamemode to be enjoyable, but also very challenging and PUNISHING. When a character dies, they aren't injured, as in story-mode, but they are DEAD. This is devastating if you have been promoting this character. This causes you to want to recruit a new character after the character is killed. This sufficiently detracts from your renown because for your character to be useful, you must promote them, and they are recruited at level 3. All in all, Survival Mode is a huge added bonus to a game that is already beyond stellar and well worth it's full price.   The art style of the characters and environment is absolutely freaking beautiful. When the credits rolled, despite the absolute mind-freak (yep, there's a cliffhanger!) I just kind of sat there and listened to the music, which was simply beautiful. Every piece of music and art in the game nearly took my breath away, particularly when Bolverk and the Ravens take the underground tunnels to escape from the mountains. Similarly to the first game, you come across many godstones in the game which are still just as beautiful. If you are playing as Rook, you may even find a pleasant surprise awaits you at one of the final Godstones.   Overall, the game is freaking brilliant. I highly recommend it to anyone new or returning to the series. Quick piece of advice, though. If playing on Survival Mode, do not use an item that draws aggro. I made the mistake of doing this and quickly lost my key tank.Art/Music: 10/10Combat: 9.5/10Story: 10/10Survival Mode: 10/10Gameplay: 9/10 (occasionally had a few glitches where I couldn't target certain enemies during combat by clicking on them, so I had to click on their icon)Overall: 9.75/10			"

												Banner Saga 2 might seem like more of the same at first, but improves on it's design in a number of subtle, but important, ways. The story continues to be a masterful display of world building and character moments, while continuing to propel the characters forward, never giving you a chance to be bored.I highly recommend you play Banner Saga 1 first though, as your entire party, their upgrade path and your items are carried over, some of which can even impact your story in interesting little ways.

												If you liked BS 1, you'll more than like BS 2. If you didn't like it, well, I don't think this'll do much to sway you.You play it for the story, which I think is interesting at best and a little dry at worst. I was keeping track of more characters than last time, I was more invested in the story this time as my actions carried over from BS 1 (being who plays the main character) and they do a better job explaining how the morale system works and what the different variety of people in your clan can do (clansmen now gather suplies every so often from the road, so that's a nice touch.)Combat is the same (though you'll get a new selection of classes and heroes to try out like Poets and Horseborn) and the artstyle is basically the same. I will add there are some fully animated cutscenes that are a nice touch, but there are only a handful of them for the REALLY important plot twists. I beat it in 10 hours or so, I'm sure others can do it faster, but I'm satisfied. Already waiting for The Banner Saga 3.			"

												Qualtiy-wise the game is fantastic. However the cliffhanger ending left a sour taste, making the whole thing feel a lot like a ""middle part"" game, similar to Mass Effect 2. And some of the story advancements during character switched felt overwhelming / too advancing.			"

												Let me preface this by saying I LOVED the first entry in The Banner Saga. I have over 80 hours logged on it, gotten every achievement and beaten it at least 5 times. I actually just did a fresh playthrough of TBS1 and I still loved it!The Banner Saga 2 is a DIRECT continuation of the first one. The first thing I noticed when I gained control is I had the exact same resources, clansman, fighters and varl as my imported save. My characters retained the same level and equipment, however it seems like they boosted all your underleveled characters up to level 3.I actually didn't expect this and it took me by surprise. Then again, I wasn't sure what to expect.Everything you liked or disliked about the first Banner Saga is back except everything is a -little- nicer and freshened up a bit!My only real complaint is about the progression system. Now, all your units can level up to level 10 but the problem is, there's no real reason to. The stat caps on your units hasn't increased at all but instead you have two options per maxed stat that can be put into a related perk. The problem is, they are all minute RNG based stats. Chance to avoid damage, critical hit chance, dodge chance, chance to avoid death are a few of the options you are given. Not only this but all of the new equipment seems to follow this design, as well, such as giving you higher tier of these random chances or more other tertiary stats that I couldn't be bothered with.It's no secret that The Banner Saga's combat is just a math battle so giving you more and bigger flat stats on levels and gear might be tough to balance and heavily dependant on how you did in The Banner Saga 1. However, by the end of this instalment, I was swimming in renown and couldn't be bothered to feed it to my units to min-max more. I think the highest level I got a character was maybe 7 and I still did fine.Overall, I'm sad to say that I doubt I'll be finding the same replay value that I did with the first Banner Saga. The ending to this instalment came more sudden and cliffhanger-ey than the last, to the point where it sapped any real urge I had to start another playthrough, anytime soon.Still, I am eager to see the end of this amazing series!Here's to hoping we don't have to wait another two years for the last part of the trilogy!

												The Banner Saga is a beautiful piece of storytelling with a spectacular soundtrack. Seriously, Austin Wintory's score for this sequel and the original frequently appear on my Spotify playlists. The game itself plays like half Oregon Trail, half turn-based RPG which is satisfying and challenging in execution. Again the game is designed to look like an old Disney film (think King Arthur or The Black Cauldron) and the Viking/Norse influences are very realisitic in that, outside of the completely fictional lore and fantasy characters/races, Stoic Games does justice to the appearance, weapons, and general flavor of Viking Age lifestyle.

												The Banner Saga team seemed to take all the criticism from the first game and fix all the flaws that inititally turned me off from the first game (mind you, the first game I liked a lot). This time around your choices not only seemed to have a bigger impact, but it did have a bigger impact. All the little choices determined whether you got clansmen or they died/left, you could convert your clansmen into fighters, clansmen could forage for food, characters that left/died in your first game died, and the ones that stayed alive fought and had dialogue in this second game. Immersion and plot is amazing, per usual.TL;DR: If you liked the first one, this direct sequel would make you very pleased.			"

												The Banner Saga games are some of the best of the last few years. Outstanding art, storytelling, worldbuilding, and music. The ""tactics"" tile-based strategy is engaging (with a bit of a learning curve). The decisions you make throughout the story are challenging and matter. One of the few games I've bought absent a holiday sale. Strong recommendation.			"

												For all of you who enjoy The Banner Saga, its presequel, you will enjoy this game even more.+ Improved mechanics from the previous game+ Great Artwork, if you enjoy and like The Banner Saga artwork you will like this one too+ Great Soundtrack. Especially male and female voice that will sing when you discover godstone. Damn+ Your choices from the previous game matters, and actually it willa ffect on how you will complete this game.+ Unique strategy game, for those of you who want a breath of fresh mechanics+ The story is great. i havent finished it yet, but the lore and whole plot really makes me attached to find out more.- Makes you realise on how bad you are on managing supplies.I really wish that the developer had more budget when creating this game. So they could add more cinematics, and add more voice actors to the characters. i dont say that it is bad. i say it because from that little cinematics and voice on the characters, they really did a great job, its epic, awesome, majestic, and very cinematic.9/10really interested on what the developer will bring next.

												Ever pick up a game and from the start its like talking to an old friend, and by the time your done talking, you look out side, its daylight, your work starts in an hour, and your world feels just a little emptier having left to go to your drab and gray life?This game is fantasy story telling at its greatest, every decision has you asking yourself ""how will my people surfer for my decision?"" ""how will bear thew weight of the collapsing world around me?"" the betrayals are harsh, and the revenge is so much sweeter for it.The game play plays much the same as before, just with so much more. you could almost see the first game as a framework  for a much grater experience in the second game.the ending was a little... disappointing. but then again so was halo 2 in the same respect. an that kinda how this felt, its defiantly the third act in a three part story though, so they leave you hungry for the next installment.

												I suppose that The Banner Saga series can be considered RPGs, but they have very little in common with the most popular titles in that genre. If you are looking for a game in the vein of the Infinity Engine classics, or even other ""strategy RPGs"", I don't know that this scratch that itch.  it is however, a good game with a a very good story.Like the first game, you will be placed in the persons of multiple leaders of small (to large) groups of refugees, warriors, and the giant varls.  Also like the first game, this is not an open world  game and you follow mostly pre-determined paths.  You inject a bit of your own personality during decision making dialog sequences and special events.  Decisions made in the first game affect the experience of the this entry. The decisions throughout the series have had major consequences by the end of the game.I have beaten the game already, which is reare for me these days with a packed work schedule.  The last time I binged on a game like this was The Witcher 3.  Totally different games, but the story kept me hooked and I wanted to see what happened. I could go on for a while, but I want to wrap up with this:  I have already said the game is not like the Inifinity Engine games, and certainly not like The Witcher.  So what does this game remember me of?  Oregon Tail, but with magic.  And combat.			"

The Banner Saga 2 is a direct sequel to its predecessor. The turn based tactics return with a slew of new units and abilities. Riding on some of the choices you made in the previous game, The Banner Saga 2 seeks to continue the epic story, pushing itself to answer old questions and open up new ones. Like the first game, it focuses on managing a caravan full of hungry people and avoiding the onrushing waves of dredge and vagabonds.+It's a flawed, but enjoyable story. I appreciated the first game's knack for great character interaction. It gave you good reason to care for your fellow clansmen; it made me want to keep them alive not just for their combat prowess, but for their company. The Banner Saga 2 mostly delivers on that as well. Many characters from the previous game return, and its interesting to see how they act now that they've been around each other for so long. Unfortunately, the writing feels a bit off in this one. I've encountered several passages of speech that didn't feel like they fit the character. In fact, one of the possible main characters (I won't say who, for the sake of spoilers), just does not fit naturally in their position. The story's attempts to make her seem like a confident leader just never felt right to me. Not to say that she couldn't fit that role, but their choice of tone felt conflicted and wrong. That said, it's a fun experience. There are plenty of encounters and situation that are much better than they were in the first game. The overall story and interactions, however, feel weaker due to incorrect tone and a heaping mound of unanswered questions.+Beautiful environments and animation. Many of the assets from the first game are brought over, mostly for conversation and battle scenes. I had no qualms with this, as there are enough new characters and units to make it feel like a fresh experience. Environments, as usual, are incredible to look at. There is a lot more chaos in the world this time around, and the art does well to reflect on that. Battle-grids are very well made, with lots of additional details thrown in. On the sidelines you'll see enemies rallying each other, homes burning, and other additions that make the battlefield feel alive. There are also more animated cutscenes this time around. All of them are fantastic in execution, though short. It really makes me crave for an animated series. Like the first game, The Banner Saga 2 stands as one of the best looking games around. It improves on the predecessor with more attention to detail, and several new unit types to witness.+Clan management. Oregon Trail style management is a big part of The Banner Saga series. The first game, however, didn't give you many reasons to keep your clansmen alive. There wasn't a real punishment for doing so, other than a slight debuff in fights. It feels much more urgent to keep them alive in the sequel. There are various fights and scenarios where it's necessary to have a good amount of fighters and clansmen to reap the benefits. That, and they made it much easier to keep everyone alive. Now, instead of doing nothing, clansmen will forage for food and keep the caravan afloat. It sparks an interesting dynamic between having clansmen or fighters. Do you want to survive for much longer, or do you want more combat scenario prowess? It makes it worth playing through again to see how your numbers affect your choices. The management system is still quite shallow, but it's an improvement from the first. +Choices are plentiful. This game that's you take charge much more often. There are more encounters in this game, allowing for many outcomes that may be worth replaying. Many choices can be made, and it's enjoyable to see how your company reacts to them. Sometimes it backfires, but it's all in good fun with the style of the game. My only gripe is that there aren't many punishments this time around (at least not in my playthrough). In the first game I had several people die from my choices, but I can't recall any in the sequel. It's much easier to prevent this time around, and I feel that takes away a bit of the fun in it.-Characters aren't as developed. As I said, concerning the plot, there isn't a whole lot of development this time. Even though one of the possible protragonists has never led a caravan before, I never felt the impact of that. Growth seemed nearly instant, as the protagonist makes a whole slew of difficult choices without lingering much on their outcomes. The way the characters scarcely interact makes the plot fly by rather quickly. Everything feels like a rush to get something done, rather than a natural process. Given the situation, this feeling is accurate to what's going on in the story, but it shouldn't be something that hampers the experience. I didn't feel as attached to my group this time around.-The ending. The story feels out of steam already, and the anticlimactic ending did not help it out. I didn't like the ending battle of the first game, but the second game sinks even lower. After finishing it in about one minute, it made me appreciate my struggle with the Bellower in the first one. The final battle didn't feel like an accomplishment for me. All I did was click on the enemy until it fell over. I didn't have to worry about positioning or any other units. It was far too simple for what should be an emotional fight. That, and the plot suddenly ends in a cliffhanger that doesn't make much sense. Due to the lack of answered questions, it left me feeling more frustrated than excited for the third game.VERDICTIf you liked the first game, you may like The Banner Saga 2. If you're new to the series, don't even try playing it. Play the first, then decide if you liked it enough to continue. It's a gorgeous game with a great combat system that's been vastly improved since the first. The story itself isn't terrible, but there are certain points that are definitely weak (especially the ending) enough to hurt the experience. I found it far easier than the first game, so I'd advise playing on a higher difficulty than normal.Give it a shot. I don't think it's as good as the first in terms of story and character development, but the gameplay has certainly improved. The Banner Saga 2 has a lot of issues, but it's worth playing for fans of the series.			"

												I bought and replayed the first part twice, just 2 days before this came out  cause I wanted to know the hype around it and for those rare times that this happens, the Hype was very real. This game series or franchise with it's own unique lore captivated me in such a way that only 'The Song of Ice and Fire' has been able to do until now. I would recommend play the first Banner Saga since it just makes you more invested in the characters, their histories and the lore.Now what bad can I say about this second part? Nothing really comes to mind. The gameplay was more polished and more intense. More new characters giving the player more ways to experiment in the playground. The choices also seemed much more smooth but as impactful as the first one. The Plot in this however trumps the first one by miles. It was so tight, informative and such a delight to be able to play a game with such intense and lore filled story that makes me so angry that I have to wait for like a year before the last part of the trilogy comes out, sad that this game will end soon and excited that I can see what will finally come to pass.Rook, Iver, Bolverk, Attlete, Hakon, Gunnulf, Sigbjorn & Tryggvi are like my new favorite characters I look forward to about knowing how their life ends up after all this. All in all, I am excited for the next installment in this series and hope this turns into a show like 'Game of Thrones' or an epic movie franchise like 'Lord of the Rings'. 10/10 is my rating.			"

												Once again very immersive story and brilliant artwork, a worthy second part, I loved it.One thing though part 2 is much easier then part 1. You get renown with training and your people scavenge for food, the result is not needing to buy food with renown anymore, plus some wins get you loads of renown, so you have a lots to spent on your heroes. This results in them overpowering whatever foe comes their way. I played it normal difficulty since in part 1 starvation always got me some where allong the way but part 2 really needs to be played on a harder level for players who like a bit of a challange.   "

												Not as good as the first game, however it is still excellent overall.The story branches a bit more, and yet leaves you wanting more as it seems to be much shorter/lacking than the original. This game should have been atleast twice the length (I got maybe 10 hours at best) given the $20 price, and the expectations set by the first (I got about 20-25 on the first). In terms of story, impressive and intriguing, although not expanded enough on for this to be considered a full/single ""game""Gameplay has nothing signifigant or new. The horseborn race is at best a new class to work with, and at worst irrelivant depending on your playstyle. This being said, anybody who enjoyed the first game will enjoy the maps on this game. There were some new battlefield objectives besides ""kill everyone"", which was nice. Classes saw more abilities and more dynamic use of skills.Decisions in this game felt much less important overall, and really didn't matter. In a blind playthrough, I lost no units to storyline (in the first game, I lost many as a result of poor decisions). The forage ability of clansman also made managing supplies more or less irrelivant.My biggest let down of this game was the lack of intimidation I felt from the dredge. The first game made me feel threatened by the mass of black, unknown creatures more than any other game or enemy (think a zombie game but more intense). The constant threat and scariness just wasn't there.Overall, it takes on the first game and builds on some aspects, but overall I wouldn't call this ""Banner Saga 2"" so much as ""Banner Saga 1.5"". It left me wanting more especially in terms of story, but has a lot of potential to buildup to an epic ending in Banner Saga 3, if tied togother properly. (if you really enjoyed the first game, this is a good buy. If you we're 50/50 on the first game, watching a youtube series much just be better)			"

												I’m not a hardcore gamer so I almost never buy games just when they’re released. The Banner Saga however was an exception for me. I remember years ago when I still carried my Gameboy Advance SP around with me and one of my favourite games was Final Fantasy Tactics. I loved the fantasy genre and I loved RPGs so it was no surprise that I loved the game. Over the years, I’d been searching for a game that could live up to the standard of Final Fantasy Tactics. And one fine day when I decided to google, I came across the Banner Saga. I was hooked and played hours on end until I completed the game. Despite the flaws that many reviewers pointed out (and which I agree with), I completely overlooked them and thoroughly enjoyed the game. While the game’s strength was in its story, the combat (and levelling) was still good enough for me. The story ended on a rather tragic note but it was well-written nonetheless; someone must sacrifice themselves to save many others. I’d been waiting so long for the sequel that the moment it was released for pre-order, I snapped it up. Not because of the price though (what kind of offer is $2 off anyway?). And I finished it within 2 days (14 hours). While there were many new features, I couldn’t help but feel that the developers were really just taking the first game and slotting in bits and pieces here and there. It felt like taking Banner Saga and aside from the continuation of the story, you were just getting some extra DLC. I didn’t get the first game at full price so I didn’t feel the pinch but now I’m hesitant to get Banner Saga 3 at full price when it comes out. Below is a breakdown of my experience:Overall experience: 7.5/10Caravan management: 3/10You spent probably 50% of your time watching your caravan travel from one point to the other. I guess the devs felt they should make use of this time to engage the player. Besides occasionally feeding your caravan (btw I spent close to nothing buying supplies), you could train your clansmen to become fighters. I didn’t really see the point of doing that and only did it once or twice throughout the whole game. I only remember a couple of moments where the number of fighters came into play and never once did I think: “Damn I should have trained more of them earlier!” More fighters simply means higher consumption of supplies and fewer people to forage (which is a neat feature). In other words, the devs kinda failed at making caravan management a crucial part of the game.Training (in camp): 5/10This was a nice addition to the game. Instead of figuring stuff out through countless battles, you could learn new strategies based on objectives given in this. I thought there was more potential for this part though. I found myself just completing the objectives for the sake of renown. And I got stuck during the training on Bolverk’s side… what makes it worse is that there are no freaking hints so I just gave up.Combat: 7/10Perhaps the most important part of the game since this is where you actually do stuff. Barricades: kinda lame and I didn’t see any point in wasting supplies for it. I only encountered them twice (first and one of the last battles). New enemies entering the battlefield: interesting at first but got annoying later. At least I can get more kills to level up and extra renown. New heroes: definitely a crucial addition to the game that I enjoyed. While my first playthrough used many of the old heroes that I’m familiar with, I am definitely going to try out different strategies during my second playthrough. Bolverk is insane though; it was really fun going on a killing spree using him.Second skill and traits: good addition to the game. Gives you more reason to level up certain characters as well as make them more versatile.Improvements that could be made: I’m quite surprised the devs haven’t figured some of the improvements to make. E.g Flanking damage bonus + direction facing, more terrain types (slowing/damaging/block range attacks/damage or range bonus from higher ground/traps such as minefields)Story: 8/10Some really tough decisions to make throughout the game which is a good thing. Story is still pretty much linear but that’s not all bad because I enjoyed the story. So many unexpected twists where the good guys turn out to POSSIBLY(?!)[\i] be the bad guys.What keeps me from giving a 10 though is the ending of the story. Unlike the first game, the story ended off on a cliff-hanger; it was like suspense for the sake of getting people to buy the next game and I just felt so cheated because there was no conclusion after so many hours. I thought a certain reptile died way too quickly and it was sad to not be able to fight it. The final battle was way too easy and disappointing too. That said, I will still play the last game for the story (to get closure you know). Hoping the devs will make the game even better. "

												If you enjoyed the first game at all, you'll love The Banner Saga 2. Everything the first game did, the sequel perfects. This is probably the best storytelling I've seen in gaming. You'll be completely invested in the world and you'll care about each of the well devolped characters. Bolverk is a fantastic character and his Ravens sometimes overshadow the main group. The gameplay is also improved with a lot more enemy variety and the new race, the Horseborn. It's challenging like the first game, but more balanced. This game is the perfect sequel and will not disappoint fans of the original.			"

There are many great story driven games out right now, but honestly this one is on another level.

												I 100 per cent recommend this game to anyone who has played the first part, and to all those who haven't: get involved in the Banner Saga asap. While the first game became a little repetitive towards the end concerning battles and I kept playing it mostly for the story (which also ended a bit too abruptly for me), part 2 had me at the edge of my seat all the way through. The plot is realy going crazy now and the battles with all the new classes and mechanics make this game considerably more challenging than the first. So needless to say, I used all my spare time and couldn't stop playing until I had rushed through it in a mere two days. This is my only real criticism of the game: it *seems* a bit shorter than the first one, but this might also come from being used to the basic game mechanics due to playing the first part over and over.Nevertheless, I can easily say this game contains some of the greatest content you can get for 20 bucks and I really can't wait until the next installment comes out.

												A great sequel to the original.  If you liked the first, buy this one, you will be pleased.Having said that, I expected the gameplay to be enhanced a bit more. The difficulty for normal has been made a little more tame, making it feel less of a struggle than the first game.  This may be because of the higher character levels, and what feels like a ton of free reknown.  It is nice that your stats/items carry over from the first game.  On normal difficulty, it does not have the same feeling of struggle and defeat as the first game.  If you played the first, consider upping the difficulty from the get go.The gameplay and mechanics are still rock solid, it would have been nice if they added more terrain and heights. How can Final Fantasy Tactics include this over 20 years ago and developers still leave this out?  It would have made the tactics much more diverse.  Archers are underpowered and hobbled.  What is the point of a ranged attacker if they have to get 5 tiles from a fighter?  The ending was not as good as the first game, more of a let down really.  I was surprised that I was seeing credits, rather than more story or the next part of the quest.  All in all it is a great game, but lacks the focus and feeling of a complete episode in the series.

												I Thoroughly enjoyed this game. As much as I enjoy RPG games I find that the epic open world games (Fallout 4, Witcher 3, Skyrim, etc.) tend to become repetitive (quests, side stories, etc) and after a while my interest wanes. I found myself completely engrossed with the choose your own adventure storyline, artwork, RPG elements and combat system of BS and BS2. The length of the game kept things focused and moving along.  I would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys this genre or other who like RPG games but dont want to invest time into large scale RPG games. A couple of things i disliked about Banner Saga 2. Voice overs - I found the recording quality of the opening sequence to be poor, tinny with lots of echo. You could hear the echo from the recording room quite clearly. - The voice over for the character Bolverk seemed out of place to me and a bit forced. The voice did not seem to fit the character. Recording quality was much better in these instances. This could have been better. - I liked the use of narration in BS which was absent in BS2 (if i recall correctly)Bug(?) - The use of willpower and implementation of exertion during combat was a bit buggy. Where is Banner Saga 3! C'mon.... its been like a month already. :P			"

												The Banner Saga 2 takes the original, with its brilliant story, meaningful choices and consequences, deep and engaging characters, and entertaining gameplay, and improves it even further. The tactical combat no longer feels so out of place, and you realy feel like you get to delve much deeper into this fascinating fantasy world. Another thing that was great, was the ability to keep levelling your characters directly from their state as you ended Banner Saga 1. Seeing Egil turn into an insane tank with 20 armour was extremely rewarding. And man, I will never be able to complement the beautiful scenery and art style nearly enough.If you liked the first one, you will like this.Oh, and for me as a Norwegian, its kind of funny to hear them use Scandinavian swear words.

												The Banner Saga 2 is a must-have sequel to the first game - if you enjoyed it, you're going to love this one. Same wonderful art, same wonderful soundtrack composed by Austin Wintory and a plot that will have you at the edge of your seat, cheering for the characters and making hard decisions.Gameplay is super solid and engaging - a turn-based combat where you have to control multiple units, their position in the battlefield being a crucial element to decide whether you win or lose. Each character has a story, and their skills can be honed and improved until they become legendary and make a huge difference in every combat. Still, the game will make you shiver at the sight of some enemies, and some fights have additional mechanics that add a lot of variety.Downsides? I can point out two minor flaws. First, the saving system is a bit confusing, and sometimes it had me reading dialogues quickly because I HAD to get to the next camp where my game would be saved - you just can't pause it in some crucial moments. Second, I experienced some performance issues with the game - and my PC is pretty powerful, I've been playing games like The Division and Witcher 3 and they run just fine. (I want to read this review some yeears from now just to see that this was our benchmark back in the day!)Those minor flaws didn't impact my experience, though. Banner Saga is already one of my favorite videogame franchises ever, the developers deserve all the praise they can get. If you're new to the saga, get the first game too and enjoy hours and hours of exciting fantasy viking adventures in a magical world.			"

												The only reason I keep playing this game is for the story. The story in these games is really epic, compelling, and contains well-thought out lore. They're going for a certain atmosphere and they do a killer job of bringing out that gritty, grim, relaistic viking saga feel. However, I keep on having to convince myself to keep playing because the gameplay is bad. There's just no other way to put it. The intent of this game not having to hit rolls is to make combat soley tactical. I like this idea, however the gameplay mechanics invalidate a lot of the strategy. Because of the way all the stats work, the most effective strategy is to build a super team of all warrior-types, preferably varl (no bards, spellcasters, etc). Have them spec high might, willpower, exertion. Maximize willpower every turn to do as much health damage as possible so that you can one-shot one enemy per turn. I found that playing without this stategy and actually using the armor breaking mechanic or special abilities was a sure way to die. But, using it, I feel like I have a hollow victory because I exploited a flaw and ignored almost every gameplay element. Frankly, it gets old fast. I actually like a tactical experience but this game does not encourage that playstyle. I end up just attacking health with max willpower every turn because it's what works. Moving on, this game also suffers from a lot of glitches. Some skill point assigments don't permanently set, so you just cannot choose those skills. Some abilities don't even trigger properly in combat. This invalidates a lot of builds and playstyles because you're limited to what works.Alot of this game is also in RNG: what random encounters you get, where enemies spawn, where one character's runes pop up, etc. The worst instance of it was a boss battle, wherein the fight's difficulty is largely dependant on the RNG of the boss's spawn point. She either spawns right in the middle of your party where you can whack her to death in one turn, or off in some obscure corner where she can't be attacked while she endlessly ressurects the bad guys. RNG like this can make the game extremely hard or easy. From a story perspective, this fits because the game world is gritty and realistic. On the other hand, it just isn't fun to actually play. As a video game, it needs to make some sacrifices of the story to promote fun and engaging gameplay. That's just how this works. Finally, I have a major issue with the descriptions of various character powers. A lot of them are so poorly worded as to be unclear what they actually do.Overall, the main point I'm trying to get across is that the developers sacrificed a ton of gameplay budget to create an astonishly beautiful story and world, not just in it's coolness, but also in literally how it looks (art assests). I wish they had spent a little more time tweaking the game mechanics so they actually work and are more fun. Either that, or the devs should just write novels. (Which I would read!)As it is, I'm posting this because I don't know if I will finish or not. So far, it's a tentative thumbs up because I'm a reader so I don't mind the game being a glorified e-book.			"

												Compared to the first game, The Banner Saga 2 loses a certain amount of Oregon Trail-ish feeling that came along with random events that always gave some kind of negative no matter your choice, but that also means that the game feels less unfair. Discounting hard difficulty(since I have not completed it yet) maintaining a good amount of supplies and always keeping your caravan in high(green) spirits at the same time is much less difficult, the cost of items generally feel reduced so that you can use your Reknown more freely for buying or leveling. Aside from a few randoms, most items now include a statistic that either emphasizes or helps focus down on new ""talents,"" percent chances for combat related evensts to occur, that heroes can level up once a primary stat has been fully leveled-- instead of the raw statistical upgrading items from the first game.Combat flow feels a bit less static now in terms of the old strategy of wittle down armor and health then kill everything at the end. I can't point my finger at specifically what causes it, but there are times where killing priority targets now lets you have an easier time in a fight. Due to many party members having been leveled often fairly high from the previous game, easier usage of your Reknown, and higher will from an easily maintained morale, battles will usually feel less grueling(except for one, will based fight). A newly introduced race enters your team along with new abilties that allow for different interactionsin a battle, so new strategies can be made as well as some staples from the past game.I liked it, don't really have much else to say. It's supposed to be the 2nd game of 3, so like Halo 2 its ending can feel lacking, leaving you wanting more. They put in some new stuff to help things feel a bit fresh, and overall they made the game more approachable though less challenging. If you liked just playing the first game I'd say it's great. Whatever the case I'm wanting to see the end of this journey, so lets help support this dev team along. "

												Deeply poetic at times, gritty and unforgiving at times, it's as rewarding and unique, as the first installment.Lots of dramatic choices (hell, the whole game can be played from a radically different perspective right from the beginning), lots of jawdropping moments with suspence and stress.Austin Wintory's music is touching as always. Your choices and unique character party from TBS1 can (but not obliged to) be carried on to this game as well -- and all those secondary characters do matter.At least twice I witnessed conversations between the two characters who could have died in TBS1 at certain points - which left me wondering, what those scene would be like, had I made different choices back then?....Also, this game is a symbol of deliverance on promises. :)Was a little worried if they'll keep the shift on actual story and not cheesy cinematics (as trailers boast much more of those than in the TBS-1) -- worried for nothing, they delivered the story and via more gameplay-oriented instruments due to better scripting logic.Was a little worried that new 'extensively scripted' battles would become unbalanced and linear -- worried for nothing, the battles are mostly balanced but in a more implicit and unpredictable ways (like, several waves of enemies or some characters joining-leaving battle in progress etc.)Was a little worried that scripted combat will leave normal 'fair and hardcore' combat unpolished -- worried for nothing, the training tent has kept its sparring mode (as before) + 2 more -- camp-related management mode and challenge mode -- all this actually intertwined with story as well!!

												What an AMAZING game. As a huge fan of the first game I felt it did leave off in a rather odd place and I was so happy that it carried on as near to where 1 ended. I like the addition of new units and the world seems just as harsh as before. If I had one gripe about the entire system, it is a lack of knowing what to expect in the next fight. Sometimes the difficulty goes haywire due to lack of knowledge here but overall this game is borderline perfect.			"

												I really enjoyed this. I just had wrist surgery so I can't use my dominant hand for a couple of weeks, but TBS is possible to play with just one hand as it doesn't require too much input and nothing is time-sensitive. I played through TBS1 and just as I was about to finish, TBS2 was released so thought I'd give it a try... I've loved both games. The story is fantastic and engrossing and the combat is challenging and enjoyable.Specifically for TBS2 I would say that they made the combat a lot more interesting and varied. There are many more types of enemies as well as player characters, plus they have fleshed out the character system so you can spend your points from levelling up either on stats or on other benefits such as adding critical chance, or chance to avoid certain types of attacks which means that you can customise the characters more. I'm pretty sure the game is also longer than TBS1.Highly recommended. If you enjoyed TBS1 then you will enjoy this.			"

The Banner Saga series is a simple, but great, strategy RPG with a mysterious Norse-inspired story in which your choices have repercussions.The gameplay is easy to learn and makes this series a good entry for those looking for a first SRPG experience. For those more experienced with those kind of games, I suggest starting on the hardest difficulty. The story and visuals are what sold me on the series (and this one is even better than the first). I can't wait for the next episode of the Saga to see how the story gets to a conclusion.Worth every cent and more!			"

												I bought and replayed the first part twice, just 2 days before this came out  cause I wanted to know the hype around it and for those rare times that this happens, the Hype was very real. This game series or franchise with it's own unique lore captivated me in such a way that only 'The Song of Ice and Fire' has been able to do until now. I would recommend play the first Banner Saga since it just makes you more invested in the characters, their histories and the lore.Now what bad can I say about this second part? Nothing really comes to mind. The gameplay was more polished and more intense. More new characters giving the player more ways to experiment in the playground. The choices also seemed much more smooth but as impactful as the first one. The Plot in this however trumps the first one by miles. It was so tight, informative and such a delight to be able to play a game with such intense and lore filled story that makes me so angry that I have to wait for like a year before the last part of the trilogy comes out, sad that this game will end soon and excited that I can see what will finally come to pass.Rook, Iver, Bolverk, Attlete, Hakon, Gunnulf, Sigbjorn & Tryggvi are like my new favorite characters I look forward to about knowing how their life ends up after all this. All in all, I am excited for the next installment in this series and hope this turns into a show like 'Game of Thrones' or an epic movie franchise like 'Lord of the Rings'. 10/10 is my rating.			"

												The Banner Saga 2 is a great sequel! It improves on the first game in almost every way. More voice acting and cutscenes, more combat classes and abilities, more characters, and much more dynamic encounters. Basically if you loved the first game but thought it was a bit shallow, this game will make you VERY happy. That being said, I would reccomend you play the first game before this one. While this one is technically superior, you will not fully appreciate a lot of the characters and parts of the story unless you play the first game. This game is a sequel in the truest sense: It literally picks up right where the last game ended without missing a beat. I played through the first game shortly before this one and with the save game import, I sometimes forget I am playing a new game.			"

Renown being the one I speak about, though clansmen can forage, that which they obtain and the rate at which they do is almost negligible. I enjoy the additional objectives in some missions, but it seemed that pursuing them didn’t reward you as much as just killing all the other enemies. The story is pretty good, hopefully in the next one there will be more interactions between the characters and more meaningful talents.			"

												I can't recommend this game enough.  This game expands on all that was great about the first game (the setting, the story, the nuanced characters), and improves upon that which was mediocre.If you liked the last game, there is absolutely no reason not to get its sequel.  If you found that combat in the first game was monotonous, that is greatly improved in this game, with much more abilities, stats, and enemies. "

												 Wow, Ok I have just finished The Banner Saga 2 and wow what a journey! Do you need to have played the first one? Yes I do believe so, you will seriously miss out on lore and back story for the characters if you don’t! Not to mention your choices from the first game are carried over. This game has made some great improvements most notably for myself is the foraging system. In the first game you had to buy supplies with renown which was also required to level up, you had to balance on the fine line of ‘keeping your people alive?’ or ‘levelling up to win battles’ Now while you do still need to buy supplies your clansmen now go out and forage while on the path which is a massive help. There are also new a new species, new enemies and hazards in the battlefields now which makes the battles more interesting. The story continues on from the last game and more is revealed and hinted at as to why the world is breaking. But the game is left on a massive cliff-hanger so gosh darn it I can’t wait for the third game! Please don’t let it be in two years… The music is again beautiful and atmospheric, I made sure to purchase the special edition so I own the OST. The art is again just magnificent and makes me desperately want an official art book. HINT HINT stoic!This game is worth the asking price, I have no regrets. Though it did feel a little shorter than the first one, however I’m not entirely sure if it is because this one is shorter or rather the final boss in the previous one took many many many retries….Once again the developers have released a brilliant game and have made me a devoted fan for life! Thanks for a great experience, can’t wait for the next one! "

												A difficult tactical game with the story being heavily influenced by the Game of Thrones TV series. This game has a pretty in depth story.  There are some choices that can be made where it may seem like a good idea now but later on could be a bad decision.  Another unique and interesting mechanice is now you have to take care of a caravan of migrants containing both your soldiers and families.  If morale is high or low, it effects your tactical battles by giving you some positive or negative boosters to combat.  There are even decisions that you have to make during your travels that will effect this as well.The tactical gameplay is pretty tough at first.  However once you get used to the idea of how things work, you should be able to get through the battles without too much of an issue. The graphics are all hand-drawn images and look spectacular. Game can be finished around 15 hours and is the 2nd of a 3 part trilogy release.			"

												Great continuation of the first game. Combat has been expanded with a bunch of new classes and abilities, in addition to a a perk system that lets you further specialize your characters. The writing and art are still great, though the story definitely feels less self-contained than the first game. Banner Saga 2 is very much the middle chapter of a 3-chapter story.If you liked the first game, Banner Saga 2 is a no-brainer. If you didn't, Banner Saga 2 probably won't change your mind. If you haven't played the first game, I highly recommend playing that first. Like Mass Effect, this is a series designed to be played from the start.			"

												As soon as I finished playing TB 1 I mustered up enough money to pre-order this game.  It was very worth it.  The game play was not unlike the first game, and it's nice to be able to import your previous saves if you've played the first game.  The art work and the soundtrack are beautiful and really add to the whole experience.  I was a bit disappointed about how many cliffhangers this game left open but I guess that just leave room for a third and I'm looking forward to that.  Over all, this game is a lot like the first with a unique story that relies on your choices to keep you caravan alive.  If you like the first game, don't hesitate to buy this. 10/10.			"

												A fantastic game, The Banner Saga 2 definitely lives up to the expectations that it has set during TBS1. The visuals, the music, the gameplay has not changed much since then, but it is the good kind of retention and not just change for the sake of change.If I have one problem with this game, it will be, surprisingly, the narrative. While TBS1 executes this nicely, TBS2 provides more confusion with little sense of accomplishment. For example, the telling of tales between Alette/Rook and Bolverk, as compared to TBS1's Rook and Bolverk didn't work nearly as good as expected. If I have to say why, it will be the pacing I think. During TBS1, both protagonists fight their way through with different objectives, experienced increasingly desperate battles (yeah, TBS2 doesn't feel nearly as desperate) that eventually end up in epic moments like the defense of the Varl Kingdom, and later in a do-or-die war against Bellower.Here, Alette's (I have not played as Rook yet) journey consisted of far smaller consequences because the Bellower threat is gone, and she's kinda on the path towards queenship or something? I can understand that this is kind of the calm before the storm, but all the same, I kind of imagined this to be like Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn levels of despair, but despite the world literally breaking... this doesn't.But if Alette's journey felt just okay, then Bolverk's is truly subpar. I'm going for a good-person-route, so my choices are going to be more amiable than tyrannical. But from the beginning to the end Bolverk felt - is - a puppet to the Menders, first by Juno and later by Zefr (and inside him, a spoiler-ish character I won't mention). His route felt more like a lesson on 'sometimes, life will screw you from the back, and the front, and through your ears and later literally your brain because you know, screw you one more time?'. Not exactly the best of experience to say the least. The shield maiden Folka would probably make a better protagonist for this storyline; where you play as her trying to influence Bolverk into making the right decisions. And the menders, god, the menders. I get the menders are supposed to be Shannara levels of secretive and manipulative and despair, but this really doesn't need to be inflicted on the players as well. What is going on? We went from 'we are here to aid you to fight against the darkness' to 'we are actually responsible for it, but we ain't gonna tell you anything just because' to 'actually I'm superman capable of lightning to death the God-like thing that's been plaguing us all' then 'NOW we're going to beat back the darkness just give us a sec to raid our old homes' and finally... finally what? I don't get the ending. I don't get Juno's thinking. I don't get what Eyvind's trying to do, I'm really disappointed we don't get to see a council of menders (only 1 dude on screen because...?) and their inner workings, I'm disappointed we don't get to FIGHT a council of menders, and most of all I'm disappointed the final 'boss' battle is a reaaaaaaaaaaally easy 1 on 1 between Iver and Bolverk. I even purposely lightning Bolverk until his death 1 HP by 1 HP because I thought that is the objective, but unless I'm mistaken even if I outright brawl him to death without a single lightning he'll still live. I have no choice but to admit that this part of TBS2 is very disappointing. I'm sorry.That being said, this is still a fantastic game. Maybe it felt a bit short - or should I say, things are running at a more leisurely pace - and I personally think that starting TBS2 with a fresh state rather than loading from TBS 1 maaaaaaaaay just help retain that despair level I so enjoyed in TBS, but still. It's a great game. I did not regret a second playing this game. Keep it up, Stoic Studio!			"

												The Banner Saga 2 bears the same merits and flaws as its predecessor. All the new features, including new classes, talents, skills, and level dynamics, are very carefully thought and well crafted. However, the pacing in TBS 2 feels even more rushed comparing to the first installment, which compromises the fun of character development and limits the opportunity of experimenting different strategy combinations in combat. Anyway, it's a great tactical RPG with lots of choices (though not all of them are interesting). Love the game, hate the cliffhanger ending. Anyone who appreciates the original TBS should defintely play this one. Obligatory.PS: The game is impressively touch/pen friendly, I played it on a surface book mainly using touch screen and had a blast how intuitive the control felt.			"

You'll be completely invested in the world and you'll care about each of the well devolped characters. Bolverk is a fantastic character and his Ravens sometimes overshadow the main group. The gameplay is also improved with a lot more enemy variety and the new race, the Horseborn. It's challenging like the first game, but more balanced. This game is the perfect sequel and will not disappoint fans of the original.			"

												Found it hard to decide but end up leaning towards positive. The story is still quite good.There have been some great improvements, like the training feature being added to, being able to further improve stats with a choice of directions and a choice of abilities, and more. Also some interesting new characters.A lot of the stuff about the first one that I liked are still there - such as a really surprisingly enjoyable combat system.HOWEVER:The story felt very hollow compared to the first one. In the first game I found myself very deeply invested in a lot of the characters and their motivations, but in this one it felt like the devs hadn't really bothered to tell the stories of the characters further, it just felt very half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in that respect. Also, a lot of the heroes just felt so pointless. There's too many of them, some of them never say anything and you end up never using most of them for fights because you don't level them up. Although the story did split in two directions, I felt like it could have done with having more storylines to allow a longer game with more diversity, and paying more attention to more heroes.Also, a lot of the time, especially towards the end, I was very confused, and the final battle and actual end was so unsatisfying, confusing, and left too much up in the air. If the devs delay release of the next one as long as they did this one, I'll have the same problem as I did this time of being totally unable to remember 80% of what happened, and being even more confused!And also, having fighters in the caravan felt pointless as there were no big battles like in the first one.OVERALLDespite all my complaining, it is still a great game, and the issues, particularly with the story, only come because I'm comparing them to an amazing first game and its really captivating story. So, although slightly disappointing after the original, I still had a lot of fun playing this game and will definitely stick with the series.			"

												Overall Rating based of normal difficulty: 4 out of 5TL;Dr - The game is vastly more expansive and innovative over the first banner saga, more mechanics, more lore, but even more to be wanting.New: Lessons to earn money and train your herd to a fighting force. More races and unit classes to be met. Even more future decisions to be made.Removed: War planning, very punishing gameplay.Story-5/5 Gameplay-4.5/5Pacing-3.5/5Graphics-5/5 (Can't add more sadly for this beautifuly drawn out figures and backgrounds)Pros- The game is worked on by very dedicated people, meaning you'll feel all of their time taken to write out the story and draw out individual scenes throughout the game. Without spoiling too much the story they have based off of Norse mythology is most likely leading up to a 3rd game in the near future and I can't wait. The gameplay was improved upon making abilities more intuitive upon interaction compared to last banner saga.Cons- Their pacing is quite a bit varied amongst the game once going throughout the story of both, the first one was very quick and desperation due to rise of a huge threat, and this one is basically a huge slow slide down meaning it's mainly easy to get to the end of the game. Also compared to the last game, you aren't really punished for bad decisions in this game compared to last game making the game that much easier. Also once you find a certain strategy it's hard to beat, especially with certain units able to abuse AI or able to just one shot almost any unit. My main complaint is the AI aren't the smartest beings but that doesn't make the game unplayable, just a bit easier to cheese.			"

												The Banner Saga 2 continues the engaging story of its predecessor with improvements to almost all aspects of the game. Once again the gorgeous art style evokes a feeling of purity and beauty, yet in this second installment there is a clear feeling of loss and danger that comes with it. As you pass through the world, it gives one pangs of sorrow, because it's clear that the darkness is coming to destroy all that is lovely.To begin, THE SOUNDTRACK ALONE IS WORTH THE MONEY! Austin Wintory (composer of Journey, flOw, Horn, The Banner Saga, and many more) does an exceptional job once again building the perfect rugged and fierce atmosphere for this mystical Nordic landscape. The music fits the brutality of war; blaring horns bombard the listener in fight sequences, and in the time between fights, the soundtrack helps keep tension high. Soulful performances by the vocal soloists tie everything together perfectly. This product is more of a story than a videogame, and you truly feel like your decisions have weight. The storyline is great-- major props to the writers for creating such a well crafted experience. There is no right decision at any fork in the road, and many times along the journey you will regret your choices. It is virtually impossible to finish this game without questioning some moves you had to make, but that is part of the beauty.The combat system is not too challenging, but at times thinking on your feet and making sacrifices is going to be required. You are challenged to take on the personality of your character and do not only what you want to do, but also what your character is able do while keeping a good reputation. There are consequences for being too ruthless, but also for being overly-soft or lenient. You have to strike a balance.In my opinion, the most important thing to keep in mind while playing this game is that it is just ONE part of a MULTIPLE part series, and should be treated as such! Do not go in expecting closure at the end, or even a perfect story-arch. What you get is part of an incredible journey, one that isnt too common in games. I STRONGLY recommend this game, the previous game, and any future games in this series. On their own, each game may not be a feature-length experience and game, but when put together, you get a 30+ hour adventure that is unforgettable. I can't wait for The Banner Saga 3!			"

												The Banner Saga 2 continues the story from the first game with a whole host of new additions...Here's a simple pro's and con's list!Pro's -  Much more variety in enemies to fight-  More spells and abilities to use in combat-  A new and interesting race - The Horseborn-  Much easier to manage your caravan from starvation (your clansmen will forage for supplies now)-  And of course all the random events and hard choices you had to make in the first game are still waiting for you!-  Lastly, the art style is done quite well...and the animation and voice acting is quite good also. Oh, and of course the muisc as well!Con's-  The game is shorter than the first one (took me only about 10 hours...and that's without skipping convo's and what not)-  The second caravan you will control in the game can be a bit harder to manage (very few ranged units and items to use)-  Somewhat of an annoying cliffhanger ending-  And lastly, some of the training missions that you will get are a bit on the hard side (especially the last one with Bolverk's team)All in all though...the Banner Saga 2 is quite an improvement over the first game.  It is a title worthy of your time and the price isn't too bad either...Just realize it's a bit short if you are only planning to play through it once (but really, you should play through it twice...once with a Alette and once with Rook)8.75 out of 10 (Very good!)

												The Oregon Trail meets Choose Your Own Adventure, meets a Viking Game of Thrones, meets one of the best turn based strategy games on the market...this is Banner Saga 2. Like a good book, this game was hard to quit. I was totally engrossed from start to end. It can be played as a standalone, but boy are you missing out by not picking up the first installment. The second game improves upon just about every aspect of the first without changing too much. The devs have struck a fine balance and churned out a sequel worthy of praise. Most decisions change the game, while some are scripted to keep the story moving. Most consequences of wrong decisions lead to poor clan morale which makes combat a tad more difficult. While the balance of those decisions affect which characters you will have in your party and which ones live, leave or die; which alters some parts of the story but are more impactful in the turn based combat/strategy portion of the game. The sound and music is top notch, the writing excellent, and visuals are fanastic. The voice acting is good in the small sections we get it in, but you'll be reading a ton in between battles. The writing is great, and most everything written has purpose...so it really is enjoyable. Check out videos before buying, but if you like what you see, I strongly suggest picking up the first game. If you don't you really will be missing out. I promise, you'll feel far more attached to the characters and their plight if you do. Thumbs way up for the Banner Saga 1 and 2!			"

												honestly, what i enjoyed about the original banner saga is delivered in spades here in banner saga 2. i HIGHLY recommend a blind (don't look anything up) playthrough your first run, looking things up for more min-maxed runs the second or third time through. this game is a solid 9-10 for me. my only complaint or concern would be a better understanding of how my characters are going to develop, though, after 1 playthrough you pretty much know all of the abilities.

												This is a wonderful continuation of where you last left off with the funeral of the Brave Sundr-Slayer, if you liked the last one you'll like this one plain and simple.There is many new mechanics, troop types, level cap, terrain types etc. And it's beautifully done inch by inch so as to not overwhelm you with the changes. Choices you made from the very beginning **Hint Hint**Better have kept Eirik, you can get a ****ing bear with him! **Hint Hint** come to impact you in different stages throughout this game and it's very satisfying when you feel you made the right one as a result. Difficulty is well done as you can choose a great many times whether or not to fight someone and this is nice because you can always do it to train and possibly get more items or people but if you can't be bothered or are hurtin then it's not overly punishing as their are many opportunities to fight and train throughout.Their is a renown reward for fist time achievements such as 5 kills with any specific class and this is very helpful for first time playthroughs, it gives you a compensary edge for learning mistakes, but makes it a real breeze if you played the first game a fair bit.With the caravan now whenever you join people they will either be a fighter, clansman or varl. Your charcters are also always included in the counters for one of these 3. It's a nice idea and I really liked it, the idea is to find a nice ratio of balancing fighters with clansman and grabbing every single varl under the never setting sun that you can. The fighters and varl protect the clansman whenever you fight and the clansman will forage for supplies periodically and consume less supplies then the fighters. That's about the end of it, there are certain checks and events that tend to occur depending on how many you have of fighters/clansman and their ratio. An example being fighters on boats, this is a bad idea, don't do it. All in all it's a wonderful game i'd say, with great replayability I just beat it with my first continuation playthrough with Rook and have gotten half way through with my second as Alette.			"

												Great story that leaves me longing for the conclusion. Combat is pretty much unchanged from the first part, but it allows for a higher level cap, which still avoids a terrible power creep: The max base stats are unchanged (afair) from the first game, but once a stat is maxed out, a proc chance can be chosen from. A bunch of new classes and even a new race keep things fresh. The character are very well fleshed out, the writing is superb, the art style is, if anything, better than TBS1 - a few more sections are voiced and there are a handful of beautifully animated cutscenes.

												Once again very immersive story and brilliant artwork, a worthy second part, I loved it.One thing though part 2 is much easier then part 1. You get renown with training and your people scavenge for food, the result is not needing to buy food with renown anymore, plus some wins get you loads of renown, so you have a lots to spent on your heroes. This results in them overpowering whatever foe comes their way. I played it normal difficulty since in part 1 starvation always got me some where allong the way but part 2 really needs to be played on a harder level for players who like a bit of a challange.   "

												I suppose that The Banner Saga series can be considered RPGs, but they have very little in common with the most popular titles in that genre. If you are looking for a game in the vein of the Infinity Engine classics, or even other ""strategy RPGs"", I don't know that this scratch that itch.  it is however, a good game with a a very good story.Like the first game, you will be placed in the persons of multiple leaders of small (to large) groups of refugees, warriors, and the giant varls.  Also like the first game, this is not an open world  game and you follow mostly pre-determined paths.  You inject a bit of your own personality during decision making dialog sequences and special events.  Decisions made in the first game affect the experience of the this entry. The decisions throughout the series have had major consequences by the end of the game.I have beaten the game already, which is reare for me these days with a packed work schedule.  The last time I binged on a game like this was The Witcher 3.  Totally different games, but the story kept me hooked and I wanted to see what happened. I could go on for a while, but I want to wrap up with this:  I have already said the game is not like the Inifinity Engine games, and certainly not like The Witcher.  So what does this game remember me of?  Oregon Tail, but with magic.  And combat.			"

												I 100 per cent recommend this game to anyone who has played the first part, and to all those who haven't: get involved in the Banner Saga asap. While the first game became a little repetitive towards the end concerning battles and I kept playing it mostly for the story (which also ended a bit too abruptly for me), part 2 had me at the edge of my seat all the way through. The plot is realy going crazy now and the battles with all the new classes and mechanics make this game considerably more challenging than the first. So needless to say, I used all my spare time and couldn't stop playing until I had rushed through it in a mere two days. This is my only real criticism of the game: it *seems* a bit shorter than the first one, but this might also come from being used to the basic game mechanics due to playing the first part over and over.Nevertheless, I can easily say this game contains some of the greatest content you can get for 20 bucks and I really can't wait until the next installment comes out.

												Stoic has done it again! The saga continues. The Banner Saga 2 allows players to import the save file from the original game. All the great items you earned, experience you received from killing dredges, and good/bad decisions you made from the first game WILL impact the outcome of this amazing sequel. If some characters are killed off in the original game, they won't return for the sequel. The new leveling system has evolved from the original game. Each character's level cap is increased to 10. Incremental renown requirement for each levelup is lowered from 5 to 2 points in this new game. Feel free to try out different fighters from the rooster because multiple members can be maxed out by chapter 15. Many players have ignored leveling up some characters from the original game for various reasons. These characters will start off as level 3 fighters from the beginning of the sequel, so they are still helpful during combat.The introduction of many new classes have opened up many more possibilities during combat. The poet class can replenish the entire party's will power, the agile horsebreed race can use the hit-and-run tactics, and the berserker class can attack twice during each turn...The introduction of secondary skills and traits allocation have made the combat more engaging, tactical and fun. Versatile fighters can be created by spending extra skill points to specific traits. All characters are relatively balanced. High armor characters might shine in the normal mode, but others' nifty skills might turn the tide of the battle in hard difficulty. Some impressive skills include beast summoning, invisibility, axe throwing, and overwatch. New ranged and buffing enemies have made the game more challenging.Storywise, The Banner Saga 2 suggests there are two sides of the same story. For the first time, players can experience the saga from 2 distinct perspectives: the benevolent rook/alette or the impulsive Bolverk. Betrayal is certainly the reoccuring theme of this fantastic sequel. Sefa the starving archer, the risk-averting king, and the oppressed Canary are not necessarily 100% evil per se. Players can resonate with their perfectly reasonable motivations.  New revelations suggest that dredges are not all evil. Juno can be viewed as a heroic valka or a manipulative instigator. The sequel ends with a major cliffhanger, and player's last decision is not only difficult but also heartbreaking. If you love great storytelling, character development and tactical combat, the Banner Saga 2 will not disappoint!			"

												Found it hard to decide but end up leaning towards positive. The story is still quite good.There have been some great improvements, like the training feature being added to, being able to further improve stats with a choice of directions and a choice of abilities, and more. Also some interesting new characters.A lot of the stuff about the first one that I liked are still there - such as a really surprisingly enjoyable combat system.HOWEVER:The story felt very hollow compared to the first one. In the first game I found myself very deeply invested in a lot of the characters and their motivations, but in this one it felt like the devs hadn't really bothered to tell the stories of the characters further, it just felt very half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in that respect. Also, a lot of the heroes just felt so pointless. There's too many of them, some of them never say anything and you end up never using most of them for fights because you don't level them up. Although the story did split in two directions, I felt like it could have done with having more storylines to allow a longer game with more diversity, and paying more attention to more heroes.Also, a lot of the time, especially towards the end, I was very confused, and the final battle and actual end was so unsatisfying, confusing, and left too much up in the air. If the devs delay release of the next one as long as they did this one, I'll have the same problem as I did this time of being totally unable to remember 80% of what happened, and being even more confused!And also, having fighters in the caravan felt pointless as there were no big battles like in the first one.OVERALLDespite all my complaining, it is still a great game, and the issues, particularly with the story, only come because I'm comparing them to an amazing first game and its really captivating story. So, although slightly disappointing after the original, I still had a lot of fun playing this game and will definitely stick with the series.			"

The poet class can replenish the entire party's will power, the agile horsebreed race can use the hit-and-run tactics, and the berserker class can attack twice during each turn...The introduction of secondary skills and traits allocation have made the combat more engaging, tactical and fun. Versatile fighters can be created by spending extra skill points to specific traits. All characters are relatively balanced. High armor characters might shine in the normal mode, but others' nifty skills might turn the tide of the battle in hard difficulty. Some impressive skills include beast summoning, invisibility, axe throwing, and overwatch. New ranged and buffing enemies have made the game more challenging.Storywise, The Banner Saga 2 suggests there are two sides of the same story. For the first time, players can experience the saga from 2 distinct perspectives: the benevolent rook/alette or the impulsive Bolverk. Betrayal is certainly the reoccuring theme of this fantastic sequel. Sefa the starving archer, the risk-averting king, and the oppressed Canary are not necessarily 100% evil per se. Players can resonate with their perfectly reasonable motivations.  New revelations suggest that dredges are not all evil. Juno can be viewed as a heroic valka or a manipulative instigator. The sequel ends with a major cliffhanger, and player's last decision is not only difficult but also heartbreaking. If you love great storytelling, character development and tactical combat, the Banner Saga 2 will not disappoint!			"

												Banner Saga 2 was a much awaited game, and was well worth the wait. I enjoyed BS1 and played it several times to see how the story would change with each play through. BS2 had the same story elements and WAY more suspense in situations that called for it. The story telling was a hundred fold better and with more vocals and visuals to aid in the overall story.  I recommend this game if * you like a good story* willing to live with the decisions you make in a game* Enjoy laid back games where much thought isnt really required.			"

From a gameplay perspective the core features are still there and several areas have been improved or diversified ( in the case of combat). Long story short it takes the seires forward in every aspect like a proper sequel should and you should go buy it.			"

												One of the best games I played in the past years. It feels like a interacitve book with tactical fights, which challenges you enough to keep your interest. It has been improved well enough and even if there is no progress in the game mechanics, I will be happy to play a third part of this epic saga.The story and the artwork are fantastic and for me, the greatest reason to enjoy this game. For everyone new to it, I highly recomend to play the first part for a much more personal game experience. If the Banner Saga were released in my childhood I probable had gotten addicted to it and if i had children on my own now, I would love to see them playing games like this and not this heartless junkfood thrown at us alle the time.I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.

The lengt of the game is slightly longer than the first one but not too long. The scenery and designs is amazing and the small details is giving me so much enjoyment. I love the short voiceovers and animations when you reach certain places on your journey. The music is fantastic, I listen to the soundtrack of the first game on spotify all the time and the additions in this game is just as good. The small stories in the game, the superb map and the characters all sets the mood. In conclusion: I liked everything about it and I can't wait to play The Banner Saga 3.			"

												The Banner Saga 2 continues the engaging story of its predecessor with improvements to almost all aspects of the game. Once again the gorgeous art style evokes a feeling of purity and beauty, yet in this second installment there is a clear feeling of loss and danger that comes with it. As you pass through the world, it gives one pangs of sorrow, because it's clear that the darkness is coming to destroy all that is lovely.To begin, THE SOUNDTRACK ALONE IS WORTH THE MONEY! Austin Wintory (composer of Journey, flOw, Horn, The Banner Saga, and many more) does an exceptional job once again building the perfect rugged and fierce atmosphere for this mystical Nordic landscape. The music fits the brutality of war; blaring horns bombard the listener in fight sequences, and in the time between fights, the soundtrack helps keep tension high. Soulful performances by the vocal soloists tie everything together perfectly. This product is more of a story than a videogame, and you truly feel like your decisions have weight. The storyline is great-- major props to the writers for creating such a well crafted experience. There is no right decision at any fork in the road, and many times along the journey you will regret your choices. It is virtually impossible to finish this game without questioning some moves you had to make, but that is part of the beauty.The combat system is not too challenging, but at times thinking on your feet and making sacrifices is going to be required. You are challenged to take on the personality of your character and do not only what you want to do, but also what your character is able do while keeping a good reputation. There are consequences for being too ruthless, but also for being overly-soft or lenient. You have to strike a balance.In my opinion, the most important thing to keep in mind while playing this game is that it is just ONE part of a MULTIPLE part series, and should be treated as such! Do not go in expecting closure at the end, or even a perfect story-arch. What you get is part of an incredible journey, one that isnt too common in games. I STRONGLY recommend this game, the previous game, and any future games in this series. On their own, each game may not be a feature-length experience and game, but when put together, you get a 30+ hour adventure that is unforgettable. I can't wait for The Banner Saga 3!			"

The storyline definitely keeps players engrossed and the gameplay will surely attract people who love to come up with strategies in games. New characters introduced keep the game fresh and interesting and it was entertaining to unravel and see them grow in light of the Darkness. All in all, if you are into RPG and strategy games, the BS series will not let you down and it's amazing to see the indie devs making such a good series here. Defo a must buy for me, and already looking forward to the release of BS3!			"

												So, what to say?I've played the first Banner Saga on iOS and it was BRILLIANT! Though, I wondered, could they improve on the sequel?Well, the answer is an absolute YES!I'm too lazy to actually write a long♥♥♥♥♥review so I'll just list in Pros, Neutrals and Cons.PROS:+SO MUCH MORE VARIETY! (More enemies and monsters, different landscapes, more heroes and classes...)+Fantastic story, though sometimes it may be a bit confusing or the kind of  a ""Wtf is going on?"" feeling comes now and then, which isn't BAD in my opinion.+Choices truly matter and impact on what is coming next.+Very replayable! +Great tactical combat!+You can import the first Banner Saga into this game!NEUTRAL:-+There is more voice acting which is just great! Although, most of it comes only in cutscenes, which don't happen so often. That kind of sucks but it is still better than nothing, right?-+Found it quite hard to level up a character to rank 10 as renown is quite uncommon (Depending on your choices) as you use most of it on supplies (which is important to make sure your clan doesn't starve and also keeping your morale in check).-+Ended well for such a short game, didn't leave you completely hanging over a cliff, and well enough to keep you curious.CONS:-You can't save them all.-All choices don't matter as some events in the story NEED to happen. (Very few though)-Hard to catch up if you haven't played the first game. They did make a recap which definitely did clear some stuff, but some characters you got from the first game will leave you confused in The Banner Saga 2. ""Who the hell is this guy I'm talking to?""-VERY short! I finished my first playthrough in 8 hours.VERDICT:An amazing hand-drawn game with one of the best stories I have ever seen and played, great narrative and overall gameplay!8.5/10			"

												Banner saga was an excellent, unique game and BS 2 delivers more of the same. Excellent artwork and voice acting. The story continues directly where the first left off and ends relatively abruptly, it's the typical filler and suffers from being stuck between a fantastic introduction and an epic ending(hopefully) as these sorts of sagas tend to do. Relatively few additions other than character types and classes, but same great tactics base combat. Additionally, still retains the profoundness of the decisions you have to make and the inevitable dealing with the consequences. The biggest change is probably the following of two wagon trains/story lines, while adding variety, I feel takes a bit away from how invested you become in the characters and events of the journey.Still, a fantastic journey, and great game overall.

												It's not often that a game get's better with a second part. While I really liked the first part it felt a little unpolished. I would have loved to mae more decisions and have more fights.  The second saga is a true gem:  it focuses a thte strenghts the first part already had an enhances everything in a wonderful way: better graphics, better fights, better leveling up, more decisions, more background of characters. It's really an itriguing game and it will hopefully be one of the legendary games when it's third and last part concludes the story. I did play the first part right again before the second was released and it's so much better to play them together.			"

												The original Banner Saga was a beautiful game with a mysterious and fascinatingly foreign-but-familiar world, addictive strategic battles, and an engaging, emotional story. Its sequel continues to excel in all of those aspects, while also improving on the overall gameplay experience. If there was one issue I had with The Banner Saga, it was a lack of variety. Environments, while gorgeous, consisted almost entirely of foreboding snowy landscapes. Now there are otherworldly neon caves and colorful, perfume-laced woods, amongst others. A new race of characters rounds out the addition of new factions, new classes, new subclasses, tons of new abilities, and all of the new tactical approaches they entail. This is really just icing on an already delicious cake, however. The Banner Saga 2 is a must-own for anyone who remotely enjoyed its predecessor--and if you haven't touched the original, go try that out too! You don't know what you're missing.			"

												As someone who was obsessed with Valkyria Chronicles and both XCOM 1 and 2, I love this game and the orginal. I would say its one of my favorite games of the past 10 years. At first I was skeptical of the combat as it lacks verticality, taking cover, and all the different ways to attack or defend in XCOM. But they're very different games. To me The Banner Saga, and this sequel, are more like chess. It seems like the developers are telling you, ""use your special power at the right time. Plan ahead. Make them use more attacks, while you take less"".My only criticism is the dialog options. The series has always made me feel like I'm blindly chosing these. If I'm playing as Rook for instance, and I've been reading all his lines, and understand how he would respond, I should be rewarded when I pick the humble yet reluctant leader option. Instead, sometimes the best option/the one that doesn't get a character killed, is the out of left field one. Basically, the dialog makes me feel like I'm flipping a coin. It's like an old school point and click adventure, and that's not a compliment. When the birth of indie games happened a few years ago, and we got Braid, Castle Crashers and Bastion, we then witnessed this wave with everyone and their mother making an indie game hoping it would be the next big hit. This is one that should be. Buy this game.			"

												The Banner Saga 2. Long awaited by myself an I imagined it would be similiar to the first Banner Sage.But it isn't... It is WAY better which is still unthinkable for me. All the great artistic landscapes and charaters show how much love is put into the game.One of my biggest concerns in the Banner Saga 1 was, that you only play lik 6-7 heroes and all the other interesting characters are avoided since they are outleveled. With a clever trick the game ""forces"" you to play a great diversity of characters which makes fight MUCH more interesting than before. You have to look for new tactics and keep balance between the characters. Nontheless you can push a few characters very high.The atmospheric soundtrack brings chills down my spine and I get goosebumps from time to time. Sometimes the pictures and howling winds tell more than 1000 words.The Banner Saga ist one of the best games I have ever played. Developers you can be very, ery proud of yourself!Nontheless I have 2 small concerns:1) Walking in fights is sometimes a pain in the .... The hitbox of the confirmation button is so small that very often another tile is selected and I have to reselect the original tile. It takes the flow out of the fights.2) A voice acting would be evry nice but I can fully understand that implementing that means a lot more efford.So all in all: Buy this game! Play the prequel first and you will have a great and epic time!			"

												Well, the bad news first: There's absolutely nothing different about Banner Saga 2 compared to its predecessor.The good news: It is the same Game! That's how I feel anyways, new chapters to the same game. And considering how great the first one was, this is as high as praise goes. We have the same story revolving around a caravan of people trying to survive a nordic fantasy endtime scenario. We have the same turn-based chess style combat RPG and the effects your outside decisions have in fights. We have the same, lovely graphics that often seem like a hand drawn backdrop from old school disney films. Everything that made the Banner Saga great is still present and expanded upon.If there's one point of critisism, then that, with strong, imported heroes, the game is almost a little too easy. Bellower was a tough fight in part 1, Eyeless, the Sundr in this one, was nothing special if you can deal her damage in turn 1.But it really is everything the first one was with about 20 hours of a new campaign and high replay value. I highly recommend it to any RPG fan.			"

												Back in the days when Kickstarter was the new cool thing, I backed this series not knowing what I was getting into. Boy, am I glad that I did. The Banner Saga 2 is an absolutely stellar game.The gameplay is split into two parts: One one hand you have a ""choose your own adventure""/resource management game and on the other hand, turn-based strategy. The latter uses some clever mechanics to make the gameplay interesting, like how wounded soldiers don't serve much purpose on the battlefield.Told only though dialogue boxes, the story is really fascinating – I'd say it's an improvement compared to The Banner Saga 1 (which also had great storytelling, mind you). What's also really impressive is the fact that a large part of your characters (I'd say about a third) is dynamic meaning that they can die, leave or join depending on your actions.The biggest complaint I have is that after some time, you will know the AI well enough to exploit its patterns. Granted, the game is still difficult! Especially the newly released Survival Mode which I can recommend if you value the tactical battles over the story.If you like strategy game, you're in for a treat. And if you aren't, you might be in for one anyway.			"

												What a great feature to carry over your guys' levels, gear, etc from the 1st game to this one.I love that it quite literally picks up 5 minutes after the 1st game ends.  Perfect!Same great model Banner Saga model; narrative forces unfortunate events on you, you quinch and complain from it, then you dust yourself off and make the best from what you have left.  It's not a model for everyone, especially if you want all the gameplay data and choices presented to you clearly, but it works for the idea behind the game and what these authors are trying to make you feel.Combat is still good and the leveling mechanics/features are upgraded nicely in this game.3 Cheers dev team!

												Major upgrade in terms of gameplay from its predecessor, and story is completely enthralling. Playing the 1st is not necessary, but highly encouraged since you keep your upgraded units strong. Also, the choices you made in the first game carry over into the second. The ending is somewhat questionable in terms of writing, but I will be playing through this game for quite a while.			"

												A worthy successor to the first episode. The Banner Saga series is a simple, but great, strategy RPG with a mysterious Norse-inspired story in which your choices have repercussions.The gameplay is easy to learn and makes this series a good entry for those looking for a first SRPG experience. For those more experienced with those kind of games, I suggest starting on the hardest difficulty. The story and visuals are what sold me on the series (and this one is even better than the first). I can't wait for the next episode of the Saga to see how the story gets to a conclusion.Worth every cent and more!			"

												Combat is complex and difficult, just as before. Your army is much more sizable, and your key characters are stronger than ever. New talents, which are unlocked upon maxing out a stat, provide nuance and chance rolls to an otherwise arithmetic combat calculation. Choices are difficult, carry weight, and both rewarding and punishing. It is a very worthy successor to BS1 and a long hard fought journey in its own right. Perhaps the best praise I can give it is that I fully intend to restart a new game in BS1 right after I finish this and then play through BS2 all over again just so I can apply what I've learned.That said, my suggestion to you: don't try to pick the ""best"" choice. Pick what you feel you would do if you were that character, and be consistent. It's really the most fun that way, and there are rewards either way.			"

												While not as emotionally gripping as the first game, The Banner Saga 2 had me drawn in for the entire time I played the campaign. The combat remains similar with a few new mechanics thrown in and getting renown seems slightly easier. My only downside is that they set up so clearly for a sequel when I thought they easily could have brought the series to a neater end here.			"

												Deeply poetic at times, gritty and unforgiving at times, it's as rewarding and unique, as the first installment.Lots of dramatic choices (hell, the whole game can be played from a radically different perspective right from the beginning), lots of jawdropping moments with suspence and stress.Austin Wintory's music is touching as always. Your choices and unique character party from TBS1 can (but not obliged to) be carried on to this game as well -- and all those secondary characters do matter.At least twice I witnessed conversations between the two characters who could have died in TBS1 at certain points - which left me wondering, what those scene would be like, had I made different choices back then?....Also, this game is a symbol of deliverance on promises. :)Was a little worried if they'll keep the shift on actual story and not cheesy cinematics (as trailers boast much more of those than in the TBS-1) -- worried for nothing, they delivered the story and via more gameplay-oriented instruments due to better scripting logic.Was a little worried that new 'extensively scripted' battles would become unbalanced and linear -- worried for nothing, the battles are mostly balanced but in a more implicit and unpredictable ways (like, several waves of enemies or some characters joining-leaving battle in progress etc.)Was a little worried that scripted combat will leave normal 'fair and hardcore' combat unpolished -- worried for nothing, the training tent has kept its sparring mode (as before) + 2 more -- camp-related management mode and challenge mode -- all this actually intertwined with story as well!!

Both of them a parts of a big awesome experience. Making those tough decisions, whatching your people die from hunger, there is no safe way in the lands of Banner saga. This game has a special vibe to it, with awesome music, drawing style (DAMN YOU STOIC, MAKE A FULL THEATRICAL RELEASE CARTOON ALREADY) and story, story, story... Recommend 100%. One of not so many games that makes you care about what is happening there. It's like reading a good viking novel, except you are in that novel.			"

The addittion of Survival Mode in one of the updates really makes the game for me though. Here some of the core mechanics from the campaign mode have been altered slightly and you play 40 battles one after another with any mix of characters you choose. It adds a great deal of replay abilty to the game.			"

												I don't write reviews. At all. But exceptions have to be made for what is hauntingly amazing.  I loved the first one, but TBS 2 is on another level.Gameplay wise, it's fairly simple to play, but in my experience very difficult to master (I still struggle with *fully completing* one particular boss fight in the game on the hardest difficulty.) Despite the simplicty and challenge, playing the story battles over and over again is always fresh because of the individual heroes' abilities - the mixing and matching of their skillsets and having to give kills to heroes to level them (some need more help than others, of course) brought me closer to the characters, and weren't just pieces I was moving around on a board. And it's inevitable that some heroes will by much more frequently utilised than others, some less, but I have enjoyed TBS 2 to a greater degree by putting myself through the struggle of attempting to use weaker characters - mixing and matching squads of shieldbanger varl with archers, only having human characters armed with shields to form a defensive line and buff stats while restricting movement, or playing with more support characters than slayers. I'm not one to complain or praise visuals because art more often than not is a *different strokes for different folks* thing in my opinion, but the art of TBS 2... I didn't want the game to end when it did, and one of the main reasons why is its visuals. Absolutely stunning by all accounts. While there are few animated scenes with characters moving about, the still depictions of the characters with their written dialogue below are just so fantastically vivid that the words come to life. Bolverk's character is truly out of the screen, for one. The silent moments between Rook and Iver. The chilling stills of Juno. Even simple details like Hakon's speech just fits the way he's so humongously built and towering over even other varl as a slayer in combat. The game can in that regard be enjoyed if played slowly, and the interactions made animate with one's mind.The story. People liken it to Tolkien's universe, or at least from what I've seen in the other reviews. I'd beg to differ to an extent. It is after all based on Norse mythology to my knowledge, especially with the serpent's presence. So, take the carnage of Ragnarok with a Tolkien-esque twist, multiple narrative perspectives from two different caravans (including some ambiguity), and top it off with a tenderness in the moments less tense, very much made possible by the visuals. The moments when the caravan stops to rest, or has simply has to stop because they're too tired to continue. Watching the caravan make its way across the vast lands is a remarkable view and story to be told in itself. Coming across empty houses, battle-scarred villages, forgotten mine shafts, caverns, or even a death march across barren snowlands for a final stand at a ford... this is the story of TBS 2.I bought TBS 1 on a whim just to try out an indie game that looked somewhat promising. The promise that it's delivered is far beyond expectations. It really is a world one can dive into and continuously appreciate if the time is taken or the eye is in awe of. Just get this game for god's sake it really is a bomb it's just wowza.			"

												+ Outstanding game with some improvements on the system from the first game in the series.  +Great characters.+ Gripping story that has a Game of Thrones feel.   No one is safe, which is refreshing in a video game.- Cliffhanger style ending is a let down after the outstanding ending to Banner Saga 1, and has an episodic (also Game of Thrones) feel to it.EDIT EXTRA MINUS: - because Survival Mode was such a monumental waste of my time.  The first 39 battles had tough moments, but were all doable.  Battle 40 is not possible with the team I have chosen.  It makes very little sense for the difficulty in the last battle to be so off-scale with the rest of them.  Frustrating to the point where I almost want to give the game a negative rating.			"

												Gameplay-wise there are no significant changes from the first chapter so this review won't cover that aspect. The game is basically the second part of a trilogy and predictably ends in a cliffhanger. We see more if the world as some of our heroes travel south while the others travel west, in the same parallel storylines structure as the previous game. There is a lot of character, world and plot development, and the more I follow their adventure, the more I get to like the protagonists. It rarely happens to have so many likable, relatable and memorable characters, and the world and plot grows deeper and more interesting at every chapter. I cannot wait to play the third part of this awesome epic saga!			"

												Banner Saga 1 & 2 & 3(probably) have filled a large hole in my heart that was left by Final Fantasy Tactics no longer continuing their series after Grimoire. Wonderful art, cool music (great for hiking in the winter/fall), fun tactics, and interesting decisions that reward and punish you in ways unexpected. A great deal of games boast decision making being a big part of the game fail to do so. Typically they give you just 3 options; one obviously good, one obviously bad, and one neutral and the ending they present is just shows you made the world a better or worse place. In this game you can make a good guy decision and it pays off wonderfully like a new unit or something game changing resource, or nothing at all. Sometimes doing what you think is right ends up with one of your key characters getting his throat slit and never being able to play him again. I have played both Banner Sagas many times in many different ways and it is always rewarding. If you like myth, morals, viking aged warriors, and a game that really pulls you in I highly recommend this and the first one. There is even an online pvp version of this game that for whatever reason isn't publicized as much called Banner Saga Factions. It was released with the first game and hopefully they will update with Bannersaga 2 and 3 mechanics. It's alright but it is free to play.			"

												Like the first one Banner Saga 2 is stunningly good looking, full with superb music and atmosphere!Just love the lore, it is so original and still have nice nordic feeling in it.To me games only annoying aspect was combat. some how it feels better in second game. It was ok in first but now it feels good. Cant say specific reasons as it's been so long from playing the first one.Really peace of art. Those rare gems like Witcher 3 or King of Dragon Pass.So if you liked first one this is even better. Also if you like good story and TBS combat buy both games.Ps. Third and final part of the series is at kickstarter!			"

												Solid turn based game. Good story. Choices that impact the story. A little short.			"

												Definitely start with the first Banner Saga. The best feature of the game is the story and pacing, and it's a better starting after the first game.The gameplay is more polished, but there's a much heavier veer into high fantasy in the story. The caravan gameplay is still not very well developed (you can train Clansmen into fighters but... where are the battles?)Has an uncomfortably sexy centaur in it.Gonna go put some money into the kickstarter for number three. Godspeed, Banner Saga 3!			"

												Well , what to say about this game. It's an unique experience with a bleak story yet, it's one that's hard to turn back on once you start. Truly amazing. The only issue that I had was that sometimes the screen would not pan to where it needed to be during the tactical fights, but this is an inconvience and still perfectly playable. If you like a good story, this is it.			"

												If you play the campaign:- 80% story, 20% action- you're forced to play useless heroes, because ""the story requires so""- heroes are shuffled all the time. You may spend exp on a hero and the next moment he's just gone- not nearly enough exp to lvl your heroes, let alone buying items- rare item loot- nice backgroundsIf you play ""survival mode"":- 99% action, 1% story- you can play any heroes- enough exp to lvl them up- item loot is enough to support any build you want- some battles are a lot more challenging than any of the campaing's, so you have to know what you're doing			"

												The Banner Saga 2 builds on the rich world and story of The Banner Saga. Battles are familiar but new abilities and characters greatly improve and mix up the flow of play to make it interesting throughout. The story is enhanced and enriched from before, with similar decision cruciality in ensuring the survival of your Caravan. If you've played The Banner Saga and loved it, what are you waiting for?

												Good tactic game, especially for its story, characters, arts and ambiance. I really want to see the conclusion in banner saga 3. The game is full of hard choices and epic battles. If you're good in tactical games (which is not really my case), you'll like the battle in normal and difficult mode, even in survival mode. If you're more like me, you'll probably ending to do the battles in easy mode because at some points, it's really ahrd. But it's always fun, beautiful and interesting. It's turned based, and between battles it's more successions of dialogues and choices, so if you're someone who only want fast action, it's not for you. But if you love all that I said before, and want a really original vision of fantasy, then you should definitely buy it ! And do banner saga 1 first, even if this one is better in all points.			"

												Did you like Banner Saga?Yes?Good. Banner Saga 2 is as much a direct sequel as can be expected. A few improvements here and there, though a notable absence of improvements the first game sorely needed (such as being able to undo your movements in tactical combat). It imports your save game directly from Banner Saga 1 and picks up where it left off. This results in you possibly starting out with wildly different parties, Renown (XP) and item layouts. The overarching story is just as obtuse as the first game's, if not more, though what matters is the journey, the Oregon Trail-like traversing of beautiful landscapes and the challenges you find along the way, rather than the obscure main plot. The characters are dry and straightforward, and yet, I don't know how they do it, they manage to give surprising depth to many characters that barely have five spoken lines in the entire game. It's rather heartening.As with the first game, Banner Saga 2 ends on a cliffhanger and rather obvious sequel hook. I have little to complain about this stupendous game. The art is beautiful, the music is stirring, the combat is tactical and fun, the worldbuilding is fascinating. You can be sure I'll grab the third one when it comes out.			"
