												Before we begin let me just say that there's a chicken and the egg paradox here: Nobody wants to buy this game because it's dead, but it's only dead because nobody wants to buy this game. So for those of you who just want to know how active the game is right now, the answer is ""dead as dead can be"". At the time of this review I have successfully completed 14 matches after having ""played"" for 36 hours.If this was a free game then maybe the user population wouldn't such a problem that it is now, but it's not. This game will usually get a 75% discount during major Steam sales, if you see it, buy it. And here's why.Picture League of Legends in space, that's the gist of this game. But there's much more to it that than. There's an overall ship progression that carries over from games that allows your ship to grow more powerful over a period of time. At the end of each match you'll usually get rewarded with augments, weapons, and medals to customize your ship. And you can choose between 4 different skills to take into battle to better fit your playstyle, and as these type of games go you also have an ""ultimate ability"" late game to make that final push towards the enemy HQ easier.There are two main game modes: Conquest and Battlefield. Conquest is the main League mode where each team tries to sweep across the map and smash the opposing HQ. What's really great however is that there's an emphasis on teamwork because there's a shared technology/upgrade pool. You can spend your credits to upgrade yourself OR you can give it to the team and upgrade your faction's capabilities, particularly the strength of your minion ships. Plenty of potential for strong team coordination.There are a total of 6 ships available by defualt and 4 DLC ships with unique mechanics you can purchase that greatly change the playing field. If you're going to get this game might as well opt in for the full bundle and get those 4 ships, at it's 75% discount they'll literally only cost pennies.A quick breatdown of the DLC ships:Science Vessal - First of all this is the only ship to begin at level 2. It has some powerful board manipulating skills including scrambling the enemy's movement and a tractor beam to drag your victims into your team's firing range. It's ultimate is an all consuming blackhole.Support Ship - The ability to drop turrets and repair station on the field is a powerful advantage, the support ship lives up to it's name by being a power tactical asset to your team.The Carrier - Introduces a new squadron mechanic to the game. You are able to launch fighters that allow you to ""hit & run"" from a distance and harass the enemy frontlines.Artillary Ship - Is able to bombard from a distance. Instead of line-or-sight like most ships the special cannon does almost instant damage with it's barrages. Fully upgrading your range will allow you to sit comfortably behind your allies while chipping away at the enemies defences with little worry for your personal safety.Is the game dead? Unfortunately yes. Should you buy it at full price? Probably not. Should you buy it when it's on sale? Hell yes! Should you tell your friends to buy it? Definitely yes!!For those of you who do end up giving this game a try a few quick tips: The majority of the remaining player base is European, so if you want to find a good game chances are you'll need to adjust to their timezone. If you can't find a game you can at least do a PRACTICE MATCH against the computer. (A lot of people complain that they haven't been able to try out all the ships without realizing there's a practice option.) You won't get any experience towards leveling your ship, and you won't get to have any real ship on ship battles, the maps only have minions and turrets. But it's a way to get familiar with your ship without the pressure trying to win.This is a really great game whose only real problem is a lack of players.			"

												It's a shame. This game could be very neat and fun. But it never built any playerbase, and it's only multiplayer, so there's hardly anyone to play with. And the whole 5 people you MIGHT run into playing it out there can't stand new players and are complete jerks(insert curseword here). I've tried to play it multiple times over many months and every attempt when I actually get into a game, the other players spend more time whining that I don't know their private lingo or do exactly what they want me to do than they do actually playing.

												This is genuinely one of the best games I have plated on the moba front. Instead of focussing on some pre-defined characters it focuses on ships which can be customised with various abilities. More importantly it becomes about using your surroundings in combat and playing towards your opponent's weaknesses. Stars, nebulas and asweroid fields become tactical possibilities through which to achieve victory.However I cannot recommend it as it has no player base and from what I can tell it has been abandonned by the developers some time between last time I played it and the last time I attempted to.

												I want to recommend this game, I really do. It plays great, reminds me a lot of Warhammer Battlefleet Gothic. Unfortunately, it seems the game is dead in the water. It has no playerbase, and since players are actually required to play, you'll spend more time waiting for a game than actually playing. Right now, I cannot recommend until they do something to get players back.			"

												DotA 3: SPACE SHIPSThis fantastic train crash simulator begins with the most intuitive tutorial since Crusader Kings II. And if you have any questions, feel free to read the help guide, an epic tale almost as long as War and Peace, but more boring.Now with more than 6 (SIX!!) non-unique ships, each with overlapping powers so as to avoid any individuality, you can feel like a true Captain Kirk from that episode where he fights with a man in a rubber dinosaur suit who can't see or move very quickly and probably has trouble breathing.This game is perfect for that time when you want to see a ship turning at about 2 degrees a minute, before suddenly spinning around randomly and teleporting inside a sun. For any other purpose, I wouldn't recommend this game.			"

												For those of you that don't know, this game is Multi-Player Only. As such, it is only as playable as the player base lets it be. I personally was unable to create a profile and register on-line (which is required), so I can't rightfully say anything about the gameplay itself. But if you are looking for something with plenty of replay-ability, I would advise not choosing this game. Seems that multi-player games are only bolstered by sales, and then quickly lose players. So the overall playability of the game is quite limited.			"

												Stellar Impact is a game that promises customizable fleet design and space combat.  However, it fails to deliver on all fronts.The game does not have a single player component; it is online multiplayer only.  While some may not consider this a problem, multiplayer games aren’t much fun with only one player.  When I tested the game, all of the servers were empty.  In other words, the game is dead.It’s a shame that SI has no single player mode.  If it did, then it may be a passable title – assuming they put as much effort into the single player mode as they did the game’s copy protection.So, to save anyone reading some money, here is the entire Stellar Impact game experience.  1.	Purchase2.	Download and install3.	Start the game4.	Go to the SI game website to create a mandatory account5.	Start the game6.	Log in7.	Enter the CD key included with the game8.	Connect to an empty server9.	Exit the game  I give Stellar Impact 0/10 washed up developers. "

												The most uderrated hidden gem of a game you will ever have the fortune to discover.This game has by far some of the most tactical gameplay that you will encounter in a MOBA. Think 19th century pre-dreadnaught naval tactics meets sci-fi. That means momentum, fire arcs, crossing-the-T, manouvers, formations! Combine this with the level of customization available to each ship means that there is a depth to this game that will make the game very rewarding for tactically minded players, throw in some fleet composition in the pre-combat phase and you have grand strategy too. The next best thing about this game is the community, although it is small. It may seem so small that it is dead... and yet every weekend you will see players flock from far and wide, messaging each other on steam and the unofficial teamspeak server to get that 6v6 rolling, and roll it will for 5-10 consecutive games or more. Sadly, without new blood any gaming experience begins to stagnate.So I say give this game a go. Its on sale, spare change. It might be one of the best buys of the year for you.  "

												For the price, it's exceptional. Battleships in space. You get to pilot your own capital ship and fight against others, steaming into a melee and swinging to the side to unleash a satisfying broadside into another ship. The ship abilities are unique and well-balanced. There aren't many people playing at the moment, but when a game gets going, it's a good time.Multiplayer only, but as someone who almost never plays that type of game, I found it worthwhile. The gameplay is that good.			"

This really shouldn't even be listed on Steam anymore.It's a tragedy; looks like it would have been a great game. But it's dead.			"

Nope!Perhaps the dev should go F2P with the base game and just keep the Vessel-DLCs as option.In the market of Mobas an entry Price is often the bottleneck to get people.Also because you can kinda get this game as a StarCraft2 Mod on the Arcade that you can just grab for freeFinal,i think the game is not bad, it just lacks a playerbase			"

												While the setting of this MOBA is very rare and sounds like a treat to try, especially with the constant 75% off sales it gets almost every month it seems, don't give it to the temptation!There is no single player or even a vs AI mode. That leaves you with only multiplayer which would be fine... If there were players. The only time you are able to get a game in is if you are in a certain steam group,  and in their teamspeak, at a certain time of day in their time zone. If all those planets and moons align... you can get a custom game going! Yay! Or not... Because all those people are played many games and arn't very new player friendly/people that just rage quit. My game was 1/2 done and all my team had already left because they didn't like the way it was going. This was of course after two months trying to actually find a game.Needless to say, if you have the time to try and find the games, go for it. Otherwise stay away from this title. It is abandonware.			"

												A game that had potential once upon a time, but has been abandoned by the dev and never really built much of a community. The debate over whether the game is dead or not is largely one of semantics. It's technically not dead in that there are still players, but most times of the day there's hardly anyone on and this is a multiplayer only title.When there are enough players on to get a game going in a reasonable time frame, the community is largely divided between long time diehards eager to convince people to buy the game so they have more newbies to stomp in game and the less experienced that got duped into trying the game out. Yes, you can sometimes get a reasonably balanced match with players that aren't hostile and toxic. Sometimes. Not being a glutton for punishment, I see no reason to roll those dice.			"

												When asked whether or not you should consider purchasing this game, you should take this single factor into account. It is an older indie title with no single player mode. It is not nearly as popular as many other titles like this, and thus it will be very difficult to get into games, unless you are either very lucky, or the more likely scenario, you bought a few extra copies so you could play with your friends.I do not dispute that some people must be able to get groups together to actually experiance what this game has to offer, however given how tiny the community for this game appears to be, the likelyhood of you being online when a match is goign to be played is very low. Being a review, I can only judge the game on what I see, and since after a week of owning it have not been able to get into a single match, have no opinion on it other then, it really should have a single player mode.In its current state, I wouldnt to recommend a purchase unless you know a few other people who already own it, or will purchase extra copies for them. Thats a shame, because the game does look fun, I will just never experiance it.			"

												So, Stellar Impact I can honestly say is definitelyon not my Top 10 game list. But I'd still recommend it for people who have the time and lust to play a different kind of MOBA, and one of the better ones out on the market.Dead Game?The statement that the game 'is dead', is not true. The game is not very active is the right word to use. When you jump into Stellar Impact, don't expect playing this game 24/7. But if you get into a game, then you will soon learn the small community which are playing this game, and you will be notified whenever people are playing. So do not expect playing more than a few matches a day.Personal ProblemThe biggest problem I have with the game is, sometimes matches can last up to 1-2 hours, which I would consider long time to play the game. And then after such a long match time, I usually get tired of it, after a match or two.SummaryStellar Impact only cost around 10€. It is not much, you can have a nice time. So if you like a nice community, slow paced MOBA game set in space, I'd recommend you to purchase this game and join for some nice evenings.			"

												I will give the game a ++++ review but please do note the devs have forsaken the gamewhich is ok because the game really doesnt have many if any bugs to be fixed.the player base is still around but its just spuratic at times.9 ship classes 24 skills 3 offensive mod slots 3 defensive mod slots and a turret mod slot. the game lets you choose a ship class and make it yours.MOBA in nature with some capture the flag for additional perks for your team. unlike League or DOTA where 1 person truely carrys a team this game requires teamwork and your faction (team) tech level (level bar) is for your whole team so when one person does good you all get to reap the rewards of new tech. upgrading yourself in game offensive or defensive as well as your faction and purchasing minion escorts if you didnt bring the skill.Join the TS3 and if it looks dead.. its just everyone sleeping. i've played 12v12 and 10v10 and 3v3 games this month so the game isnt GONE.

												Your potential enjoyment of this title depends entirely upon how much the idea of the peanut butter and chocolate combination of space naval combat and Defense of the Ancients-style gameplay intrigues you. If you're at all curious, it'll be worth the time, but if you're not, there's certainly a dozen other games in the same family waiting for you out there.If Tindalos Interactive can attract more players and implement a more stringent matchmaking system, Stellar Impact may follow in the footsteps of Frozen Synapse and become an indie strategy star.However as it is now Stellar Impact is a great example for the run-of-the-mill online multiplayer strategy formula. On one hand you'll always be able to find some players, but in the end you don't rely much on tactics but on sheer firepower.			"

												You're unlikely to be able to ""Join the Fight!"" because nobody plays this game, including the developers, whom have moved on to other projects. That is, if you even get past the login screen (which requires you to make an account elsewhere, and input various CD keys), as you can't change any option settings before that.Only buy this if it's dirt cheap AND you plan to profit off of the trading cards, or make the badges cheaply, because that's about all this title is good for right now.

												A brilliant game although it is multiplayer only and the playerbase is small. Don't expect to buy this game and jump straight into a competitive game. If you do get a game right away then you're lucky but more often than not you'll need to wait a while or return another day/night when it's busier. When you do get into a game it's totally worth it  and you should be able to get a few games in a row once you're in with the rest of the players who are also online at the time.You play in two teams trying to destroy your opponents base. To help you achieve this there are creep ships which you need to protect as well as each other and planets etc. to capture for upgrades and team benefits. After each round you also get experience and can upgrade your ship. There is a nice varied selection ships to choose from such as frigates, cruisers etc. You can also upgrade skills etc. during a battle.The game has never crashed on me. Graphics are average, sound is average, gameplay is awesome (when you get a game!).			"

												If I were to review it based on the game itself - it's a brilliant title. It plays nicely, the graphics are lovely and the feel of the game is as it should be in a space based game. The maps and objectives are well made and the ships are unique and trully versatile requirind a proper set of different vessels to achieve victory - in other words it does everything a MOBA needs.Unfortunately, the game is not the issue - the problem is that the game devs abandoned their product and left us with a pearl of a game... which no one plays.So, unless it's on a massive sale and you want to check it out or you have 5+ friends who'll buy it with you - there is no poin in getting this product. Too bad, as it had the potential to be the League of Legends of the Sci-Fi genre.			"

You can't possibly practice because the only way to do so is to have matches against other players, and the only people who are ever on (less than maybe 30 at any given point in time) are 50 million times stronger than you, therefore making your ship useless as f*ck and making the game not fun at all.I'm not even going to dive into the putrid game mechanics.

												I didn't like this game, but I'll be fair, I don't like this genre of game. It's Basically Defense of the Ancients/League of Legends except smaller maps, and slow-moving starships instead of characters. When I bought it, I mistakingly assumed with ships and strategy, that it'd be an RTS. It's not. And DLC changes the actual ships (with stats) that you have available, so it's not like the others in that the paid-versions are just cosmetic. You have to pay to get different ship classes. Meh.Also, it's not often you actually find a game running, anymore.			"

												This game could be a great MOBA for all I know, but I can't actually play it.  It requires you to play with other players, however there is hardly anyone online - 142 people right now according to the game.  When I first logged in there weren't any games available... I managed to create and play 1 practice round 1v1 against an opponent who joined my game and then decimated me because he knew what he was doing and I was just trying to learn.  Heading back to the lobby after getting destroyed, I attempted to join the only open game.  My team mate noticed that I was a newbie (the game prominently displays your games played and rating), typed ""lol"" and promptly left the game - followed by everyone else.I'm really glad that I bought the DLC package for this game, seeing as how I will never actually get to use it.TLDR: multiplayer only, no players online, not newb friendly.

												Cool, sould have read all comments and recommendations first but they do not show up on the mobile app. Now, even account registration is/seems to be offline, or does not work, so i am XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The only time i was more disappointed was when i bought Maia in alpha 0.01. Yes, 0.01. Nothing playable, just the basic layout. Ah, yes i forgot, suicide and homicide sims. I even got the Bundle, regular price 11,99€, but still these 2,99€ from the offer seem like wasting 30€ to me. Solution to the player issues mentioned below: add bots. Dota 2 does it for training and lan matches, so why do they not do it? No clue. And I have absolutely no clue why I need to register my account externally when I bought it via steam. This is not Battlefield 4 or anything from EA where i ecpect it. Never have such issues with humble bundle purchases and steam.First: try new user registration, then dare to buy it.			"

												Please, don't buy this.I'll start with the positive:  It appears to be a well designed arena battle type game, with each human commanding one capital ship.  The graphics are decent, if not spectacular, and the controls are pretty reasonable.  There's enough interactivity on the map to give each field a different feel.Unfortunately, I had to preface that with ""It appears to be"" because I've been unable to get into the game.  I've spent well over an hour combined waiting to get into a game, with no luck.  No matter how many people it shows online (the highest I've seen is about 160), no one ever shows up in chat, and as far as I can tell no games are running.  I'll be emailing customer support to see if I can get my money back, because while I'm willing to accept having bought a game I don't like, I don't like having paid for a game I can't even use.			"

												Bought this game on deep discount because the graphics looked cool.  Little did I know it was multiplayer only, and nobody plays the game any more.  If I'm not mistaken there's not even tutorial levels against AI or anything.  So I don't even know what the actual game is like, because I never found anybody to play with.			"

You will die multiple times without even knowing what's happening. However, if you were to focus on one ship to specialize in, you can become a master. Very fun game if you like tactical, ""naval/space"" battle games. I plan to play this game again. It is one of my favorite multiplayer games available.			"

												This game is tragic.  The game has so much promise, I've only been able to play a few games and they were fun and interesting but sadly the playerbase is just as dead as dead gets.  I recommend this game in the sense that its a good game, that people should play.  But it comes with a large warning and that is that its going to be very hard to find a match to play in and its online only.It also seems like the devs have pretty much abandoned the game with the last update being in 2012.  I bought the game and all DLC for $3, I don't regret it at that price but I really wish I could play it as it just seems so fun.			"

												Great game.It's a simple MOBA with an active (albeiit smallish) community.The main reason I played this was that it had naval-style manoeuvring (turning, broadsides, acceleration, turret rotation, etc) and I really wanted to play a game like that again. It didn't disappoint, and I truly recommend this game.Though the community is small, if you want naval-tactics in your MOBA, this is definitely the game for you!Good levelling system, good variety of maps with various factors to create risks and rewards for your own playstyle.Cheap, too! :DEDIT (27/10/2016) - I need to add that this game still has an active core playerbase of over 20+ players, which means maximum size matches still get played quickly unless you login at an unlucky hour. However, matches can be around 40 minutes so if everyone is in one you may need to wait a little while although there are usually a few idling which you can chat to (also check out the Stellar Impact Teamspeak general chat to talk with many of them).I still love this game and I've never seen a replacement for it, it's very well balanced and any class of ship can become the nemesis that's thwarting you and you need a solution for.A large group of the community is also looking to team up in an Organisation for Star Citizen once released. As I said before, it's a small but active and awesome community (approx 20-30 core players I would say).Love it still!			"

												If you get this game make sure you first get some friends to buy it also. It's a fun game and has some really awesome components but what they should have done is given a bunch of copies out to original subscribers, that way they could get some people playing it (it's only multiplayer, so if you can't find others playing then your out of luck) instead of just releaseing it and hoping for the best. So long as you've got friends who have it then I really recommend it, with it's price and how addicting it can be it's an awesome game.			"

												It's actually sad that after having this game for almost a month, the number of players went down to 1/2 of what it used to be. The trouble with online games is that you have to keep your fanbase interested. Whitch this game fails at utterly. It's been kinda fun, but if I have to wait 30 minutes to get into a game, I'd much rather play something else.It had some potential but I think that the customisation possibilities for your ships were too few. And you had to grind a WHOLE lot just to get some low tier upgrades.I was amazed by how few maps there were available.Good job on being able to rotate your cannons sepparately and in different directions at once.

												This game looks great, and for the most part it is - the ships are detailed, and morph with each weapon and ability change, the maps are lovely with lots of routes to take, and the gameplay is pretty sweet. However, on my first experience of playing the game, I got into a multiplayer game and was instantly ostracised for being a new player. Within the game itself I was constantly berated for not knowing what other players were talking about despite having less than half an hour within the game. I'm glad I only spent a few pounds on this piece of garbage, but even so It was a waste of money. Experienced players wonder why they get no game time, and then openly criticise new players.I hope you enjoy watching your precious game crumble under it's own lack of community, and as the last servers are shut down to be reused as cloud storage for Xbox one savefiles, all your hours of gameplay will fall into obscurity under the crushing disappointment that is Stellar Impact.

												This game... Was a waste of money.. I only spent 0.85€ on bundle, when it was on sale. I bought it, and then I had to register. Site loaded for LOOONG time. Then I registered, I put in the DLC code. It was wrong. I try 10 times again, copying from the taskbar the same time. Then, it finally worked. The Ships codes never wokred. When I got in game, the screen was pink and only the NPC dialogue was showing and the map. I shut down the game, hope to work again, and it did. But then I couldn't repeat the turtorial. I  had and still don't have an IDEA what to do on this game. Hopefully I will figure it out some day. But, at least graphics are fast, nice and quick. They don't seem bad. The game seems to gbe fun, but I can't even play it, because the tutorial didn't work. I'd be happy to ever know how to play this game. I'm going to try on YouTube and by guides, that's my only hope. If I get to play this game ever, I will probably change this rating, but for now, it deserves this rating: 3/10			"

												This is a FANTASTIC MOBA. And that's saying something, coming from me, because I hate MOBA games.Sadly, the major drawback to this game is that LITERALLY NO ONE IS PLAYING IT. I managed to get a single game in, once, by waiting for close to two hours for the game lobby to fill. Apparently, this is totally 'normal.'Sad face.This game needs to go F2P or something to boost the size of the community, otherwise it's awesome.			"

												I got this game durning a sale and can't play it. The first thing the game did was make me create an account from their website. When I finished the account I got ""This account has been successfully activated"". For some reason I could not log in. I clicked on forget my password and it sent me to the stellar impact site again. Hidden in the top right corner was forgot your password. I was asked to enter my email address and then told I would recieve an email with instructions and a link to change my password. I entered my email twice and still received nothing. When I tried to contact technical support by email which is listed as bugs@l2p-games.com on their website I got ""This email is invalid"". I looked on their forums http://www.stellar-impact.com/forum/ and noticed how small it was. I didn't pay much for the game but when I buy something I expect it to work or atleast have some support.

												Good but dead & multiplayer only. As of 3/24/2014 three are not enough players online to populate the lobby and getting a game involves unreasonable wait times, scheduling or simply does not happen.However I loved this game and the only way for it to get populated is for more people to buy it and log in once in a while. So if you want to try and bring it to life give it a buy, just know that it's dead with no singleplayer so you might not be able to do anything at all with it except solo practice mode, the tutorial and stare at the lobby. There are even no AI so you can't play a game vs bots. It was great while it lasted though but it never got all that big and DoTA2 coupled with time probably killed it.			"

												This game, for the short time I was able to play, was undoubtedly my favorite in the ""MOBA"" genre. When I bought the game, the community consisted of about 40 dedicated players. They had a dedicated Teamspeak server and organized games that way. They showed me the ropes and it was a ton of fun, even if only playing against the same couple dozen guys over and over. But eventually people started moving on, including me.I was really hoping this game would somehow take off, or pick up in player numbers, but it didn't. It's as dead as a game can get. Too bad, because it was super fun. Even if only 10 people could organize to play a few games 1 night a week, I'd be thrilled, but it's not likely to happen.EDIT (6/28/16): It appears that some people ARE still playing this game. I checked fairly regularly and failed to ever find anyone, but apparently my timing was just off. There's a new TeamSpeak server (check the forums!) and people are playing fairly regularly. And, as stands to reason, there are always some new players around the time of Steam sales. As such, I have changed my review to a Recommendation, but you should still be warned: depending on what time of day you normally game, you most likely will not be able to just jump in and casually play some games. Your best bet is to find the TeamSpeak server and message other players directly and try to set up games!			"

												I loved the concept of this game. While it was executed well to begin with the upkeep of the game just isn't there. Sadly, this game has so much potential to be great with a little marketing and a few updates we could expand a relatively small player base to something grand. However, while I can't recommend you get this game because of the super low player base, I will recommend that if you can get 10-12 friends to buy the game you could have a hell of a time with many hours of replayability. Then maybe, JUST maybe you could get the devs to come back and revive this wonderful hidden gem!			"

												Let me indulge into why I say Yes to this game.  One, the game's graphics are well done in specs for how much you can purchase it for.  There are very few glitches overall in the game which makes playability enjoyable.Although, the lack of advertisement and support was this games down-fall.  It truly is a sad deal when a great game falls short.  Only for the fact of lost vision.Currently you will find that the game has almost no one playing.  The ones that are playing are usually a group of four to eight people or more... that know each other and have the game.  Sadly, you'll be hard pressed to get people to game with.  There use to be a public TeamSpeak server for the game.  It was a form of assistance to help find games and teammates, as well as communication for in game.This game could easily make a come-back if the creators and or current holders probably changed a few things... what I feel they could change to improve it.1- Change how DLC works, for example new ships costing money is not a bad idea for a space battling game.  It is very much like League of Legends, Dota, or many others in this field of play.  Change it, but how?  You ask...  Well simple, currently many have bought the game so you might as well just let them have the DLC and Ships currently available.While allowing new users to unlock these ships after meeting certain criteria.1.5- Coming off the first improvement would be including a ranking system.  Example would be using Air-force or other forms of ranking to enlist Player's rank in games.  Someone who has played enough games to be seen as a veteran or a pro could be listed as a General.  Using XP and Wins to show their personal abilities.  You could even make it rank specific to ships.... meaning I could be a Commander Specialist on a Dreadnaught but a Rookie on a Destroyer.  Granted these ships already have a leveling system which enables survivability, but not game-breaking..2- Servers, servers, server!  Find a deal or a means to get cheap and affordable server(s) that are not atrocious!  Heck, the current game building is not bad actually!  Although servers would allow them to create updates, new events, things that many games are now adopting.3- Advertisement!  I honestly never even seen any advertisement effort.  If there was it was not enough.  DOTA and LoL did not get to where they are just by fan-base alone.  They sold themselves like an individual who willing sells them self for $2.00 an hour!  I mean seriously... Not enough advertisment!  When can you have too much advertisement?  When you have people laughing at the advertisment because they see it as silly... when it becomes SO normal that when it's missing they go... oh, hey... that's a new billboard?3.5- Youtube, Google, Steam, Facebook, MySpace, and soo much more!  Heck, Youtube and Facebook you don't even need to pay for!  Be shameless in your advertisement, go all out if need be.  Blow the game up to superb expectations just to fall flat but then raise the game to those expectations once the money rolls!  Simple, no?and my conclusion...  I just followed what a bunch of others have probably said about this game... those hard-core gaming members out there that enjoy a space battle.  This game is good for a top-down battle game in space.  It gives you that feeling at least... just depressing the game has essentially disappeared due to the current holders and or creators just giving up on it.  Sad days for such hard work that they put into a potentially fine game.I rest my rant.			"

												An excellent MOBA (DotA-like) In Spaaaaaace!

It's also got a pretty great community.			"

												A Nice and Easy to understand game with a lot of interesting features. After playing the Tutorial and the first few Battles online, everything should be said and anyone should be able to play without big problems (Aside Nosy team mates of course XD). The Big Problem is, as many allready said ""Chicken and Egg Paradox"". The game is seen as dead, so nobody buys the game. Nobody buys the game, so the game dies. This game is on major sales often enough that I say, if you have friends that like ""League of Legends in Space"", then you should definatly buy the game as a group. It is tons of fun when there are enough players and that is exactly the point. Convince your friends to play it. When at least 2 teams of players (in numbers 10 people) are there, you can have so much fun. I did not play it long, but I downloaded it today again to make a Let's Play (you can find me by searching Darkmesia on YouTube). I hope to revive this game, it would be worth it.			"

												 My first words to you are, wait.This is a great game, when it will actually run. If you enjoy other MOBAs, you'll probably get at least a few hours out of the game just trying it out with each of the ships and toying around with it.It has versatility in the number of initial potential options, even without the extra DLC ships. I Would recommend picking them up just to give yourself a few more tools to work with, in a similar manner to buying extra champions in LoL. One thing is the fact that you an not play to earn the ships, but instead you must buy them with $$$. It's a downside, but understandable. Every company is in business to make a profit. If there is no income, there is no business, no updates, no patches to fix minor problems or major bugs.The reason I say Wait, though, is because there seem to currently be problematic server issues. People having graphical errors, account creation problems, and being locked out of the game because 'You are already logged in' errors.			"

Varied maps (without an Allstars/Summoner's Rift clone, to my pleasant surprise) that can support a lot of strategies, classes that don't conform to the tank/dps/healer dichotomy very clearly, and fairly unique combat (mostly about getting broadsides) make this worth checking out if it goes on sale again.

												Good bit of fun and its quite different to the normal DOTA/MOBA type games that are out there.Essentially its DOTA set in space with ships, turret warfare and the skill recharge times are longer than in most games so its more about timing your shots (manual fire) and right skill usage time.Games range from 10-20mins to an hour. Both are very fun in their own way, but the longer conquest games which are evenly balanced are great fun and really promote team play.Highly recommend, especially if looking for something different than Demigod/LoLEdit: Unfortunately support for this is now very limited as the dev is working on a new game.

												A unique form of Moba game where you get to costumize your own spaceship with a variety of skills and items. Then take it to the battlefields to either conquer locations or simply destroy the oppositions. Nice graphics and very nice community.			"

												*READ THE CAVEAT BEFORE BUYING*Yes, this is a pretty awesome game - I'm not really a fan of the other MOBA style games, but this one kept my interest. Ships look cool, and it feels satisfyingly naval-y in the way you have to think about your momentum/direction, and whether that puts you in a good position in the next minute or so. It's fun throughout the match, and you don't tend to feel too outmatched by people at higher levels. HOWEVER, it is dead - like other people have said, there are never any games going, so don't waste your money on buying. Instead I'd recommend keeping an eye on Battlefleet Gothic: Armada, another game made by this developer based on the space-navies in Warhammer 40k - it should have a very similar, tactics-based feel.

												Stellar Impact is a strategic real time space combat game that gets a lot of things right.  The graphics and sound are well done and the control scheme is simple enough to learn quickly.  The included tutorial does a fine job of teaching you the basics and there is quite a bit of depth both with the kinds of obstacles you will encounter in space as well as the different research and upgrade trees.  The game appears to be designed from the ground up with multiplayer in mind, but while I have not yet tried an online game, the single player mode is interesting enough to keep me engaged.  In short, if you are a fan of games like Sins of a Solar Empire or even new to the genre, Stellar Impact is an above average title that promises hours of fun.			"

												For starters: It's DotA in Space. So if you don't like DotA then this game is not for you. However, should you enjoy steering spacecrafts, from the small corvette to the mighty Dreadnaught, into battle then I recommend you have a look. The game is slower paced than the regular DotAs and how you position yourself can make the difference between life and death (also knowing when to bail). Only downside is that it becomes very obvious fairly early on who's having the upper hand and who will be winning the battle.			"

												I would definitely NOT recommend this game. First off, the screenshots look terribly misleading. The gameplay is one that of a sluggish MOBA where your ship, even as you upgrade it's manueverability still turns worse than an impregnated whale on human growth hormone. I was under the impression that ""multiplayer combat"" meant a consistent game-to-game ship where I would upgrade work on my ship with tracked upgrades and progressions. Instead it gives you this MOBA-like upgrade system where everything is temporary, with no real incentive to play more than a few games. I'm not against MOBAs, but the expectations coming out of a game that looks like this, and almost deceitfully poses as a space sim rather than a MOBA; stating that there's ""tons of loot and equipment"", ""classes of ships"", and ""factions"" - not that there's much of this either. Don't let the screenshots fool you - it's NOT A SPACE SIM.Also all the servers are empty and there is no SP.			"

												Space Battleship Yamato!!!This game has so much potential - the control system is similar to Star Fleet Battles, only more intuitive, and the ships are right out of SBY.  Too many space-based games try to make you fight in three dimensions, which is more annoying than anything, but this one doesn't fall into that trap. If they'd only added a single player campaign, it would have been a hit. However, as you will soon learn, it's multiplayer only, and no one plays. But at least the tutorial is fun.  Lots of potential for mods as well; this format would be perfect for a Honor Harrington 'verse  game.			"

The tutorial though helpful fails to help the player get aquainted to the qwerky controls of this game.  However as of right now the game is defficcent at connecting to its players.  I hope in future updates this game will be fixed.			"

												I can't recommend this game. Do not pick it up. It is conceptionally flawed in a way that prevents any newbie to win against a veteran player. I bought this game during a sale, because its concept was nice. Back then, it was a few months after release, the game was almost dead already. (It is dead right now)The game was fun for the first couple matches, because there were a good amount of newbies and 2nd Tier ships at most around. At that point the game was balanced. After a few more matches a Vetern joined with a Tier 5 ship. In a 5v5 match setup our complete team, all newbies in Tier 1 and Tier 2 ships, kept firing at that guys ship and he won. He literally outtanked all of our damage and killed us 1v5. It wasn't that we were bad, it was just that our ships weren't leveled enough. Not enough damage, not enough hull. The Tiers are balanced to each other but as newbie in this game you have lost the match before it even started.It is the reason this game is dead. No one will put up the required hours to die their way to a max level Ship, just to be on equal footing with people that played the game much longer. I soon there after abandoned the match, as the realisation sunk in with the end of the promo weekend, that there just weren't enough newbies around anymore to have fun or level up.The game's mechanics canabilse its own newbies, by making it completely impossible for them to have fun if they are in a match with people that played the game for much longer.It was a good and interesting game, as long everything was balanced, but the low player base means you'll be joining matches with veterns in much stronger ships than your little dingy ship can measure up to. Its a fun game to play during sales, when new blood gets into the game, but as soon as the sale dies down, you are most likely going to deinstall the game.Save your money.			"

												It's a good game that nobody plays.The very few people that DO play are not friendly to new players, and don't seem to think that's a problem.Sad.			"

												Purchased but have not been able to play it since no one is hardly on and no single player. Paid a couple bucks on sale and wished I read the reviews first. Would have rather purchased a diet soda than this game.			"

												This is the problem with online only games.  if you could play the game on lans, or connect with your friends to play the game would still be alive to some players.but when theres no singleplayer, no lan, no multiplayer  just permanent online. and the player base is gone the game dies and servers shutdown. and then what you have is dead weight.this is why i never buy games that can only be played online because its a gamble and eventually u wont be able to play the game coz servers are dead.

												This game is not bad, it's a space based MoBA, but the issues lie with the developers and the lack of player-base.  If it had more people playing it would be great, but the sheer lack of players makes this not very interesting. Edit: Changed review to not recommended.  This game died very close to when it came out.  It was initially fun because there were people to play with, but the game matches ended up going pretty 1 sided fairly quickly.  In addition, the community basically shrunk over the first month to make it impossible to play at off-hours.			"

												This might have been a cool game at one time but I won't ever know because there's no way to play this game anymore. Multiplayer is the only game mode and the player base is absolutely gone. About as dead as a game can possibly get.			"

												I was really looking forward to playing this game but sadly its dead.  No player base with a player based game = no players no game.   if they were to set the game to free to play and maybe DLC as optional then, it may boost the Player base for the game.			"
