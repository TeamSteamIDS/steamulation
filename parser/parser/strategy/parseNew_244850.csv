 People asked for solar panels. We got solar panels People asked for infinite worlds. We got infinite worlds People asked for survival game mode. We got survival game mode People asked for planets. We got planets AND moons w/ astmospheres People asked for multiplayer. We got one multiplayer that was completely reworked from the ground up to work properly. People asked for better models. We got AAA team style block models. People asked for more and better particles. We got them People asked for oxygen for survival and room pressurization system. We got them both People asked for mods. Extended mod support was added. People asked for simple singleplayer campaign. We got a freaking cool campaign People asked for realistic sound mode. We received it. People asked for programmable block. C# scripts can now be made and used ingame People asked for steam workshop system. We now got 200k+ blueprints/worlds/mods/planets from the community on the Steam Workshop The list goes on and on...One of the best indie dev teams out there. They take suggestions from the community a LOT and implement them.Game just went to beta today and obviously the game is not perfect. But for 20€ you get a limitless experience. And with each update the game just gets better and better.EDIT: For people complaining about performance:Don't play on a potato. Specially Integrated graphics.This game is very resource intensive for various reasons:1. Almost everything is physically simulated. This is the biggest reason. (even small effect particles use physics).2. Custom engine (VRAGE) means that theres no already made assets and technology to improve game's performance. KSH (Keen Software House) has to make everything by themselves.3. Game is still in Beta, which is the primary and most important phase of optimization of the game.			"

Early Access Review
								I just had an epiphany. Yes I did. Let me explain.All games I play I start on the hardest possible settings. I dislike easy mode because bad habits and the real intent of the developers never shines through. (The devs need to make games easy for some people because they're either time-poor or effort-poor and well, their money and wishes are just as important right?)And this does that. In SE, easy mode doesn't teach you anything. It's a ""Lego meet Asteroids"" style and some even called it for a ""Minecraft"" clone as a result. Add building block. Add another block, and another ad infinitum until you have spaceship. For me, it got boring quickly. It's called ""creative mode""- just... build.And then there's survivor mode - on hard. Whoa!! I struggled for the first few hours. With little in the way of documentation and no real clue as to what to do, it took me over an hour to work out how to build a single block from the remains of a craft crashed into an asteroid.First there's survival. Have I got enough uranium for power? Should I turn on the gravity generator? How can I save energy until I can salvage enough to.... live?I need to mine. I NEED fuel. I can mine using my included hand drill but it's... messy. Slow. Trite. So to mine I need a mining ship. To build a mining ship I need components. To make components I need an assembler. To use the assembler I need steel. I need glass. I need energy. And all I have is a drill. I have a grinder. I have a welder. And in my scenario, I have a ship I can salvage. Piece by piece with a grinder, all the while careful of my energy limit, my inventory. I need a refinery. The refinery is needed if salvage doesn't give me everything I need so I'll need raw material to convert to ingots, including uranium ore which I convert to processed uranium to fuel the reactor so I can do ALL these things.Do you see where this is going?To build my mining ship I need a mining drill. To build the drill I need motors, steel etc. Some of these can be salvaged. Some have to be made. Every component needs to located, transported, linked and welded. EVERY component. You need a plan. A rough sketch on what you intend to build helps alot. It gives you purpose because time is of the essence. if you're not watching and run out of fuel you're.... dead. No energy means no refining of uranium ore to refuel. It's a grind. And a weld. Yep. Grind and weld. Hour after hour floating in your pressure suit. Maybe you can leave the grav gen on and walk around, expending more of that precious reactor fuel. Who knows. The decisions you make determine what you build and how fast it's going to take.The flying is... space like. There's 3 dimensions. There's gravity. There's velocity. There's death. There's no attitude indicators, sky markers, ""horizon"" indicators, compasses or such. Fly too far, lose your bearings and home.... disappears.  There are no fixed paths or objectives (apart from survive). It's a sandbox. And a multiplayer sandbox at that. Go public, lose it all or go ""friends only"" and do the hard yards with mates to build the biggest dang skyship ever made. There's missiles, guns, turrets, fire and light. Death. There's explosions, broken platforms, busted ships.Or there's serenity and wonder as you quietly go about your mining ship construction. The game caters for everybody from MP gung-ho blast'em players to SP anal-retentives with spreadsheets, CAD and a master plan.At alpha, a lot of the options are not as intuitive as I'd like. The UI is a bit invasive and some work could be done here. The universe is.... grey. I'm sure some awesome nebulae would fit in great here and add appeal to the wonder of space.There are glitches,  it's alpha as I write, but I've experienced no crashes. It's going to be good thing this Space Engineers and the devs seem happy to include...whatever people damn well please.7 hours went by in a single session. I'm only half through building my mining ship. I have no objective but to succeed. My epiphany? What is success in SE?  It's when I finish this ship, I'll mine, refine, transport and assemble another. It'll be bigger. It'll do more. The welding torch will blind my eyes as I drift in and out of the superstructure boundaries, my suit energy draining away.I'm fascinated.THIS can only get better...9.5/10gg			"

								When I picked up this game, we didn't even have functioning weapons - The only way to damage other ships was to ram into them at top speed like a maniac, which generally left you as mangled as your target.Now we've got weapons, NPC ships, remote-controlled ships, radio communication, jump drives, solar power, oxygen, wheeled vehicles and three different kinds of thrusters to pick from. A few years ago the effective game world was a small cluster of asteroids floating in empty space, and now we have planets that are around 50-60 kilometers in radius.It's been a long and fun ride, and it shows no signs of stopping.

								do you enjoy the oxygen-less vacuum of space that traverses a seemingly infinite distance? do you enjoy building things, perhaps vehicles for travelling through aforementioned space, or elaborate stations for docking said aforementioned vehicles when you are not travelling in the also aforementioned seemingly infinite oxygen-less space? do you enjoy destroying everything you've toiled hours away creating at high velocities with varied humorous results? if you answered yes to all of these questions, you should probably play space engineers. because you can do those things, plus alter gravity like an omniscient god, among other things as well. so play it.

								I couldn't recommend it more. As you can see from my time played, it is incredibly addictive. The gameplay is amazing, the ship building is an absolutely blast, and then using your ships is even more of a blast! (In more ways than one!) The community is one of the best on steam, and I think this game deserves that title too. :)			"

Early Access Review
It's Dead JimWhile some will disagree the game is simply dying, if not dead already, one thing is fact, the steam forums are dead.THE PROBLEMSThis game as suffered from a bad stroke of development since it went multiplayer even ignoring all the optimization issues that still exist with the game. For most, playing singleplayer just gets boring after a while as you basically just build a ship in creative.  Building a ship in survival was just pointless because there was utterly nothing to do.So, many players took to multiplayer, which by concept had the potential to be a megaton of fun.  Imagine it for a moment, you are building your ship and a player comes by to try and steal it, you turn around and open fire with your assault rifle, and your ship comes to life and helps to defend itself.  VICTORY!  Now, imagine a large ship with 4 - 8 people on that ship helping to man everything from guns, to inventory, to even drones or small ships in a mining operation.  The sheer coordination required by that would be intresting in of itself to make this game GOTY worthy.Alas, that is not at all what it delivered.  If your ship moves, any passengers have about a 424242% chance to die for no reason other than neglegent programming. In fact, almost 42424% of your deaths were from bugs. And if that isn't bad enough, 4242424242% of the time your ship was destroyed from bugs.  Now, I'm actually refrencing a Dedicated Server with a 32 core Xeon, 1TB system that my guild ""tried"" playing on. Hardware was not the issue as it never was, it is the software -- that neglegent programming./geek stuffThe game currently uses the steam netlayer which is capable of 33 updates per second.  That means that in one second, the server and client can send 66 updates back and forth to/from each other.  When a ship moves at 5 meters per second, the netlayer is already saturated with physics calculations and simply can't take any more because there is just so much ""junk"" being sent through the netlayer that it was never intended to handle.  There are other netlayers out there, even the moderators said they would move to Rakknet, in which we later found was a lie.  The developers never intended to move the game to rakknet which has a update capability of over 100 updates per second vastly expanding the maximum speed in which a ship can fly before the netlayer becomes saturated and causes ""bouncing"" of the ship./end geek stuffTHE CULPRITSI tried to help.  I am a programmer myself and being the game was open source to those who paid for it, I examined the source code and how the game interfaced with the steam netlayer -- honesly it was simply as I stated, there was simply too much stuff being sent over the netlayer, some of which shouldn't even be there and some a conversion to lockstepping could help alieviate. So, I created a client and server side wrapper that provided an alternate method of transfering ""some"" of the data. It was simply a bandaid as it did have its bugs but the concept was solid, especailly in demondstrating what the problem was while there was a heated debate in the forums about what that problem really was.I asked a complete stranger in the forums to join my server and help me test something, basically after I had finished my prototype, they joined my server with the changes installed and they were absolutely blown away.  The server had no bouncing or rubber banding.  When you looked straight down at your ship's floor while it was traveling 120m/s, you could only see the ship wabble 1-2 pixels on your crosshair, which was an absolute night and day diffrence between not having my fixes which the wobble could be upwards of 50 meters, which would cause instant death.I took video of this just for posterity and posted it in the forums (Sorry Twitch has already deleted the video).  The fanbois were P I S S E D!  But why, I wondered.  It took me a while but I figured it out, it took one of the fanbois only one comment to completely explain to me why they were all so upset -- I proved their precious KSH wrong, and showed them up by fixing the game for them!  Did you know I was called a fraud? The guy I had just met was called a fraud, the video was called a fake, and you don't even want me to get into all the names I was called in that thread while the moderators utterly ignored every word.  No seriously, every word until of course, the guy I met spoke out and defended himself in much kinder tones in which he recieved a ban.I know one of the moderators and I'm not pointing fingers, I don't know which was responsible or if it was someone from Keen that did it.  But there was a new precedent set that day in the forums, that much was quite obvious: Fanbois, ala the majority, rules.DIGRESSIONThis problem of fandom was first revaled to me after the ""Cyberhound"" patch.  Immediately after, before anyone had access to it there were comments from the fancamp praising Keen for a job well done, calling the update awewsome, perfect, exceptional, epic, and one even called it couragous! It was sheer spam.After I got the patch, I logged into the game to find that these cyberhounds randomly spawn inside your ship and immediately and without warning blow it up from the inside out.  Try and digest what I just said if you haven't purchased or played this game yet.  Immediately and very angryly I go back to the forums to the patch notes and to my surprise I see it going completely nuts with people complaining about the ""Jihad Dogs"".  The moderator I am in contact with even said it was the hardest he's had to work so far to keep the comments within reason and in line with the rules.It was so bad, there was an emergency patch that was pushed to toggle these dogs off.  This one incident illuminates so much about the woes of this game, community, and developers that it may take a few reads to actually grasp the gravity of it, but being limited in text, I will make an attempt here.Firstly it was made clear that Keen could urinate in the fancamp's mouth and the fancamp would thank them for the rain while at the same time attacking anyone who questioned the pungent smell, warm tempeture, and golden color.  A critic's feedback never reaches Keen, and the developers have become so disconnected with the community it is almost laughable and pathetic to see them attempt to re-connect (that is a whole other story there).The last attempt was the most miserable.  A Q&A where Keen scripted the entire thing and selected on their most rabid fans to participate. No critics were allowed a signle question, and there were no questions that caught Keen offguard. It was more of a political forum than a Q&A.But what it boils right down to is with the critics now gone, the fanbois have lost intrest in the game, no one plays, no one talks on the forums, and there is no more healthy debate and discourse with the developers, the game: It is dead.  May it rest in peace while fandom burns in hell.What you see now is the skeletal remains of an awesome idea where like a cancer, fanbois invaded the inner circles of the developers and tricked them into thinking that everything was ok while slowly killing them. By the time the developers realized there was an issue, which was a few months back when Merik came back to the game, it was simply too late, the damage was done.  Fanbois seem rather hellbent to having this game die a slow and painful death; they seem to somehow think or believe ""they are the game"" by identifying as the game and therefor feel it necessary to attack all criticism -- suicide.There are many ways for a game to ""go"", but never, until this game, would I have guessed for a second that raving group of fanbois could actually achieve the death of a game. This game is a casestudy for the books and a prime example of who not to listen to when developing a EA game.			"

Early Access Review
								I usually dislike early access games. I usually take a fat pinch of salt when I see new 'build your own' style game comes come onto Steam too. Not in this case. Space Engineers has quickly earned a spot in my all time favorite PC games for its dynamic and engaging construction system and it's got one of the coolest looking destruction systems I've ever seen in a game like this. The devs have been keeping up with weekly updates since its launch and they're very involved with the community. As a matter of fact, player made content will be appearing as randomly spawned ships in the upcoming exploration patch.The construction system is very simple, even familiar for most people I'm sure. It's like Minecraft, in that you're building pretty much everything out of blocks, but that's where the similarities end. Ships are made by sticking a power plant, cockpit, a couple gyroscopes and thrusters (In every direction by the way! Space has no gravity or atmosphere so your ship needs forward thrusters to slow down, etc), maybe a few weapon systems. Then you have to hook up conveyor pipes to most of those things to power them with resources and components you get from mining asteroids. Ships can be as big or as small as you like, the only real limit is how much your PC can handle. Everything from little scout fighters, mining ships, frigates, fighter carriers and even humongous titan-sized battleships can be built. Yes, you could even build your own Death Star, but you might have to wait a little while for a working Superlaser. Or you could just mod your own Superlaser into the game, because Space Engineers has a modding API and a fully fledged Steam Workshop page that's already crammed with all sorts of player created content.There's also an integrated blueprints system (And a corresponding hologram projector for constructing saved blueprints from scratch) so you can save ships and carry them over to other servers/maps, or if the first ship you had gets destroyed and you want a replacement, you can just ctrl-v it into the game after selecting it from the blueprints menu. Very very handy.Ships and stations crumple, tear and otherwise deform when they take damage, whether you're hosing them down with lead, setting off explosions or just smashing into eachother for fun. You can see the damage your ship takes over time as holes, scratches, dents and warping are modelled into most blocks. Even portions of your ship can be sheared off and cause extra damage as they free float in space, getting knocked around and causing even more havoc as they get caught on your ship and tear it apart from the inside if you're not careful. The same rules apply to your enemy too though. It's very exciting and sometimes anxiety-inducing, the way combat works.There are two gameplay modes currently, survival and creative. Survival mode lets you build everything from scratch and assemble it together using the various ingame tools you're provided with. Everything needs to be constructed piece by piece and you're limited by how many resources you have and what kind of tools you have available. You can mount bigger and better drills, welders and grinders onto your ships after you acquire enough supplies.Creative mode is exactly what it sounds like; you have free reign to do whatever you like in the galaxy and everything is constructed instantly the second you place it down.A pretty solid multiplayer mode with player-created factions and servers was patched in a while ago. It even supports mods. I haven't spent a lot of time online aside from on my own private server I play with one or two friends on but there's practically no change between offline and online gameplay aside from some occasional connectivity and performance issues.The multiplayer still needs quite a bit of polishing, as does the overall performance of the game, but so far it's come together very very nicely and I expect I'll put another fifty hours or so into the game before it's released.If you're into Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Warhammer 40k or any other scifi genre, buy this game. You'll thank me later.			"

Early Access Review
								I have a deep love for this game, but lately this has been fading deeper and deeper into disappointment.I bought it on sale a bit over a year ago, I think it was about $10 at the time, which for 350+ hours of time in a game is certainly money well spent.  Many of these 350 hours were enjoyable, and if you'd asked me 6 months ago whether to buy this game, I 100% would have told you to go for it.The conceptual design of the game is amazing.  The way the ships lock together through all the different engineering features is just plain awesome.  The dynamic nature and wide range of build options will unleash your creative child, and you'll find yourself spending many hours nutting out tricky designs to see what works best.The community is even better.  The people I've met playing SE have usually been mature and fun to play with.  There's always a few exceptions .. but hey, we're gamers, right?  The mod community is extremely active and you can find a mod for just about anything.So why won't I recommend this game?  Well ...It's buggy.And by buggy I don't just mean buggy in an annoying way.  I mean buggy in a way that will progressively drive you crazy.With early access, this is normally forgivable.  Early access itself comes with an implicit promise that the developer will eventually fix most (if not all) of the bugs and eventually release the game.  So paying cash for something in early access usually involves developing a thick skin for the bugs.  I knew this going in, and it didn't stop me.But after 2 years in early access, a disappointing pattern has been emerging with this game.  I don't think that the person responsible for prioritising the work for SE actually plays the game.  If they did, they would likely be running things very differently.At the moment SE is running a weekly release cycle.  Mid to late in the week, the developers push out an update containing features and often a few fixes.  The root problem seems to be that each update brings too many features, and not enough fixes.The result is that over time, what initially started as a fairly simple physics sandbox game has evolved into a massively ambitious project full of unfinished features.  Almost every time a feature is released, it gets 90% done, then left on a shelf.  Sometimes the 10% isn't that important, and the feature is worthwhile.  More often the 10% is something rather critical (like ability to work in multiplayer) and the feature simply becomes a point of frustration, as you spend hours trying to make it work or basing designs off it, only to have it fail you in the worst possible ways.I have very limited experience in games development, but 15 years in the software industry have taught me that letting the bugs stack up is a really bad way to develop a product.  The longer a bug remains in software, the harder it is to fix.  The more you stack on an unstable codebase, the buggier it gets.  The SE forums are completely littered with bug reports, many of them very serious.  The developers know about the bugs, but instead of fixing them, they just add more features.I don't think this is going to end well for SE.  At the time of writing this review, I can no longer stand to play the game through the seemingly endless number of bugs that plague it.  It's starting to look like one of two things will happen:1. SE will stay in early access forever.  It will continue to sell copies.  The developers will keep adding features.  The bugs will keep stacking up, until some critical level is reached where people get so frustrated that the review standings and sales plummet.  Development then scales back (or stops) and the game is left in early access.2. SE will leave early access in a buggy state, not with the level of stability expected in a finished product.  This will in turn lead to lots of disappointed people, bad ratings, and probably a collapse in sales and support.I want Keen Software to prove me wrong in this.  I would LOVE for them to prove me wrong, and get SE out of early access into a stable state where it can be as awesome as it deserves to me.  But with every feature release, I lose a little more faith.  This seems to be a constant problem with the approach of funding games using early access - there is no commercial incentive to ever actually leave early access.So it looks like SE for me will remain a broken dream.  To anyone that is considering buying this game, I recommend first taking a look at Empyrion - its build system isn't yet as sophisticated but even in its very early days I found it much more stable than SE.But if you can't resist and you really want to buy the game, be careful with the following features.  They will give you little but frustration:- Pistons and Rotors (these mess up the centre of gravity in ships, and intermittently cause massive unexplained velocity/damage - especially in multiplayer)- Wheels (no effective brakes + other physics bugs)- Small ship conveyors (these don't bridge effectively with normal conveyors. The blocks that connect them are intemittently unreliable)- Landing gear (hitching and physics issues, especially in multiplayer), connectors are better- Batteries on complex power grids (when combined with reactors and solar panels, these need to be micro-managed.  It's improved recently, but will still drive you crazy)- Projectors (these will destabilise servers in multiplayer, giving big crash issues.  Big loss as there's no way to move ships to survival mode without them)- Large ships and complex worlds (the game server itself seems to run all ticks on a single thread, so any more than 1 CPU core is wasted.  This means there's no way it can scale as ships get bigger and worlds get more complex.  Everything just slows down)- Ships parked on unlevel planet surfaces in multiplayer (jerks around like crazy, can be very disappointing as it often destroys the ship)---------- 15th January 2016There's been some interesting developments lately for the SE project.  Marek Rosa (the controller/owner of Keen Software and first dev on the SE project) has taken a renewed interest in the game and earlier this week, he did a live stream over twitch where he played it online.  The stream was very revealing as it showed how little exposure Marek has had to the current state of the game.  Over most of the stream, he was chatting with the other devs and pointing out issues with the game that he wanted to see fixed.  More information on this here - https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceengineers/comments/40jbfk/marek_rosa_says_this_is_♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t_to_space/It's become pretty clear that many of the development problems in SE have originated from a gap in leadership.  Marek seems to have realised this and is taking serious steps to exert more control over the project.  Today he posted a lengthly article consisting of a very long list of issues with the game he wants to see addressed, with a strongly worded commitment to fix bugs and get the product out of an early access state - http://blog.marekrosa.org/2016/01/the-ksh-roadmap-for-2016-space_14.htmlI find this very encouraging.  Perhaps there is hope for SE yet.  Considering the current broken state of the game, I'm not yet ready to recommend it to others, but I do think this is one to watch.  If Keen can make significant progress towards fixing SE in 2016, it may just become a game worth buying.			"

Early Access Review
								A story that can tell you a lot about the game: After joining a multiplayer server, I spawned with an atmospheric lander, but I found myself in space, where the atmospheric thrusters are completely useless, rendering me instantly stranded on an unmovable ship. But I thought: well, this is survival, so, challenge accepted!I started to deconstruct the lander with my grinder. I quickly realized that I don’t have thruster components to build ion thrusters (because atmo thrusters don’t use them), nor do I have enough uranium to run a nuclear reactor. But I had plenty of ice in the lander’s oxygen generator, and solar cells in the cargo container for building solar panels. So my only option was using solar panels for electricity, and using ice-fueled hydrogen thrusters for propulsion. I built a platform in space, added a flight seat, some solar panels, a battery for storing power, a gyro for turning, a medical station for oxygen and respawning, a hydrogen tank, some hydrogen thrusters, and a generator to fill the hydrogen tank. Finally, I started to build the hydrogen thrusters, but I found out that I have materials only for 5 small thrusters, which leaves one direction without ANY thruster! That is not good, because without thrust the inertial dampeners wouldn’t be able to stop the ship from drifting. Fortunately, after some deliberation I realized that I can just turn around and point another thruster in the given direction, so I’ll be able to stop.I finished deconstructing the lander, and stored all the materials in a cargo container on my new ship. I was thrilled to try my finally functioning ship, so I started to move, approaching the closest asteroid to find ores. This was my first time using hydrogen thrusters, and I was blown away how strong are they – a single back thruster gave plenty of forward trust. The first asteroid only contained iron, which I didn’t really need at that point, so I continued my journey in space.After the second or third asteroid I was still without a good source of the needed ores, but I gained confidence in my new ship, so I decided to approach a bigger asteroid far away. I applied plenty of thrust to make the distance quickly. Funny how the fuel time always shows zero… it must be broken when using hydro thrusters, but let’s stop to investigate – I was thinking. But moments later the thrusters shut down completely, and the ship still had a speed of over 70 m/s. Taking a look at the generator revealed that it’s completely empty, no ice left whatsoever to produce hydrogen. And no oxygen supply either, because ice was also the source of oxygen. It took a few moments to realize that this means I have simply no options to stop the ship. So here I am, finally managed to establish a base ship for respawning with two hours of work, and now it’s as good as a drifting rock – or worse, space debris, since multiple large asteroids seemed to be on its path.What can I do… there is only one option! I need to leave the moving ship, quickly find ice on an asteroid with my jetpack, and somehow get back to the ship. I tried it once, and I failed miserably. After the ship was 3-4 km away I simply lost track of it, since it was already just a small spot on the sky. So let’s try again; let’s respawn on the drifting ship. This time I first built an antenna on the ship, and set its broadcast distance to maximum just to be sure. I left the ship, overtaking it to reach a bigger asteroid near its path. I found ice, and after chasing the ship for some minutes I was able to finally board it with my ice cargo. I filled the generator, and FINALLY, the thrusters were working again, and I was able to stop.After this incident I made it a priority to fill the generator with ice, and as time passed I collected other ores and built a refinery and an assembler on board to expand my creation into a proper ship. Then the game crashed, but I started it again promptly, since I was very eager to get back working on my project. Steam started to update it, because a new hotfix was issued meanwhile. Well, that’s good, right? Maybe it will be more stable then. But it turned out that since my version number jumped I simply can’t reconnect to the server, because the server still had a pre-hotfix version. No matter how much I’d like to continue, it’s just simply not possible, because I can’t roll back. I’ll need to wait until the server is updated too, and I have no idea when will that happen.Disappointed as I was, I joined another server, and started to build a base on a planet. It went well, and I invested many hours into it, making it looking much better than the ones I built in single player. But one day, the server that had my base on it simply went offline. I waited until the next day, but it was still offline. It’s still offline as of now; I have no clue why, or when will it be online again, if ever. I checked the previous server too, where I built the aforementioned ship, but there is a version conflict again, so I can’t join. I’m now looking at the list of servers – most without any players –, and I wonder if I should start investing into another one, knowing that tens of hours of my time can get wasted, because the server can simply disappear, get wiped, or remain inaccessible for goodness knows how long due to version conflict.In addition, I left out from the beginning of the story how I wasted hours with joining a server, spawning into a respawn ship, and trying to fly somewhere to start my base, only to have a client or server crash that instantly wiped my progress – since I wasn’t yet able to make a powered medical station to respawn into. I also left out the constant lag- and glitch-causing ‘server sim speed is low’ issue, which happens whenever a new player connects to the server, a ship crashes, or really, when anything significant is going on in the game – even with the newly released multiplayer code, it seems.Overall, this game can give a unique experience for people who like to build, to mine, to improve and expand creations, to explore, to get into trouble, and to find solutions to problems as they go. Albeit it’s a stretch to think you are ‘engineering’ in the game, it has plenty of complexity and depth. If you buy it, you can easily get hundreds of hours of playtime out of your money. After trying the game in a not completely legal fashion, I didn’t even wait for a Steam sale – I went straight to the developer’s site and bought it directly from them for full price. Due to how unique this game is I never did regret that decision. Despite it being in early access for more than three years, the development is still alive, and even bigger updates are coming out – the recently redesigned blocks add an amazing level of graphics detail to the game.But as you spend time with it, experience the limitations (e.g. 100 m/s maximum speed (in space!), bugged rotors/pistons, primitive physics (thrusters just push the center of mass without respect to their placement, no hull integrity at all so you can have a single block holding 1 million tons), pain in the♥♥♥♥♥shape creation from cubes (and a lot of missing blocks to make basic hull shapes), but especially the crippling multiplayer problems), and get to know more about the developers (missing talents, missing leadership), you’ll realize that chances are you will never be able to love this game without hating it too at the same time. And you’ll realize that this game would give you the best multiplayer experience of your life if you could only join an official persistent universe where you can cooperate or fight with other players or just show off your creations, and that you’d be happy to even pay a subscription fee for that – but you simply can’t, and probably will never be able to, at least not in this game.

								It took us hours to build, and hours more to paint, but when it was done, our station was top notch: three designated landing pads, a central control hub to maintain the station's sytsems, a player hub filled with medical bays and storage space, and two full refinery-assembler combos. My partner in crime placed the blocks. I welded them in place and splashed some paint on it all once the basic shape of it was finished. It was not large, but it was clean, functional, and designed with sophistication.  It was ours, and we had built it out from the tiny little square of space we had started with, turned it into our own little command post lodged in the side of an otherwise unnoteworthy asteroid.The ships came first, though. Without the ships, there were no resources to build with. First was the mining ship. We equipped it with four sets of drills and my partner took it out on missions to gather more resources. He was gone, and so I built our second ship: a fast little cruiser made only to get from one place to the next or to scout out potential mining sites. We called it the Toad. And so we settled into a routine: I would take the Toad out and find a nice planet ready for excavation and he would go plow into it with the mining ship. We unloaded the materials. We assembled them into parts. We put those parts into the blocks he had put down. We toiled. We slaved. We built and built and built.And when it all was done? When everything was in place? What did we do then? Did we recline in our player base? Did we look out over the catwalk railing and say, ""Look what we have built from nothing. Admire our structure."" Did we bask in the glory of a hard fifteen hours of work?No. We planned. We created. We started on the true project, the beginning of our empire: the Mothership.It was designed to be bigger than our entire station: two refineries of its own, three storage containers, twelve gigantic thrusters, enough room in the hangars to store both of our ships (and possibly more), several medical bays to respawn in—and one ridiculously enormous ship. We placed the first block above our station. And then another and another, until the massive frame of it started to block out the light. It was a monolith to our own accomplishments, a totem of sheer ingenious design and willpower. Not a block was out of place, not a single reactor was missing.And then we ran out of resources. The frame was all done, but the blocks couldn't be finished without more steel plates. We need iron—a lot of iron. So away my partner went! He climbed into the mining ship, steered it towards our latest excavation site and gunned the engines. He hit max speed. He piloted the ship around the end of the ghost-like frame of the Mothership. And then it happened—the unthinkable: he ran out of fuel.Pop Quiz: An object in motion . . . Stays in motion. And he clipped it. He clipped the mother ship. Grazed right off of it and, with no way to stop the mining ship from moving forward, had to bail out of the ship before it carried him away to oblivion. There was a panicked rush to mount a rescue of our mining ship by using the Toad to chase after it so we could supply the mining ship with the fuel its reactor needed to activate the reverse thrusters and stop the ship.We gathered the fuel. We undocked the ship. We prepared to launch. Then, with the slow, heart-pounding realization of a horror film, a shadow passed over the Toad.  We looked up at the Mothership, our entire view eclipsed by its awesome mass. We dropped our tools and stared in gut-twisting horror.The whole thing.Tilting.Spinning.Moving.Crashing.This is what happens when you let normal people pretend like they're Space Engineers.			"

								Space engineers.... What can I say? Its the best space sandbox out there. During my time playing it, i've started a faction, held destruction derbies, crashed massive ships into one another, and build beautiful stations inside asteroids. I've spent over an hour searching for cobalt to make a single ore detector, constructed a walking robot only to see it destroyed by a stray asteroid, and built a ridiculously fast ship to stab other ridiculously fast ships with. I made something orbit before Spherical Gravity Generators were added. I can't describe the amount of fun I've had with this game. The devs are awesome, theres an incredible new update every week, and the community is amazing. So, do I recommend it? Hell yes.			"

								As you can see, I'm only 6 hours into this game, but I've watched hours of others playing, tutorials, and guides in order to get a better hang of things. Even though it's early access, this feels like a whole title. Even if the developers were to drop it completely (which they show zero signs of doing), it would still be worth $20. Some quick pro/cons:PRO:+Massive creative potential.+Good modding community.+Strong multiplayer.+Active and player-friendly developers.CON:-Difficult UI. I had to look up tutorials on YouTube to get a decent idea of how to do things (Thanks, Gas Bandit!).***This has since been fixed with a tutorial! Told you the developers were awesome.-Little guidance, expects you to tough out the rookie mistakes and learn***Again, see above edit. Developers are awesome.-Brutal PvP online. Do NOT go online without playing single player first and getting the hang of things.I love this game. It's tough on your computer, though. It runs on my laptop, but barely. Definitely stick with smaller ships and maps unless you have a monster gaming PC. With a little help regarding the UI, some optimization to improve performance, and just more of what the devs have been doing, by the time this hits 1.0 it will be one of the best games of it's kind. TL;DR- This game is good, doesn't feel like early access. Make sure to check the min/rec'd specs, as it's pretty demanding of your PC. Watch tutorials online (check out Gas Bandit on YouTube) to not be a noob floundering and dying for 3 hours straight.EDIT: My laptop has 4 GB of RAM, i3 M370 2.4 GHz (I think. Computer stuff isn't my thing). I stay on small world settings, very few asteroids, basically bottom end graphics. If you can run Skyrim, Civ 5, Kerbal Space Program, then you can run this. Maybe not at full power, but it works, and its pretty dang fun.			"

Early Access Review
								To make a long review short... This game is fantastic, and you'll hate every hour you spend on it.--- To Begin ---I have been a part of the Space Engineers community for quite a very long time. Although at first, the game was still being developed (as in... Before weapons, detonations, and the etc existed at all). By then, I enjoyed the game for a while however was never extremely hardcore into it. This all ended up changing around the past month and so however. With the introuction of new community groups, factions, and of course mods, (also of course the content being added every week) the game has never had a segment of any real 'boredom'.--- Graphics ---The graphics on this game are done pretty well for many of the Sandbox Sims I have seen out and around. It is noted though, that to run this game on higher graphics settings you -will- require an at least decent PC to run this game sufficiently. There are of course a few glitches with the Early Access still above, such as a few lighting and shading bugs here and there, and the occasional block bug ot glitch. Overall though, the graphics and physics are all well and nice to look at (for the hours you will spend in the realms of space), of course.--- Gameplay ---The gameplay is something that will vary depending on you yourself. If you enjoy building new (NOT FEATURED!)land, orbital, or space creations; enjoy exploring the infinite fields of asteroids, (NOW FEATURED!)planets, moons, and simply space; and would want to join the already growing and very friendly, creative and supportive community, then this is the game for you! The gameplay is fairly simple to a certain degree, the building being commonly referred to as 'minecraft in space'. This, however, changes drasticly past the simple placement of blocks, such as the production chains from mineral ore, to basic materials that can be processed into components that then are used to build and create each block in the game. This is a game where commonly you would want to play with a friend or even more (the more the better!).--- Community ---The Space Engineers Community is one of (if not the) most active and creative communities I have grown to be a part of on Steam. The Workshop houses hundreds of thousands of player-made creations ranging from spaceships of combat, commerce, and civilian use, as well as stations of all types, ground vehicles and orbital ships, as well as now including land bases. There are also an array of hundreds of player factions, from pirates and mercccenaries of war, to civilian trading corporations and industrial commerce administrations. There is never a shortage of player-created factions, and it is always a great idea to find one that suits your interests best, and join in to meet other and new friends, and to share designs, tips, and your own universe experiences.--- Concluding ---Overall, Space Engineers is a wonderful game. Although there are of course bugs, errors, and situations that occur, this is  still in Early Access. The game itself is doing quite well so far, and I, alike many many others, are excited to see what will be released next. The release of planets today is a revolutionary new feature as well (Although it is a bit of a framerate kill on weaker PCs). Multiplayer still does have a bit of connection and server bugs, however it is functional and does work for the majority (though most problems I have experienced were from the server hosts themselves).All in all, a great game, and I recommend it for any space, simulator, or sandbox fan.Always remember, have fun! Fly Safe! (^-^ )7			"

								From the very first videos that promoted this game prior to its launch on Steam, the game looked impressive, melding a voxel game (similar in nature to another popular game) to a deformable physics platform set in Space.From it official launch in 2013, Space Engineers has been in Early Access.By no means has it been a smooth ride, but each week the developers have been adding to and improving the game, adding features requested by the community, as well as adding their own particular enhancements.The game has grown substantially in that time, making Space Engineers an impressive multiplayer sandbox experience.The developers have hinted at many new things on the horizon which will no doubt improve the game play immensely and expand the playability when they are released in the coming months.I've personally spent more hours playing this game than any other in my Steam catalogue, and hope to continue playing for a long time to come.- If you like building stuff....- If you like smashing stuff...- If you like flying space ships...- If you like exploring massively open space...- If you like encountering random procedurally generated items...- If you like building/flying model replicas of famous SciFi ships...- If you like competing with players to build the biggest meanest ship to pit against one another...- If you like experimenting with physics...- If you like the community experience of sharing things you have made...- If you like a game with a large community following...- If you like a game where players can actively contribute modifications to expand the game...- If you seeing a developer actively spending time to improve their game...Then please consider having a look at Space Engineers.

								Space Engineers...When I first found the game it was a very enjoyable game. They added exploration in an infinite universe and the game was even more awesome. Yes, it had some bugs, some were even painful, but most had workarounds....so far I've put over 2500 hours into it...in the neighborhood of 14 non-stop weeks worth of playing.......And then the dev's 'improved' the game, providing a steady flow of features the majority of players don't care about and in the process not only failed to fix the preexisting bugs but introduced more bugs as they went. If the devs stopped all development and stabilized what is already there and put thier focus on fixing the bugs the players have been complaining about since the beginning and THEN once the code is stable moving forward with new features only after ensure they aren't reintroducing old bugs, then it woud be a good game. As is it is usually unplayable and not worth the time at any price and I would not recommend it....nor will I play it, other than to periodically start it up and test the same major broken things.If the day comes that Keen finally fixes the game then I will change my review. So long as they continue to develop without first fixing the preexisting problems I will continue to give them the thumbs down they deserve.			"

								If this game were only creative mode, it would still be one of the greatest games ever made.  I used to describe the game as 'Minecraft in Space', but I think that analogy falls very short of the truth.  I've seen people build things in this game that just boggle the mind.  One person used a simple set of rotors to make a tank tread that was far more amazing than if the programmers had just put a stock tank tread component into the game.  Another person used a series of timers to build an autonomous mining drone that could be set loose to gather materials while the player performed other tasks.  The key word in the title of this game isn't 'Space', it's 'Engineers'.			"

								Space Engineers, my Part time 'job' for the last two years. It was the foundations from which I wanted to become a game developer and 3D artist. And I have seen it grow since it's inception.There are very good reasons why this game is as highly rated and prized for it's gameplay and development, and also as much reasons why it is still following the early access model.As I am writing this, it has been a few months since I had a long session of building and interacting with the community. The long hours I made in this game and the great people I met on the workshop and forums are the reasons I am still coming back. This game is a timesink, but the reasons why you play differ per player. I am of the creative sorts and love sharing my creations on the workshop. Others may jump into a survival server and love the interaction and building together with friends or anyone at all.The game has a solid foundation, with a lot of potential, yet a lack of polish. That is now written of as 'early access' yet it also seems that the focus of SE lies on the core mechanics, and allowing their players and dedicated modders to expand on the assets, code and additional features one would find in competitor games. I myself have never indulged myself in the survival and multiplayer scene in the way SE presents it to their players. I prefer working in self made scenarios and creating the sandbox environment as a filming studio. Making machinimas or just a show and tell.  I have had a blast with this game, yet sometimes you need a break to rewind your creative gears. I have had a break of a few months before, and when my time is plenty again, I will definitely get back building!ProsUnique physics and deformation engineContinues updates and community feedbackUnlimited value if you are into sandbox games and space. (2000 hrs and counting)MultiplayerModding support.Many other things.ConsTerrible User interfaceLack of Polish in models, characters, variety and depth of existing game elements A lot of work arounds and limitations in gameplay. In the form of artificial maximum speeds and stopping physics calculations at certain speeds.Multiplayer is not reliable (Netcode is not done on the moment of writing this)Many other things aswell halas. Final VerdictIt is a platfrom perfect to continue your creativity and physics nonsense you expect from other sandbox games. I love this game to death, the team behind it is great and the community is one of the friendliest I ever encountered.			"

								I've been playing Space Engineers since it released on Steam. Before symmetry mode was a thing, before survival mode, before thruster damage or multiplayer or many common mechanics were implemented.  I've got nearly 430 hours into it now, and I'll definitely rack up a lot more. Here's why. -Infinite possibilities. Do you want to build a racetrack in space and dash around in gravity-tethered go-carts? You can do that. Demolition derby? Sure, that's feasible. Starfighter dogfights? Yup, you bet'cha. Capital ship slugfests? Seen 'em, they're pretty. Just build without restrictions, build whatever you can imagine? Ayup. Survival mode? Oh, oh hell yeah. -MultiplayerSometimes sketchy, but generally reliable as of the last few patches, Space Engineers multiplayer is genuinely fun. Not in the shoot 'em up bang bang pew pew sort of way, more of the mutual cooperation so you don't all suffocate and die horribly in space sort of way. It's a huge change of pace, and the recent updates have made it feasible to do more than merely survive. You can explore, you can wander the 'verse and see all the beauty and horror it has to offer. -PhysicsDem physics doe. Needs a little fine-tuning in places but it works out brilliantly otherwise, and allow for artificial gravity and zero-gravity to happily coexist. Crashes are spectacular, damage from kinetic torpedoes is impressive, and for the non-combat oriented, it's just plain fun to fiddle with the physics in this game. From making orbiting satellites to devising new and innovative ways to send things flying at ludicrous speeds. -Update speedKSH is awesome. They push out updates every Thursday, barring major holidays or a sudden and inexplicable bear assault on their offices. They work hard to keep the game up to snuff and it shows with just how far its come in relatively little time. -Steam Workshop IntegrationSeriously awesome. Want a mod? Grab it. Want to play with someone's ship? Snag the blueprint. Want a new skybox? Done. New world? Easy peasy. Workshop is an amazing tool and it allows you to very easily - and very rapidly - add new spins on the base game. -KSH is awesomeSo good they deserve their own bullet point. These guys work hard, are creative, are pretty honest about where they're at and what's going on, and push out updates and fixes like clockwork. They're enthusiastic about their product, they're in touch with their playerbase, they listen to their playerbase, and they're willing to learn from their mistakes so that they can overcome future hurdles. They're working hard and the game is only getting better with each passing week. If you're on the fence about this game, don't be. It's a good, solid title. It has its bugs, yes, it has its glitches and its problems, but they've spent several weeks weeding out the bulk of the problems and it plays pretty smoothly now. There's modding support, multiplayer, survival mode, creative mode, and they're rolling out exploration-oriented content - plus patches every Thursday. Not much beats that. If you like  building games, buy it. If you like mining games, buy it. If you like exploring, buy it. Some folks say it's minecraft in space, and in a sense it is. It's virtual legos for sci-fi gamers and hopeful shipbuilders, and it's just flat-out fantastic for it. Strongly, strongly recommended.			"

Early Access Review
								Grumbles and curses abound as I am forced to reconstruct my space station for the 50th time.  A botched docking by my somewhat less-skilled colleague melted half the platforms off, and now we’re both trying to catch the bits that are left floating through space. A few minutes of work later we complete the job, just as a business shipment appears at the edge of our sector. A silent nod later, he’s in an interceptor and I’m in a cargo whale both chasing down the hapless vessel. I attach to the front end and slow it to a stop with my powerful thrusters, before both of us rush through and check for traps. I cut through a block, without realising that it was where the entire front end was attached. My colleague grumbles and curses as the dissected ship gently drifts apart. Looks like we have another engineering problem… in space.			"

												This Review is VERY outdated! This is the review of the game back in December of 2013! Thank you all for reading!A bit about the game and developers. Space Engineers is a sandbox game about engineering, construction and maintenance of space works. Imagine it as Minecraft in space, where you can fly what ever you build by your own hands. This game is still in a very early Alpha stage, therefore you must know that a lot of things might, and most likely will change. Space Engineers is being developed by Keen Software House, which are the same guys behind Vrage and Miner Wars.About Gameplay.As said above, Space Engineers is something like Minecraft. Currently the game futures only Creative game mode, in which the player has unlimited resources. Player can just open his inventory, put the items into the toolbar and use how he / she wishes to use it. But there is a small twist. This game is not a voxel based game, therefore building something is much harder than most of the other games. You have to turn the object how you see fit. And putting other objects might be a bit hard, since the objects maybe won't be in a good angle.There are many various items that you can use to build your small ship, big ship or a station. As it is probably obvious, You can fly small and big ship, but you can't fly a station. And you really wanted to make a huge carrier, didn't you? Well no problem! Just make a massive big ship. Make it so big that it can actually keep other big ships inside of it! Nothing and no one can stop you from doing that! Will it be slow? Of course it will, but you still did it! You can really build what ever type of a space ship or a space station that you wanted to. The game also has a lot of very nice parts that look nice inside of the stations, such as doors or inner walls, etc.Everything in this game is destructible. And by that, i mean everything that you have built, or your friend. Even if it's an accident, you can't stop it. If your ship is about to crash into a station, you can do your best to evade it but you will most likely fail, and destroy half of the station and the ship. And the amazing thing is that the developers actually put the effort into that! The destructed objects look amazing!I have to say, this game will have multiplayer in the future. The developers have already confirmed that a long time ago. And I can tell you, the multiplayer of this game is going to be amazing! Imagine four or five player building massive ships and stations. Gosh, I can't wait to do that! Even though the game is in very early alpha, and it really doesn't offer too much to do for now, exploring the current content of the game already showed me that this game has a lot of potential, and that it might actually have a very bright future!Graphic and AudioGraphically speaking the game looks very good, but it's nothing too special. The visual effects of explosions are very good, and destroyed items look amazing. The game's building ""blocks"" don't look the same. In fact, they are built in a way that they keep ""continuing"" each other all the time, therefore each part of your ship looks somewhat different. The game also futures coloring, therefore you can have a rainbow ship! Well, you can't really make that but you can try. Music on the other hand isn't anything too special. It's very fun at the beginning, but it gets rather repeatable after a while.Pros, cons and final grade.Pros:- Space sandbox building game.- Multiplayer in the future.- A lot of different ""blocks"" with which you can make many, many different ships.- Ability to mine through the asteroids and get minerals. We will see what will we be able to use them for in the near future.Cons:- Jet pack is very hard to use.- Flying anything is very hard, and there is almost no way to stop your ship mid-air. It will keep on flying away.Final Grade: 7.5/10Extra Info: As mentioned earlier, this game looks very promising. I can guarantee that as soon as this game releases multiplayer, it will be much better and much more fun. We just have to wait and see what will the developers do!And also, I wish everyone Happy holidays! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to everyone!			"

Early Access Review
								After 1089 hours of gameplay.. time for a review!I've never been hooked to a game before... I tend to hop from one game to another.This one is a game changer.If you liked minecraft, sandboxes, military, building, complexity, puzzles, exploring, crafting, doing whatever you want...This game is for you.It's a complex game with a steep learning curve. But when you get the edge of it, this game breaks the limits of many games out there. (watch for the links at the end of the review)I play most of the time in Survival PVP Multiplayer (because objectives and challenges increases in a big way compared to pure PVE in this game i.e. military component gameplay), and sometimes in Creative to experiment new designs, weapons and new engineering processes.Many will complain about the lag, stability, bugs unfixed for months... it's all true but Keen opened their software for the community to help enhance it further, server admins and community developers to push the limits of what is possible while Keen work on the core component of the game. To some degree, you need to accept to adapt. If that doesn't work for you, then don't buy this game. Personally, I don't have any problems in adapting, working around bugs and enjoy everything this game has to offer so far. This is definitely one of the best game I ever had in my collection.That being said, check out my website where I show a list of highly recommended servers to play on (survival PVP), best line of conduct in a PVP server, and how to get started fast: http://trement.com/seacadIf you like Star Trek and roleplay, you could also visit this blog post: http://www.trement.com/space-engineers-starship-commandingYou can also follow me on my workshop for new ship designs (battle tested, survival PVP approved)See you in space!

Early Access Review
								Space Engineers combines space sim with building and does so extremely well. While the Early Access has a lot of bugs, mostly affecting multiplayer, it is still a blast to play building and flying whatever type of ship you want. It has more than just simple building blocks (the default armor blocks) including things like reactors, solar panels, gatling guns, turrets, pistons, rotors, cargo containers, and more - all of which work and have their own functions. Carefully-designed slope blocks allow you to build ships and stations that only look somewhat ""blocky"", compared to the cubes-only approach of other building games. Space Engineers supports mods like nearly no other game does, with the ability to add mods to a server, and have the clients automatically download the same mods from the Steam workshop. Because of this approach, everybody in a multiplayer game runs the same mods, all without an external modding program! So you see Earth in your skybox? So do the other players. Got custom weapons for your ship? So does everybody else. I expect this server-based mod approach to become more common to where it becomes the standard. For Early Access, Keen has done an excellent job with updates and hotfixes that come out weekly (on Thursdays), meaning you can log in once a week and see something fresh, as well as see that progress is being made constantly. This shows me they are serious about the game and they aren't going to just shelf this game before release or before it's ready. With the update for players to manually control ship turrets, as well as the player-faction features, this game is becoming more and more co-op supportive, where you can control a large ship with multiple players in different roles. Then you could use that ship against other players' crews in PvP, or fight AI once that is implemented (or when mods add AI ships to fight). Some of the more interesting things you can currently build include: gravity drives, remote-controlled torpedoes, orbital drones, retractable weapons, rotating antenna arrays, giant miners for strip-mining asteroids, detachable countermeasures (decoys), automatically-opening doors (sensors), and escape pods. Once they fix the Early Access bugs and add enough features to release out of Early Access, I have a feeling this will be in many top 10 lists of best space games for a long time, if it isn't already.

Early Access Review
								Been putting this off for a while now, but due to recent spates of negative reviews i think it would be a good idea to make one, if only to make people more aware.First off before the actual review i will write a warning to newer players.This game is unfinished, do not judge it based on its current bugs as they are being fixed. People who claim that development is taking too long need to realize that this was being developed by a very small dev team for quite some time until relatively recently (and a good portion of the current dev team is fairly new to game development), that they are working on two games at once (medieval engineers), and that they used better part of a year developing planets at the demands of the community (which a few members of the long term community think was a mistake. That is open to speculation). In other words, cut them some slack.This game is EXTREMELY GPU and RAM intensive, i do not suggest running it with less than 8gbs, (16 recommended). Also bear in mind that some planets will refuse to load on low end GPUs and that others will run badly. For example you will run Mars at 30 odd fps on a GTX 750ti, 50-60 on a 980. Earth and the alien planet will run at 50-60 fps on a GTX 980ti (basically a titan x with less vram). I also hear that AMD cards and CPUs run worse than their Intel and Nvidia counterparts, though this is inconsitant.As such i STRONGLY suggest you stay away from planets if you have a weaker GPU, i can manage 40fps on intel integrated graphics in space.Multiplayer is currently broken, though new netcode is on the way and indications are that it is nearly complete. Stay away from dedicated servers until it drops, private games with 2-6 people run perfectly fine for the most part, though i do not recommend using pistons and rotors, they will invoke to wrath of Clang (the patron god of Space engineers and utter ruin).That just about covers it for the warning, i will add more as i either remember things or otherwise find out more.---------------------Now, for the actual review.Space engineers is a semi realistic sci-fact voxel based building and exploration game (emphasis on the building part).In this game you will build, mine and fight pirates (single player) and other players (multiplayer) in the hope of creating massive battleships to oppress the peasants, and defend what you own. You can build basically any ship from movies, other games and TV series, or something original (but mostly you will end up building flying bricks due to your lack of aesthetic skill), the only limits are your imagination, and your computer.Mining for resources is actually very fun in this game due to deformable terrain.The fighting part could use a little work, but it does the job fine for the moment.The exploration element is similar (if not somewhat superior) to that found in Elite: Dangerous, difference being the main reasons are to find a nice looking place for a base, look for resources, or if you have both, look for the community made ships that are placed extremely infrequently across the galaxy. Rather than just to have your name on a planet, though you can do that too if you really want.The UI is, to be honest a little daunting at first, but it does the job. The graphics are some of the best in the genre, and the models and effects are currantly being improved.The music is decent (love the title screen song), but after a while you get a little tired of it. The modding community is absolutely fantastic, on par if not better than the Skyrim one.Infact the community in general is superb for the most part. Probably the best i have found yet.The game is updated every week on thursday, and hotfixes released as soon as they are finished.Youtubers for this game in general are great, i suggest VideoSage, XP gamers and W4stedspace.That about covers it for the review. TL;DR To me this game is fantastic and has the potential to be even better, and it looks like the devs are going to deliver.8.5/10Edit: Before putting a dislike in, make a comment so I know what you disagree on and how i can help fix it.

								I now have over 2100 hours played in this game. I have also contributed to the community by creating a workshop mod for the game with over 8000 subscribers. After all of this... it pains me to say this... DON'T BUY THIS GAME.Why? Plain and simple, the developers are better at breaking their game than building or maintaining it. The game has been in pre-release for almost 4 years. In that time the developers have added many amazing features via a weekly update schedule. They are very good at keeping to the weekly update schedule, but they are very bad at coding, or testing, or maybe they are just bad at giving a crap if things even work or not. The weekly updates usually include bug fixes, visual enhancements, or brand new features. The problem is that every update seems to break functionality that was previously working. Then in the following week they will release a fix for something they broke, which usually breaks something else.The concept of the game is great, I love it. The game is great fun to play solo or in a multiplayer environment. When you first start playing this game you may love it. But when you start finding all of the broken features that make your in game plans impossible, your enjoyment and fun quickly turn to frustration and maybe even anger. At this point you will find yourself eagerly anticipating each weekly update in hopes that the broken bits get fixed and you can again enjoy the game. The problem is, for every fix they make, they break something else. Sometimes multiple things.All in all Space Engineers is fun when it is working right and VERY frusterating when not working right. After about 2 years now owning this game, I have rarely seen the game working right. I now have serious doubts that the game will ever reach full release, and if it does it will be so unstable and bug filled that you are better off not wasting your time or money on this game.If things improve in the future I may re-write my review... but after following this game for 2 years... their track record indicates that probably won't happen.

								Minecraft in space. More fun, more physics, more possibilities, longer learning curve. Still, it also has the same primary failing as Minecraft: there is little or no external motivator but your own desire to build, and the greatest danger to your life is actually pressing the Helmet Off key. Nevertheless a challenging sandbox that accomodates many play styles.			"

								I'm giving Space Engineers a marginal thumbs down at this point (October 2014). There's a lot to like, but also a lot of frustration, if you happen to take the game's name at all seriously. As it stands, it's not so much about ""engineering"" in space as about wartime industry...As a sandbox platform, Space Engineers is enormously promising. The construction system is beautifully executed, with a great 'mechanical' feel to it. Harvesting ore, refning and building are great fun. The adjustable pace means you can spend little time grinding, lots of time building. Best of all, the problems of movement in zero-gravity are beautifully solved by an intuitive control system.Unfortunately, the emphasis in successive updates has gradually shifted almost entirely to PvP - more weapons, more targeting systems, more ways to blow up your friends' bases, and/or defend your own. Obviously, a lot of players are thrilled. But this new direction belies the name ""Space Engineers."" That name suggests an emphasis on building, and doesn't even hint at destruction or combat.Meanwhile, the 'adventure' backdrop remains bland and featureless, so there's no incentive to build and explore. Just as you're starting to enjoy the brilliant ""space engineering"" in this game, you run out of challenges. You really need just one good mining ship and one factory base. All the ore you need can be found just about anywhere. There are no NPCs or mobs. No interesting places to go. No need for shipping, no opportunity for trade, or discovery. No skill tree, or experience to earn. No requirement for food - just metal ore. Not even a need to pressurize your habitats - air isn't a concept, so air-locks just get in the way, and you quickly learn to not bother building them. True, you can go ahead and build fanciful structures in creative mode. But really, they're all going to be either a) space ships or b) space stations. And there's nothing in the environment to create any meaning in any finer distinctions. Larger ships? Why? There's nothing to transport, no place to take it. Scout ships? Why? There's nowhere to go that isn't exactly like where you are already. More elaborate space stations? Why? With no air, you don't really need a closed-in space at all -  a big open platform is far more practical.I keep hoping that the developers will turn their attention back to sandbox play. Add a few new world types - perhaps with some rare ores that would need searching out. With AI mobs that might randomly challenge your building or defensive ability (without being as wantonly destructive as human players). NPCs that would give you some reason to establish shipping routes, or to build specialized bases and ships. In short, an actual game to make this sandbox come alive.So, bottom line, I'm giving Space Engineers a thumbs down at this point. PvP fans can ignore this: go ahead an enjoy blowing up each other's elaborate constructions. It's not my idea of fun, but it seems to amuse quite a few people. I'll keep hoping the developers eventually get back to adding more adventure-type elements, and give me a reason to revise this review.UPDATE: November 4, 2015A year has gone by, and Space Engineers is still in Early Access. And I'm still not going to put my thumb up, though it's closer to horizontal than before.Space Engineers continues to be a beautifully-designed 'sandbox.' The controls are elegant, the visuals are sharp (especially in DX11 mode), and the construction system is fascinating. The new blocks, the oxygen system, all that stuff is great. But it only makes Space Engineers a great platform for a game, not a game as such.A 'game' consists of a set of rules and a set of objectives. Space Engineers still has no objectives other than those you set for yourself. Calling Space Engineers a great 'game' is like calling Photoshop a 'work of art,' because it gives you the tools to create an infinite number of works of art.It's not just Space Engineers - I have the same complaint about a lot of 'sandbox' products. SimCity could use more-defined goals. But SimCity does create a sense of urgency by forcing players to balance a budget, right from the first moment. Minecraft forces players to find food, to defend against enemies, merely in order to survive. And it offers varied and surprising terrain to explore, both above and below ground. It's that sense of urgency, of discovery, that hooked me on Minecraft, and it's what I still find painfully lacking in Space Engineers.I'm definitely not saying you can't have a lot of fun with Space Engineers (as long as you don't mind making your own fun). I simply can't recommend Space Engineers as a game, to every unknown person who reads my review. The Steam thumb only has two positions.			"

								Do I recommend this this game... Looks at hours played... 1,570.2 Hours on record... Yeah, it's okay I guess.In all honesty, there are few games that have kept my attention, despite having moments that make me want to flip my desk as well. I'm referring to weekly patches that add new parts, fix bugs, and also break things. It is not uncommon to have a week or so every now and then where I simply cannot play the game at all due to a crash, but usually a week later that crash is fixed and I can play as normal again.I have played this game for quite some time, so I have seen it progress a lot from the days when it first came out. This is also one of the few games where I both love and loathe the community. While normally not a part of my reviews, with such passionate fans of the game, the community is partially responsible for the direction the game has gone and that means the devs do listen. On the same token, sometimes you wish the devs would stop listening to the community and polish what they have already implemented. Yes, it is Early Access, but at some point you cannot use that as crutch considering it has been 2 years.Overall, I do recommend this game. While I do have to set it down on occassion, sometimes for a week or more at a time, it is one of those games that every Thursday I watch the patch video, read the notes, and sink a few hours in.

Early Access Review
								Space Engineers is a sandbox space building game based around building and destroying space ships of all sizes that is currently available on Steam Early Access. The game features endless maps which can be customised in many different ways in two different scenarios, creative and survival. Creative mode gives you unlimited numbers of blocks, infinite health and removes some gameplay aspects whereas in survival you have to mine to create your own materials, you can easily die and you have limited inventory space.While this game is great to play with friends it can be a bit boring to play by yourself unless you're very creative so bear that in mind when you purchase it. Also, please note I am capable of commenting on the realism of the game's physics as I study physics and mechanics.+The physics in motion are good and seem realistic to me+Graphics are okay, they aren't the best but they aren't the worst either+You have lots of info displayed about your character and your ship (if you are in one) such as mass, speed and fuel left+It's a lot of fun to fly around in smaller ships (better handling) and it's also fun when flying in larger ship to crash them in to each other+The building system is pretty simple and easy to use once you get the hang of it+The multiplayer is good and playing with friends is a blast, until that one friend we all have decides to crash his ship into yours after an hour of building it+Lots of hotkeys/controls including one which toggles the HUD, great for taking screenshots+Workshop intergration is good and there are a lot of very good mods available-Momentum doesn't seem right at all, when two objects collide (no matter what the size) a few blocks will break off and some will be crushed/deformed but that's it, the object that crashes into the stationary object will sometimes rebound off of it or they will both remain stationary. From what I know presuming the velocities of the two objects do not cancel (which they cannot in this situation) either one object or both of them should carry on moving, the sum of the two secondary velocities should be the same as there is no friction to take into consideration and the secondary velocities should be in the same ratios as their mass is. (I hope all of this makes sense).-With all the controls (I think most keys are used) it is very difficult to get in to and learn and it's also hard to understand some of the different mechanics such as mining-The default skybox isn't particularly high quality-You can't pause even when playing offline-Character animations aren't great and don't look realistic in my opinion-The price seems a bit too high for what you getWorth a mention:-The game has long loading times due to the size of the maps and how much stuff is in them-If you have a low end PC or Laptop it's unlikely you'll be able to run it, the game slows down a lot when a lot is going onVerdict:7This is a good physics based builder despite it's issues that is best enjoyed with a few friends, I'd suggest waiting for this to get a sale before buying.El K.

Who:You the Astronaut, First Person or Third Person.What:Block building system in meters for small and large ships, and stations. Four tools allow you to construct, deconstruct, mine for resources, and shoot stuff.When:Distant enough future to have gravity generators and warp drives.Where:A small asteroid cluster, generated field of asteroids, or planets.Why:Minecraft in Space.Significance:Creative and Survival modes that give the player of hours of creative and destructive power in the zero-gravity of space, and now within planet atmosperes.Pros:Ability to mod plus an already extensive list of blocks makes for a flexible sandbox in space. Multiplayer.Cons:Velocity capped at a little over 100 m/s and other bad physics design choices. Large ships, many ships, large bases, and now planets create performance problems. No in-game economy (trade ships are planned, but generally you mine resources simply to waste time in survival mode).Summary:You'll spend most of your time making ships, and then wanting to show them off or fly them around. That by itself is enough reason to buy this game. Add in multiplayer and then mods and it only gets more interesting. If you think you have a high-end computer this game will test that notion.			"

Early Access Review
								All the negative reviews of the game, saying that the game is unfinished, with poor graphics and optimization...they're not wrong. But they aren't right, either.The game is in an alpha state, and there WILL be bugs, specially in multiplayer (but that's going to be fixed in about 3 months when new netcode is implemented). Right now the game is almost feature complete. There is way more things to explore than in other games. You could spend a thousand hours on the game yet you wouldn't explore it fully.What annoys the people and make them post negative reviews are the details. It's true that the game has undergone some reckless patches, without any clear goal (remember they patch the game once a week. That puts big pressure on the devs, needing to release features to keep the community happy), but the new roadmap for 2016 states that things will start to be tidier.New models, new textures, new UI.  The game is not going to stay like this forever; it will eventually become and look like a finished game. So although the models aren't that pretty, the features are there, aren't they?Even though cargo containers might be ugly modeled, they are functional, and that's what counts.About the ""reckless last patches"". If you bothered to read, you'd know that the new game netcode is being developed RIGHT NOW, so don't expect big patches unless the netcode is released.Let me tell you some of the things you have right now at space engineers: Pistons: Yeah, they are buggy right now IN MULTIPLAYER, but that'll get fixed. In single player they are functional. Rotors: Hanger doors, Robotic arms, hidden turrets, moving platforms... Conveyors: Item sorting, automated power / item transfer between ships...Combine with rotors for epic. Planets: Fully moddable planets which add several engineering challenges, such as getting out of the atmosphere of a planet (yes, there is gravity and it's not that easy to get out of the planet, specially in survival), or surviving the long trips between planets. Remote control and Drones: You can send your ship out of the planet without even being aboard. Obviously, this is not easy to do, and requires engineering (and maybe, programming skills if you want more functionality) Programmable Blocks: There is an extensive API out of which you can make automated ship station, item sorters, radars, status reports, cargo managers... Or just display the time in an LCD. Huge modding community: The developers are also focusing on adding modding support to many areas of the game, and right now there is a bunch of mods that ADD REAL FUNCTIONALITY to the game, plus cosmetic ones that look absolutely amazing. Awesome ship designs in the Workshop: You can get an idea of what kind of ships you can make taking a look at some designs made by other people. You can recreate ships from films and series, like star wars, or from games like FTL. The game offer great building mechanics that make it suitable for a wide range of styles.So yeah, the game is not BUG FREE, nor FEATURE COMPLETE, but right now it can give you LOTS OF FUN for many hours, and many engineering possibilities with all the mechanisms / machines included currently in the game.The only serious con I'd see right now is optimization. Seriously, if you want to play on planets with large ships, be sure to get a high-tier gaming rig. I have a 970 which seems enough for the game, and an i5 (this game is CPU intensive!!)The game will eventually get more and more optimized for less powerful computers whatsoever.TLDR: Despite all the bugs and placeholder models in the game, it offers many features which are already in the game and WILL give you a lot of fun, specially if you play with friends -expect bugs if you play multiplayer -.Don't get scared because of negative reviews. The game right now is just developing new netcode and thus the weekly patches are not AWESOME and they introduce some bugs to the game. "

Early Access Review
								Update as of 2014-06-27:The devs of this game are amazing, and have been adding in so many of the features that players want!This game is not yet ready for everyone, but what content is already complete is mad fun and has put this game on the top of my watchlist. With multiplayer, survival mode, and the endless possibilities in your creations, this game has the potential to rival Minecraft as one of the best voxel sandbox building games.The screenshots and videos are deceiving and make the game look much more static than it really is. For some reason, the creators focused more on the ability to crash ships than on how much control you have over creating things. You place every single block on your ship. You can build a ship or station in any shape you could possibly imagine. And then fly them around!As I write this on April 6th, 2014, there are some important issues with the game that are worth pointing out to those who are considering the purchase.Edit: There are now dedicated servers. :)#1) There are no dedicated servers for multiplayer yet. This means that most MP servers are at least a little laggy, making certain actions in the game very difficult. Being a more tolerant alpha tester, this has not stopped me from having hours of fun in multiplayer working with other space engineers. If smooth co-op is a must for you, I would wait until dedicated servers are out to consider playing.Edit: There are now conveyors, connector blocks, merge blocks, vacuumming blocks and debris ejectors. :D#2) There are some important blocks and features yet to be implemented to make the game more complete. These include conveyors (due in the next 2-3 weeks), pipes, large ship mining drills, working large ship weapons, factions, and automated defenses. These features are all planned, however, and will allow some fantastic gameplay. Fully automated transferring of resources from your mining ships, natural anti-griefing mechanics with defenses that shoot down anyone not in your faction, and more exciting gameplay when capturing randomly spawned NPC ships.My favorite things about this game so far are as follows:A) Jetpack. I can't tell you how many times I have died in Minecraft from building megastructures. That is not an issue in Space Engineers where jetpacks are part of the vanilla game and even have built-in balancing elements (your suit can run out of energy).B) Your creations move. I have always dreamed of building a car in Minecraft. Yes, there are mods to do anything, but when comparing the vanilla games, Space Engineers really delivers here. You can already built a huge (and I mean HUGE) ship to carry your refineries, assemblers, cargo, and even a fleet of smaller ships in your hand-built hangars. This part of the game is just amazing. In my single-player map, I already have a very simple carrier that acts as a fully-equipped, portable space station complete with landing decks for my mining rig and prototype torpedo bomber. I get goose pimples thinking about how the game will play with dedicated servers, player factions, and screaming, ""GET TO YOUR SHIPS"" to my buddies as we scramble fighters to respond to a player attack.C) Extremely high player-impact. This is the main thing I enjoy in any game. In Minecraft, you build your own base, terraform the land, and change the world permanently. Others can come and admire your hard work and creativity. In Space Engineers, all this is true, but you could go as far to make a flying city and bring your creations with you anywhere you go. Make your ships as stylish or as ridiculous as you please, and it will change your experience and the experience of others.D) Promising update schedule. Every Thursday the devs come out with an update, many of which contain new items and loads of fixes. This will make the alpha testing phase that much more exciting for me and indicates that the game will mature nicely.Conclusion: This game has already earned its keep for me. It has cool physics, encourages player creativity, has the potential for some of the best multiplayer action of any sandbox. It may just rival Minecraft in terms of enjoyment and long-lasting, good memories. I give the alpha version 8.7/10 Prawns, with a few more Prawn-Points depending on what the devs accomplish in the near future. Now back to designing my battleship.			"

Early Access Review
Where I am coming from:I played about 360 hours from the time that I bought the game to the time that I write this review. I bought the game right after multiplayer was released in January 2014. This was before survival was introduced. At the time I was very disheartened by a few bad early access titles that were just disappointing.I looked into the Miner Wars history of Keen Software House, and decided that - even though that was a kind of flop - this game was worth a look into. Maybe a bit of fun with friends. My dream was always to play a game that let you walk around on small planetoids, building your own stuff. After playing games like Cargo Commander I kinda got into the genre. I played a lot of creative at first with my friends and we built huge ships and had fun gunfights.After a while, when they got bored and survival got introduced, I found a very nice multiplayer RP server with different factions set up and had the time of my life as a Drone Engineer.My opinion of the development and further notes to the multiplayer:Let me mention a few things about the development of the game (which after all is very important if you read this).I don't know if it was from the point on that I bought the game or shortly after that, but the devs (KSH) promised not to promise any features or announce set dates for certain features and introduced weekly updates. Yeah, that's right, one update to the game every single week. That is features, bugfixes and in addition to that hotfixes for big bugs between updates. For me, this shows dedication. This is the game that let me put trust into early access games again. Simply for that fact I adore it. I have never been as hyped about any game as this, and I played a lot of games. The devs react to feedback very fast, and the community really makes a difference.Almost all of the features the game has were suggested at some point by us. Planets, scenarios (with set objectives) and multiplayer improvements are already in the works at the time of this post (you can read that up at Marek Rosas Dev Blog[blog.marekrosa.org] ). At this point I have to mention that multiplayer is playable, but you might want to avoid certain things like landing gears, pistons and rotors on ships for now (perfectly fine on stations) as the netcode can't quite handle the synchronization between clients.My opinion of the game / features / options:The game has a very thought through, realistic (Newtonic) look at the Space Survival genre, which I would put this into.One of the things that often get overlooked is the amount of options available. Not only does this game have all the necessary sliders (seperate audio volumes, FOV, maximized borderless window option, ... ), you can completely customize almost every feature ingame. A few of those options are mods (which there are thousands of, from blocks over skyboxes, character models, animations, ship blueprints to custom asteroids and scripts) with full workshop support, but also things like the amount of inventory space, production speed, world size (which by the way is currently able to generate worlds that take about 150 realtime years from the center to traverse at standard speed - which if you don't want can be modified, yay - with randomized asteroids and soon planets).You can customize view distance, which makes this playable on pretty old machines, even without the beta optimizations that are about to come in still. (Remember, this is in alpha stage)Also tons of other options that en- or disable all kinds of ingame features, should you want / not want them.Creative mode:- If you play creative you can build whatever you want (from cubes of death to star destroyers, your favourite space station or a small fighter) instantly without needing any resources- There is a mirror mode that allows you to build quickly and efficiently with symmetry- You can copy paste small parts of a creation (onto other parts if you want) which allows you quick builds with forms and structures you like, which helps a lot if you don't think you are creative enough for a whole big ship- You are able to spawn in any ingame object, be it resources, weapons or even whole asteroids- Talking about asteroids, there is also a voxel tool which lets you deform asteroids to any shape you want (it also lets you replace materials)- There is a blueprint system in place, which lets you transfer projections of the ships you built in creative to survival, which makes rebuilding the thing only a matter of resources and timeSurvival mode:- This game is a sandbox game, meaning there is no set objective (yet) to ""finishing"" the game- ""Exploration"" mode offers almost infinite world generation (as mentioned in the features section) with random encounters which range from small ships, to cruisers or large battleships to stations (most of them created by the community)- Survival has a lot of facettes to it that require planning (energy generation, oxygen, storage and production facilities) that may initally seem very complex, but the community is always there to help- It is possible to use programming blocks to display things via LCD panels, control stations or ship behaviour (really, almost anything you can imagine, if you get into it, someone for example made an autopilot ship and a customizable interface for pilots that let you see every room status and interact with all the different subsystems, just imagine, you get an enemy player alert in your ship, which then leads to depressurization of rooms, so that your enemies can't breathe there or get sucked out into space)- You can create gravity weapons (like a huge space shotgun that shoots out projectiles), gravity drives with artificial mass blocks, which, if correctly done, can get even the biggest and bulkiest ships to maximum speed in a matter of a few seconds- But even relatively simple things like building your own mining ship or fighter are highly enjoyable and feel rewardingFinal thoughts / prospects:For me personally it is enough to gather resources, take over enemy weaponized cargo ships that are floating by and creating awesome stations and battleships, aswell as designing them. But man, this game already offers so much more than that. I have never seen a more polished early access game. From RP mining to dogfights in space or replicating your favourite scene from Star Wars, this game has it all!Community links:The reddit with very important tips in the sidebar, like controlsThe wiki[www.spaceengineerswiki.com]The official forums[forums.keenswh.com] "

								Space Engineers is one of those games that you buy hoping it won't disappoint.You start playing on a quick-start world and you wonder what on earth you paid for - a handful of spaceships, a platform with some weird machines stuck to it, a gatling turret that looks... interesting. You fly them around, you crash them, you marvel at the effects. You experiment with crashing different ships into different other ships at different speeds and angles. You accidentally turn on the gatling turret and wonder wtf happened the first time it shoots your cockpit off your ship. Now you need a new ship.So you start to learn how to build your own ships (your first ones will be crap - don't lose heart!) After your first real success, you wonder what the limits are (note: you will run out of ram before the game runs out of program).Then you find the workshop (this is a good time to have a quick browse) and you realise you've been thinking small. Childishly small. And not nearly intricate enough.You stop building Luke Skywalker's X-wing and start to build MACHINES. Machines that EAT ASTEROIDS and SH*T COMPONENTS, machines that fire TORPEDO WARHEADS through space with GRAVITY CANNONS, machines that WALK, ROLL, CRANK, STOMP, RACE, SHOOT, DIG, machines that BUILD MORE MACHINES.And then you find multiplayer. And multiplayer reminds you that building stuff is fun and all, but when some f***er is trying to blow your stuff up, you tend not to build to super-cool stuff until you've built defenses. And then you realise this is a survival server, and your defenses are going to take the rest of today to mine, refine, assemble and construct.Better start planning for tomorrow.			"

								Great game, but a VERY GOOD PC IS REQUIRED, NO EXCEPTIONS!!I play singleplayer only, so I have no experience with multiplayer. I am also very patient, so loading, lag spikes, etc. do not bother me, but might bother others. Updates weeksly, getting better all the time. Simple ReviewPros:- Realistic (as a game can be with physics and the sort)- Great destruction physics- Fun to experiment- The good kind of frustration- Playable for hours- Make a train that goes from planet to planet (Personal achievement :) )Cons:- Buggy (But, hey, its early access, what do you expect?)- Required a very good build (I have i5-4690k, gtx 960 and get about 40fps on PLANETS on medium settings and well over 60fps in OPEN SPACE)- Big loading time for planets and large worlds with lots of ships (personally doesn't bother me, as there is no other loading once you get into the world)- Not much elseGreat game, if its on sale BUY IT, you wont regret it. Full price? BUY IT, you wont regret that either!			"

								Space Engineers is a brilliant, sandbox style game that has all of the trappings of an awesome multiplayer experience. In single player mode, Space Engineers is a dream come true, offering the ability to build and maintain spacecraft and ground craft with a wide variety of very compelling parts.However, 3 years in and multiplayer is still largely unplayable due to physics/netcode issues. Back when the game first was released, we played for a while until the physics engine ate several ships through unexpected interactions with landing feet. A year later we tried again and found that interacting with any ship in motion, even in LAN play on direct ethernet connections was a recipe for disaster as the mismatch between the server and client about the exact location of a ship would cause the two to spontaneously (and destructively) collide.Move forward to the planet release. We ended up quitting when one of our rovers (made of large blocks) ended up clipping and falling through the planet. Fast forward again till the June 9 patch. Here we had one person fall into a planet while mining, as well as two ships and one base that were eaten by physics. One magically started floating off while in a gravity well and would kill anyone who touched a certain part, and another where a ship that on the client side was fully stopped went careening into the base causing critical damage to both.In all the game's biggest weakness when it was initially put into early access was multiplayer physics/netcode, and truth be told, that is still its biggest shortcoming. The introduction of planets (and more relevantly, persistent biasing forces,) has ultimately made these problems even more noticeable. I might try it again in another year since I already own the game, and I will update my review then, but in the meantime I don't believe I can recommend purchasing the game in its current state, though remember this game is still technically early access, so things will likely change. Whether it's for the better is yet to be seen though.			"

								This game started up really promising... time passed, features creeped, and now in its current form is unplayable. I thought it was just my rig, that needs a serious update, but looking at other reviews and comments on the discussions, it's not just me. The game is, in its current state, a resource hog and buggy as hell, things that used to work have gone unfixed for months now (autopilot I'm looking at you), and they aren't simple bugs, they are the kind of bugs that makes you wanna rage quit. Things that took you hours to build get destroyed in a blink of eye because... reasonsAnd what pisses me off the most, it's that now they are selling an older release (aka when the game was actually fun) as a ""deluxe edition"".

								So I am going to start off with that this game is no where near done with development. That being said, it's the best realistic physics space game that I have played. You go in expecting to make a ship from like Halo or Star Wars with engines on one side and suddenly realize that you have no control over you ship that you spent hours making, or you go to fly it and it crashes into the ground. This game teaches you how space really is and with each block able to be damaged from impacts or weapons it really changes your perspective on how space ships really should be. Plus for those interested, there is planets and a survival mode. Is the game buggy? Yes. How hard is the survival? Not very, but the mobs and meteors showers can make it a challenge if left on. How big can you make a ship? As big as your computer can handle. There's a 1 to 1 scale of an Emerial Star Destroyer on the work shop.What about land vehicles? You can make those too. Peaople have made them with wheels or with moving legs, like a working AT-AT.Is there multiplayer? Yes. It's not great but it has tremendously improved from what it was and has been pretty stable as of late.Does the developer still work on the game? There's weekly updates every Thursday.So do I recommend it? Without a doubt. It's a lot of fun and you can make some amazing things.			"

								This game is  absolutly awesome...IF you like building your spaceship before you can shoot things with it :)I'm actually rather serious, thats the only real weakness i can put my finger on, this is not a game for people who like space shooters. At All. This is a game for people who like space, spaceships, engineering, building things and who enjoy problem solving and improving something you have build.Pro's:-good dev's, passionate community, good updates.-Very nice graphics, effects need some work but they'll get there.-the basic game has allot of well thought out, community advised content and possibilities, and then you can easily add the mods in workshop to make the amount of building blocks more or less infinite. Example: basic game has rotors, pistons, armor blocks, some machines etc, giving you 100's of things to build, the mods add: variations on all that, addapted building blocks, complete overhaul of the ""look"" of all buildingblocks, completly new angles and shapes to work with, completly new in game mechanics like food and water, looks for your character, new weapons, improved blocks, etc etc.-Insanely devoted modding community, and they are well heared by the devs.-very good looking surroundings-endless spaceships, spacecannon, weapon, base, station, etc etc possibilities-very fun space battles with your friends-incredible efficient creative mode that allows multi-spectrum building-Single player or with friends is AWEsome fun, aswell as creative mode friends, wich is about building stuff to kill eachother :D Creative mod singleplayer is very relaxing and fun if you like builing fast.-as much game modes possible as you can devise.-VERY VERY DEPENDABLE UPDATE PROCES (very trustworthy devs) I can not stress this enough.Cons:- very limited survivor aspect atm, building an actual ship is some serious work in survivor mode, taking hours : mining ore, refining ore, processing into components, and assembling them components into the blocks you need. Its fun if you like that sort of thing!-Again in survivor, but in the game in general: NO enemy, the only real threat in single player is  asteroids and they are not really that fun.-Only enemy or threat in the game is in multiplayer and this system has been well worked out but is not yet finished imo.-Very very very grief prone game. One of the things cripling this game is griefers going on servers, crashing ships into other ships people have worked ours on, or just spawning in giant ships to lag up the server and then leave.-Multiplayer if not with your friends or group is very limited. Take a while to build up stuff and then the server resets, dissapears or someone griefs  your base into the dust, people dont tend to come back after that.- NO npc's , no quests or happenings (only thing atm is some ""ghostship"" spaceships you can go chase)-not much to do in this game outside of building stuff and then using said stuff to build more stuff, for now.-Bugs, updates, patches, new bugs, alpha!As long as you like building atleast as much as you like firing space weapons, this is a good game for you, if the dev's stay on track and i'm sure they will, this game has a golden future! If your not into the consequences of an early acces game dont buy it yet but come back in about a year, it will get very good i'm sure.			"

Early Access Review
								After nearly 1,000 hours, experimenting with mods, scripts, and blueprints, this is still, after over two years, my go-to game.The community is fantastic, the developers are on point with weekly updates that either fix bugs, add content, or enhance performance, and all the while I can still use all my old builds with newer, updated versions of the game so I can just build on and add to them with the new content! Each week the updates are accompanied by a YouTube video log going over the updates and sometimes have teasers for future updates.They're getting a lot more realistic with oxygen and sound effets, and though I play almost exclusively Creative Mode, Survival Mode is coming along nicely. A fair amount of content, and it's even better since they added planets!I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys creative gameplay and slow-paced survival, or who just like building things for fun!10/10, best pre-alpha game I've ever bought, and they're still going hard on this one, with no signs of letting up anytime soon. Buy it! BUY IT NOW!			"

								If you can think it, you can build it. If you can build it, you can rebuild it to be better. The only limit to this game is your imagination (and your PC). Right now it is in Alpha and there are a few kinks that the devs are still working on. Some are major, to be fair. However, they are adament about fixing problems and they clearly have a game plan that they are working with. I'll be honest, I've been frustrated at times with the lack of optimisation at the current build, which does affect playability, as it very clearly says that it will in the Early Access banner above. This doesn't mean that it's a game to be passed up though, to say the very least. The game is in development, and the devs show no signs of slowing down or halting progress on their game. The developer involvement in the community is top notch, absolutely excellent. As many other reviewers have stated, Keen Software House is definitely setting the bar for how Early Access games on Steam should be done. Just the other day I posted a bug on their forums, and one of the devs by the name of ""Phand"" got back to me in 10 minutes. He had me send him my world that I experienced the bug in and forwarded the situation along the appropriate channels. Even if it isn't fixed in this next update, I'm not going to be here complaining because I know it will be as soon as they figure it out.But, the devs not only communicate well with the community, they also expand on ideas and are working to make the game better than anyone could have imagined it being six months ago when I first got the game. It has absolutely evolved past what it was at that point and is well worth the asking price. I have bought several copies of this game for friends and have met many excellent builders in the game. The UI is a little invasive at times, especially when building something from the inside. But, there are mods for that and I have little doubt that it's not something that the developer has on the to-do list. Speaking of which, if you want something that isn't in the game, you can almost always find a mod for it. The modding community is very talented and there are many coding experts that have developed tools for the game that are available to you for free. And, if you yourself are a coder, check out the programmable block! There is literally a block in the game that you can use C# to program scripts into to execute actions for you on your ship/ station. Not your thing? Or don't know how? Not to worry! You can use scripts from the workshop to make your creation come to life before your very eyes!While the game is no doubt a lot to take in and can be daunting at first glance, the workshop also has examples of ships you can build, and YouTube is littered with in-depth tutorials to get you up to speed. Not to mention the countless guides from the community that explain everything to you in text, if you prefer that to a video.All in all, it's a dream come true for someone like myself who spent a lot of time as a kid building Lego space ships. I can't wait for the game to progress further, and it's a very safe bet that it will be the best game of its kind.			"

								I currently have 449 hours on record and have been playing it off and on since early alpha. If ever there was a game that is a positive example of how early access should work, it is this one. Both content updates and bug fixes have been consistently released throughout the game's development. Players are kept informed of progress and changes and player feedback is ACTUALLY listened to. If you want to get in on a great space game that only gets better with time, look no further.			"

								So, to start off, you do need a decent pc to play this game. Remember, this game just went into beta phase. If you are turned off by the idea of bugs, continuous changes, and constant reworking of mechanics, by all means don't bother with this game until it is complete (which may be not for a while, as improvements and content are constantly being added).But if you like the idea of waking up midway into crashing into the side of a planet, tearing down nonessential systems to save just enough power to not die instantly on impact, scavenging what's left of the wreckage, and setting up a bunker on a hostile alien planet filled with burrowing spiders, and setting up a distress beacon in hopes that a passing cargo ship will pick you up, then this game is for you.If you aren't a fan of games in the middle of the optimization process that may have some lag issues, then don't bother with this game.But if you are a fan of jetpacking on top of an enemy atmospheric fighter, grinding down the cockpit, shooting the pilot in the face, then building the cockpit again and kamikaze ramming it into the bridge of an enemy carrier, then being picked up in the gunner's seat of a passing friendly gunship, then this game is for you.If you don't think you would want a game where piston physics sometimes break down when flying in multiplayer, don't buy this game.But if you want a game where you construct a mining ship, fend off the occasional pirate, and begin drilling for ice to fuel your hydrogen thrusters, to discover an abandoned mining facility inside the asteroid, which you slowly build up and repair and turn into your permanent, autonomously maintained home, and begin work on an interplanetary exploration vessel that would allow you to reach the planets in the distance, then this game is for you.If you don't like early access problems, frequent updates, bugs, lag, and glitches, leave this store page immediately.But if you want to crew the apollo 13 mission while being swarmed by tie-fighters or establish a mining outpost on an unexplored alien planet, or if you just want a game where the developers are fully invested in improvement and there are limitless options for creativity, then this is your game.All of the scenarios I have summarized in this review have all happened to me in game within perhaps a few months of playing. I did get this game on sale, but would have gladly paid double the regular price now that I see where this game is headed and what it can do.Best purchase I have made on steam, hands down.			"

								I don't get how people with over 100 hours in a game can give a thumbs down. I've played Space Engineers for 50 hours on solo and feel at this point I got full value of my purchase (which was on sale for $15). You can play for this long and not even scratch the surface of things to build and create. To the guy with 2,100 hours who gave a thumbs down, you could have collected a year's salary instead of playing this game as long as you did. Obviously SOMETHING kept you playing this simple, fairly cheap, beta early access game for years.Buy if you like to:Build♥♥♥♥♥♥ You cannot punch the trees to get the wood but you can build customized mining ships to smash the rocks to get the ores. I find both mining by hand and with ships to be enjoyable.Organize♥♥♥♥♥♥ I haven't even completed my new asteroid base but the creative sysems you need to use are fairly realistic and intuitive. You build various systems to tranport resources, automate hangar doors, operate ships remotely, and build the weapons and building materials you need to expand or destroy. Explore♥♥♥♥♥♥ After getting bored in initial base building, I decided to go to the moon. Halfway there an AI fighter found me and after a short dog fight i was thrown from my ship and hurled into space. Using jetpack I caught up to the ship and repaired it before it fell to Earth, got back in and was on my way. Finally I got to the moon. In my exictement to make a giant leap for mankind, I crash landed, my ship fully destroyed. Despite the time to travel (see con below) it was a fun trip that was enhanced by sudden unplanned events. Looking at the wreckage of my ship and back up at the GPS marker 200km far, far away where homebase sat put into perspective that your character is a little miniscule speck in the vastness of the game.  Cons:You do need a beefy computer to run this and get full enjoyment. I'm playing on a brand new computer and I will still occasionally get rendering errors (skybox goes pink for a frame or two).The 100 m/s max ship speed in vanilla is painfully slow at times, I've heard there are mods but I am a vanilla game player by trade. Even 200 or 250 m/s would make the game feel like hyper speed if you're used to the 100 m/s.Bugs. I've encountered some. Heard of many more. Wolves chewing through heavy metal armor. Really?I recommend if you want to play space Minecraft but with better creative production systems and the ability to build whatever you want and it will fly. 8/10 would crash land on moon again.

								My favorite game. Ever. The Devs are great, working to provide weekly updates and great content. Many of the negative reviews say that they are having to split time between Medieval Engineers and Space Engineers, which is completely un-true. There are two equally capable teams for each game, giving both games the attention it deserves.If you like using your creative side of your brain, Space Engineers is for you. The possibilities are endless in this game. First thing I would recommend is to join a server to play on. Playing with others is TONS more fun.  :D			"

								Ever played Minecraft?  Remember what it was like early in development?  It's come a long way, hasn't it?  Well, Space Engineers is like Minecraft in Space, and it is set for a similarly drastic transformation. Almost every update brings something remarkable and new.As of Summer 2014, they still call it an 'alpha', however the game has reached a state where it no longer feels like an unfinished 'work in progress' but more of an already complete and playable game that is still getting constant improvements and additional content from the developers. (Rather like Minecraft this last year or two.)Edit Autumn 2016: What I said above has only continued to be true.  Just like Minecraft, the updates have been primarily focused on bug fixes lately, but considering the amount of features that have been added prior to that, among them things such as planetary surfaces and in-game programmable systems, I'm not sure how much there is left to add... (/edit)The physics are really awesome, crashing two large ships into eachother is sufficiently harrowing to anyone onboard. And I like how all the ship systems work...especially now that they've added the 'conveyor' systems which allow you to connect things like refineries and assemblers (Refineries turn chunks of ore into raw materials, and assemblers craft materials into the components you build with) together, along with cargo holds, so that items are just moved around automatically.  They also added blocks that 'collect' items into the conveyor system, and blocks that 'eject' items from the ship's conveyor system, allowing you to transfer cargo between ships. (Such as having a mining ship dump its ore into a refinery ship that automatically begins processing it, and assembling components from the materials.)EDIT: Almost right after I wrote this recommendation, an update added the ability for ships to physically 'dock' via a connector on the conveyor system, connecting the two ships' conveyor and electrical subsystems, and allowing control of all ship systems from either vessel. (Also works with ship/station connections)I also like the progressive construction system. When you go to place a block, it requires one unit of the most basic component; usually something like steel plate, and that creates an empty framework of the block, so you can continue laying out a basic skeleton of what you're building. Then when you go back over it with your welder to actually 'build' the block, it requires the additional components.  Things like motors, steel tubes, 'construction components', computers, etc.Survival mode is already full of surprises, considering the fact that there's no AI or anything yet. Recently, I had this incident where I was out mining an asteroid...  I left my ship, my 'mobile base', floating above the light-side of the asteroid, and I ended up mining a deposit on the dark-side...  I get back to the ship and try to open the door...nothing.  That's when I notice none of the thrusters are on; there's no power... I quickly jet over to the other side, and the whole thing's been ripped open like a tin of sardines.  Must've been struck by a couple of micrometeorites...  Reactor was gone, refinery too... Luckily my cargohold was still intact, so I had what I needed to quickly assemble a new reactor.  I had to work fast to get power back on just to recharge my suit before I lost life support... Then the next task was going to be restoring minimal maneuvering to get the thing away from the light-side of the asteroid before there was another meteor shower...  I managed, somehow. Lesson learned; you can bet I never parked in the sun again!I still haven't played this multiplayer, it would definitely be useful to have people to help build sometimes. Any really large ships or stations are not one-person jobs.			"

								About six months ago I wrote a Space Engineers negative review which was popular among the reviews. I now want to update the review.If you want to know the description of the game and what it is, read it on the Store Page, I'm not going to sit here and tell you what you can and can't do in it.I bought Space Engineers (SE) three years ago and played this game all the time. It was fantastic, just an addicting, fun, and innovative sandbox game that helped get me through my tough college semesters.In November of 2015, the developers (Keen Software House - or simply Keen) released a massive update. This update introduced planets. Previously the game allowed us to play in only space. Long story short, all we had was asteroids. When I say that, I mean that more than acceptable by the community. Without planets, there was already so much to do, so limitless that no one complained about lack of content and only a few bugs here and there. To summarize that; the multiplayer net code was reliable, the optimizations were great (DX9), graphics pretty good, there weren't too many bugs, and there was an abundant amount of content. During that time, the game was phenomenal, I couldn't say anything bad about it.So going back to the planets update. Keen had kept the idea, of planets, in the back of their head until the annoying small part of the community kept begging Keen to introduce planets into the game.I get it, cool idea, sounds like fun, ok whatever let's see what happens. Well come November, planets released. (after Keen hyped it up so much) My god that was a nightmare, horrible execution of a good idea. It was the epitome of a disaster. The FPS, graphics, extremely long loading times, bugs, and optimizations, (forced DX11 on an already CPU dependent game) were horrendous. A week later they released another update that, very slightly, improved the optimizations. See my PC specs on my profile, I could barely hold 60FPS.It's been almost a year and the game hasn't much improved. Optimizations are still terrible, there are so many bugs, the multiplayer net code is FUBAR so basically no multiplayer, and there is really not much to do. Keen seems to rely on modders for adding content. For me, that is a punch to the face.Moreover, SE seems to be tumbling downhill and I don't know if it will ever get back on its feet. Keen has dissapointed me the community so much, you can tell by how many negative reviews there are. (I remember when reviews were ""Overwhelming Positive"")Now, I play here and there on only asteroid scenarios since it seems to be the only stable part of the game, especially since there I can actually play with friends without having to worry about the poor netcode.Just stay away from now, check the reviews every month or two to see if things change. I pray that this game improves but as for right now, I unfortunatelly have to give it a thumbs down.Sorry Keen but if you won't focus on just optimizing the game, maybe you wouldn't get so many negative reviews like mine.For the time, I'll play some KSP in lieu of SE.Edit: Grammar updates			"

								So I picked up S.E. after it being described to me as Minecraft in space, and seeing as I liked minecraft, and space, I figured this would be a hit with me. Yeah buddy it is. One day I can decide to build a trading station in the middle of nowhere purely for the fun of it. And the next day, I'm building a fleet to pass by and destroy said station. I can make my own goals, my limits are really only what I can think up, and whatever the game lacks atm I can probably find a mod for. Sure, when I started playing and atm it's still early access, but it's regularly updated with a great dev team and an impressive modding community as well. Think you've got the hang of everything available? Subscribe to some of the mod packs available through the workshop, that'll keep you busy for months all on it's own.If you've ever played or watched anything sci-fi related and thought it'd be cool to build that. Get this. Why wouldn't you want to build a Star Destroyer or the USG Ishimura? Just sayin.			"

Early Access Review
Day 1. I'm on a tiny, abandoned and crude space station on the side of an asteroid. I have only couple hand tools, no ship, no material for building. Space is vast, I gotta find uranium, fast. This is very scary flying so far off the base with only my jetpack. ..Oh noo some time down the line I lost the signal for the base! I guess meteor storms destroyed it's beacon.. I have no idea where the base is anymore. Forever, lost in space... ✞Day 2. I woke up in a clumsy landing pod, descending towards some unknown planet. I'm panicking and trying to figure out the controls, finally, I'm almost on the ground,steady now. Wait, what did this button do.. Oh no! Managed to flip the pod right in the last meters, it exploded.. ✞Day 3. I managed to land my pod, yeah! I don't need my helmet, I can breathe. First steps outside. Hey Idid't know this planet had life, look at those beautiful dogs, what a big pack! Wait, what the, oh for the love of AAAAHHHHHH.. ✞Day 4. Back to my asteroid station, life on a planet is too hard. Getting my first scouting ship done, with a tiny drill. I coudn't get my reactors working though. Finally, I figured out the uranium couldn't possibly move through the conveyor system to the reactor without any power. Duh! I ripped the side open and added some uranium directly to the reactor. While doing that I noticed that peeping sound I kept hearing, it was becoming more frequent, I don't think it's part of this song coming from the radio afterall. What is it.. AHHH I HAVE NO OXYGE... ✞Day 5. Note to self, tossing a piece of rock out of the cockpit while flying full speed will effectively break your ship in half and fling you out. I disorientedly watched my ship parts disappear in mere seconds to the vastness of the space.. Not this again. I figured out how to use the GPS system though and found back to my base, as it was conveniently set to be the zero point.Day 6. I mustered up enough courage to face those vile dogs and decided to try landing one more time. Once on the ground I immediately installed a turret on my landing pod. Ha Ha! Die you %#&* §¤#! Yeah! They aren't so tough after all. Now off to build a base, quickly! Ohhh hey what on earth happened to my jetpacks now, what do you mean NO FUEL?! I'm middle of flying full speeAAHHH... ✞Day 7. My planet base is coming off nicely, finding ore though is painful. I have no uranium and I don't have lot of energy left. I gotta move my solar panels higher, but I gotta save my last bits of jetpack fuel for dog emergencies. After a lot of work I built two pylons surrounded by scaffolding, and installed a rotor on top of them with solar panels. I have no idea how to program them to follow sun, though.. eventually, I figured out the day length and just gave the rotor a rotating speed divided by day length. Wow, it works!Day 8. I used last of my spare energy to power up a small car I built. I turned off everything on my base to keep power usage to minimum. The improved solar panels are still barely charging my batteries. I'm only keeping turrets online to protect the base. Ok off to find uranium! Wow this car speeds up really fast. Oops better avoid that tree, hey what the..! Great, now my car is flipped over in middle of nowhere, I gotta figure out how to turn it around, maybe if I built a piston on the side.. OH MY GOD WHERE DID ALL OF THESE DOGS COMEAHHHH.... ✞Day 9. I spent a lot of time today fiddling around with my tire controls, the car is now more stable. Gotta still drive it carefully though so it wont flip over, but it's good enough. Ha Ha hey ramming those pesky dogs with it deals with them in no time! Take that! I couldn't get a turret to work on my car, but this is maybe even more satisfactory.Day 10. I found uranium!! It was very deep in the ground, but I managed to dig a steep slope to it and get back up. Digging in the cramp tunnel is scary and disorienting, I often panick when I can't see the exit anymore and loose my sense of direction. Fair enough the dogs didn't figure out how to follow me down there, I guess they aren't as smart as I thought. Finally I got my refiner and assembler working steady with this uranium. And most importantly, fueling my jetpack is not a problem anymore. One spare tank of hydrogen lasts quite a bit, even in this environment. (I carry 5, just to be sure)Day 11. I started building a massive drilling ship after watching a distant proadcast from another planet. This guy was telling how he made one, it was very inspiring. He said the scraps of the old landing pod that I already disassembled would be plenty to get it going. He was right. Though I've used lot of the parts already for other things, his design is too big. I will make my own, a bit smaller. May take longer, but atleast I will learn better how to do it.Day 12. My green driller was coming off nicely (I named it Monster), but one of those damned dogs managed to appear from nowhere and hide where the turrets couldn't see it. Before I even realized it managed to chew through the pedestal where I was building my Monster! Karma is a b*tch though, the dog died right after the ship fell on it, ha ha.. Monster is now flipped sideways on the ground. Luckily it didn't break however, atta girl.Day 13. I finished building Monster, been working whole day to figure out how to flip her heavy frame back the right way. Those small atmospheric thrusters are really weak! 6 of them are not enough to lift Monster even a bit from the ground. ..Ohh great, now I managed to just get her flipped all the way upside down, sheesh. This model has hardly any thrusters downward, I will have to figure out a new approach..Day 14. I added several big thrusters on the back pointing up (or down, from this angle). Now if I just coordinate this right it might work. First, lifting the backside up from the ground, and add force to nose tilting, yeah it's working! Monster is now wabbling on it's front drills. Now, carefully adding power to the front thrusters to lift it juuust enough to keep it turning back on it's belly with those new thrusters.. Steady, come on big girl.. Wohooo I did it!!Day 15. I disassembled those extra thrusters from Monster fast, almost panicking. While I was trying to flip her back I managed to get quite far from the base. I was very afraid of those dogs appearing again and destroying my Monster. I had to add one more big thruster pointing down to get her howering easier. Fortunately I got her flying and now Monster is docked safely on the base. It was quite stable to control too, I am happy. Now I am ready to take over this planet! And some day.. Maybe reach that beautiful outer space again ♥Most. Addictive. Fascinating. Inspiring. Early Acces Game. Ever. 10/10 "

								I have spent a considerable amount of time playing this game and I cannot seem to stop. At first it just feels like minecraft in space, and while this may be the easiest way to describe this game, it certainly does not do it justice. I got tired of minecraft after about 20 hours of gameplay but I have over 250 hours on this game and it has definately saved me money as I've had no desire to purchase any other games as of yet. Definately recommend buying this game.			"

								-----------------------TL;DR;A very interesting sandbox game, with realistic enough physics, efficient building interface, many mechanics to play with and build smart ships, and a truckload of mods, skyboxes and blueprint to toy with.Only real downside (beyond not available on Linux ;)) is that this game is very resource-consuming and seems not multi-core friendly, so it may run very slow on medium-range machines.A MUST-HAVE for anyone liking space navigations, dogfights and unlimited creativity! :)-----------------------""Yet another sandbox!""Indeed. But, what a sandbox!!! While it may seem very similar to Minecraft in essence, Space Engineers holds its own thanks to a few unique aspects:* SPACE! Building your own spaceship or station then go fight or race with friends is truly a thrill! Especially when creative mode offers a well-thought interface (although there would still be a few improvments to make, like a larger number of toolbars).* Physics! Well, it's a very similar point. Still, beyond the basics of space navigation, the included mechanics such as rotors, pistons and sensors allow wanabee inventors to (re)create astucious machineries to give some automated glory to your creations!* MODS! This game has been designed from the get-go to be easily modifiable, and the recent addition of ships/stations blueprints really amps the game! Between reconstruction of famous spaceships, tricky mechanics or slick self-made models, you really can spend hours just trying everything -or designing the next most popular ship on the Workshop!So, is this game a true gem, without flaws? Unfortunately, no.1. This game is a resource-hog! It is very CPU demanding and can put down even quad-core if you get a bit heavy on blocks and interactions (it fully crashed my computer once when I fought with friends between half a dozen ships).While it's partially explained by the richness of interactions and creativity, everything cannot be overlooked. If your computer is more than 2 years old, unless it was high-end at the time you won't enjoy it fully.2. Survival is basically boring for now. Only difference with creative is occasional meteor showers, keeping an eye on your internal battery, and SPENDING TWO HOURS JUST TO BUILD A SMALL SHIP ! 'Cause you'll have to drill, build a refinery, drill rare minerals, refine them, order component manufacturing and assemble them, and EVERY STEP IS RIDICULOUSLY SLOW! So unless you start in ""scenarii"" it's just an uninteresting waste of time... For now at least.			"

								Great concept, poor implementation.   Bought this game shortly after release, and have watched it develop from Alpha into Beta; honestyly don't think the devs understand the difference between the two.  Some critical, and even game breaking bugs, have been around for years unpacthed, others get patched - reintroduced - patched - reintroduced - etc., etc.  Most of my gaming buddies have dropped this title due to the bugginess and lack of focus on fixing critical issues in place of the focus to revamp the game's art style.  The worlds *DayZ Standalone"" have been used to describe KSH's development practices with  this title (it's really not *that* bad tho, just bad enough).Here, as with other games, is where this game really falls apart... eternal EA.   IMO, EA ought to only be allowed if the game is in a playable BETA state with a developer specified EA duration is no more than one year - otherwise the game is really a kickstarter and sold as such.  Space games are not KSH's first foray into this, the first one failed, and this second one seems right on track to follow.My recommendation, avoid this title at least until it fully releases (out of BETA), and then evaluate whether you want to give it a try based on reviews, vids, and streams. Due to the excessibely long development timeline for this title, it is quite possible that other similar, more recent titles will likely do it better than SE.			"

								I won't deny that I had a LOT of fun with this game, and my play time will speak on my behalf on that. But, as other early access titles, there's always a shadow looming over any potentially great title: the direction its developer will take, and how they will react to an unexpected success. I loved this game back when it was... simpler. Not in its mechanics, mind you, but in its SCOPE. It was a game in which you had to hone your space engineering skills (hence the name) to make better designs, and when you managed to build a well-designed, perfectly working ship... it was glorious. I remember how proud I was of the first semi-automated mining ship I built, the smile on my face brought me back 20 years, when I was a kid playing lego and building something I liked. Then Keen Software House was hit by a wave of... success. They tried their best with their weekly update, and for some time I thought they were going in the right direction, with them adding programmable blocks and more engineering solutions to the already rich plate. Then they started trying to please everyone. Adding things most players didn't even want, failing to fix GAME BREAKING bugs, ignoring the pathetic state the multiplayer is in (completely unplayable as of now, has been like this for months). Then the dreaded PLANETS. I won't lie, I was looking forward to them. But the engine showed the game itself wasn't ready for them, and they even changed the damn system requirements after adding that feature. Fact is, even with a mid to high-end gaming pc you won't be able to reach playable frame rates. I'm using a good machine myself, and my fps (10 to 20) on planet surfaces makes the game completely unplayable. And the bugs and unneeded features just keep coming. We have exploding CYBERDOGS now, yey, and we can mod our medical room to suit our playing stile, imagine what kind of funny stuff we could do in multiplayer - oh wait... the multiplayer is currently broken. Keen is losing sight of their own creation, trying to subtly invite us to polish the game for them via MODS... their vision of this game's future is clouded by their own inadequacy. I would NOT recommend this game to anyone right now, and I fear this might not change in the future, since the company behind it is quickly losing any credibility as a serious developer. If you're really interested in this title... well, my suggestion would be to wait. Wait and see if they can (and want to) come up with solutions to this game's long standing bugs (mining not working properly, terrible sim speed, unacceptable optimization, unplayable multiplayer) and make the right steps in order to keep the title alive. If so, I'd gladly change my review at a later date. But right now... avoid this game. It will make you think ""this could have been GREAT, when and how did it go so wrong?"".			"

								Space engineers is one of *those* games. The ones that sucks you in and you notice its 5 am the next day.I can easilly place this next to Factorio or IC2 from Minecraft. But in space, with physics, and deformable voxel geometry thats not just cubes. Build huge ships, and wage war on multiplayer servers (of which allow it).I've spent countless of hours building stations and ships, and hosting a dedicated multiplayer server. The fact that you have to build the tools, and automation to build bigger, dig better, and generally make everything less of a chore is a very odd progression element: Of which I oddly enjoy. Now with the inclusion on random generation and infinite distances, I've enjoyed it even more. You now actually have to try to look around and find your way back to get resources, because not everything spawns on a single Asteroid.My only gripe is the fact that the energy mechanic doesnt seem to be enough consitute this as a survivor game, yet its annoying enough to accidentally forget about it until you die and your corpse is floating about with alot of stuff: Meanwhile this isnt much of an issue after you start building ships to handle most of the heavy lifting. Why not also go further that you have to process something to make oxygen or filter CO2, etc and etc. Mods ofcourse can probably do this as well.There are still plenty of things I havent experimented with (such as pistons or programmable blocks), but it looks like there is a lot of things you can try to create. I've seen huge projects from a mining beast that carves out a huge round cavern within an asteroid (leaving only a shell and a tiny entrence making a great asteroid for a base), to smaller utility ships that can be converted to fighters, welders or miners.I can easily recommend this game to anyone who loves building (engineering), creatively experimenting with creation of various tools / weapons (in the form of ships). Just be prepared to spend lots of hours, especially if your are into creating automation.			"

								By this point in time, I've spent over 304 hours of my life playing this game. It is a game of both critical thinking or great fun should you not desire to think critically about your designs, note that it is and will still be fun when you use critical thinking because that is what engineering is about. I have flown hundreds upon hundreds of kilometers and have fought many many fights both on the ground, in a small ship, and in really big ships and I have mined entire asteroids yet I still have not seen the end of creativity and possibility with this game for it is truly limitless from my experience. If you are a person who loves building things and gets a kick from blowing stuff up, then this game is for you, and I promise that you will never regret buying and playing this game, to prove it, I will put one of my experiences below.One of the greatest experiences I've ever had while playing this game was in a multiplayer server, people were flying everywhere and fighting, some of them raming, and I had just crashed on an asteroid and had to wait for my friend to pick me up, but he did not know where I was so I had to create a beacon, which I did by taking apart an old station I found inside the asteroid, which sent out a signal saying S.O.S, this not only solved my problem of my friend not being able to find me, but it also created the problem of a bunch of playings humting me down. I was forced to retreat into the asteroid as the barrages of rockets and gunfire came down but I was just setting myself up for a trap, the entire area was closed off and the ships were able to come in, so I grabbed my drill and burrowed into the wall. As the guy was flying towards me, another person came flying in as well and so they started shooting eachothers' ships effectively destroying eachother, once they were done in their little dog fight, I managed to sneak up behind hiw to where I pulled out my assault rifle and shot the cockpit untill it exploded and killed the last guy. My friend had just gotten to the area I was at, so we scaveneged all the parts we could from the wreckage and flew off several kilometers away where we started setting up our main base living happily until a much later point where someone had their faction and came in with like 5 different large ships and totally annihilated it, and so, a new journey of revenge began but with no end. We built a whole field of ""magnetic"" mines around our new base and waited for someone to come, and they did.			"

								Space Engineers. What can I say? It's basically Minecraft and Kerbal Space Program combined. Players can choose from Survival and Multiplayer. In survival you have to build ships and a medical room to survive. There are hostile ships you can grab resources from but be prepared for a fight. They are armed. Creative is well creative. Build what you imagine and what your PC can handle. There are Servers, Easily Downloadable Mods, And a thing called Games were instead of LAN u can have people join! Overall its a 5/5 for me. I recommend it this summer due to the sale!			"

Due to all the horrible bugs and glitches sure the modding community is great but space engineers has a ton of glitches. the multiplayer is basically unplayable if you build anything bigger than a small fighter the frames are absolutly horrible! and with planets in the mix its even worse. on planets without anything on them youll probably get at the most 18 - 25 FPS. Ships will randomly explode without warning. oh and dont even bother with wheels/rotars because they will absolutly annihilate whatever there on after a while. i really want to play and recommend space engineers but untill the multiplayer and frame rate becomes better i can not recommend this game.

								Update:Optimization improved heavily from original post date. I still will look for more until I go positive on this review. Specifically there is an ocassional stutter that can toss you to space or kill you randomly. A client sided view distance slider would not hurt as an option setting though along with more shadow optimization. I hope they keep it up. I know they can do more and are capable.Game is very laggy and poorly optimized. I wouldn't make this statement if they hadn't been working on it for so long. Matter of fact performance gets worse and I found out I needed to download some sort of Directx 9 beta version to even play. Even though I was able to play with Directx11 before they added this.I don't care if you want me to purchase a better PC. That doesn't make the game work better. It just makes your pc run the garbage coding better. So for real. They need to make this game run faster.Other than that. Solid game but seriously. Fix the lag.			"

								I *really* want to give this game a reccomendation, but I'd need to be able to play it to do that!This game is great, but as more features were added, it became more hardware intensive, buggier, and prone to crashes. What this game needs is for the developers to take the rest of the year off from adding features, and focus solely on optimization and bug fixes. Once they do that, I fully reccomend this game!Seriously, it's an amazing game, full of depth and complexity. It feels like you really are engineering items in space, but simplified enough for it to be fun instead of stressful. Although I also think it's best to get this with a friend, as singleplayer can start growing monotonous after a while. Or at least, it did for me.			"

								If you...- like or liked building spaceships from Legos (and then smashing them)...- are o. k. with playing a yet unfinished early access game in alpha-stage...- have a decent rig......give Space Engineers a try!  (If you are patient/cautious, wait until it goes on sale.).Space engineers is a block based building game, often described as minecraft in space, but with more realistic looks and physics. (Disclaimer: I have never played Minecraft because it is not in space.)It has a creative mode, where you can comfortably just build spaceships (or bases, or vehicles) and a survival mode, where you need to mine and refine ore from asteroids or planets before you can expand beyond your starter-ship. In survival, you also need to generate energy and (unless you turn that option off) oxygen. Either way you get to build your own ship from hull to windows, doors, thrusters, gyros, antennas, refineries, cargo containers, fuel tanks, air vents, conveyors, batteries, missile launchers, landing gears (or wheels), cameras, sensors, timers, script blocks and more. Then you can fly your spaceship in an asteroid field, land on planets, set up bases, mine ores, fight pirates... Space Engineers is a sandbox game, so beyond not dying you have to set your own goals.Of course you can save the ships you have built as blueprints and upload them to the workshop or download ships built by other players. There are some fantastic creations on the workshop. Actually, if you are interested in this game at all, I recommend you just take a quick look around the workshop to see what can currently be done in Space Engineers. Space engineers is early access and still in alpha. The developers update the game every single thursday. That update will fix some things, add some things and, inevitably in this stage, break some things. Be sure to report bugs - that is what early access is for. The devs do a hotfix every friday, so that you can enjoy the game better over the weekend. While the devs listen to the community - they added planets by popular demand - they have been too silent in the past. They are making an effort to improve, though. Being alpha, the game is hardly optimzed yet, even though the devs work on that week by week, too. Older rigs may struggle with it. Performance in Singleplayer can be improved with the right settings and good judgement. Multiplayer however is currently being completely redone and perfomance varies from week to week.			"

I have not played the game for some time now and can not give feedback about the changes (planets, AI ships and more).What do I do in the game?(I have only played Survival but there is a creative mode, too)- gather resources- build a base- build spaceships and other SiFi stuff- fight NPC spaceships- PvPwhat I like:- Science Fiction Setting- Realistic Art-Style- you can build spaceships that fly and shoot stuff!- build your own tools (you can build spaceships with mining and/or crafting tools attached to them and use those ships to build even bigger ships or bases)- working in-game programming language (code your own little programs to display container content on a display for example)(I believe it is C+ or something like that)what I don't like:- there is not enough to do besides building ships and stuff- the NPC ships just fly a straight line and don't really engage in fights beside shooting their auto-aim turrets- really, there is not much to do besides building and resource gatheringSummary:I have mixed feelings about this game. The Building part is super fun. The Resource gathering is interesting because you build your own ships for the Job.On the other hand, the lack of content besides building and gathering can make this game pretty boring pretty fast.Interested in building cool spaceships or a moon base? This game might be something for you then.But if you want to use the stuff you have build in cool combat scenarios, you need to join a public server or play with(against) friends.			"

Early Access Review
								Space Engineers is one of the few games I've purchased myself, and sets my standards very high when it comes to Indie Developers. I've rarely seen a game in Early Access do it's best to reach it's potential, to set a goal and make great progress towards it. With every massive leap forward however, Keen Software stumbles back a little bit. While everyone else sees these as game breaking issues that will stop them from ever enjoying the game (and with good reason), I see a developing team that is doing their best to improve. I see it as a work of passion that Space Engineers is getting an update every week, and a stable build every month. I've seen so many games abandoned with an issue strikes, but the developers for this game continue to fix small things, and when they find a way around, the bigger stuff is fixed as well. I won't lie to you, the silence between the devs and the community is worrying sometimes. Big issues that go unresolved for periods of time can leave you not wanting to play until they're fixed. Large updates that bring several problems can be disheartening. But if Keen had no intention to finish this game, they wouldn't continue to update it this frequiently. So, I'm putting a little silent faith in this game, in its devs, and in its community, that we will all be Interplanetary Space Engineers. Instead of calling the game dead, and a mess, notice whatever improvements are coming and do your best to show support. It's coming along, and I don't regret a single cent.			"

								Imagine this, you build a spaceship block-by-block and then you use it to mine the materials to build a starbase and factory all from your imagination and the shapes and sizes are all there for you to build nearly any ship you can imagine. There's even a blueprint system that lets you ""print"" out copies of your original design. Although, you have to get some mods because the included tools don't allow for large ship printing easily. However, there you are with your cool base and fleet of ships ready to take on the galaxy when it hits you... you're all alone. There's no enemy to fight. No point to building anything really. Now, you invite some friends to play. No more than 3 or 4 though because your world will lag until the end of time. You all build your bases and slug it out. Maybe two of you team up even and go out to attack the other guys. You try your best to see through the dozens upon dozens of icons that you have no way of removing without losing communication with your home base and ship. At least no realistic way. But!!! you found an enemy base that your friend has built and you launch your attack crippling him and destroying many ships and structures. Victory! However reality sets in, now he has to rebuild brick-by-brick because mass building and repair is not supported and only marginally supported by mods. So, he gives up and plays something else because he realizes there's no point in rebuilding.Such a great concept so poorly executed. Planets made the game worse by increasing an already steep learning curve and eating the little resources left to run the world. Had there been real NPCs and cookie cutter shipyards that could constuct/deconstruct ships it may have had a chance as a multiplayer. If it had any type of descent NPC faction it could have been a good solo/coop game. It doesn't have any of that. Instead it's a solo building game. You make a neat ship, screenshot it or upload its blueprint to the workshop and call it a day. It's like a hero without a villian, all kinds of superpowers but, nothing to use them on. Save yourself the depression and buy Kerbal instead.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: No.Look...I wanted to make a long, detailed review, but I ranted so much into the review box that it was actually too long to post. Steam wouldn't let me.The problems with Space Engineers aren't necessarily going to show their face at first. At its' core, the game is still the same one we got when it entered early access alpha 3 years ago. It's still fun to build ships and fly them around, fun to watch them crash into one another and splinter up and break and dent and all that jazz. If you have a computer capable of hosting a server with friends and they have computers capable of running the game, the multiplayer can also still be a ton of fun. And the game has a huge modding community, which is always a huge plus, and it can easily support itself feature-wise without it. Not to say it SHOULDN'T have one, of course, but it's a good thing when a mod-focused game doesn't actually need mods.Buuuuuut...3 years ago I ran this game on a potato. It ran like a charm. I never had any issues with lag or any crashes or anything. When multiplayer was introduced, my friends joined me and we all played on potato-quality PCs. It's all we had at the time and you know what? The game ran perfectly. Nobody ever had an issue with it.Somehow since then, the game has managed to turn into the most sluggish, buggy, awful piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥I have ever encountered. Period.I can get 60 FPS in this game. Usually. Mind you, my computer ALSO has a brand new Nvidia GTX 1080 in it and a hex-core i7 processor with an absolutely huge overdose of ram at 64 gigs, which is used for video and music production - I never thought I'd see a game that actually needs ALL of it. And even then, the game will crash due to running out of memory and just dumping to desktop without warning. Sometimes, right when you load in. And dont you DARE alt-tab - that causes it instantly. Saying ""Usually"" also means that I have to turn things like anti-aliasing off entirely and, of course, not even think about playing on planets, which are one of the game's biggest features. Planets lag like♥♥♥♥♥and there is NO workaround for it outside of plain and simple horesepower. That's not a good thing at all.The friends that used to play with me for the most part can't anymore. Without a godlike internet connection, the game will cause them to stutter around and die to literal nothing - they will just suddenly be dead without having a clue why. Turns out it's usually because they lagged into an asteroid or something and didn't see it coming. Of course, that's if they can even run the game. I have a friend who can get about 30 fps in space and, well, on planets? A healthy 4 at minimum settings despite surpassing minimum requirements for the game by a large margin. Slideshow quality graphics do NOT count as ABOVE MINIMUM SPECS. And seeing how the game used to run better at higher settings on ♥♥♥♥♥ier hardware, I'm entirely blaming the game for this one.So performance is a hit. ""Well,"" you say, ""I have a god-machine that ran me down the price of a luxury vehicle and runs 400 servers across various games daily, I can run this, your PC is trash lmao"". That won't save you from the constant array of glitches. The game does nothing but insert workarounds. Passenger seats were added because they can't be bothered to fix other players glitching out of a ship while it's in motion. Piston and rotor safety locks were added because they can't be bothered to fix them flying off and causing your whole ship to detonate spontaneously due to trying to TURN. The faction system doesn't work worth a damn since any time you build new blocks, they are by default neutral, meaning if you add blocks to a ship that belongs to your OWN faction, YOUR OWN SHIP WILL OPEN FIRE ON ITSELF TO REMOVE THE NEUTRAL HERESY YOU JUST INSTALLED. The oxygen system has had its pressurization system turned OFF by default now even on pre-existing worlds because it's too buggy to bother fixing, so LETS JUST MAKE IT SO IT DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE.There's your rant. Reduced size for you, Steam.Oh and did I mention the game has been in alpha for 3 years and shows no signs of ever progressing past that stage? And every other game the company has EVER made has been abandoned, including Medieval Engineers?...right.			"

								My time with Space Engineers was really good. My friends and I slaved away on a massive space-base on an asteroid for weeks. Eventually other people caught on, and joined us as well. It was the perfect life. Eventually we made a gigantic ship out of teamwork, blood, sweat, and tears. After this was made, I proceeded to crash into our space base while playing ""My Heart Will Go On"". As all of the people in our meticulously crafted space base were sucked into the endless abyss of space, I assessed the damage, before the gravity failed and I become lost in space.10/10			"

								Due to the recent spate of positive reviews from fan boys and girls trying to counter the recent spate of negative reviews, and after having reviewed said reviews, I must now review this game.Amazing potential and pitiful follow through. They added planets, that's pretty amazing, but I think they were trying to keep up with Empyrion on that note. This game beats Empyrion in every way except flora and fauna and ease of use. I hate hearing ""it's not done yet so don't be critical"" but... it's been three years. How long must we wait before we need to get critical? Furhtermore, if their team is so small, I'd say they've sold enough copies to make a larger team. Perhaps they should invest more into their products instead of whatever else they're blowing their money on. Or, at the very least, come out and say they don't really care and are going to squeeze every drop of blood from this stone.Played soooo many hours. I enjoy survival games but the novelty wore off and became tedious after awhile. I enjoy PvE games with friends which is how Empyrion won our heart despite it's innumerable draw backs.If they could introduce a robust PvE element, this would be a killer game.I wish Space Engineers or Empyrion would just sell their concept to the guys who made Ark: Survival Evolved so THOSE guys could make an epic space survival game... and learn from Space Engineers and Empyrion because Ark's building is garbage.Man... you just can't win these days. No one makes finished products anymore. Everything is early access/Never complete. Or they ""finish"" it in its uncomplete form and start some other foppish project *cough*Planetary Annihilation*cough*One day... a member from each team will splinter away and create something amazing, and finish it... and release it to the world. But until that day... just... buy this, play it awhile, switch to one of the other ones, do the same to it, and eventually rotate back around to this...Or learn programming and make something better. Ugh... what's become of games these days... I'm gonna go play Overwatch.			"

Early Access Review
								Space makes everything cooler, right? No offense to terrestrial enthusiasts, but it's unlikely that a straight-up simulation of everyday engineering would have this kind of pull. By contrast, Space Engineers has a definite hook even in its current Steam Early Access state, which has convinced half a million PC players to pay for pre-release play. While it does feel a whole lot like a celestial take on the sandbox charm of Minecraft, Space Engineers generates its own unique brand of fun, whether you're more interested in constructing things or blasting them to bits.While spawning into a world in Minecraft often reveals mountains and caverns to draw your attention, spinning up a new universe in Space Engineers might drop you into the middle of near-nothingness: just a person in a spacesuit with a jetpack, floating amidst the far-off stars. For most players, it's probably best to start with one of the pre-defined scenarios, which can dump you into a world with a few ships and a platform—something familiar amidst the dead of space, and a home base to start building your own fun around.Whatever your surroundings, Space Engineers' biggest thrill at this point is creating a ship from common parts and zipping around the cosmos. It's amazing how you can simply pull up your inventory, drag a handful of pieces to your toolbar, and build a small working ship in the world in minutes using armor blocks, a cockpit, reactors, thrusters, a gyroscope, and landing gear. Make sure you've got thrusters pointed in all directions and enough juice to power the thing, and you can take off and explore the depths of space in moments. Just like that.And that's just a small ship. It takes a fair bit more time, but you can also build large ships that you can walk around in, as well as outfit them with things like missile turrets, refineries, and medical rooms—plus you can design a space station with many of the same accouterments. While the tools used are simple, your ships and stations can be considerably tweaked in both look and purpose.Granted, that's really the bulk of the game experience right now: building ships and structures, and then toying around with them. But plenty of antagonistic fun is here to be had, too—I had a blast pairing up with an online pal, outfitting our ships with warheads, and then bashing them together and watching the explosive results. Ships and structures tear apart dynamically with each collision or rocket launcher hit, and you can blast holes in space stations large enough to weave tiny ships through. Generating a world full of blazing meteors is a fun twist as well, plus you can hop into others' public or private games for co-op creation or other shenanigans.As of now, Space Engineers includes a couple of ways to experience the action. Creative mode waives resource and inventory restrictions and lets you go crazy with building and design. Meanwhile, Survival mode requires a lot more planning and work, as you'll have to harvest resources from asteroids, craft items, maintain energy levels, and avoid death, lest you want to lose your inventory. Unsurprisingly, it feels like Minecraft's own Survival mode on a basic level, but while it's the more substantial mode of the two here, it comes off like a more time-intensive version of Creative without its own uniquely intriguing aspects—aside from struggling and laboring a lot more. Hopefully it evolves to feel more distinctive than it does now.Being that it's an Early Access game, Space Engineers also doesn't yet have the polish of a full release. I ran into glitches in spots when starting games or connecting to others, and visually the game needs refinement—the engineers just sort of hover around without much in the way of animation, plus the backdrop of the stars looks like a static texture, and it's difficult to get a feel for movement as a result. But those are feasible fixes for a game in this state, and otherwise it's very playable and the core mechanics are solidly in place.Space Engineers does feel a bit thin today, but like the block-based sandbox it seems to take a lot of inspiration from, there's just something about the fundamental building and breaking aspects that holds up during repeat play. Keen Software House has a real opportunity here to expand out from that solid foundation towards a broader and deeper experience in the months to come. For now, you'll make most of your own joy in Space Engineers, whether that's creating things or tearing them to pieces. Usually it's both, and often that's good fun.			"

OverallSpace Engineers is a game with a lot of promise. Get your friends together, start a server, then land, survive, build, and fly together. The game itself has gone through major phases, year over year since inception. Overall the game is mostly fun, until you hit a bug that directly affects your play style.Bug That Ended My ServerPicture this: You've put 10 hours into building a base, refinery, assembler, generators, lighting, and have established multiple mining points for 6 or so ores that you need for moving forward. What's next? Building vehicles.- Step 1: Mock the vehicle layout- Step 2: Layout the skeleton of the vehicle- Step 3: Add wheels- Step 4: Pick up the pieces after the vehicle went flying through the air because the wheel clipped the ground during build.Would I Recommend?Space Engineers can be major fun. It has a lot of fundamental bugs that affect daily game play, but it is Early Access, so it has an excuse for it. I've also played for 67 hours so far, so I've had quite a bit of game play time in the game. Was it worth it? Monetarily, yes. But I have a negative impression of the game. When the name comes up, I get upset because the game has such promise and I just can't come back till it's fixed.			"

								Owned the game for 3 years and have about 100 hours on it. Great concept, poorly executed. The amount of persistent bugs is unreal. Instead of fixing them and keeping the game in a stable state with each update. They'd rather take everything the community suggests and throw into the game.Well the community are not game developers, this game has been ruined.It's clear a lot of the mechanics and game modes are flawed/unblanaced also.When i bought the game it did what it said on the tin, and i liked where the game was heading based on design documents for the game.Somewhere a long the line that changed.Now it's just an unplayable mess that requires a supercomputer to run efficiently.If the devs had wrapped it up and finished with the content they originally intended, it'd still be a great game. They were at that point a long time ago, when the game was naturally generating positive reveiws.Originally the devs didn't want to take the game beyond where they saw our Space Technology within the next 20 years or so. Probably less, i'm just being generous.So what did they do? Added alien cyber hounds (Just a really poorly executed version of a Minecraft creeper), warp drives and other such nonesense.I bought the game under a very different label, and though alpha games can and do change. Not usually to the degree this game has. It has complety veered off from its original design document. So the future is very uncertain.I don't know how as a company you can justify starting a new project built around the same concept and physics. When you haven't finished this one yet. Surely finishing Space Engineers first could only have improved development on Medieval Engineers.If the reason was money. Then i really don't understand. A small team generating the revenue Space Engineers has.Developers out there have done a better job with no revenue.			"

								Space Engineers is a great game. What is it? Imagine Minecraft having kids with space with difficulty surpassing all other games you have ever played and great modding potential. Maybe I'm overexaggerating because the game isn't that hard when you disable some stuff but trying to capture a cargo ship with automated turrets with your little fighter is hard and the space doesn't forgive. If you get shot and die it's not minecraft your stuff is gone for good and you'll not find it unless it's stationary or marked, or going really slow for some reason. You have to menage your resources well and pick your fights if you plan on fighting. There are also pirates that sometimes spawn and you have to attack their base or they'll keep sending drones and some alien NPCs like big spiders and cyberhounds. The game is updated every week and it's amazing that developers DO care. You can create a lot of different stuff in Space Engineers and you can even code in game. Space Engineers is all about usability of your creations but it doesn't stop you from building 1:1 Death Star with empty interior, it's just not as fun in my eyes as making something more... technical.Controls might be confusing at first but you can remap 95% of stuff and it's great. The game has a lot of tutorials but I've never played them since I bought the game years prior to tutorials and simply watched update videos to learn the game.You can play either Survival, Creative or some workshop scenarios. All modes are great. I love spawning planets in Creative with different seeds, they're so sexy, mrrr. Survival is really, really great and it has been greatly improved since I first bought into the game and made more accessible and faster for single player. Multiplayer is loads of fun and I recommend you bring friends if you plan on playing Survival because it's the best thing to do in the game. Graphics vary but there are some really cool solutions in here and it's not Minecraft level of graphics, this isn't square world - only the blocks are square 100%, destruction of ships is really great and blocks do not destroy instantly like said MC - destruction looks very real and ramming mothership with other mothership into a side is fu**ing omhack fapfapfap.I really enjoy the soundtrack. Both battle music and the slower pace tunes are good. The game truly has a lot to offer and you can build a lot of different vehicles or even make a small ship into a guided rocket or a turret. The game is still a little bit buggy but recent updates are all about bugfixes and optimization.On the topic of optimization it's not really that great but it's hard to tell why. It's just not always good but even in world with 25 planets I'm k but when I eg. land on a planet or spawn a really big fu**ing ship then it might not be as good. And I have a very good PC soo yea it's sad. The game is loads of fun alone or with friends, creative or survival, map making or building sh*t, fighting with motherships or raiding an NPC vessel with fighters. I recommend you support the devs, the game is really worth it even though it's not perfect. Remember, you can only play planets if your video card supports DX11. Otherwise the game is playable in DX9. The Dark Souls sandbox in space with great modding support I've always wanted96/100.+ for:CustomizabilityLots of options to create advanced mechanismsMultiplayer, SP, Creative, Sandbox, Scenario mode (community made maps/vanilla maps/map making)SoundtrackPlanets are stunning to look atThe game is fair but hard if you want it to beGreat modding supportWeekly updates that do indeed add stuff and fix stuff (progress of the game)Physics (destruction and all the other stuff that makes the game more difficult to build vehicles capable of flying above planet's surface etc. it's all so cooool)You can make everything out of this game Very tactical with where you set up your base to defend it more easily and to avoid meteor storms, battling cargo ships, managing resources and trying to stay alive and with oxygen etc. (unless you turn these features off)- for:Optimization (big -)Some major Scenario features I'd love to see there are still missingMultiplayer code isn't as great as it could've beenThey deleted ladders years ago and they're out of the game since then... guys give up with your gravity elevators and stairs we just want fricking ladders.Crashes (sometimes)No water on planets (only ice)This isn't a great FPS regardless of having Assault Rifles (lackluster shooting with your astronaut/space engineer altough still being worked on and it keeps getting better)The money you invest now is the money you'll get back in fun time pretty quickly and even more money over time since with each update game becomes more expensive and it's getting better and better so it's definetely worth to buy it because it's 99/100 material and 100/100 if they CAN and WILL MANAGE to make the optimization great.

								Space Engineers is a sandbox game about construction, engineering, and maintenance of objects in space. This includes small ships, large ships, space stations, and platforms. It features a simple crafting system, jetpacks, survival and creative modes, as well as multiplayer! Space Engineers is developed by Keen Software House,  the same team behind Miner Wars.The game revolves around the player collecting resources from the asteroids and rocks floating out in space. To reach them you can utilize either a ship you've built (or started with) or your trusty jetpack. Once you've reached a location, you can then scout out materials and begin mining them. Once you have sufficient resources, you can then craft things such as a cockpit, thrusters, a gyroscope, a gravity generator, and reactors...all of which are required for building a ship. Multiplayer can be quite challenging, as it will have you coordinating with other players to build large stations and ships for moving and storing items as you establish a base of operations and then go out and find new sources of ore and materials.Everything in this game is destructible. And I mean EVERYTHING. What you've built, what your friend has built....even your friend! If your ship is about to crash into a station, you can do your best to evade but you will most likely fail, and destroy half of the station AND the ship. And the thing is that the developers actually put the effort into that! The destructed objects look very realistic and look like they had some thought put into how they would look if destroyed a certain way (Rammed by a ship for example)! Fly a ship into another ship and check it out. Broken objects, pieces of metal, and more will all be floating away through space after a stellar impact.Space Engineers is currently still in Alpha, and is available on Steam via the Early Access program. While it is still very early in its life, Space Engineers is very playable, and a blast to play with a few friends. Get a few together, grab a four-pack of the game, and you will definitely get share of fun from this game. Recommended "

Early Access Review
								Long ""story"" read, jump to the ----'s at the bottom for a TL;DR.A long time ago back in 2013, this game used to be incredibly stable while also running impressively smooth for an alpha game. The player motion in space was also incredibly responsive, allowing you to build large-scale things with even the most rudamentory block-per-block placement methods. Was it tedious and basic? Yes. But it worked with there only ever being any lag If you had say, over 200-300+ ship parts with particles going on in your view which was understandable due to there being little to no optimization done.After that point, they decided to completely revamp the way you move in space. Now instead of a butter-smooth responsive control scheme where your character would quickly respond in what directions you were telling him to go, you've now got ""velocity"" added to your character, adding massive delays, mandatory slow-downs & speedups and drags for every single movement you try to do. This would not be a big issue for me.. If it wasn't the case that you can't TURN IT OFF/TOGGLE IT IN CREATIVE/SANDBOX MODE.FPS issues and overall colossal latency problems were becoming more prominent everyday as the developers were constantly trying to cram things in at once like destructible asteroids, rotor mechanics, landing gear magnetism, guns & explosives, world generators and ultimately, multiplayer that remains a horrid, lag-filled warping mess up to this day with even the tiniest of space-battle skirmrishes being networking & server nightmares.4 months after It's release onto Steam, the game has sold over 250,000 copies and not long after that, it grew up to 500,000 copies. After a certain point however, the developers started to just pound out features into the game faster than people could even test the stuff in 2014. Meteorites, solars, wheel-systems, conveyor systems, missile turrets, dedicated servers, factions, pistons, hacking, addition of steam workshop, camera blocks, spherical gravity generators.. The list kept on going, and following it was a very distinct downfall in both FPS and latency performance through the game for everyone as it became an EXTREMELY common complaint on the forums and yet it fell unto deaf ears as Keen Software continued to essentially ""speedrun"" the development of the game, not giving a single care in the world for stability or FPS performance before next year in 2015..They also suddenly decided to announce that they were making ""Medieval Engineers"". A spinoff from Space Engineers while SE is in itself a spinoff of another abandoned game of theirs called Miner Wars 2081 that can be found here on Steam, go ahead and read the reviews of it here:Medieval Engineers was a game that many optimistically jumped into, seeing that it had potential but not much of anything else, having next to none of the buyers of that game actually do any research on the company they were buying it from and just like Miner Wars 2081, Medieval Engineers was unofficially abandoned with the only news regarding it these days are empty ""developer diaries"" where they sit and talk on how round the planets are for 45+ minutes instead of adding actual updates to the game itself. Review ratings for it is currently around 25%, can be seen and read here:-----------------------------------------So, everything put together into a TL;DR, this company has absolute zero care in the world for delivering people a polished product or even keeping promises for that matter and much rather jump from title to title, hoping and praying to the powers above that this routine of theirs won't be recognized before enough people have been ripped off buying their ""games"". Just today as of writing this review, I went ahead and downloaded a fresh install of the game to try it out. I jumped into a well populated MP server.. And was met with the most horrible latency lag in the world, even though the server itself had as little as 18 ping reported to me. Not before long, I would also be met with.. You guessed it:http://imgur.com/a/8AtfzDo yourself a favor and please don't repeat the mistakes that others have made by buying and playing these turd-excuses for ""published"" games by these devs.Thank you.

								EDIT 11/30/15 Welp, after last thursday's update, planets run quite a bit better. I can keep 60 FPS on Mars and every moon, about 30-40 on ""Earth"", and about 30 on the ali.en planet. I get a lot less lag flying quickly into the atmosphere and loading the terrain now, as well.EDIT 11/13/15 (Planets Upate Yesterday)So, planets eh? After all the whining of the community asking for them to ""release NAO"", here we have them!And how are they? Well, 20-30 FPS is how they are.20-30 FPS of great potential.As of now, they haven't got many features to them (flora has no point, and the only fauna is the sabiroid (space spider)), but, the sheer size of them, interesting gravity, and pirate bases/drones are enough to keep one occupied until more features are released. Be warned though, your FPS WILL drop when on a planet.I get 20-30 FPS with these specs:FX-6300 OC'd to 4.1 ghzR9 270x 2gb16 gb ddr3 1600 mhz850 EVO SSDRest of review below~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This is one of the 3 or so games that I can safely say I will NEVER run out of things to do in. The other two being Minecraft and Gmod. I've been with this game pretty much since launch, and I've watched it progress from a semi-broken space physics simulator to this absolute masterpiece of sandbox and community. I remember when Workshop integration was added, within days there were tens of THOUSANDS of worlds on the workshop. And when official modding was introduced, the community (and myself) went absolutely CRAZY! Modding opened up whole new worlds (sometimes literally) for this game. Also, I find myself enjoying the multiplayer a LOT more (screw you rammers, though) simply because of the numerous fixes and improvements they've made to it. Even now, this is one of the few games I would've payed the usual 50-60$ for, but it's a steal at only 20$. And the devs! Keen Software House have to some of the most dedicated game developers I've ever seen, releasing content-filled updates EVERY THURSDAY since launch, never missing one. I heard recently that this game is also going to be in retail stores and for download on the Xbox One. Now, if you can get your game on that big of a platform, you're doing something right. I really can't wait to see where the future takes this game and KSH.So, overall, 12/10			"

Early Access Review
								*Review based on game as of March 2016*This is a very conflicting game for me to review. On one hand there are things about this game that are amazing, which I get excited about, on the other hand I find there are just so many problems and bugs which are holding the game back.I'll start with the negatives. This game is very poorly optimised. I know this game has a lot to render, but the framerate on planets is less than satisfactory even with a reasonably strong PC running on low settings. Planets offer the most interesting gameplay currently, so it's a shame to have to deal with this issue. (I do understand this is an early access game, and optimisation usually comes later in the development cycle, I'm merely commenting on the current state of the game). I usually play on a private server with a small group of friends. During our time playing we have encountered a variety of bugs and frustrations. One of the worst was after a few days building a station on a planet, it decided to flip, damaging or destroying much of our work. This was immensely frustrating, especially as we were also dealing with occasional crashes to both client and server. We also had issues with turrets targeting dogs and just shooting our station instead, causing damage. Not to mention the dogs themselves, which seem to spawn randomly and appear with not much warning. They seem very simple and could do with work. I also find the UI to be a but clunky, but that may be more down to personal preference.That aside, this game has a lot of very nice features. The planets are huge and impressive to see, even though they haven't been in the game too long. The physics in the game is good and the technical side to building ships and stations has plenty of depth, whilst still leaving room for creativity. The resource gathering system is cool too, starting with basic hand drills, up to large mining ships, there is really no limit to how far you can go with this game, as long as you have the time.In summary, this game has plenty of impressive core features but is plagued by frustrating bugs, features and poor optimisation which are currently holding it back. I am highly confident this game will be an amazing experience at some point in the future, but a little patience may be required.Pros:-Planets-Good physics-Good ship/station building mechanics-MiningCons:-Bugs, some severe-Crashes-Dogs are a bit simple-Poor optimisationFinal verdict:4.9/10Maybe pick it up on sale to give it a test, otherwise stay patient maybe until it comes out of early access.~edited to fix a few spelling errors			"

								91% of nearly 42,000 people have given this game a positive rating. How do you go against that?Well, here's how I do it.Space Engineers is a fantastic game if you're prepared to play a local, single player game. It works quite well, with only a reasonably small amount of bugs for an Alpha game.Space Engineers is a terrible game if you'd like to play a dedicated server, multiplayer game. It barely works, with a large array of game breaking bugs for an Alpha game. Furthermore, some deliberate design decisions by Keen will ensure that sooner or later, entire ships, cargo and inventory are lost, and done so on a regular basis.Overall, I'd really like to like this game - and if playing forever by myself was an option, I reckon I'd love it. However, until the cheap and fatally flawed multiplayer code can be fixed (or completely dumped and replaced with something that works) and until some key design decisions can be reversed that stop penalising players for the frequent disconnections induced by said multiplayer code, this is a game whose multiplayer capabilities are best expressed in abstract terms only.

								After having dumped a large amount of time into this game I cannot reccomend this game in its current form. It has so much potential but it's all wasted by being a buggy mess. I would not reccomend investing time into building anything in this game because the bugs will destroy your progress. >start game with buddies>solid 5 hours are fun>spaceship randomly starts flying off from planet, even with the power off>suddenly no one is able to place thrusters>okay lets just make a big land vehicle>land vehicle wheel breaks, stuff on the vehicle starts gyrating like crazy>fine lets try and repair the wheel>place wheel, vehicle goes nuclear and leaves a giant crater destorying 2 days of workMultiplayer can become almost unplayable, even with the simplest build; dedicated server or not, on a beefy PC. With the amount of time this has been in development it is dissapointing to say the least.If Keen fixes their game I will change my review but as it stands I suspect that this game will be remain a buggy mess forever.  I'd love to be proved wrong. "

								Space Engineers is the game I've been wanting for years. I'm a huge Minecraft fan and always wanted something that looked a bit better and gave me even more freedom. I found that with Space Engineers. The building system is great and the mod support is epic! There are so many things that can be build within the game and using added mods. I regularly play with 100+ mods added to the game.Now, with the added planetary support, it has just become my favorite game. I never really get tired of playing this game. It's an awesome builder with a dev team that really enjoys what they are doing with the game.The only downside to the game is it's graphics compatibility issues. It seems that every other update breaks lighting or voxel viewing. That can pose an issue when float through space and you smash into invisible asteroids or when you are deep in a mine on a planet and your helmet lights only half work. Taking a break from playing for now while they sort out more lighting issues.			"

Early Access Review
								This is the game that no man's sky was supposed to be.Kind of.doing cons first, as a tl;dr why you might not want this amazing piece of game.CONS, in order from most to least severe:-Development has been sloooow. The development branch of SE updates weekly, with the stable branch updating monthly, I believe. It's hard to expect revolutionary gameplay changes on a regular basis, but even still, many of the updates are fairly small and mostly contain changes for the sake of mod support or minor bugfixes. The game is still worth playing, but It may be a while before it's finished.-Planets are a bit boring. Space is also boring because it's so empty, but space is just like that. But planets still feel barren and somewhat samey, even with different seeds for random generation. With some luck, more detail will be added to the procedural generation system to allow for things like caves and more detailed biomes- similar to how minecraft works. At the moment, a ""biome"" in SE basically just means a slight difference in the texture on the ground and how bumpy the terrain is. There are a few hostile enemies that spawn as well, but they feel very unfinished and don't add a lot to the gameplay. Generally they just spawn out of nowhere and make a beeline for you or things that you've built, then stand still attacking it until they die or their target dies.It would also be cool to have some weather effects. Just saying.-Fairly demanding game to run. I suspect that a decent gaming computer will run it well (my rig isn't exactly a 'beast' but it runs 60-80 fps at moderate settings) but you're not going to get much out of a generic 150$ laptop from best buy. It's possible that optimization will improve in the future, but at the time of this writing the game definitely needs a good PC to run.-Bugs do crop up from time to time, and there are a handful of quality-of-life issues that i'll rattle off now;--Remote camera overlays are annoying and make it nearly impossible to see when piloting a remote ship. Fortunately, this can be easily fixed with mods.--There are a few features missing that would be nice have in the game, but don't seem to be currently supported- such as locking an axis of rotation on a gyroscope to prevent ships from rotating in a certain direction, or getting GPS coordinates from antennas or beacons. (I don't know if other people have suggested these, but they're things I'd like to see)--Ore detectors and other coordinates seem to be based on the position of the player rather than the camera or the detector itself. This isn't a major issue, but it does mean that if you're trying to pilot a remote-controlled mining ship towards an ore deposit, it may be difficult to tell exactly where it is.--conveyor systems seem a little bit wonky at the moment, i've had instances where I've spent hours gathering hydrogen fuel only to have my hydrogen tanks suddenly vent it all for no apparent reason. Oxygen generators also don't ""share"" resources like other production items do. If you put a chunk of ice through a connector, it will all go to the nearest oxygen generator rather than splitting evenly between several, the same way reactors will evenly split up uranium ingots.--Rotors are a pain to use if you want to have limits on their rotation. you have no real reference for angles other than their current degree of rotation, which means setting the upper and lower limits for rotating is basically done through trial and error. (there's probably a better way to do it, but I'm stupid)So Pros, then. Now in paragraph form, because these were harder to put in a list format.One thing that I really enjoy about this game is the amount of dynamic problem-solving and experimentation involved in building a ship, especially in survival mode. There are a few basic mechanics to ship-building that you can pick up from the tutorial, but the tutorial only shows you how to build one kind of ship. Space is a pretty demanding place to live, and just one kind of spaceship isn't really going to cut it. Eventually, you're going to have to get creative.This means quite a lot of trial and error and a lot of experimenting. Every planet has a slightly different environment, and every survival run is going to have slightly different factors involved (depending on how you set it up). You might end up on a planet without breathable air, creating a need for remote-controlled ships or ships with built-in oxygen generators. Or maybe you're trying to get from one planet to another, meaning you'll need to build a ship with powerful enough engines to get you out into space and then land again. Or maybe you're not on a planet at all, and have to build a ship that can quickly move between asteroids to gather resources.The game has no set list of goals to achieve. Similar to minecraft, you must decide your own endgame, and then take on whatever challenges that goal might involve. But unlike minecraft, in which you ultimately can't create much more than simple machines, decorative buildings, and big holes in the ground, SE lets you really interact with your creations. You can build a model of a huge space shuttle in MC, sure- but only Space Engineers lets you experience flying it.And when you do finally build that shuttle capable of escaping your planet's gravity, there's no feeling more satisfying than looking out the window at the continent you had to turn inside out for resources, and the graveyard of broken or obsolete mining ships that weren't worth fixing or grinding down for scrap metal.Then you have an embarassing crash landing on another planet and realize that the planet you were on before was actually a much nicer place to live.

Early Access Review
Space Engineers is an Early Access space sandbox game, developed by Keen Software House (you might also know them from Medieval Engineers or Miner Wars games). Although it's not yet fully released, it already features a great deal of content.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.Note: I played this game when I was on vacation with no internet so playtime and achievements were not registered for some reason. It was a nice vacation, though.What is happening in the game:People would tell you that it's basically Minecraft in space and they wouldn't be wrong. You can build ships and bases, fly around and mine. What to do in the game is basically your choice, as in all sandbox games.Pros: There are both survival and creative mode. As you can assume, creative mode is for creating, without any real danger you would need to deal with. Survival mode, on the other hand, need a bit more skill when playing, as you have to be careful not to die or lose the energy, there are meteor showers ... Of of the best things in the game is Workshop integration. With 120k+ user-created items submitted, it is obvious that the game is fun enough for that many gamers to post their own creations. There is everything: ships, characters, asteroids ... you name it. A pretty good tutorial introduces you nicely to many features in the game, even the basic movement ones, if you've never played any games before. Some reviews say that this game is abandoned by the developer, however, there are regular updates coming out about twice a month. Even though I'm pretty sure it's not very realistic, it still gives the impression of being like that. Space battles and stuff like that is of course not transferred from the real life, but other content might very well be. A part I'm very thrilled about is in-game programming. You use C# language to write scripts. For a game in Early Access there is a ton of content and things to do. Reminded me of Prison Architect. Impressive.Cons: The price is pretty high for an Early Access game. You should at least put the price a bit lower for the testers! It is true, however, that this game has been bundled twice already (at the time of writing this review). Building stuff takes a long time, ruining it takes seconds. There is Workshop for the lazy people, though. Despite having relatively low system requirements, this game runs slower than it should. I believe they're going to fix that before they get out of Early Access. No Linux and MacOS support. I am not familiar with what engine they're using for this game, but most modern ones support other platforms than Windows.The final verdict:If you are one of the people who love sandbox games (not everybody do), you should consider getting this game. Even though it's in EA, it has tons of content, Workshop support for a few more tons of content and more features will be coming with future updates. The game is fun, not that buggy and it includes both creative and survival mode.I've played Space Engineers a lot already, some people even spent hundreds of hours on it, in case you're worried about how many hours this games can offer.For people who like sandboxes, this is certainly a recommended game.Further reading: Store page Features[www.spaceengineersgame.com] Space Engineers Wiki[www.spaceengineerswiki.com] Gameplay on YoutubeGreetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.---If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

Early Access Review
								Space Engineers is an Early Access game and have been for quite a while. It is in Early Access game with quite a bit of content and more is being added on constantly.  What is in the game?This is an open sandbox game with lots to explore, it is not your typical sandbox game, it is a unique sandbox-space game. There is lots to do, you can build spaceships, explore outerspace, build space stations, have ship fights with friends in your almost fully destrutible enviroment. Is this game worth the money? Personally I think it is worth it, there is so much to do in this game, there is two game modes, Survival and Creative. Pretty self explanatory but Survival is where you are trying to gather your supplies and trying to survive and create your spacestation, but in creative you get to create your own spaceship or spacestation or whatever you want to make with all the tools at your fingertips. Yes the game is a bit expensive 25$ at the moment, it did go up recently from 20$ if you dont want to spend that much then just wait for a sale when it will be much cheaper. The game is fun but even more fun with some friends to mess around with.Pros Huge Workshop, there are over 150 thousand workshop submissions from Spacestations, Spaceships, and all kinds of machines. Regular updates to the games, some great devolopers working on this game they update 1-2 times a month. Great game there is so much to do, you can have huge space battles with friends, build an army of spaceships, have races in fast spaceships, build a deathstar. There is a great high detailed tutorial that helps you figure out this game which can be pretty complicated at first.Cons Again this game is a bit expensive, 25$ is quite expensive for some people but it does go on sale and when it does you should get yourself a copy and maybe one for a friend. The controls for flying ships are a bit hard but once you get used to them it becomes more enjoyable. It does take a while to build stuff and can be challenging and frustrating when a friend or someone or even yourself destroys your creation in a matter of seconds My final thoughts and opinion of Space EngineersThis game is still in Early Access and is one of the better sandbox games i have seen and played so far. There is 100s of hours of gameplay to offer and maybe even thousands. There is plenty of mods to try out and play. There isnt very many gamebreaking bugs (or none that i have found or heard of) but the developers are always updating and patching bugs. This is a great game for early access and i am excited to see what is to come later, i highly recommend this game to fans of sandbox games, and fans of building games. "

								The devs working on this game are seriously dedicated to the quality of their product. They know what they're doing, and getting weekly patch updates as they continue to expand and refine this game is amazing. Even if they stopped trying tomorrow, this game would easily be worth $40 given the amount of entertianment it's provided me, and will continue to provide. And that's the best part: they haven't stopped. They keep making it better.This game is pure gold. It's essentially a box of space legos with mining.			"

								Space Engineers is an ambitious game. However, it has two huge problems. To counter that, it has some of the best ship building and flying for anything that you build.A) It's a sandboxB) It's a buggy mess.Now, before the introduction of planets, the sandbox aspect was more or less not a big problem - all resources were accessible if you could just find the right asteroid. Survival was a thing you could do.Come planets though, mining planetside and progressing to get into space became nonexistant. Multiple ""features"" are ignored, despite being buggy across months of patches. Currently the game is stuck in bug patching hell, and every bug ""fix"" seems to introduce three more that were worse than the last.It's great if you just want to play around in sandbox and make things, but forget about enabling meteor storms. If you're on a planet, they cause damage to all the voxels, slowing things down, and they have no parameters that you can set to make them seem challenging but not overwhelming.They mostly need to work on world generation and progressing from planets to space, neither of which seem to be on their roadmap. To make it all worse they released Medieval Engineers before it even really hit an Alpha state!			"

								Ok, i have been playing this game for a while now and i think its time to write a review.Pros:+ great potential+ lots of things to do+ SP+ Great non-toxic community+ Capital ship battles with my friends+ update videos, dancing dusan(music video coming soon maybe?).+ Community plays a huge part in the design of the game.Cons:- Bugs, lots of them- MP sucks, (netcode improvements are coming tho.)- optimization (working on it tho)- Crashes- rotors, pistons and all things CLANG.In general i would recommend this game to anyone who has creativity and likes Space. The community is great and the devs bring out lots of teasers and information about development, its even possible to chat with some of the devs on xocliw's (community manager) stream or on discord. -Sirhamsteralot			"

								Interesting game that brought a lot of new ideas to the genre, there are a lot of very interesting and solid mods out there that add a lot of replayability and complexity to the game, it still has a large and active community.Sadly it is plagued with numerous bugs and problems with the engine from the very beginning. Lately the bugs and problems are getting worse, Keen Software House seems unable to get a grip on the problems plaguing the game, in fact the game is now at a point where it has become unplayable for me.Numerous bugs in the physics engine, failed multiplayer, massive problems with bigger models, items falling through the ground and, worst of all, sudden freezes every few minutes or directly after loading where the game can only be killed with the task manager loosing all progress, have made the game an exercise in rage control instead of an enjoyable adventure.I have lost hope that Keen Software House will be able to fix the game, i think there are problems with the underlying concept, the way the software is build, that make it ultimately unfixable.Well, time to move on to greener pastures, sorry, can not recommend with a good conscience.

								The game is beta and should be treated as such, single player is fun but quiet.  Multiplayer is amazing but painfully frustrating when things start to lag a bit, which happens quickly on any server that is remotely popular.   Sim speeds drop quickly, ships you've built will do crazy things including and up to destroying themselves and everything around it.  I can't recommend the game in it's current state and I have over a 1000 hours in game.  I really do love this game when it works, it's amazing, but the continuous bugs and multiplayer issues cast a huge shadow over Space Engineers.  I am starting to wander if Keen even has anyone play the public servers to see what it's like.. Wait to get this game until some of those outlaying issues are fixed, if they ever are..   Yes it is a Beta game, and as such I can't recommend it unless you're willing to put up with the frustrating bugs and slow development where it matters, multiplayer framework etc..			"

Minecraft in Space?It is not Minecraft, but it has similarities, being a grid based game (often called voxel); however your grids form their own ""objects"" making it possible to smash those grids against each other and watch havok deform the material, and spaceships create awesome wrecks.The Creative Solo PlayerWith multiple ways to achieve your results, you will quickly see the creative part of the game becomes the first magnet. Designing your own stuff is easy there, weapons do not require ammo to fire, blocks are buildable fast.You can use mirroring to build faster, modify the level to your liking by deforming asteroids or placing objects, copy and paste parts on each other, use all kinds of mechanical parts, or a programming block to create whatever you imagine. But the biggest fun is to actually design in creative, save it as a blueprint, and rebuild it in survival conditions, or use your own spaceship design in a custom match.Creative gives you all the abilities to get to know the game engine. Not everything you can play in singleplayer will make a lot of sense in multiplayer, and you can create abonimations like life sized ships, use thousands of mods to make them beautiful and even host it for a few players to look around.SurvivalSurvival is the basic new trend in sandbox games, once you learn how to survive, you also learn how resources are limited, and how the players are balanced in a MP setting. Surviving in space needs energy and oxygen atm. - you need to mine asteroids, refine the materials, build new materials, and each component you would build in creative with a click needs a lot more work.Since you can die, or stuff which explodes might be lost, your energy might run out, or your oxygen, survival gives it's own long term struggles, but does not really hinder you to establish yourself, and concentrate on tasks at hand.Therefore the refining and assembling is not as complicated as in games dedicated to this, but still complicated enough that a question which you never asked yourself suddenly pops up, and makes you realize, your current design philosophy with all its glory has also its weaknesses.There is little more to say, it's only a step, if you cannot entertain yourself, you might want more... so more to come...ScenariosAtm. introduced, scenarios and modding are a big focus of Keen. Designing your own level, like it's a game within a game, and playing it with friends, or publishing it and become famous on workshop are their own achievement. However, be warned, this part of the game is still under construction.The Space MMO dream?With the coming introduction of planets, the introduction a new rewritten netcode, and the developers going public with sourcecode (so you can help fix bugs or have it easier to create mods on github), and also the efforts in AI ""research"" from the publisher, it seems clear, that sandbox worlds are a dream of the dev team, aswell as the player base.Currently however, you should not expect a full online game experience.Current state critiqueI have little critique. It is the first C# app, I do not dismiss, simply because it's written in a virtual machine language, something I do not want game engines written in personally; I can see a lot of struggles ahead for the devs, but they seem keen (pun intended) on facing those obstacles. I can only say, if they keep up their energy, and dedication, this game will slowly evolve into an absolute classic. That said, it runs well, but of course also eats resources, if you give it more. Like basicly every physics game; graphics and effects are decent, as is FPS.This being said, it's of course directx only, so windows/xbox based, with still a rudimentary hackish netcode, and no sandbox servers, database stuff etc, and especially not for linux, to make it really able to create medium sized communities for your own ""little spacegame"". There are servers which try to make larger games than 4-6 players possible, but actually, it is not something you want to play now. However, since there is much to do until that is all ready, and still core features to come, I would hop on now, than later; it is more than worth it's money in fun, and offers you especially if you have a geeky heart or a fable for lego or lego technic, a lot, especially if you like to invest time ""behind the game"".It is also great for kids, since the game does not focus on violence, much less than minecraft anyway, while it also does not completely ""conceal its possibility"".Have I said, that you can smash ships you built with copy paste to see them explode? This should be all the arguments you need. If you quickly want to do something in a virtual world, this is one of the most ideal games for it. You might even just build a conference center for youtube videos or create machinimas with it - if you are the creative player, who wants to design, this game is already in a very finished state. For everyone who waits for the online experience, I can understand if it stays on the whishlist. But definitely, it deserves a spot there.			"

I spent some time happily crashing spaceships into station platforms.  Since that time, October '13 I think, it has come a very long way.  Survival mode, Workshop creations, multi-player and even NPC ships that can be highjacked if you dare. The developers watch the forums and respond to anything from ""send me your game world to be checked"" to actively focusing on fan desired features!  No regrets in buying this. It's one of my favorites.			"

Let's just use this example : Instead of actually fixing the multiplayer server sim speed problems they implement lens flares and chrome wheels. Things considered to be crap compared to the big problems.It's a great game for what it is, but it needs a♥♥♥♥♥♥TON of work that WILL NEVER be fixed. You're better off buying a different game.			"

								This game... I hope someday I can change this review to positive but honestly its beenyears now and perhaps there have been a few optimizations but it is /still/ a bloodymess.Let me start by saying I recently re-downloaded this game, after giving up on it becauserather than optimize the game KSH just decided to raise the minimum system requirementsand I did not meet them. Prior to this I was eagerly awaiting the upcoming optimization,planets, and new multiplayer back end update. All while suffering through the terribly lowfps and sim speed.I was really enjoying myself on one of the preset earth-like worlds untill it got so slow thatit became a pain to even play(can we say memory leaks boys and girls? :D)I've now uninstalled it and given up on it a second time.I have heard KSH and their legion of fans preach ""Premature optimization is the root ofall evil."" as an excuse for KSH to not optimize their code untill beta. Well let me justremind them that the /full/ quote is actually:    We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time; premature optimization    is the root of all evil    ~Donald KnuthThis was born in a time when we still were working with asm. Small efficiencies here literallymeant techniques that would have obfusticated the code base or making various,per-cpu-model optimizations for a fractional speed boost. This does not mean make stupidand wasteful choices while coding. This does not mean ignore plainly obvious bottlenecks incode (I am certain there must be a few with how bloody slow this game runs). This does notmean raise the minimum system requirements instead of optimizing the game.It means write code intelligently, which is really not that hard to do if you are capable ofwriting even basic programs (think basic utilities or really simple GUI without an IDE backingyou), but don't go nuts on refactoring or writing semi-obfusticated code just to reduceprocessing a small amount. It means attach a profiler, determine where the real hogs are,and address them instead.I acknowledge that beta is a time of bug fixing and optimization. But that is precisely thetime for optimization of the little things, which is exactly what Knuth was referencing.Fixing the bugs and optimizing the systems is something that should be done the /entire/time.As I said, I have nothing but a few minor issues with the actual game itself (cyberdogs areone of these issues for being so out of place and immersion breaking), but the VRageengine is a trashy mess currently and ruins the game for me and several others I know.I /really/ hope that I can actually run this game some day!Thanks to whomever reads this, and best of luck to the devs :)			"

								This is one of my overall favorite games of all time.The crafting and survival systems are all very well balanced, fun, and gives you a great sense of accomplishment as you build yourself up from a basic ship/base trying to meet your basic energy needs all the way up to a multi-planet power.The engineering and design elements are both challenging and engaging. It tests my creativity to come up with functional and aesthetic design, but the end result is more than worth it.The game definitely has more than it's fair share of bugs, however. Optimization is poor at best, and there are multiple game crashing bugs that I run into regularly.That having been said, the developers have put in a staggering number of new features since the game was released, including the MASSIVE and game changing Planets update that was never even initially planned. And the last month or so, they have focused exclusively on bug fixing and it's really starting to show.Overall, the game has issues that I would consider unplayable in MOST games. However, the fun of the game outweighs the frustration by miles, and with the developers history of listening to the fans, I have absolutely full confidence the devs will work out the kinks.I would call this game a must have.

								This review is heartbreaking for me.TLDR: Keen ruined this game.In it's alpha prime, when it was still a space sandbox, PVP was amazing. A cluster of asteroids that pirates and miners fought for with creations of their own designs.. perfect.Instead of optimizing that, they listened to whiners and pressure to do other things, and released planets. And started Medieval Engineers. And made exploding wolves. Been waiting on Netcode, stability, and clang fixes for over a year now without playing. (most of my hours logged were pre-planet PVP and design.)EDIT: Okay, as someone pointed out, Keen ruined MY own idea of how this game should be (survival sandbox pvp). However, honestly, if Keen would fix JUST STABILITY, INCLUDING MULTIPLAYER, this game could be what anyone wants. Custom servers can be setup for every style of gameplayed desired, but Keen hasnt been able to deliver that for well over a year now.			"

								Its a really well made realistic space survival sim that involves mining and assembling. Its a good thing you dont have to eat aswell! its a top space sim for online gaming and 1 of the best MP space creative/survival sims I've ever played, though it could use a planet or two with dust rings you can fly though or something, something more than just asteriods/meteorites something to explore, discover, achieve some sort of a goal? in game and not as a mod would be nice.If you love to use your Imagination for Creation and have a love of Space this game is worth a crack. ps thankyou for the the tutorials redirection at the start of new games many ppl I play with just keep'd getting confused by the complex appearance of the game and this has hlp'd heaps THX's and keep up the good work, its very hard to find a problem with this sandbox game as it is a very unique concept and very well done already but its still a beta, nice work so far I can't wait to see whats coming next.

Early on, there was great progress, along with many new features that needed refining. In very early 2014 I downloaded a cracked version of SE to test it out. 400 hours later I bought the game to help support and add my constructive criticisms to improve the game. Rotors, Pistons, and so much more was added!Through many of the requests by players, we got many additions and other grand features, like warp drive, batteries, sensors, and much more. NETCODE --- Players asked for better multiplayer netcoding, we got BLOCK COLOURS... This adding of ""Flash and flare"" as I call it, has done nothing but satiate the players who can't see past their own noses. This ""flash and flare"" has been a constant method of Keen to satiate EVERY request for multiplayer netcoding along with ""Soon"". Well.. We are now nearly 2 years down the line, the game is BEYOND playable in terms of multiplayer. Simulation speeds will drop to .3 - .2 with few physics operations. PLANETS --- No doubt a big deal. They are very impressive! Well, until you realize that you CAN NOT play on them. Search youtube for ""Planetary Holes"". Since then, we got exploding Cyborg Dogs... Really? More flash and flare to distract the simple-minded players from the ABYSMAL quality of multiplayer. 1 year ago I had a relatively stable world with 2 large 800 meter asteroids that I generated for my dedicated server and the community that played. The forums run by Keen were flooded with players and groups and communities with lavish ideas and doing everything they could to encourage improvements for this game.Since then, Keen has done nothing but ALIENATE the valuable playerbase they first had. Read the replies for each weekly update, dating as far back as possible. The vast majority of the players have left, along with countless multiplayer communities. The comments have degenerated into useless ""Thanks!"" replies along with the ""Negative Constructive Criticism"" from the few valuable players who still cling to the hope that Keen will eventually fix this game. The final interaction I will have with Keen and their products after this review is posted, is to wipe it from my personal computer as well as my dedicated server once and for all. For a game with such grand potential, Keen has squandered it, and lost their most valuable resource - THE LOYAL PLAYERS WHO STUCK THROUGH THE FIRST YEAR OF MAJOR ISSUES. Now you are held up by fanboys parading ""THANKS!"" on each weekly update instead of the QUALITY that you first demonstrated.  Shame on you Keen, however, shame on me for actually trusting your company and it's HISTORY of incomplete products. You have tarnished the purpose of ""Early Access"" games.			"

								Consider that this review was written on 09/08/2016. This game may have changed meaningfully between then and now. I've got a lot of hours down in this game. I've enjoyed it. Not anymore though.The game does have merits.- I've enjoyed survival mode a lot. It's fun to start with limited resources and scrounge up what you can to build and progress until you finally have the resources to build something impressive. It was very fun when I came across a derelict station to explore it and gradually rip it down for parts. But I played 300 hours of this game before that ever happened; it was the first and only time I came across one. They're apparently sparsely located, and, naturally, they're difficult to see in space. - Planets can be an interesting challenge, to an extent. Wheels were added a long time before planets were, but they were basically redundant. There wasn't an advantage to making a wheeled vehicle in artifical gravity over a flying one, really. - There are very many mods. If you don't like something about the game, there's a good chance it can be changed. Mods include upgrade modules for thrusters, different suits (models and different stats like hydrogen, carrying capacity), new planets, more encounters, homing missiles, skyboxes, probably any given armour block you would need..Keen have really made this game very modable. - Programmable Blocks have allowed for many interesting possibilities. I've seen a script that draws a map of your ship and represents the damage as it takes it, radars, reports on inventory..It can be very interesting, if you know any C#. - The armour damage is very nice. The best part of making a large ship is taking it into battle and wrecking it.But it has more cons at this time than pros to my eyes. - After playing enough survival to get on your feet with a stable supply of resources, what is the point? There is nothing to drive you but the goals you set yourself. There are enemy drones, but they don't seek you out so much; you have to come into their sensor radius first, then they'll come after you with drones. You can do a lot as far as building goes, but there isn't any reason to. In that sense it's more like a tech demo. The same for creative mode.- If you've read much about Space Engineers you may have come across the name ""Clang"", a joke deity players made up to explain the very frequent physics bugs that afflict this game, derived from the noise they make. They didn't do this after only a little while; it's been broken all along. Many ships have been lost to splruging pistons, rotors and landing gears, the latter of which is to be fair better than it was. But it still very common with rotors or pistons in my experience to simply blow up your machine.- Where's the engineering in Space Engineers? The only blocks that are really mechanical are Pistons and Rotors. These are both horrendously broken a lot of the time, and are actively avoided in ships and stations by most players because they have a tendency to blow up. So the only blocks that are designed to make elaborate, custom machinery instead of premade blocks are deathtraps, and in one of their livestreams (or possible their roadmap on Marek, the CEO's devblog) they basically said they have no plans to add any more blocks like those because of how much trouble they've had with pistons or rotors. At this time, if you want to build a walking mech or some other elaborate machine, you can probably forget it. - There's actually not much depth to planets, it seems to me. You're relying more on solar power and batteries because Uranium the usual power source, is scarce, so you can't just throw thrusters at everything. However, once you have enough batteries, or find some uranium, you can do whatever you want more or less. Furthermore, my experience of tyres has been that they're more likely to flip you over than give you any stable vehicle; they have plenty of settings to modify to fix this, but you have to do so much fiddling to get a wheeled vehicle worth a damn. There's also no way of making a plane that flies like a plane; if you want to go up, you need thrusters. - Reliance on mods. I believe that Keen have made their game so modable because they want many possibilities to exist in this game but don't want to spend the time and money doing it themselves. Look at the amount of things that are mods that should, in my opinion, be in the core game. For one, suits with different attributes. You can get a mod for a heavy suit that is slower but can carry more, or a fast one with little capacity, and so on. Those should be in the game itself. Or the Aerodynamic Wings mod that lets you make planes that can fly more like real planes, instead of the fake planes you would have to make in the base game that fly with downwards facing thrusters. - Enemies. There are drones in space that aren't so bad. The drone Argentavis will occasionally appear and may head for something nearby. Itcan spawn other types of drone..some are designed to attack, others designed to look around and summon atack drones if it finds something. I've never tried capturing it myself, but I'm told it's a challenge. It's not so bad. But on the Earthlike Planet, you have Cyberhounds, packs of cyborg dogs that appear from nowhere, spawning near you, and attack. You can't outrun them. If they can't get to you, they will chomp at the nearest structure. Why do they even exist? In universe? Someone must be making them. But more importantly, they're not a challening enemy, they're a nuisance. Set up a moat (with no water, because water is actually solid ice) and you'll be fine. Or if you have the Magnesium, a auto-turret. Or if not, set up some grinders with sensors that turn on when enemies draw near, they'll walk right into it. Alien Planets have Sabiroids, spider-like creatures with basically the behaviour as Cyberhounds. Except they will happilly glitch-walk right over each other and if memory serves don't eat your work. Both of these types of enemy, I've seen, may well spawn inside your structures; they spawn within a certain radius of you, not taking into account your environment. - Multiplayer is broken. They say they have been working on it for some time, and are fixing it. Most accounts I've heard suggest it's still dross. A person managing an SE server really must put in effort to get it to not perform like crap. The most popular tool for this is a third party on called SE Server Extender, if I remember rightly. I believe Keen were considering integrating it into the game .- Don't expect to be able to detail your ships worth a damn. Large Ship Blocks are large, often stupidly; a Catwalk is a very thin bit of metal, but it still takes up the whole space, meaning I can't have a walkway with a light above it in a 1 block space. Simple things like that can't be done, so if you want detail it ends up bloating your entire ship. There is a mod to give small ships all large ship blocks, which can give you great results, but the large small ship may be poor for performance. TL;DR:Pro:- Tonnes of mods- In-game programming can be good.- Deformable armour is great.- Pretty large planets. Several types (Earthlike, Alien, Martian, etc)- Single Player is fine enough so long as you set your own goals.Con:- There's basically no engineering in Space Engineers.     - Rotors and Pistons will break your work.- Large Ships have to be very big to have much detail.- Things that should be game mechanics are left to modders (which I believe is Keen's deliberate laziness.)- Multiplayer is broken. - Enemies are very dumb, and don't make sense in-universe (cyborg hounds, who is making them?)- Planet performance varies wildly depending on your computer and has not much depth. - The devs are also friends with several of the more prominent YouTubers who play this game, which I think is inappropriate.I suggest not to buy.

								This game is so enveloping! The first time I tried survival, I died several times while trying to build a ship because I forgot to build a place to recharge my suit. Then, after about a few hours of building a small mining ship I finished; Only to crash it while mining an asteroid far from base. the only bad side about this game is the buggy multiplayer, but the devs have promised to fix that once planets are out!The Skybox has been changed and looks spectacular! Also, there's now a speaker block, so you can easily rig a simple alarm to tell you if you're going to run into a wall, someone entered your ship, etc.With the addition of exploration mode, your world can be almost infinite! Now the game features an alpha prototype of Scenarios, which will be basically like single player missions.Planets are now here, and i must say, they look fantastic! Unfortunately, I personally had some problems with getting high FPS, but after tweaking the graphics settings a little, it was fixed.Tip: Don't turn grass multiplier up to 10 and then set to HIGH definition of foliage. Great way to break your computer.9/10 A great game that continues to get better!			"

								Space engineers, by far, is one of my favourite games on steam. I've had the game for a very long time now, and I've never been disappointed by it. The graphics for me are good enough, and the controls are easy enough too, I suppose. The game is in EA still, so there still will be bugs, for obvious reasons. I can see a great future in this game, and this could easily become one of steams most well known game easily.But i stress, this game is not bug free, and probably wont be for some time, but i've only had very few bugs as I've played.If there is any future updates that I'm imperessed with, I will update my review accordingly.

								I really love this game and spend many hours into it ever week. Space Engineers is a game where the only limit is your imagination and how much your computer can handle.What I really love about this is how it allows the player to build what they want : A fighter, a crane or even a replica of a ship from Star Wars. Then? You break them! Ram them together, have a massive ship to ship battle or crash land on a planet? You decide!Also, the game gets updated every Thursday allowing players to have fun with the new features and laugh at new bugs.The only negative I can think of is some slight performance issues when things explode or ships ram, which gets only worse on a lower end computer. I currently get great performance on my high end PC.In the end, this is just an amazing game well worth the money. What are you waiting for?! Buy it already!!!			"

								A creative and exciting game where you get the incredible opportunity to be a space miner and build your own ship. You spend the first hour of the game going around space and getting excited about how cool your life is, and getting basic resources, like iron and uranium. You spend the second hour building your own amazing ship, which is all fine until you realise that you have got no silicon so you can't build squat. Hour 2 to 12 is spent flying around space in a desperate attempt to find Silicon, while your co-op friends shout at you for being worhtless and politely suggest that you should end your own life. You, of course, find no silicon.Hour 12 to 20 is spent alone, crying on the cold hard floor of your bathroom, mumbling incoherently about Silicon - this is where the game breaks the 4th barrier and enters your real life, forcing you to re-evaluate your priorities.10/10, best no-Silicon simulator in the whole Universe.

Early Access Review
 Space Engineers: A Game of Infinite Possibility  The History I initially purchased Space Engineers during it's Early Access period fairly close to its arrival on Steam on recommendation by a good friend. Until recently, Space Engineers was a game I would play heavily for a month or so, and then put down for an indefinite amount of time until I got the itch to build a sci-fi wet dream all over again. About two months ago, I heard that there was some talk about putting planets into the game, and I decided to ease myself back into the mechanics before the launch of the new update, which proved to be counter-intuitive as the update changed everything I knew about the game. The Review As the mechanics of the game itself have heavily changed since the introduction of planets, this section will cover my thoughts post-update. Planetary gravity has revolutionized everything about the way this game is played from the ground up. When I first loaded up my new world, I found myself amidst the derelict husk of a spaceship in the middle of the night somewhere on the face on an earthlike planet, out of broadcasting range of my friends. We initially spent the first two hours discovering we were out of range of the strongest beacons, and that we couldn’t seem to build a ship strong enough to escape the planets gravity, much less keep them upright during the building process. Eventually we discovered that it all came down to mass, center of gravity, and the angle at which we tried to escape the atmosphere. This is what draws me to launching this game every night, the sudden tangibility of the  world  solar system post-update. You can easily lose a ship you spent hours assembling due to a misplaced thruster, crashing into a planet leaving nothing but a crater behind. The map spaces are so large that you can lose your base, your friends, and all sense of direction. The core difference between gameplay as it exist now compared to a year ago, is that you frequently have to build something to address a crisis, and not just because you want to.Despite all of the positives this game brings to the table, it does struggle with some graphical and physics based glitches. While most of these boil down to minor annoyances in the grand scheme of the game, there have been moments when these issues have rendered my game unplayable.It would be a travesty to discuss what makes this game great without touching on the fantastic modding community attached to it. The people who love this game have created everything from small physics fixes to gigantic rail canons capable of punching a whole through practically anything. You would be missing out if you didn't browse through the Steamworkshop for this title. The Takeaway This game provides a form of sci-fi fantasy fulfillment rooted in compelling physics, and a fantastic community. While this is not a game for the easily frustrated, as it suffers from a variety of technical and graphical glitches, I have found that almost any question I have is answered shortly by a quick browse through the forums, and the developer has frequently implemented changes derived from player feedback (i.e. the planets update). If you are willing to invest the time to learn the games physics and nuanced mechanics, the payoff is worth it.Good fit for: Sci-fi fans, Simulator junkies, Creative types. Bad fit for: Fast-paced gamers, Glitch haters.			"

								I've had this game for a while, and it's almost as broken as ever. Here's a small series of events that happened today (keep in mind that this is just one of the many examples I have).My friend and I were on a planet, and I was flying around with a plane thing. I got a lag spike and crashed into the ground. We tried to rebuild the plane by attaching a projector to a truck. While building the plane it and the truck smashed into the ground with the force of a thousand black holes, leaving a big crater and destroying all our work. Then we quit.There's also some very nauseating graphical bugs, like the one that causes the lighting to change very suddenly and harshly.I get that the game is early access, but I find it much less excusable when Keen Software House is currently working on two early access games at once yet doesn't seem capable of developing either.

								Ok, no matter what anyone says, this is not minecraft in space.Space Engineers is way ahead of any other alpha game. It's physics are amazing and are a force for haters to reckon with. The graphics are great and the music adds atmosphere to it. It's graphics are ahead of their time and have been and still are being perfected. The gameplay is great, unless you've got a crappy PC (unfortunatly thats me too) so I found that using a reasonably good Toshiba PC works just fine. There is no actual storyline, you've just gotta go along with what the world gives you.Graphics: 9.5/10 Graphics can cause some lag.Physics: 8.7/10 They still need to worked on,,,, a lot, but are still ahead of their time.Gameplay: 9.9/10 Still needs to be tweaked, but still love it!Overall Verdict: 9.8/10 It's still a great game, but needs that little bit of tweaking.Would play over and over again just to have my base destroyed by asteriods.

								Alright so due to a recent impulse of negative reviews I want to clear up a few things about SE.ONE, it is in (Beta), and has one of the most active development base in all of steam and early access. Also, the main features have been added, and optimization is the next step, the game has gotten SO MUCH BETTER since itfirst came out, and people complain about the performance after the planetary release, this was a huge feature.The game uses a lot of computing for mapping out and modifing a massive planet, so there is a pretty big load on your PROCESSORS, this game doesn't need a badass GPU, it needs a pretty good CPU to run smoothly. The Network coding is being completely restructured, so obviously it is going to take awhile to be sufficent, but it WILL be better than it was before. All in all, this is a great creative game that is great for you if you have a good rig and love other creative survival games like Rust, Minecraft, DayZ, H1Z1, etc.			"

								I was pretty skeptical about buying into yet another early access game when looking into Space Engineers and it took some more convincing than the usual reading through the Steam store but eventually I did end up getting the game. To my delight the development team has been really hard at work with releasing updates which more often than not contain noticeably good tweaks to content and optimization. Updates are seen at a regular interval of about twice a month and if there's one thing I learned from fooling myself into getting Starforge and watching the progress of Starbound it's that steady updates are king and there's nothing more irritating that developers who spend more time talking about how great the game will be when it's finished than they do working on the game. As with any early access game there's still a lot of work to be done; the most recent update was as a fantastic jump on optimization which allows for collisions to be made without losing literally all of your frames for a few seconds but the Survival mode which was also implemented with it is still at a lackluster state where it's only really worth checking out if you want to demo what will soon come around. You can't really lose with holding out on buying an early access game but if you're considering Space Engineers I feel that I can tell you it's worth picking up.			"

								At this point this game is absolutely not recommended for anyone but die-hard alpha testers.The game is fun - basically - you build your space ship on beautiful (hand-crafted) planets or in space or both, fly around, gather resources, build more stuff, fight alien spiders for resources, build more stuff. It is basically like half a Minecraft in space, just without the long-term entertainment and reasonable multiplayer.On the other hand the game is so full of bugs right now, that playing is painful. Crashes, safe-file corruptions, they got it all. Multiplayer has been neglected for years now and unless you like playing on servers with 5 fps that crash every 20 minutes it's just not fun at all.KSH releases an update every Thursday with incredible updates like ""Planets now have more stones, and some of them contain ore."" At KSH this is the result of a full week of work. Oh and also they add bug-fixes to the changelog, but that doesn't mean that those bugs are fixed, just that it says so in the changelog. And they add new bugs to the list, game-breaking ones that everyone who tested the game for at least five minutes would have noticed, but obviously KSH does no testing at all. Since the source code is available on GitHub it is painfully clear that KSH has basically no idea how to make a game, or to code. For example every random coder that does Minecraft mods gets a power system right, KSH doesn't manage to do that in month. Obviously adding and subtracting some numbers is already beyond the capabilities of this company. Don't expect this game to ever go out of alpha, the developers just don't have the skills to do that ever.			"

Early Access Review
								This review is of the Early Access (pre-release) version of the game, current as of 10/13/2014, and pertains almost exclusively to the Survival mode of the game.Early access it may be, but Space Engineers is worth a look if you enjoy builders (eg. Minecraft-style) games. I've spent much of the past weekend mining, refining, assembling, and then building the components of various ships and devices, to much enjoyment. Flight is Newtonian, jetpacks are standard, and the freedom of flight on top of the construction mechanics is enjoyable.However, like most builder games, Space Engineers has a large element of resource collection and extraction. In this case, it's also part of the charm - there's nothing like building your first tunnel-boring machine and using it to core right through an enormous asteroid - but expect to spend some time mining if you're not simply playing creative mode. That means some relatively mundane mining - whether it's small scale mining by hand, or large scale resource extraction. It also means finding ores, but the game provides tools for this (ore detectors, lights, and conveyor/connector systems) to permit a player to facilitate this as much as possible mechanically without actually removing it. When creating a survival mode world, give some consideration to your intended style of play. For instance, the game offers the opportunity to let welding (construction), grinding (deconstruction), refining (ores into ingots), assembly (ingots into components), and general inventory size be faster, more efficient, or simply larger. These changes can alter a survival mode game into something much more like the creative mode, or allow a single player to have the ability to move the ores and components of ten men when multiplayer is not available. None of this will stop a single player from playing as they wish, but it will have an impact on the level of tedium a player may have to ignore or overcome to enjoy the game.Full disclosure: I'm currently playing a ""all settings realistic"" Lone Survivor start, where I've gotten my first mining barge up and running despite starting with nothing more than a hand drill and the basic machines needed to process ores and materials. There's a sense of satisfaction attached to starting with ""nothing"" and bootstrapping yourself into an effective spot.As it's early access, the only ""threat"" the game proivides is in the form of wandering mostly-passive cargo vessels (turrets ahoy) to attack, scrap, or plunder (optional and default to off), or metor swarms hammering your landing pads and ships. Metors can be avoided easily by building some basic armor for your stations, or building them in the shadow of the rocks, but on the highest settings you'll be hard pressed to avoid the constant barrage of rock from above.I'd recommend this - but keep in mind it's a lot like Minecraft. Sandbox and passive play is the order of the day, not frenetic action. (Though, the game certainly seems to support it, with gatling guns and rocket pods along with its assault rifles and jetpacks.) It's a much more spartan and simple affair than its learning curve will initially indicate, but there's plenty of sand from which to build your castle-in-the-sky.			"

Early Access Review
								short review: great concept, lots of potential, fun to play, large variety and easy use of mods.Sadly the game is weakened by lots of bugs even by Early access standards, multiplayer hardly playable, weekly updates causing more problems than they solve. I recommend buying it at a discounted price or in a few months when hopefully the most annoying bugs will be resolved.PROS:-you can build nearly everything you can imagine -large world maps including huge planets ready to be explored.-provides interesting engineering challenges for building spaceships/stations, planetary bases etc.-Survival and creative mode Wich allows you to play the way you want-Huge amount of player scenarios and creations to play with, and you can publish your own easily!- large variety of mods available on the workshop, to enhance your experience-multiplayer modeCONS-weekly updates create more problems than they solve, forcing you to face new bugs every week-they main engineering features, rotors and pistons, still cause problems since their implementation-the amount of issues is too much, even by Early access standards-poor optimization, compatibility issues with graphic cards-the game can't handle huge structures or big scenarios-lack of proper enemies in survival mode-multiplayer users experience most of the bugs, to the point of being unplayable-tutorials are insufficient to explain game mechanicsCONCLUSIONIt's an amazing concept, and I have no doubts that more stable updates will remove most of the issues. It's worth buying at a later date, however, when major bugs in MP and SP will be resolved. The constant instability of the game due to new bugs introduced every week is going to turn you off from playing it. That's why this review is negative. Space Engineers needs to have more stable updates, and bugs must be at least not evident the moment we start the game. Early access can exscuse most of them, but some don't need even testing to be seen, and those are not exscusable.I am confident that in the upcoming months major bugs will eventually be resolved, and thus I recommend SE at a later date or at discounted price.

								Don't believe the recommended computer specs; they're a lie. It's a gamble whether this game will run decently on your pc. It has next to nothing to do with how good your computer actually is.Despite an entire year focused on resolving such issues, the game is still a horribly optimized buggy mess. The developers are obviously incompetent, ignore issues which plague most users, and lie about the state of their game so that they may get more people yet to give them money. It's theivery, frankley.  Do not buy this game. Buy something else.Visit the discussions if you want to see evidence of what I'm saying here.			"

								This game is almost infinitely detailed within well-defined limits: you're a space engineer, and you can create various moving and non-moving structures in space: space ships, space stations, robots, hovercrafts, wheeled vehicles, and the like. There's a survival mode to make this more interesting, as well: you'll need to collect ore from various asteroids for raw materials for your creations. Because of the amount of complexity, you can also create your own 'game modes', if you put your mind to do it - moreso than unmodded Minecraft. The physics are 'real' - you'll have to worry about gravity, structural integrity, damage, and momentum. Flying your first ship is a thrilling experience; being crushed or slingshotted by a stray piece of dismantled ship or space trash is, as well. It seems to really shine in multiplayer but none of my friends have bought it yet - hopefully this review can play a part in changing that! Also, the game is updated with new mechanics and features much faster than I can keep up - it's freakily exciting to see each dev update and see that they've added two or three amazingly complex but well-thought-out additions.

								****BETA REVIEW****sim speed is slow. Everytime i start up the game the sim speed slower than a snail. Unplayable. Only cool thing is the new textures. The game is pretty unplayable. Why is this game even in Beta? ****ALPHA REVIEW****The game was decent before the planet update. After that the game has gone downhill. Pistons and rotors just exploding and ruining hours of gameplay work this is a problem that has been around for 2 years.... The game doesnt even run properly on recomended specs. The community is full of redditors with self entitled opinions that just  cant accept the games faults. Cant enjoy multiplayer because their netcode is bad. Cant enjoy singleplayer because of the bad game stutters or constant crashes while flying a ship out of the planets atmosphere. I bought multiple copies to share with friends and we cant even enjoy the mp aspect of the game. Dont waste your money until they fix these bugs and update the netcode if you are looking for the mp experience......			"

								Space Engineers is a very detailed, very impressive sandbox crafting game set in space.  It consists of building things, exploration and gathering resources for said building.The highlights of the game are that you can make pretty much whatever you want, and that you can be as specific in your building as your patience allows right down to each block.The physics are also noteworthy and make it stand out from similar games, particularly in regards to destruction and how things visually break depending on the point and force of impact.Very few bugs are present especially for an Early Access game, most of which can be fixed with a simple relog.Space Engineers is lots of fun and well worth your time, either alone or with your friends.If you'd like to see some not-so-serious antics between friends in this game, feel free to check out the video below:

Early Access Review
								I trully loved this game, it is basically Lego space ships that you can fly and crash, now with planetary survival. What big kid wouldn't love that? I've had this since very early on and have enjoyed it greatly as you can see from my hours. The updates have come thick and fast and i have enjoyed almost all of them, yes even the exploding cyber dog's have fond memories for me. I have some how manifested the patience to create so many ships, small to vast, but it is a painful and lonely game a lot of the time. If you want to become a Master Builder, expect the same game hours as the comments here, it is more an act of devotion than a gaming experience. I have had city sized vessels torn assunder by landing feet, exploding like a small nuclear device. I've had planet surfaces become sticky, pulling me and my colonies into what can only be described as a kind of limbo. I've had pistons for elevators, that seem to repel gravity drives and ricochette out of the ship close to the speed of light.As much as I have created on here, loved this game, and excepted the 'mishaps' as a part of the experience, I have become tired of playing alone and taking the massive time wasting glitches on the chin. We create masterpieces, but other than giving them away on the workshop, you can't share your creations. Privately rented servers, no matter how powerfull, can't handle multiplayer; more than 4 people or more than 400 blocks on your ship and you can expect to see some serious Invisible-Space-Kraken encounters.I'm sorry KSH, I held out, but we've grown apart and I don't think this is working anymore. It's not you, it's me, actually no it's you. Perhaps we can be freinds, and one day way down the line, meet up for an awkward coffee. You can provide the slightly less shakey but still effectively unplayable multiplayer and I'll whip up a quick Starship Bebop.See you Space Cowboy's...			"

								A great game from the design of the UI to the physics system driving the whole experience. You can build a spaceship and fly it. Every geeks dream. I found myself stepping away from this game after every hour of gameplay because space feels empty. Space is depressing. There is no where to go. Nothing to do past building a ship and collecting resources to build a bigger ship. Perhaps if I wasn't playing by myself and instead on a multiplayer server I may have had quite a different experience.To clarify, there are places to go, passing ships, etc. But you will never find another living being. Just empty ships drifting through empty space.			"

Early Access Review
								Well let me start out saying I have  1,611.3 hrs on record for this game so far. This game had tons of potential only to fall short due to bugs that never get fixed or never stay fixed (pistons for one). They seem more interested in adding more features vs fixing all the deep issues this game has. It's nearly impossible to have a stable server with a player count over 8 to 10 people if they are all active mining/whatever.  In my opinion they should get the game as stable as they can then add features after that, but logging in and having bookmarks/ships/whatever up and disappear for no good reason makes it hard to play multiplayer.  To even think about hosting a half way stable server you have to run third party tools like server extender even then you have to jump through a lot of hoops. I couldn't tell you why keen didn't hired the person who made Server Extender, the server end would be a bit better if they did. I usually get a itch for the game every so often and will play for a bit until I cant deal with the bugs anymore and quit for a while hoping they fix it at some point only to keep being repeatedly disappointed. If you catch it under $10 on sale and want to gambling it will turn into something better go for it. With keens past history I hope they just dont release the xbox version and bail out on us. We shall see.With all the negative comments I have posted above I will say when the game works with out crashing or pistions killing you and your entire family its unlike any other game thats out. My expectations of a great space engineers game would be to have at least 30 people doing whatever they want with in reason and no lag/slow down on the server. But go look for yourself if you have it pull up a server list see how many servers have 15 or more people in them, not many.			"

Early Access Review
								While perhaps more of a ""design and program"" game over an engineering simulation, Space Engineers is a very approachable, fun space sim that gives you far more creativity over other space sims. The game offers two modes - Survival and Creative - both allow you to build your own space ships and space stations, one of which actually requiring you to mine, refine, and assemble materials into parts before welding them into your ship. The game is a little slow and meaningless if you play it by yourself but if you can find some friends to share a base with, and create factions to fight each other, the game is very entertaining due to the number of possibilities. The limited number of game functions at the moment is offset by the Workshop, which seamlessly (YES, NO ISSUES!) integrates hundreds of new blocks and backgrounds into the game without a hickup, only requiring a slightly longer load time. If you can manage to find people you like (or hate) to play the game with you, you will have a blast. However, single player doesn't offer too many fun possibilities, as building a ship doesn't really accomplish anything without having something to use it for - you will be alone in space in the most literal sense. While it lacks some more advanced mechanics calculations and possibilities for real engineers, it does offer those with a knack for programming and configuring controls the opportunity to customize features and design complex mechanisms to accomplish various tasks ranging from opening a door to operating a complex automated train line. It is a load of fun when you design things you can show off to other players (and attack them with), but be prepared to not be very useful at the beginning - some things aren't too intuitive, and PvP can be brutal.

Early Access Review
								After Reviewing many many reviews, most of which were negative, I asked myself why this game was so hated. I have stuck with the game since a few days after its initial release and, while it does have a few shortcomings, I am extremely impressed with this game and plan on continuing to play it, and while it does have some shortcomings, the game itself is an extremely good game for an early access game. I look forward to seeing what the official release will bring.Before jumping into a constructive breakdown of what I have experienced in this game I wish to note the main source of negative reviews on this game. People are voting negative because of the games networking issues and general bugs, however what many people who posts those reviews fail to realize is that THIS GAME IS NOT COMPLETE! Please avoid making reviews directly based upon bugs until the game has been officially released!Positives and Reasons To Buy This GameSandbox: Obviously this games number one purpose, those who play Minecraft, Starmade, Kerbal Space Program, No Man's Sky, or even Garry's Mod should at least find some measure of satisfaction with this game, if not immense satisfaction. You are able to mine ore/terrain in a completely destructible voxel environment, or simply throw down a few warheads to blow up a massive hole to live in, while at the same time being able to make ships or even automated machines to do the mining for you. You are able to build ships and stations from scratch, and automate their construction and semi-automate their repair even when some sections are missing. (thank you projectors!) With that same block you are able to create saved ships from a projection as well. When this game was in its earlier renditions, I even went so far as to develop a miner that could eat a smaller asteroid in nearly two passes. Back then I was sad because I couldn't share the project with anyone or easily remake it, but now you are able to save it locally or upload it to the workshop! (wish I wouldn't have deleted that save!)Development: Every Thursday, whether or not I am looking to play the game, I always check the update notes, because every Thursday Keen does a software update on the game. This is the only game I have ever done this with, and generally I ignore update notes unless its a multi GB update. Why, you may ask, do I pay attention to the more numerous and minor updates instead of paying attention to other games with fewer, more comprehensive updates? The answer is simple. This game has gone above and beyond my expectations when I first bought it, added many more features than I expected, and even added some features the devs said they probably wouldn't add *cough* planets *cough*.  Never before have I been so tied to a games development. Not only that, but with each update comes assurance that the devs are always working on the game and always moving it forward, however so slowly it may be going at times. Beyond that, the game itself has come a long ways from its initial relase. In the above section, the miner that you see in the picture used to make it so pretty much no one could move effectively because the simulation speed was brought down to 0.3 out of 1 every time it turns on. Now, however, after remaking a similar miner on a much more crowded server, the simulation speed was staying stable at around 0.8.Workshop Integration: This is the biggest, and best reason to get this game. As of the time this was typed up, space engineers has 193,072 items on the workshop ranging from small ship blueprints, to mods that add drills the size of your entire starter ship! The community is constantly adding many cool and new mods and creations that it is doubtful you will tire of it soon. From the well known Azimuth mod, to the more specialized SANCHINCORP hoverbike mod, or even to creating your own mod so you can have what you want in the game!Combat: ""Now whats the point of having this big destroyer if you dont have a target for it?"" you might ask. Well there are plenty of places to prove your mettle in combat if building massive stations or designing mining ships just isn't your thing. EVE online players, be careful as you may get sucked into this one. Not only are you able to engage and defend agains hostile NPCs, but factions get taken into effect and you may very well find that you and your faction/friends are being assaulted by another faction or group. Or, maybe you were on a mining trip and stumbled upon a well tucked away base. You mark your location and come back with the big guns to neutralise the defenses, then loot their containers while they are away or even salvage the entire station/ship. All in all, these are the primary things that I believe contribute and make up this game. Believe me when I say that there are many other things that are awesome to this game that I haven't included.Negatives and Reasons To Avoid The Game For NowNetworking and Stability: One of the games biggest faults is its networking and communication between peers. I cannot tell you how many times I have spent hours upon hours or even days making ships, mining for resources, and welding them, only to have them completely destroyed by an errant small ship de-syncing and tearing through it like an ICBM. This issue, while not nearly as abhorrent as it was before, is still present and continues to be a source of fear and greif with this game. I have ragequit more than once because of something getting destroyed due to de-syncing.Exiting Planet Gravity: While seemingly a small thing, the simple act of exiting a planets gravity is near impossible to do if you started on the planet in the first place. Planets are abundant in pretty much every ore, however they do not have platinum, which you need for making the non atmospheric thrusters. Hydrogen thrusters, while fast and capable, run out of fuel so fast its not even funny. It took me over 43 different ship designs, from the ground up, before I finally gave in and snagged a ship from the workshop, which still didnt get me to where I needed to be because I ran out of fuel shortly after exiting the atmosphere.Time Consumption: This game can and will EAT your time up as my friend TwoPheat is a great example of. Your game will go and go and you will continue to perform tasks slowly reaching your goal, then you glance at the clock and realize that you probably should have been asleep 3 hours ago. While some people might see it as a great sign, I find it quite irritating coming into work an hour late because I got used to performing the same menial task over and over and over, that I lost my sense of time. Needless to say, after that happened a few times I, setup an alarm to let me know when to sleep and that fixed it.Performance: While not nearly as intensive as it used to be, Space Engineers is still a very demanding game. Expect it to eat up your system performance, especially when dealing with ship to ship combat engagements.ConclusionSpace Engineers, despite still being in Early Access and not being a complete game, can give you immense satisfaction and enjoyment despite still being plagued by a few unavoidable bugs. There are many things that you can do, and an almost exponentially higher number of things you can make so long as you are willing to invest the time to make it.I would highly recommend getting this game if you are looking for a good sandbox game.Note: Your ships may end up looking Phallic in nature, don't worry thats normal, just dont make them pink.

Early Access Review
								I desperately wanted to enjoy this game. I did everything I could to make the game as playable as possible. But in the end, this game is an unfixable wreck that Keen has left us with. Few new features are getting added, and we're left with a broken mess that is Space Engineers. For starters, this game is incredibly unfriendly to people who don't have a top of the line computer. Besides for how high the requirements to smoothly play this game are (I probably should have payed more attention to that before buying), the game also only goes as low as ""normal"" for graphics IIRC, and has very few graphics options. In addition, they stopped supporting the dx9 version which turns this from a game my computer can barely run to a game that makes me feel like I'm watching a slideshow.The overall idea though is great, and I loved the idea of building fleets of drones to do stuff for you, a little bit of which I actually did before they dropped dx9 support, and even though I still have the dx9 version, I got tired of 15 FPS constantly so just stopped playing.If Keen ever takes measures to reduce lag, then I might consider trying this again, but until then, I'm just going to have to thoroughly regret buying this game. If you do have a good enough computer, then I'd somewhat recommend this, but this game still has a whole array of other problems mentioned in other reviews.			"

Im sure it will start to feel fun again when the multiplayer is optimized enough that I can actually play it without a 50mb/s internet speed.WARNING:You will need a beast of a computer to run this at maximum settings, and a reasonably good computer to run it at all!I can finally change this to a positive review now that steam has removed paid mods, and KeenSWH can no longer consider adding paid mods to their game.

								For this game being in early access I find it very time consuming and fun, though you will crash, A LOT if you're the host of a server. In the start you spawn in a rescue ship and have to fly over to your station, this will take about 3 minutes at max, then once you're at your station, well, you start your engineering aspect of the game, you start with a Welder, a Grinder, and a Hand Drill. You should start building a ship, or a miner, etc, off the start as you need some sort of transportation instead of the rescue ship.You need to be very patient with the crashes you get all the time and how laggy the game can be, also gotta be patient with your progress and how complicated things can be, I recommend watching a tutorial on the game, anyways.I would rate this game overall an 7/10 due to its many crashes and lag spikes, once this has a few patches I'm going to edit this review.

								It's like Lego in space!You can create spaceships and land vehicles and explore, fight and colonize.But it's so much more if you want it to be - there is also power management, weight distribution and proceduraly generated asteroids and whole planets and moons! Yes, Space Engineers did it first, and although they do rush some of the features in order to be first, I really believe they are pushing the game industry forward with their ambition.If you want a big challenge - there is a punishing Survival mode - where you have to mine, produce and assemble all your creations. Imagine having to actually create all the blocks before assembling them. This makes you design efficient, realistic vehicles and spaceships.Some of the players complain that the game is what it openly states it is - an Early Access game. Some features simply don't work  yet. My solution to this is to play with the features that work perfectly and I couldn't be happier. The team gives weekly updates to the game, and there is a very strong modding and blueprints community that pushes the format of this game to the limit.It's been a fun ride so far and I believe there is a lot in store for this game in the future. It's ambitious, it's serene and I keep returning to it - playing it for years now. Definetly worth your money! "

								The game isn't perfect, and it doesn't have kerbal space program physics, but it is still really fun, especially on multiplayer. The developers are awesome. They care what the community wants, and they are keeping it a really good game. Originally, the developers were not going to add planets, but so many people requested it, and guess what? They added them!The community is awesome as well, however, like any community there is the bad part of it. Try creating a public creative server, it won't work too well, it'll just have spammers. At least until mod api supports more. Aside from the creative servers, you can find a community you love being around, just takes time to find one.Missing content to the game? Look to the modding community, there is tons and tons of content created for the game. Pros:- Infinite worlds, just explore or create a huge empire.- PLANETS!!! They are beautiful in every way, they're just gigantic, I mean like... MASSIVE. Oh, and... The best part, The ENTIRE planet can be destroyed, sure that takes up a lot of resources, but its possible. You could make a hole from 1 side to another.- Building mechanics are awesome, many decoration mods to make ships feel like they're actually a space ship.- Enjoyable if you play with your friends, teamwork can make things a lot faster.- The game sort of has a goal now, starting on a planet, and moving up into space, and jump drives being end game. The alien planet is far away, and is dangerous and very exciting to be on, and be eaten alive!- Planets do not support DX9, why is this a Pro? Because DX9 is like extremely old and outdated. Cons:- The game is getting better at optimization, still laggy, but getting better. Consider the scale of the game, and what it has now.- Some patches released can break the game a bit, but generally they're getting better, after all, it still is Alpha.- The game pushes limits, so don't expect it to run on your 2005 dell computer, it's not going to. The game requires nice hardware, but at the same time, the game is pushing the limits by adding  content that has never been done before.			"

								Even tho I prefer Medieval engineers because of the setting, space engineers is excellent because it's the same gameplay and core mechanics, so i recommend.It's like you're a space game fan get space engineers and if you're a medieval fan get medieval engineers, or if you want the complete experience get both.

								This game is like a relationship you love and hate at the same time. You know, a person who looks great and you can have a lot of fun with, but ruins every moment with annoying nagging and sudden emotional explosions. This person knows how stressful this is for you and promises to change this attitude, but simply won't do that. To hide that, this person makes you presents in order to make you forget those flaws. But you don't want those presents... You want this relationship to work!That's pretty much this game.Heck darn, it's fun to play.. or it WOULD be fun to play! Establishing a base, building ships and do things with other players? Sounds awesome! But all thouse freakouts in multiplayer makes it almost unenjoyable. Recently I found a server and played hours on it because the performance was bearable... Yeah, you can call hourly server crashes, violent twitching of objects and other bunches of bugs 'bearable'. Singleplayer or private MP runs almost flawless, but that's not the space adventure you want to have. You want to communicate with other people! Trade with them, explore with them, fight with them!Trust me, I'd LOVE to give this a positive review, but I can't. Not with all those problems. The developers made me have hope for this game, but that hope vanishes with every session i play. As long as it stays like this, my thumb stays down.			"

								Space Engineers is one of the greatest space games I've played, and considering how far its come since I bought it, I can't even begin to describe the leaps and bounds this game has achieved to someone who hasn't played this game prior to.Needless to say, the latest addition is by far one of the greatest crowning achievements, while the game was quite fun prior, it did lack some sense of adventure and diversity considering everything was just empty space with YAY another damn asteroid. Now the game is strikingly beautiful on top of being and intense build it game. Going over specifics of this game is hard, theres far too much complexity to the base game to sum up its gameplay into a less than novelistic review, that doesn't consider the vast mod base this game has either, which is equally pumping out awesome new things daily.If I had to pick one bad  thing to say about SE, it would have to be the ""static"" celestial environment, granted planets are only barely coming into the game, but even with unlimited universe, high density, planets, meteor showers, random AI, theres still a missing feeling given everything is in its relative positions static, which for me takes away from a space gaming experience. Additionally, the multiplayer could still use a lot of stability work, dedicated servers are still a myth in my book, with regular crashes, and continual ""update screwed the server files"" from server operrators, I find it hard to play this game multiplayer(less I'm hosting) and annoyingly lonely considering I always seem to be kicking everyone shortly before they crash a giant ship into my space station...LOLWith that said, I've got to give this game a 9/10. leaving room for the obvious improvement the devs will be making in future updates.When you're done stealing your mothers credit card, hook yourself up with a copy of SE STAT!

								I've seen some reviews calling this minecraft in space - this couldn't be further from the truth.There is a learning curve but playing around with a few of the pre-made ships for a bit will teach you most of what you need to know. You bring your creativity to the table and take it from there. This game has provided me with one of, if not the most, memorable moments in PC gaming:After a bit of resource gathering and getting myself acquainted with my crappy little wreck of a ship I start to feel confident and go off futher and further. While drilling for uranium on an asteroid I foud myself being watched by a ship. The ship got closer and closer and then to my dismay I found that it had weapons. The ship fired on me. I had not thought to put weapons on my peaceful learning ship so I had no way to defend myself - or did I? I jumped from my ship with my jetpack and managed to avoid getting shot. I locked my magnetic boots to his hull and started grinding a hole in his armor. Once inside I saw his vital components. The ship flung itself wildly as I cut away at reactors, gyroscopes, and the like. Soon he was dead floating in space. I felt like I had killed Moby♥♥♥♥♥♥ ...five minutes later his friends showed up and I had a bad day.Would space-whale hunt again 10/10			"

Until then we get a broken game with a beautiful concept.Plus the controls are an absolute pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ All I want is a simplified menu layout not a damn headache everytime I need to open one of the multiple menus or figure out what random key does something.EDIT: 3 years after release its in Beta!

								It's a great game if you like building stuff (at certain times, differs greatly per alpha version). Sadly, it's overall EXTREMELY buggy, unbalanced and it does not perform in multiplayer, not even with a state-of-the-art-super-server (180-500$/month) and it seems that this game will never finish.In Singleplayer there isn't really anything to do besides building stuff, but everything you build bugs/corrupts. It's really terrible. Some bugs are as old as the first public release... That alone should say something about this company.They have fantastic ideas. But their ideas are too big to materialise and they have this habbit of adding more 'ideas' before even prototyping/finishing the previous ones.Restrictions & LimitationsOriginally posted by Silver:In sandbox games you want to build, be creative and be free.But the freedom is limited by the server performance which is killed really easy w/o rules that limit your freedom.Yes servers MUST apply serious restrictions to all players (like deleting all ships with more than x blocks). And yet you can still crash any server you want without hacking/cheating. But you can't even make a medium-sized-battleship without crashing or at the very least lagging out even the most expensive and modern servers.Another example: there is a hidden block limit for each ship, exceeding it will cause a crash. Official reply from Keen stated (literal copy-paste): ""We will try to take a look at it. But it will not probably be fixed."".Singleplayer is a lot more stable and performs better but it's still pretty bad.PlanetsThe new planets release only made things worse. EVERYTHING I touch bugs.  You literally die from jumping on a flat surface or touching a players corpse.One hour of playing, over 10 serious (as in corruption, server crashes, ships blowing up, etc) bugs and at least 2 exploits. 2 years in alpha + years of development + 8 figures in budget and still a big mess. They still release patches and updates that are totally flawed instead of waiting until they get it right. After playing some more hours the amount of bugs becomes extremely annoying.Server Performance, no matter what you do...At capped FPS, at max server simspeed, with the server using less than (literally) 1/10th of it's resources the game still becomes a slideshow with more players. The whole optimization is totally absent after years and years of development.Servers are unable to perform no matter the hardware you put in it. And in singleplayer you can make it perform to a certain degree using mods. But those break roughly every week and I noticed that my machine is still rendering lights and blocks that it can't possible see. Even after the planets update...But there is so much more...There are so many more problems (like the weekly updates that introduce more bugs than fixes and that break the mods you need to get around existing bugs...) and pages filled with bug-listings. But it's too much to all sum up in a review.Project management & communicationI seriously frown upon how they manage their project in Keen. It's all done extremely unprofessionally, even for an Indie team. Also the questions asked during streams seem pre-made, too politically correct and the important questions are ignored (and most likely not fixed/implemented).Example: We suffer for so long from a rapidly increasing world filesize on servers. They can grow very fast and makes connecting to the server insanely slow (which can grow in just 1 day to the point where it gets nuts) with no build-in way to decrease it.However, at 15 january 2016 Marek in the live-stream about the ""roadmap Q&A"" hears about this for the very first time... Now I know why they never solved that issue before and why he plans on creating persistent servers without fixing this first (among others)... Their management appeared to be unaware of such very important issues even though it has been reported many times over the last 2 years... But yet they are the ones creating the 'todo-list' and the priorities for 2016...The people who see nothing and blame 'my pc' for itIt works for me! I have (almost) no bugs! Game is fine, must be those other people!Our server runs just fine. I don't see the 'big' problem.Maybe try having more than 2 people on the server, use more complex blocks and more complex designs. And pray that people who are like that, never join your server. Or people who know the bugs&exploits and who can crash your server anytime they feel like it through legal means. Don't use programmable blocks, don't use rotors, don't drill, etc. Sure at some point you can make it work... Just limit yourself enough in a sandbox game and tell everyone that this game works just fine. And if not, tell everyone it's an alpha game that excuses all the design&management failures that this game company made.Just look at the memory leaks alone... It's enormous. But hey, if you don't see any bugs, if you don't see the epic failures from their management and if you are not worried that this game is unlikely to ever reach the finish line, then this game is for you!It's your PC!... I have no words for this level of 'stupidity'... Maybe my RAM has a hole in it... Me and other admins literally see the memory leaks on the servers. But it must be my client PC that somehow leaks memory because my CPU is bad right? And what about all the bugs? Also caused by my 'bad CPU'?And when I look at the server I sometimes see that the CPU runs at like 1-40% capacity and 30GB free RAM left and a good ping and free disk space and etc. But still we got a slideshow caused server-side? Maybe... just maybe.... it's the game? Just at least consider it?But it's alpha.. How can you downvote anything in alpha?(quote is not mine)You post a review on the state of the game. Not the state you think the game will be in. I think it's fair people are made aware of the limitations of the current game. Especially those wanting to play MP. "

								Space Engineers is a very promising, inspiring and creative game. If you like playing alone in an empty universe, then you must definitely try this game. You won't regret it. It is one of the best single-player sandbox games I have ever played.Everything is great until you try the multiplayer.Extremely unstable, insanely laggy, frustratingly buggy.No, it's not my internet connection (I have a very fast connection) and no, it's not my pc (I have a very high end pc).It's just that the game is severely unoptimized. Whenever I join an online server, the game switches to s**t mode.There are so many things not working in multiplayer that I can't possibly list them here, some of which are:- Lag gets so extreme that you must wait for 30 seconds for even the most simple action- Game freezes for 10 - 20 seconds for no apparent reason- Player jumping all over the place, without any chance of controlling it- Lag stuttering gets so intense that can give you a seizure- On planets, player suddenly starts sinking into the ground, free falling to the center of the planet and ultimately dying- Sudden death for completely inexplicable reasons- Parked vehicles explode for no reason- Stationed ships explode for no reason- Drills and rotors explode for no reason- Merge blocks explode for no reason- Parked vehicles jumping all over the place for no reason- Stationed ships jumping all over the place for no reasonYou get the idea.Overall, great for single-player, unplayable in multiplayer.Yes, it is in early access but there are serious bugs that remain unsolved for 2 years and I don't think they will be ever solved. Looks like this game suffers from the eternal-early-access syndrome, which is very common these days. "

								Space Engineers is a game where you not only ""build"" - but you truly engineer. And you happen to be in space. You have to worry about keeping up your life support systems, finding energy, materials to build - and where to find more materials. Trying to hijack space-shipments is super fun too. There is definately a learning curve with the controls and systems - but with a little patience you'll be a Zero-G master. Fun to play with friends, or also just go into Lego-mode with creative and make up cool things.			"

								Keeping this short. Space Engineers has a lot of promise. First however, it needs a lot of fixing. Server side I am aware of a nominally fixed memory leak caused by voxel updates (we think, hard to be sure). Not ACTUALLY fixed, despite patch notes: our server admin has tested this thoroughly.Client side... I don't know where to begin. Sometimes my oxygen won't replenish, or my energy, when sitting in a pod with both supplied. Sometimes objects literally destroy themselves while I build them. Just now I lost almost two hours of solid work because things I build don't always default to BELONGING TO ME.My advice is pretty simple. Wait until the devs iron out most of these things before giving them money for the project. Currently it is frustratingly prone to glitchy behavior, and while the game is playable you will see tons of things go wrong.Tl;dr, Dark Souls 3 is more rewarding and less frustrating than this. Infer what you will from that.			"

								For quite some time, I had to say the Space Engineers was one of the more fun sandbox games that you could get in a self-hosted multiplayer fashion, but over time the developers have really dropped the ball. The game's weekly updates have been steady, and new features added constantly, but stability has been an absolute nightmare due to the apparent focus on feature creep and lack of developer testing.  Releases are almost always followed by immediate patches for widespread gamebreaking issues, mods are broken often, and there is no apparent interest from the developers in moving to a slower and more stable approach. The game may be in Early Access, but developers should never use this as a reason to provide absolutely zero quality testing.			"

								Early access or not, it shouldn't be more of a bug-ridden mess than when I played it a year ago.The game is amazing, when it isn't doing everything in its power to stop you from having fun. You will die from physics errors, ships will randomly stop working forcing you to restart the server just in order to use them again. And this ship thing happened to me at least every half hour or more. Sometimes batteries will work, but sometimes they will randomly decide otherwise. Ground vehicles? Nope, they will steer like the buggy itself is having a seizure before flipping over with no way to right it.Because of all these errors, I found it far faster and less annoying to just fly and hand-drill all my resources. Even with the occasional death from physics. Save your money if you haven't bought it already. I'm sure it will be good given another 3 years.			"

								Sorry, but I cannot recommend this game. After having played it so much and having enjoyed it lots. I cannot say it is worth the money you pay in its current state. Bugs such as rotor problems piston problems, stupid amounts of lag when using oxygen in your ships. And many a death I have claimed from something simple such as exiting a cockpit... The sheer amount of bugs/glitches/annoyances make this game unplayable if your doing anything but building a ship in creative mode. Survival? Don't even ask me about it. I have not yet gotten far at all in in survival due to the reasons mentioned above. Once the creators stop concentrating on other things and actualy fix the problems with this game then I'll be willing to try it again. Truth is it should not have been brought out of Alpha until the issues got fixed. So once again I say this game is currently not worth your money.			"

								I really wanted to like this game, however, the bugs destroy it. Imagine an engineering game about space ships, where you actually can't really engineer a lot, because the basic tools for more complex machinery (pistons for moving, rotors for rotating) aren't working. Yeah, you can use some stupid workarounds to fix some of the problems, but it's just annoying. Want to build a simple elevator on your ship? Good luck, the ship is constantly going to spin now, even just slightly.  Yes, you can't even build an elevator on a ship without getting a headache. Probably one of the most basic engineering tasks. What a failure. Even worse, these bugs aren't anything new, they already existed when I started playing this game around two years ago. Probably because of some stupid fan boys on some forum who are like ""XD butt dis is all teh fun in enginring wen u have to solve prublems!!!! the systems work fine!!! u just have 2 expriment :^)"".

								Good:  Deeply engrossing.  Unique perspective.  Excellent physics.  Not a Minecraft clone.Bad:  Frustrating and confusing interface (this is coming from a Total War / Europa Universalis fan).  Unreasonable learning curve.  Streamline the messy menus, and add a decent tutorial.  You lose a lot of people within the first few hours of the game.  Like you did me, at first.  Conclusion:  Fantastic idea.  Implementation needs significant improvement, but the base mechanics are great.			"

								I'm more addicted to this game than Minecraft lately. When my friends are off doing their thing in games I don't have, I'm usually in this. I'm only just scratching the surface of potential, too. Creative if insanely fun, and Survival is harshly challenging. If you want more challenge in either mode, the recent addition of Meteor storms has seriously kicked things up a notch. If you feel the need you can change your world settings from Survival to Creative, you can change the frequency of Meteor showers, and adjust the realism of Survival if you're having a hard time with the masochistic default survival settings.Not a true Sandbox game yet, but I imagine that is a possibility in the future. The plyable objects and terrain is also fun, you can drill into things, blow it apart with rockets, or stockpile warheads and set it all on fire!I left out that I found the Music rather fitting and epic, but to summarize the rest: Buy this game if you like building things and space ships. It's still in-dev so there's definitely more to come!-Addendum 10/10/2014 GET THIS WHILE IT'S ON SALE! This game is PERFECT for the creative minds out there and the people who enjoy space sandboxes. It has it's limits still for me, but once I get a new computer I intend on writing a completely new review. Play it while you can and try and get it while it's on sale!			"

								Amazing game. A ton of fun to play. However, I am down voting because the developers have not fixed multiplayer. The community started crying for multiplayer to be fixed years ago and the developers keep telling us, don't worry we will fix it. Yet, MULTIPLAYER IS STILL BROKEN. Fix your game instead of adding things like planets. Planets are cool, but A WORKING MUTIPLAYER IS BETTER THAN ANY FEATURES YOU CAN ADD.			"

								An absolutely fantastic game in the process of becoming even more fantastic. For instance, we have been promised planets to land and build on. They are in the process of upgrading from DirectX 9 to DirectX11 support (without ditching DX9 for older cards). There has been talk of AI. The multiplayer is being completely rebuilt into something far superior. If you liked your space legos like I did, this is a game for you.			"

								Short ""review"": Wait a year and see if this game is (still) in active developement. In it's current state it's more of a tech demo with a lot of performance issues. But it can be a great game in the future for sandbox and survival game lovers.Good things+ Looks good.+ Fun to design and build ships, station and cars.+ Cool with Star Systems, especially in Survival mode.+ Got battle mechanics for those interested (can be turned off).+ Pretty good damage and physics modeling - stations, ground and vehicles can break in a neat way. + It's like Minecraft with mods with better graphics but a more shallow tech tree (you can get the coolest stuff in a matter of hours in survival).+ Lots of potential, can be a really great game.+ Strong modding community, you can find a lot of good mods in the Steam Workshop.+ Lot's of options on how to play the game. For example, do you want to start on the moon? Or in the outer space with only a crappy ship? The not so good things- Crashes, freezing your computer. According to the devs they have problem with AMD beta GPU drivers, AND Nvidia drivers. So what should we use? An old Matrox GPU? Anyways, sometimes you can play for 2h without a complete freeze, sometimes you can play 20 minutes, sometimes you get away with ""only"" restarting the game. But be prepared to reboot your computer. I have tried different drivers and settings, and the game crash (most often also freezing the computer) sooner or later. So saving and fully restarting the game every 45 minutes is a work around.- Performance - This game is pretty taxing on your computer and the game has a sluggish feeling to it (even with 120 FPS).And when fun stuff are happening (like destruction of ships/ground) it will get pretty nasty on the frame rate and general flow/speed (often called simulation speed in this game). So if you want to build a massive space station or planet base, be prepared for a single digit FPS and/or playing in slow motion.- Save game corruption. You start up a new game in Survival, you decide to start on ""Earth"" in a Star System with Mars, the Moon and a Alien planet. After let's say 12h when you want to explore the star system you notice that the other planets are gone. You verify this with a save game editor. The moon is gone, Mars is gone, it's only ""Earth"" left. So save games can be corrupted (happened to me at least twice now). You can manually edit new planets in, but that's not the same and they will probably dissapear too. - Progression: If you want the game for a strong Survival experience like in Minecraft (with mods), forget it - you wont find it here. There is no real progression other than mining, no tech tree, nothing to discover since all resources can be found everywhere (besides platinum that can't be found on ""Earth""). This means that there is practically no reason to explore or play this like an adventure, you have everything you need where you start (or at least in 1-2h of play time). - Developement cycle. At this rate I wonder if the game ever will be finished. There are weekly updates that bring new cool stuff. I would prefer if they focused on performance and stability before adding all the ""fun"" stuff. I know it's fun to add graphical updates and stuff like that. And bug fixing is a boring job. But sooner or later you (the devs) have to do the boring stuff too. So, yeah. This game is in early access, developed by a small studio in a slow pace. It got huge potential and besides save game corruption and all the crashes I had fun with it. You should probably wait for your own sake, or get it now on a sale and play it when (or if) it ever get completed. Thumbs down for now but I will be back and hopefully be able to recommend this game.			"

								Let me preempt this by saying this is from a multiplayer perspective.The game, while beautiful and full of promise, is currently a broken pile of chips.For the past month we spent every Tuesday on this for hours (with vods if you must see for proof) full of broken physics, stupid deaths and suicidal AI.  And the planets, while awe-inspiring, are only that way ‘til you ‘land’ on them.My deaths have been many and glitchy...and since this game doesn't keep items on either death or relog, they can be detrimental if you were trying to build something and had items in hand.  Oh, let me say that last bit again, just to be clear: on relog, if you have items in hand, they are GONE.  So I hope you put your stuff away, 'cause what you had is poof!  But I digress...let's actually look at my experiences!My last deaths are as follows: - Walked into a tunnel, touched a pebble.  Fell through the earth to my doom. - Walked up to an AI ship that crashed into the surface, jittering wildly...got touched by it, almost died from the contact (okay, not technically a death, but close). - Used a jetpack to fly up to a mountain top, couldn’t slow down, crashed. - Same, but tried landing on smooth surface. - Walked across the ice.  That’s it.  Was walking across the ice.  The flattest, most benign surface you could imagine.  Tripped on NOTHING and died. - Reloaded server, couldn’t move on spawn...slowly suffocate to death.  REPEATEDLY.This is not to account for the multiple times I ended up somehow falling into the center of the planet from touching a pebble...those don’t count as deaths because I’d have to teleport up to a fellow player (I count one because I didn’t have the ability to TP for that one...used backspace).  Just about any physics object can easily become a glitchy mess...I saw breakdancing vehicles, floating body bags and playing kickball with a ship...before suffocating inside where the ship ACTUALLY was.  Oh, and don't try actually digging down into the earth...you know, where everything is, because trying to point DOWN and hitting the rock with your actual drill is near impossible!  And this is supposedly the EASIEST way to mine right now.  This is all very recent, and after a week of ‘fixes’ for planets.And about those planets...I foresee further issues once it’s realized that the planets have indestructible trees, no fluids (water is ice atm), no caves, and a surface devoid of life.  Each one of these things getting eventually added (as I’m sure the populace will demand them) will each in turn break the game yet again.PLAY EARLY ACCESS AT YOUR OWN RISK.If and when this game leaves Early Access, I will retry it to see if it is playable, but I assure you...I will NOT be touching this game until that label is removed.

								I often heard this game described as a cross between Minecraft and Kerbal Space Programme and honestly I think that's a great description of it. Any fan of either game should definately take this game into consideration. Having said that... That does not by any means mean if you havn't played either of them, that you should ignore it! This game is a true gem and I'd recommend it to everyone.The endless possibilities for map creation and the creation of your own challenges and mini games are going to keep you coming back to this over and over again. Wether you are looking for Jolly Cooperation with the construction of mega space ships and stations, want to Blow sh*t up or just enjoy the deep of space, you wont be dissapointed!Great Job Space Engineers!

								So...sold as 4-packs, multiplayer barely works past making a few ships then the server starts to choke.   -Solution: buy a better computer, the game can't be optimized.                     Wait, no, its probably your internet connection (because 6 ms is pretty bad latency)    So play single player!  The game sells itself by showing you that you can ram ships into eachother.  So you can either paste them in via creative mode, then have a minute or so of fun for $20, or you can try survival mode, spend hours on one ship, then hours on another, then crash your ships into each other by yourself. On a certain genre of interent sites, $20 you could get you a whole month of crashing into yourself, and it would definitely be a lot less frustrating.I can't recommend this game.  Its certainly circling the drain, just waiting for the standard early release ""this is 1.0 release, we've fullfilled our contractual obligations with valve, we're out.Honestly, 3 years and millions in development and its a modicum better than it was when it slid on to the steam store. And like most early release titles, that initial groundwork was so poorly and ineptly laid (as one would expect) that years of improvements and a 50 MAN TEAM can't update more than a FEW BUGS A WEEK, with no new content.Save your money and your future frustration and look for a professionally developed game, because early releases are on the same level you'd expect if some guy in his garage built an airplane. It may fly, but I wouldn't count on it being particularly stable or an alltogether enjoyable experience.			"

								This game is very fun when it's working as intended, but i can't recommend it for people who want to play it with their friends, which was the main draw for me. The game seems to be a much less bug-ridden experience if you play solo and perhaps in a creative mode, but networked and survival gameplay is very much unpolished.I've owned this game for years now and i've played it at multiple stages during it's development, which makes me feel like i have a decent grasp on it's issues with it's rate of development and bugfixing, which motivated me to write this review.I had a lot of fun with this game. I've played it for near 100 hours. After KSP it's probably the best space sandbox game.But despite all of it's potential i can't really recommend the game, especially as a person who likes multiplayer and playing with friends.I've always thought that this game was great, but after having it for years i'm not seeing much improvement in terms of bugfixing and networking optimization.If you want to buy this game, even despite all the bugs, in hopes that the developers will fix it.. I'm saying, don't do it. There is no guarantee that they'll fix anything, since they haven't really fixed any of the core networking issues since i first played the game. Everything is still jumpy, permanently desyncing, crahsing, etc.The game is ridden with bugs that can break your server unless you clean it up occasionally.It's also full of bugs that have you or your buddies constantly restarting the game.Most of the game's issues are networking-related, for example clients not receiving the same information, even at <100 ping, which spirals out of control for some reason, ending at a point where clients may not see interactions of some objects at all, or they see everything 10km away from where it really is. These are really common occurences.The conveyor system is full of bugs as well, sometimes pulling items in and out of inventories where items shouldn't even be allowed to flow due to the system not being in a loop, just a one way linear set of sorters, cargo boxes and assemblers.Even though the maximum speed in the game is limited to a grueling 100m/s, supposedly in order to prevent the physics from breaking, it still constantly breaks, while making travel to other planets a journey that takes HOURS unless you mine for just as long of a time for resources to make and use a jumpdrive.Starting scenarios are kind of a mess as well, there is no option to just start in a star system with asteroids and limited resources, essentially allowing you to play a survival mode where you can't spawn in new ships. There are some scenarios but they may not include some other generated features of the game. So you either modify server settings on the fly, or tweak your world with the editor in order to have a non-creative, survival experience with all the generated feautres (planets/moons/asteroids) of the game.If you are completely new to the game you may miss out on these features entirely if you just start one of the scenarios that seem good.I have the most stable computer i've ever had, reaching 10 weeks of uptimes regularily while playing games and using various heavy applicatios.I don't think any game has ever crashed my system consistently since i've built my rig 2-3 years ago, yet space engineers manages to do it 2 times in an hour.So, in closing... People who have played DayZ can understand a situation like this, where the game can be SO FUN yet so RIDDLED with bugs even after years of development, which is what makes this game really hard to recommend, because i DO want to play games with friends.The DayZ developers worked with a proprietary engine that is very much known to be bug-ridden.I'm not sure what the excuse of Keen Software House is, as they've been working this engine engine from the ground up, starting with their previous games.Now they're also working on a game called medieval engineers...?Why?

								Came back to this game yesterday after quiting a few months ago.  Spent last night and today playing and realised why I quit in the first place.  The game is VERY buggy and nothing is being done about it.  The same bugs that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off more than a year ago are still♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off today.For example, you spend hours working on a ship, things are looking good, and then randomly the ship starts twitching and the landing gear explode, sending the ship far out into space, never to be seen again, hours down the drain.  most recently I logged onto my game and my ship just blew up while being rendered,  note that I was playing on single player, so no time had elasped since I last played.  My ship was fine one second, and just blew up for no reason the next.The latest planet update is the next big debacle,  I only tried to play on a planet for about ten minutes before I gave up: planets have the worst lag and framerate ever, the games optimization is already bad, but just forget about it on the planets.I love the concept of space engineers, and it was a lot of fun when it wasnt making me scream in rage, but seriously devs,  stop adding more features and start fixing the ones that are broken, and I would love to recommend this game, but until then I will not.

								A very fun game! It has a lot of potential and room for mods.pros:- able to build complex ships, yet they are still easy to navigate (most of the time)- mining/crafting is really well done- exploration is very fun yet has some sort of scary feeling to it (of going into the emptyness of space)cons:- you need a beast of a computer (which I don't have, or maybe there is something wrong in my settings somewhere)- When you F-up, you usually F-up in huge ways (like crash a ship into another ship or a station or the ground)- currently, with planets/moons, it's extremely hard to have a decent start. Also the framerate drops even further- combat is much like f-ing something up yourself. It doesn't just kill you, it damages everything you've worked your butt off for. Which is why I usually avoid combat in the first placeI think if I figure out why the game is running at 9 or 10 FPS I'd enjoy this game a lot more			"

								This game has one of the more innovative and interesting construction mechanics i've seen, and has had an opportunity to do what tekkit and its ilk never could; It could have let engineers fight not just with combat skill but with their skill in engineering. The vast creations of players could have dueled where factories in Feed The Beast could have only refined the materials you threw into them. The joy is in the puzzle of maintaining the unwieldy system you yourself built.But this game has none of that joy.With rare exception, Engineering does not matter, only guns and armor matter.With rare exception, piloting does not matter, only guns and armor matter.With rare exception, being smart does not matter, only time spent working matters.It is my firm belief that progress in a game should not be marked by time spent, but by mastery achieved. A grind is no substitute for gameplay.(oh, also, Keen software somehow managed to one-up minecraft's wolves update, by making an update with EXPLODING CYBER WOLVES whose role in the game could have been filled in many different ways using any number of systems already in place. KSWH have, design wise, forgotten what they have.)			"

								Easily one of the best bang-for-bucks I ever had. I bought it a few weeks after it came out and the developers have continuously updated the game ever since. Now, with the recent addition of planets, I don't see any reason not to recommend this game. If you like space and builder games, go for it! Be advised, though, that you will need some creativity as the fun of the game comes from trying out new ways to engineer something to your needs. Also, the developers listen to the feedback of the community. Planets were not initially on their roadmap but we do have them now solely because the community wanted them.			"

Early Access Review
								I don't know where to start with this review. With nearly 200 hours, I can say I fell into this game with a Minecraft level addiction. It's been sitting in my library unplayed for a while because the game seemed to lack any real goal, or formal challenge. This changed when they implemented planets.My first and only real run at SE lasted pretty much the bulk of my playtime. Not having any real reason to play the game up until that point. But this go-round I instituted my own goal; I would crash on a planet in a starting ship, I'd get off planet and build an orbital base, from the base I'd build a ship that'd allow me to travel to another planet.Not a complicated goal, but it kept my interest in the game up. I had just gotten the step where I build my own ship, a mobile base it you may. By that time I had left my orbital base to explore. I had a half-build mothership, a mining ship, and a ship for landing planet-side.I decided to leave my base behind and explore since I now had functioning thrusters, and even better, a warp drive. However, as I moved around my mothership, I noticed some really strange things happening with my docked ships when I moved my mothership. While staying docked they'd still manage to shift in my hangar hull.Well that was kinda annoying. After nearly every jump and every ship repositioning (even after lowering my gyro power to 2%, as I thought that might be doing it) I had to go back to my hanger and re-dock my ships.Anyway, after hours and hours of work, I've given up on the game. Last night I left my ship saved right after a jump heading towards the moon. When I logged back in, I was dead, and my ship was hurling through space at about 42 m/s with no explanation. It was stopped when I saved last night. Sorta, I noticed more and more after I'd jump somewhere that my ship would 'drift' even after inertia dampening it back down to no thrust, it'd accelerate back up to 0.01 m/s.After having to respawn twice and do some quick jetpack work, I was able to get my ship stopped. My mining ship is gone, my lander is destroyed and my hangar has a huge hole in it. No explanation. Hours of work destroyed by a bug.Like any early access game, wait till it's released.UPDATE: 06/02/2016 Gave it a try again, spent a considerable amount of time building until eventually I had two unwarranted ice explosions. Containers full of ice in two ships spontaneously exploded. This game is still not ready for prime-time. I'd recommend steering clear of it.I'd suggest not buying it at all. I doubt it will ever be fixed.I doubt I'll be trying it again. I was also greatly looking forward to Medieval Engineers, I can say with all certainty that I will be passing on it completely. From the mostly negative reviews it's currently getting, I guess it's not a huge surprise.			"

								""If Minecraft is LEGO, then Space Engineers is LEGO Technic."" Key Features:-Survival game with a focus on building efficiently-Voxel based terrain which allows for landscapes to look smooth and realistic-Can build vehicles like cars, ships, rockets, etc.-Has multiplayer-Players can traverse planets or take to the stars. Possibly discovering other planets-Space piratesPros:-Fun and addicting survival mode-Even if you're more interested in survival mode, creative is still useful for making prototypes and blueprints-Multiplayer is extremely easy to set up-Game gets prepetually updated with new features and bug fixes-Active workshop community creating new blocks, vehicles, scripts etc. -Lots of potential playtime-Good tutorials-Blocks are NOT locked to a universal gridCons:-Game can be confusing at first. Reccomend checking out some ""Getting Started"" guides before jumping in-Building good vehicles is hard and an improperly built vehicle can be the loss of alot of resources. If you're new, test them in creative first-The games physics don't always play nice. Especially in multiplayer. This is a problem the devs are actively working on though.-Can be demanding for weaker machines. Once again, the devs are doing their best to get rid of this.-Rather buggy-Gets stale without friends. Make sure you have a friend to play with before buying. The multiplayer is a major focusOverall. Space Engineers is a really addicting game for those who are willing to put the time needed into it. It takes a few hours of building before you get your first viable vehicle but once you get past that initial difficulty curve, things will go alot smoother and you'll be pushing out amazing creations in no time. And even if you don't like designing vehicles and bases there's an entire workshop full of blueprints which you can import to the game. This game get an 8/10 for bringing a rather unique twist to the survival building genre and keeping it very fun for a very long time despite being full of glitches.			"

								Space Engineers is currently in bata mode, and the team at KSH are working hard, providing weekly updates. I highly recommend this game for players who enjoy building virtual worlds. Since there are so many little peices, an upper end computer is required (X64). The physics engine that drives this game is amazing, and the developers are smart about encouraging community development, including a strong Steam workshop MOD system. I've yet to play multiplayer, currently content with working im my evil scientist lab.			"

Early Access Review
								There is a lot of fun to be had in this game if you like building things in space. OR IF YOU JUST ENJOY GOING INSANE. It is a patience test the likes I have never seen. I like hardcore/challenging games but this goes into absurd territory too often. Once the initial cool factor of space building wears off, it is just a futility/space madness simulator, which it excels at in every way imagineable. Cool graphics and neat functions are very addictive at first, time will fly incredibly fast. Spending many hours throughout the night just to get that next thing built, it will only take a few minutes, you keep putting off bed. Then out of nowhere some inexplicable, random explosion sends all of your stuff that took time to mine, refine, assemble, transport, weld, and configure to be scattered about and deleted as the server detects you're not within some tiny range of the objects. Boy that was fun, it's now 5am all for nothing. Not once, but a couple dozen times this has basically been the case over the years of coming and going every few months. Like a fool, I keep trying to give it a chance. For just maybe one more time I'll get lucky or I just have to put that one extra ounce of effort in and things will be just dandy.Yeah, I know what you're saying. It's all my fault, x catastrophe happened for a perfectly explainable reason. blah freakin blah. But after almost 900 hours and careful investigation of causes I know the difference between what is my fault and what is because of the game. I don't use pistons, rotors, landing gears, nor any mods beyond experimentation and I'm being as careful as possible, one thing at a time, graphics on lowest, on an empty server, <50 ping, good server settings, and i have 16gb ram, 8core 4ghz cpu... but nope, still not good enough? Don't build too much, don't use this, don't do that, must do this before that then this then that...then that's it. Actual large ship combat is a pipe dream, starting a decent foundation to commence such is loaded with constant setbacks. I don't mind figuring out a long list of getting things done, or dealing with a bit of stuttering, and of course my own mistakes and bad planning, but it is extremely tedious and limiting to have to trial and error everything to avoid nonsense issues and there to be little to do otherwise, trying to avoid whatever random BS will happen next.  It is walking on thin ice, all the time. I know what you're saying. It's space, it's dangerous, it's this it's that. Or it's a complex game, it is very hard to program blah blah. Yes, I know. Things will work just fine just enough to get your hopes up that you can move on to the next operation only to bring you down again, having nothing to do with the dangers of space or your actions, just purely the game being stupid and requiring a million band-aids to hobble things along. Usually thanks to processing a stupid amount of data that could be more efficiently handled as well as crappy networking. But that's understandable when things go bad, when there's a lot going on. I'm talking about when you're by yourself and performance is grand, you still get SNAFU's that will make you pull your hair out and cuss furiously. Unless that sort of thing gives you the warm fuzzies.It is loaded with a million features and complex layering of which can seem amazing at first that it works at all, until you realize there's simply too much, making the mp performance terrible and otherwise glitchy as all hell.  The most fun you'll have is exploring workshop entries and messing around in single player in my opinion, but that gets old quick as there is no game otherwise to work towards. The AI is non-existent. Just some cheesy simple spiders and wolves and aimbot ships. No AI characters or factions. Just scripted ships with red signals. It's more of a base/ship making sandbox sort of interactive editor with no real depth of goals to fulfill beyond the chores of mining, fixing stuff/rebuilding and making workarounds because of all the ridiculous conflicts. This is all besides the fact that there is no true physics in the game except locally floating components/ores and ship controls. Planets do not rotate, the sun is geocentric (revolves around everything in the skybox), there are no orbits, etc. No basic temperature of any kind except thruster damage. Things that are essential considerations to space travel. But of course those are the most minor of complaints.Multiplayer: Unless you're lucky to have a few friends on a good LAN, multiplayer is a complete sh!tshow unless you're a masochist. Stuff which took forever to build since most servers want super realism rates as well as having to find some safe space to not get looted immediately. That is IF you don't have the beacon/antenna bug that broadcasts to everyone on the server your location no matter the distance or settings, the items of which are required to keep ships on most servers ironically enough, the thing that allows you to be ignored by cleanup scripts is the bait that attracts the looters. Not to mention all of the horrific lag spikes and sim speed issues, where there is yet to be any decent multithreading to be seen. Then you can't rejoin the server since it's not updated to the latest version or it went off line for a while and you usually lose all your stuff. I simply don't play much anymore, it's always infuriating, a waste of time. Then add  the community is plagued with a lot of complete d!ckheads. I can't count how many times I've been crapped on just for asking a basic question or voicing a normal concern that would come from anybody who doesn't base their entire life around the game. I can understand tough love for mindless curiosities but if you're not in the cult of understanding all of the esoteric ways in which this game screws with you, then the asperger-ridden, spoiled d0uchebag geeks and their equally braindead sycophants drop in and cut you off at the pass eager to start sh!t and troll you away, taking whatever issue you're having personally because their life has nothing else invested, apparently. How they tolerate each other is beyond me. *cough* FOUNTAINCORE *cough*  Most of the nice people I've met are those that play this crap as rarely as I do.We keep getting excuses that it's early access blah blah blah but how long is this going to drag on for? How many years has it been now? We're going on 4 years and it's been in open development how long and where are the significant improvements? There's simply too many hands in too many cookie jars with this clusterfuc|< for it to be a game worth wasting time on any time soon. For all the good press the game has received for their ability to keep pushing updates consistently and have as many sales as they have and the awards given...how do they still not have the programming/director talent required to get this out of dev hell? I know they are an indie dev unit and programming isn't easy but at what point do you graduate the amateur sphere and move to become/hire professionals when you're raking in the money?Right now the game is only for uber geek fanboys with supercomputers who enjoy never ending bugs and zero criticism. Pin the blue ribbon upon their chests for masochist excellence. If you want a better, real in depth review check this one out: http://steamcommunity.com/id/leewells2000/recommended/244850/Also, I see a lot of reviews recommending Empyrion. It looks better in general. Time to get in the escape pod and jump ship, but i'm not holding my breath.			"

								Space Engineers is a game which I don't really know how to explain. It's a sandbox game, a building game, a shooter game, and an exploration game. Space Engineers takes you out into the galaxy as a space engineer (obviously), starting you off with anything from a fully kitted out base with a large red ship, to nothing but empty space for you to just fly around in until you find something. The game incorporates what I assume to be a randomly generated universe with randomly generated planets and asteroids. Players can choose to play however they want in Space Engineers, you can be a military commander with a giant armored behemoth to a simple farmer, tending to his asteroid (by that I mean mining resources). The game does not have a story to follow, in fact when I was dumped into the world I wasn't given any direction as to what I'm supposed to be doing, so naturally I just went around and blew♥♥♥♥♥♥up.Building in Space Engineers is very easy, as blocks all snap together seamlessly. There are many different types of blocks that can be used, my personal favourite being military orientated blocks which include heavy, armoured pieces that allow ships to take large amounts of damage. Unfortunately, these heavier blocks require a lot more materials to be able to build, and when my ship took a hell of a lot of damage in a battle with another friend I cried myself to sleep because I had nowhere near the required amount of steel to repair even the tiniest part of my beloved ship. Military oriented blocks also refer to the weapons that ships can use  to destroy each other. To my knowledge, there are four blocks that allow ships to attack; Missile turrets, missile launchers, gattling turrets, and sentry turrets. Missile turrets are best used as asteroid defense and to directly attack smaller ships that may be attacking yours. Missile launchers are best used to attack other capitol ships such as battleships, cruisers and carriers as they can be grouped together closely, and can do a large amount of damage in a small area. Gattling turrets are best used as a missile defense, and  the sentry turrets are best used to fend off enemies that may board your ship. The lighter building blocks are useful for creating mining ships to gather resources, as they are light, easy to repair and allow for increased mobility in ships.Mining in space engineers is a very well done system. The jackhammer tool that the player starts off with does a very good job of mining different ores in order to create your ships. Building a ship and attaching drills allows for a much easier mining experience, as larger areas can be mined at one time, and the player does not have to worry about running out of oxygen when going to other asteroids to ,mine.Overall, I'd give this game an 8.5 out of 10. There are a few bugs I have encountered but overall it's a great experience, even though it's only in Beta.			"

Review 01.159... Oct 28, 2016I write this review from the perspective of enjoying to build structures and crafts as I have little interest in PvP, and people should learn to be creative together rather than destructive.Briefly about the gameYou start your game stranded in space in a rescue ship with just enough fuel to carefully navigate to nearby asteroids, or on various planets with a starting base. A number of scenarios are available and can be customized.Your first order of business in space is to find uranium to keep going, then you can search for other ores. Through the use of the rescue ships equipment you can refine ores and create components that will allow you to build, assemble and repair your vessel using a welding torch. Components can be salvaged using a grinder to tear them apart. An ancient hammer drill is used to locate and mine ores ( not very space age ). You can build almost anything your imagination can dream up, using various shapes, however not all combinations will allow you to control everything correctly ( for example the last time I played wheels mounted to pistons could not be controlled).Pro's:Multiplayer allows you to share your game with friends and the server aspects are done in the background. You unfortunately loose your inventory when rejoining a friends game, unless you stored it before exiting. So much for crash situations, or network failures where saving is rarely an option.The physics are fairly real, and components that fall off downed ships can be salvaged for reuse.You have the options during setup to increase the inventory size from realistic to 3 or 10x, however this is still very small, and you'll make many many trips. You can build constructor ships to expedite this with much larger inventories and assembly speed.Currently you don't have to be concerned with eating, you only need oxygen, hydrogen, energy and the materials required for those to carry on.All constructions in the game have structural integrity so if a piece breaks off, it floats or falls a way for later disassembly (limited by item settings).You can switch between Creative and Survival and adjust settings on already started worlds, which is a great idea to save time.Metals can be crumpled and damaged by impact, however its at a performance hit.You can still mine ores in Creative mode, which allows basically an infinite inventory, however great care must be taken when changing back to lower inventory levels, or you risk losing those ores.Blueprints allow construction of additional vehicles using a projector.Cons:The performance is BAD, and gets worse the larger the base, even with far more than the minimum requirements. Moving an item from inventory to storage chest can take several seconds, which is totally ridiculous, compared to the tutorial (an instant drag).You must make many many trips to build anything significant at even 10x inventory, unless you build a constructor ship. Generally its just a slow slog in survival.Controls leave much to be desired, complex, and you can easily get disoriented, using the mouse.All blocks must be welded together in place with is very very slow, you may die of boredom first.You must keep pressing the pickup key to obtain ores before they float away ( in space ) or get underfoot on planet.Textures, colours, etc.. are limited.No Terra-forming tools exist beyond the hammer drill, which is very crude. So much for filling annoying collision holes caused by crashed ships or creating a better seal against a rock face.You have zero sense of surroundings, and your vision is very tunnelled perhaps due in part to the helmet, which can never be removed only opened.If a item gets damaged or you removed it ( a wheel for example ), you may have to go to great lengths to replace it while on a planet, since agility is off the table (at least a piston can be used as a jack stand).Unfortunately I got so frustrated with the poor performance that I removed the game, before evaluating any new features or added parts. Why on earth or anywhere should I be waiting for items to move from my inventory to a storage chest, when I'm the most important thing in the game and all mobs are turned off. The inventory I was looking at, kept showing the entire inventory of oxygen bottles instead of paying attention to what I was doing moving ores from inventory to storage.PS.. Comment to steam... life is not black and white... we need a star rating system in addition to Yes/No 7/10 stars.			"

								AWESOME!!!!!!!! (This was all I could come up with back in Nov 2013, only a month after game release)Now its nearly May 2016 and I have got over 5200hours playing this game, I still think its awesome.In the last 2 years or so this game has come a long way from what I remember it was like not long after release. We now have planets to visit and build on as well as a world that is 1Billion K's across to explore. Although, much of it is empty space with asteroids throughout, each and every world can be customised to suit your gaming wishes. There is 100,000's of mods available on the workshop that you can use to make your game experience how you would like it. If you enjoy Star Trek for example, there is many Star Trek themed mods that you could have in your world so you could build the Enterprise or maybe a Klingon Bird of Prey. There is over 200 planets that have been created by the modding community that you could populate your world with. The choices of gamemodes suit many different players, Single Player Creative mode where you can build whatever you wish without the need for resources. This is a great mode for designing and building ships or stations for blueprint creation for use in other worlds and also learning about all the functions of the many choices of in-game blocks. Single Player Survival, with this gamemode you can challenge yoursef to find the resources you need to build your hopes and dreams. There are several scenarios to choose from, each with differing setups to start a game, for example the Easy Start Scenarios give you a station on a planet with 3 basic ships to get you started in the game. in the setup for each game you can customise the setup to make it however challenging you want. From inventory size, crafting speeds to settings like pirate drones and even cyberhounds and alien spiders which will attack you or start chewing through blocks on your base to get to you.Then there is multiplayer, you can host your single player game on your own machine to invite friends to join in, or there is many dedicated servers to choose from. I have been running a dedicated server myself for over 2 years now (spaceengineers.com.au). Now, I will be honest and say the multiplayer Netcode is still a WIP and at times, issues in game will frustrate you to no end. Don't let this put a dampner on how you feel about the game, the developers have stuck to their weekly update schedule and slowly but surely everything is getting better. As with all Alpha development games, some patches can end up breaking the game for some, but be patient as the team will surely have the issues patched up soon.Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys building, using and showing off their creations. There is a plethora of player creations on the workshop, including blueprints that other players have created that you can build in game. You are only limited in this game by your own imagination. Search for Space Engineers on youtube too, if this review hasn't been enough to convince you, i'm sure some of the fantastic videos of player creations, machinima and the like would be enough to push you over the edge and make you want to buy it.Hope to see you in game one day, and if you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up.

Early Access Review
								This is a great and fun game but it's getting old. The idea behind this game is great and so far they've done a good job in making this game, however, this game has been in early access for quite some time now and the stability and functionality seem to be decreasing. They have added a lot of things which were in high demand by the community, like planets. But the coding and the work behind the curtain is questionable. They seem to be adding content and patching stuff that really is not important right now instead of actually fixing game breaking bugs. After some time playing you will realize that mostly everything you will build needs to be pretty big. This however doesn't correspond with the game engine, as you will lag... a lot. The problem may not even be your PC (I have 30-45 fps with multiple HUGE (200x100 blocks or bigger ) creations and the proccessor is fine, but the Simdrop is there, and once you fire up your refineries, assemblers, grinders, welders or even weapons, the game will drop down to less than 0.5 in Simspeed which results it in being unplayable. Thus completely breaking large creations. This is even worse in multiplayer. The AI in this game was never supposed to be part of it, just like planets, now they added it but its just a joke. It's always exactly the same thing with every NPC you see. You don't even need a ship to take most of them down. You spot a ship, you approach it and it will open fire once your inside it's turret range, which is max. 800 meters. Other ships warp in, sit several kilometers away and pump out very frequent drones to harass you, which a couple of turrets take easy care of, if they happen to function correctly. Other than that those drones are nothing but a waste of ammo. The world is infinite yet there are only 3 planets accompanied by their moons. So you can go away from those planets, but there is nothing else out there except some astroids if you set up your game that way. Cyperhounds on planets are also a joke as they randomly spawn behind you every few minutes and are near to impossible to sound spot. They are bugged too, as they're bodies most likely will disregard the earth's gravitation and drift off into space. Spaceships are also extremely fragile. Well, nearly anything is.There are also other things which turned me off from this game after doing some research on the developers. I really hope that Keen Software House will spit in their hands and pull themselves together and get back on track with this game. But I've been patient for a long time and I think the time for Keen to hide behind the ""early access"" is about over. Really hope it's gonna get fixed and be amazing in the full release, but my hope of that ever happening is nearly gone.--Update--Keen is still sitting on their♥♥♥♥♥ feeling good that their fanboys, who apperantly have no idea what a GOOD game looks like, praise them for useless sound patches and minor bug fixes. Mean while, the major problems within the game are still present. Multiplayer is still broken. Do yourself a favour and DO NOT BUY this game.Buy EGS instead, its better in just about every aspect and hasn't been around nearly as long as Space Engineers has. Now some may call EGS a rip off (altough I disagree), but seriously.... who cares if they deliver the product in a much, much, MUCH better way?			"

Early Access Review
								This game is EARLY ACCESS, so bugs are to be expected. The problem I have is with the trend of updating the developers pursue, causing the light at the end of the tunnel to grow dimmer all the time rather than brighter.I love this game and have put many hours into it. You can create space ships, rovers, starbases, and a myriad of other things with well-thought, intelligently-designed blocks. This is one of the best games I have ever played--ever.However, I cannot recommend it currently. While they constantly update the game weekly, I have noticed a trend in updating where more content will be added or existing content will be modified in some way, but bug fixes to the game-breaking issues remain unchecked after months of waiting (some I hear from friends have been there for over a year). They do of course fix minor bugs, but they seem to constantly miss or avoid the major ones affecting gameplay. On top of this, more and more bugs seem to be introduced as the game is updated and those bugs also remain unchecked. Some examples of bugs I've encountered:-If you turn the power off in your ship, the engines will eventually freeze up when you try to turn the power back on and won't work again. If you're parked in a port, your ship will drop and likely break into many pieces. The current workaround is not to turn the power off at all (it took awhile to figure this out), but it caused so much frustration for me.-Disengaging the landing gear from terrain (with gravity only, as far as I know) will sometimes cause a catastrophe, making half of your ship explode due to a physics engine error.-In multiplayer the movement correction will sometimes cause your character to appear inside a wall, killing you instantly.-Mining drill stops working after a minute or two of use. This is a new bug, so hopefully they do manage to clear this one up quickly.-Entering a search string in the inventory screen now causes it to show no results even though there should be some. This seems to be a scroll bar error, so as long as you scroll to the top of the inventory screen before searching it will work. Again, this is a relatively new bug.-Standing on the icecap of mars causes you to slide around in multiplayer. Everything just slowly 'drifts' in one direction. We had to abandon an entire base eventually because of this one.-Long connections of blocks will cause the game to stutter each time you place a new block in that grid. This effect will get progressively worse the longer you connect the blocks. This is a long-time known bug by the developers that is related to the electrical system, and yet it has stayed there for the months I've been playing.-The most recent patch has given me my first Blue Screen of Death on my computer. It has frozen the game completely once, and it has caused the game to crash to the developer report once. This was only 30 minutes of gameplay, and unfortunately I can't continue to play the game like this.It's not to say they haven't done some good things, of course. They've added a hardware-rendered particle system (it used to be software-rendered) which increased how well the game ran. They modified the block placement system and cleaned it up a lot (which some debate it worse than before.)Please be cautious. This game is awesome when it's functioning well, but right now it just isn't.			"

								Alright, close your eyes and picture Minecraft. Now, replace the pixelated visual style with crisp graphics that rival Bioware titles. Good, now replace the medieval fantasy setting with the depths of space. Then, add the physical properties associated with space, and a building mechanic that not only lets you build architecture, but also space craft ranging in size from small fighters to gargantuan carrier vessels. Add blocks of various shapes and components for complicated mechanisms such as motors and gravity generators. Let's also throw in a destruction engine that lets every block deform with stress and damage in the most realistic manner conceivable. What you'll have is the wet dream of every creative gaming enthusiast, only this isn't a dream.			"

								     Space engineers is simply a fantastic game for the gamer who is into creation in a sci-fi atmosphere. Basically, the point of the game is single/group/multiplayer (vs) survival (or sandbox) creation of ships and stations in space. Player vs. player combat is virtually nonexistent, as the point of the game is to create ships and bases to do the combat for you. The building possibilities are relatively endless, as new parts are added with each update. It is somewhat 'HD Minecraft'-esque in that all parts are geometric (though the asteroids are not). It is rather graphically demanding for the texture quality, however this is somewhat expected in a game where hundreds of objects  are rendered constantly, at once. The multiplayer experience is so-so, in that private servers are a ton of fun, but public servers ultimately lead to griefing of your structures the moment you log out. There are other space games other there, like KSP, but it is hard to compare the two in a which-is-better way, as their playstyles are far too different.tl;dr: 8.5/10 Fun sandbox creation game.			"

								As always, buying a game that is still in early stages of development is a risky move. It was not without hesitation that I bought this game, and that was even at a 50% sale. Well, after the three first days I had amassed an impressive ~30 hours of playtime simply because I couldn't stop playing!It should be said that I have not put much time at all into the Survival mode, I've almost exclusively been playing Creative mode. If you even consider buying this game I advise you to check Youtube for gameplay videos - there are lots of channels that give you a good perspective on what this game is, and what you can do within it.Well, on to some pros and cons!Pros:+ Vanilla game offers wonderfull possibilities when it comes to construct your ships and bases.+ The modding community is outstanding and expands vastly on the vanilla game.+ The Dev-team seems to update the game in regular intervals. (They even released a major one on X-mas day!)+ In my opinion fairly cheap for what you get.+ Out of ideas for what to build? Youtube is full of incredible channels that feature user created content from Space Engineers that continue to inspire for a long time.+ The ability to save your designs and ""paste"" them into new world. This is togglable when you create a new world.+ Easy to get started with and a world of more complex constructs awaits you if you dive deeper into the game.Cons:- The maximum travel speed ingame might feel pretty slow if you are playing on a large world with long distances to cover.- Game is still in a pretty early development stage, so bugs and glitches are bound to be around for a while.- Public multiplayer can seem infested by griefers unless you are playing with people you know or trust.- Easy to spend way too many hours playing, forgetting other stuff like sleeping or eating...To conclude this review, I would like to say that I most heartily recommend this game to anyone who wants to let loose their creative side when building awesome stuff in space.Just my few cents!/Trobbel			"

								Let's clear the air. I've been playing this game in 1-2 month fits since about 2014. In that time, I've made everything from hover bikes (using player mods) to full length battle-cruisers. From small orbital mining platforms, to acre-spanning planetary bases. I've made cargo ships, mining vehicles, a replica of the SHIELD heli-carrier, and essentially anything else I felt like.The Good:-Great selection of mods from the community keep this already massive game perpetually new-Great graphics for a voxel game-Continually adding new features and mechanisms. Life support was a game changer.-You can build in creative mode, save the game, and turn that game save into a server.-Despite other reviews - multiplayer *does* work - it's just glitchy. I typically keep persisten objects down to double digits and limit players to about 8. Not super fun, admittedly - but you gotta' work within the constrains of whats possible in the game. I see a lot of reviews here harping on things the game just isn't designed to do (yet, if ever), and it's silly to me because its analagous to complaining that Red Dead Redemption doesn't have lasers and cyborg ninjas.The Bad:-AI is stupid. Last I played, you had roughly 3 options for ""enemies""/NPCs. A) drone ships that are a bit OP if I'm honest. B) These weird spider things that literally jump so high they kill themselves upon landing. C) These odd cyber-tiger looking things that destroy your base while you're off not paying attention. None of them are fun, none of them really add anything to the game, and only seem to be there as a token gesture, like ""ok. here. something to shoot at other than your buddies.""-Game slows down to unplayable depths if you overestimate your computer's ability to handle this game.-Lots of features need tweaking if not outright revamping, but devs seem to have their own agenda/priorities on what gets fixed first.-The planets are MASSIVE! Which would be awesome if there were any sort of reason to visit them. Other than a change of scenery (which in itself is a bit bland and repetitive), mining on planets is a mostly-hands on job as building a reliable vehicle to do this can only be done in creative mode. There isn't as much as liquid water on any planet. And so far - I've been unable to find more than stone iron and ice on a planet.With all this said - I still highly recommend this game to anyone who's ever enjoyed building their own spaceships, stations, or just wants an excuse to float around in space. Just stay off the planets.			"

								With all negative reviews because of bugs around here I think it is only fair that I share my experience, I play this game since the early alphas before the survival mode even existed, before wheels, jump drives, docking, beacons, turrets, programmable blocks,conveyor systems, projectors, welding/grinder ships, planets, and oxygen/hydrogen.I have not played as many hours as some people here but I have a fair amount of experience and I say that in this two years (maybe more) I never had problems with bugs, not even once. There is people saying it is unplayable, that's absurd, such a shame people that don't get the meaning of ""alpha"" and ""beta"" flaming such a good game because they had a one in a million problem that is probably fault of their own computer, drivers, OS.Im not saying that bugs don't exist, of course there are bugs, this game is not finished yet, again, people complaining about them don't know what ""alpha"" and ""beta"" means. Most complaints about bugs I saw here are because of landing gears,rotors,and pistons. I personally never had issues with them that I could call a bug, but I didn't made anything really complex using them either, most of my ships have landing gears and they always worked for me, in one of my survival games I attach all my small ships to my refinery ship using their landing gears to take them with me when moving elsewhere.If you want this style of game (""minecraft in space"") kind of game, this is the best one I found so far, at its current state and as a programmer it surprises me how optimized this game is. For a voxel game with a infinite universe, asteroids and actual planets of such size and complexity where you can dig and build on each planet and asteroid and even code in-game scripts for ships it runs extremely well, while other game of same style I tried that had inferior graphics and small square planets sent the processor usage to maximum, making me lock in 30 fps to avoid overheat, space engineers run smoothly with 60 fps without big differences to temperature, even near planets that in SE case are round, way bigger and actually look good.This game updates weekly with sometimes a patch on the following day to address bugs discovered after the update reached the users, there are times with lots of new features, and times where the devs stop releasing new features or only do minor ones to focus this updates in bug fixing, this is a game Im very happy to see the way it evolved on the last years, and how the community took part in it, planets where not a feature they were going to introduce, that was a community request.For the ones complaining how new features bring bugs, That's how coding and developing works, and it will happen until the game is finished. This game improved dramatically while other similar games barely changed, and actually reached beta. In my opinion the best of its style, I had to make this review because some of the bad ones around here are really unfair in my opinion and experience with this game.			"

								With over 500 hours of gametime on this game I can honestly say that this was a really good game that had great potential. I know alot of people are complaining about bugs and whatnot but those will hopefully be looked at in time. I really REALLY loved this game, the freedom to build whateveryou liked, the realism in when crafting a ship if it wasn't built well in terms of having enough thrust to leave a planet or just build a ship that won't crash because it's not balanced out. Things like this really made me love this game and I had a blast both crafting and fighting other players and NPC pirate ships. Hell I even made a vehicle that ran like a tank because the ground vehicle wheels are buggy (last time I played) and don't work in multiplayer games, BUT! if you use Rotors instead it works perfectly.. just assigned the left rotors on button 1 and the right rotors on button 2 and then just turned the rotors on and off to move and turn it.. like you drive a tank bacically... What killed the game for me is bacically the lack of dedicated servers. Playing solo get's boring fast and playing on someone elses server, some servers just vanish and the same can be said about all the hours spent on building something there and you have to start from scratch again somewhere else and hope that server will be up longer. Bacically I think everyone that likes crafting/building games will have a blast with this game for a few hours, but after that I fear you will lose interest because you either end up having nothing to do or you lose everything and have to start over again and again and that in itself get's really boring after a while. Another issue with private servers is the simspeed and latency, having dedicated servers from the developers means they are finetuned to run the game as well as it can be run.Bottomline... if the devs decide to startup some dedicated servers then I think this game will be one of the best games ever made. It has great potential so I hope they get some servers up in the future or if they never planned on doing it I hope they rethink that decision.			"

								The alpha that keeps on giving.  Space engineers is a sandbox style game in which you are placed in space and can build to your hearts content.  It shares the same genre as minecraft being a sandbox but is not Minecraft.  Think of it this way, Battlefield is a first person shooter but is in no way the same as Counter Strike.  Sure, each has similarities in that you are in first person mode with a firearm, but beyond that, the mechanics are very different. Space Engineers takes on this same style.  It seperates itself apart from the rest in that it is in space, is not completely block based, and has a modern/futuristic feel to it that takes some getting used to.  Building is easy in this game, there are many different types of items but the foundation is always a block, slope, inverted corner, triangle, or a landing gear for a ship.  You can make stations, ships, capital ships (larger ships essentially), opening and closing doors, hidden turrets behind a set of lights, etc.  The possibilites are endless and the weekly updates make it even better.Uranium is your life force and your refinery and assembler are your tools.  Without these three things nothing happens and you end up respawning inside a yellow ship with these basic things and nothing else.  Turning things off like a gravity generator and the engines may be necessary at first just to preserve what little uranium you do have.  Do not fret however, almost all materials needed are not difficult to find...for the most part.  Some places you might find entire sections of uranium while other areas may contain traces of the ore but also have spots of other ore like gold, magnesium, silicon, nickel, iron, and silver.  Each has their uses of course.Bugs are apparent in some instances of the game.  It is an alpha so it will have issues but as said before, weekly updates are releasing new content and fixing old content that may not work properly.  Dedicated servers are an option or you can just run it from your local machine as you see fit.  The dedicated server that I run is locked down to my group only and consumes very little resources.  In fact, my machine is running a mumble server, a minecraft server, and Space Engineers and the machine is an old AMD Atlhlon x3 x64 system with 4 GB of RAM on windows 7.  So anyone can run a server!Performance wise, the game engine has a bit of optimization needed.  Sometimes it lags other times it is fine.  I run a very clean system that is top notch performance with dual SSDs in RAID 0 and 16 GB of RAM with dual video cards and a high end processor and still experience issues from time to time.  Nothing serious, but still, they are there.  Overall, the atmosphere of the game is great.  The sound effects, music, graphics, everything is great.  The controls are a bit wonky at first but you get used to them.  You can just remap controls if you really get irritated though, so keep that in mind as an option.  Creative mode and Survival are a blast although the latter is my favorite.  Playing with friends is fun and hunting down those armed mining ships and military ships is a blast.  Physics play a role, so that means mass is also important and how many thrusters you have overall will make a difference.  Everything from reactors to guns and stations to capital ships are present in this game.  Nothing here is poorly executed aside from the menu system which can take some getting used to.  At this point on the timeline, I would say this is a good buy for those looking to play something unfinished but worth their time.			"

								Personal Recommendation: Hell Yes!This game is absolutely amazing.  Yes, there is no real point to it, other than being creative.  Personally, survival is only fun with friends.  It can get somewhat dull otherwise.  This game's only limit is your imagination, if you aren't creative and don't enjoy creative sandbox games, don't get it!  My only complaint is how demanding planets are.  I'm sure they'll optimize in the near future, but it's absultely insane how demanding it is.  I have an i7 4790 and a gtx 960 with 8gb of RAM and I STILL can barely run it at medium settings.  Do I recommend this game?  Yes.  BUT, only to people with good enough computers and how enjoy being creative.			"

								After I got sick of minecraft, I started looking for a replacement. I bought space engineers a long LONG time ago but never had the ability to play it due to potato PC's. A little later I got a new HP Envy, still was a potoato to run this game. So still was never able to play it. Ever since planets came out made me feel left out because of my PC. I still never touched the game though. After a recent update I decided to give it a try and see what I can get out of it, well since they added the option to turn off shadows really helped! I ran the game on the lowest settings possible, lowered the resolution to the minimum that looked best, not enough to mishape things, still even with the screen. and well I was able to play away!I managed to get a fast smooth framerate with a Intel HD 4600 GPU!! I would build cool things after I did the tutorial, and would build from little rovers to space stations! I would ask my sister who was very addicted to minecraft: ""Can you do this in minecraft?!"" maybe with all the redstone stuff but would be very bulky.I don't know why people complain about running this game on beast PC's on low settings and would only get around 10 to 5 fps. I managed to get this game running nice and smooth on a potato! (this is all including planets) Now people do say that this game is minecraft in space. Well that is accurate. Building is similar to minecraft, but more complex. Minecraft is everything blocks. Blocky world too. Space engineers has blocks to smooth out your creations to make them NOT so blocky. The planets are more planet-ish also!This game has a high learning curve too. Which I'm sure people don't like, but I do! I like to learn how to play complex games like this. Feels really fun and challenging at the same time! After you build some pretty rad things in this game. You'll never complain about your house being griefed on minecraft agiain! :)The only thing I don't like about this game is that there is not too much to do here. Besides building ships and bases and well stuff like that. Thats why I set my own objectives to reach a certain planet or moon.I also hear that multiplayer is really buggy. Well I can't say anything about that because I'm more of a anti-social person, so I NEVER play multiplayer. (Unless with a friend)I also never seemed to encounter much bugs with this game also. (In singleplayer of course) The only bug I have encountered is the gamma or contrast messing up when the game auto saves. (The screen would be really bright or really dark)Now all I have to say is if you buy this game after reading my review. Keep your expectations low. This is just my expirience with this game and I can't guarentee anything to anyone else.Thanks for reading this rambling review! It may not prove usefull but It will get my word out!Thanks again! :)			"

								New, but totally worth it. At the moment, not much to do besides build, and dogfight with a friend, but they will add factions (There is a tab that says ""Factions"" un one of the menus) and SO much more in the near future. Updates come out often also. I'm just preparing for the time when mods/dedicated servers come out. It will absolutley be my favorite game. Also, though, it's not optimized very well. I can run Arma 3 on high settings just fine, but I cant even be near a big ship without getting less than 20 FPS. Verdict: I reccomend it. Though it's not the best in its current state, I guarentee you it will be later on in its development. Your choice if you wanna buy it now, I assume the price will raise later.			"

								i can say this game is combination of minecraft and x-albion. basically you need to survive to keep your oxygen supply and station/ship powered. and defend from other players if you're on multiplayer server.on the first day of survival, you need at least to build your own station. to build and complete this station you need mining the asteroid to get resources(iron, gold, platinum, ice, etc). and then manufacture the necesarry part and combine them into various functionable machines(from assembler, refinery, oxygen generator, reactor etc).the interesting part begin when you join multiplayer server and compete/coop with other player. you can create turrets to defend your station, fighter ships, capital ships, droid, and warhead torpedo to bombard your oppositions.i can't wait for the dev to implement planet system. this game have potential to make you able to create your own empire.

								Not recommended, at least not yet...Laggy, broken, super fun and addictive garbage. Ships randomly disappear (or, more accurately, do not appear to your friends, so they crash into your ships instead of docking next to them), things randomly break, simulation speed drops in half, randomly crashes to desktop, etc.Also, the C# API has a really funky smell. Why is everything prefixed with ""My"" and why do search methods return void?! So sad.EDIT: Many many months later, this game still has numerous irritating bugs (or design flaws) that prevent it from being enjoyable. Everything was pretty good and playable until planets came out, then everything went down the crapper. Our jetpacks inexplicably break (hydrogen at 100%) until we respawn, certain areas cannot be walked/jetpacked through because of invisible blocks, ships formerly attached to the ground without any thrusters defy gravity and float off into space, physica collisions make things explode, and so on...

								Simply amazing, and with the magnitude of updates that comes in each week; with tutorial videos to go along. Just buy it already! Multiplayer is fun, building is a dream with control interfaces that most games wish they had. The sheer number of items, blocks and designs you can create is staggering! It also has a very nice XYZ mirroring features, copy and paste - real-time of ships and objects. Offensive weapons! Such detailed and rich environment and object / ship damage. Build big, build small, build a station to house them all! Gravity, Mass, Velocity, etc all apply here and it makes for some great physics fun! With gravity generators, you can make any direction and adjustable field sizing for direct gravity on objects and players. Lighting / shaders are top notch, and the effects you can experience are background / image potential for sure.It is well worth the money for this, and if you ever want to build together - just shoot me a message!*This game has only gotten 10x better since my review back in Febuary - customization and amount of addons and changes is too numerous to begin to tell you - the videos on the Store page don't do justice - they are mostly old. Just look up the weekly dev blog that in-depth explains the newest features and keys to get a better feel at current state. The MP is solid and full on space battles are just about seamless. Wonderful are the latest changes to make ships and stations interchangable with docking ports, and now conveyor systems for item transfers, passenger seating, color scheme on everything is RGB / Hue / Sat customized, Turrets both interior and exterior, artificial mass blocks and gravity generator modifications. I could go on and on, or you could just check out their weekly videos since release. The real-time damage system is SOOO great, and detailed. There is something for everyone - whether you are into pitting two dogfighters at each other and record it, hundred people in your own spaceport RP system, or simply want to solo design an epic space station in the side of an asteroid you blew a chunk out of. IF YOU ARE ON THE FENCE AT ALL ABOUT THIS GAME, BUY IT! You will not be sorry.			"

								First off, I'd like to start out by saying that after I originally wasted nearly 26 bucks on minecraft (DO NOT BUY THAT GAME), I bought this game for just under 20 (should have bought when half off) and I got to say that ""awesome"" is the grandest of all understatement on a way to describe this game.  This game doesn't come without its early game problems though, which i have serveral ideas.1. You can't build road vehicles (disregard, it has been pointed out to me that artificial mass gives gravity to road vehicles)Though you have wheels and suspension, you can't really build a small vehicles because they end up floating away, not that you need small road vehicles considering the concept of the game, but the wheels should be pulled down by gravity like the player is, otherwise, like i said before, it'll float away, i'm not sure why wheels exist in this game as of now, but adding gravity affect to wheels, and steering assemblies wouldn't hurt, it would really be as much usefull as much as it would be novelty, unless you have a REALLY large ship, which is what i'm working on, there will be a core of the ship because you'll need a vehicle to get to and from really fast.2. Server lag.I feel that the multiplayer servers and the way everything is handled when sharing maps could be done more efficiently, so much lag and is very network intensive, i work with networking and computers and the way everything network in this game is being handled, is not doing so very efficiently, i'd have people join my maps, complain about the extreme lag, and leave, like clockwork.3. Some of the cubes are limited.For example, on large ships you can only place large cubes, and for small ships, you can only place small cubes.  When you are configuring your toolbar, there is a category for large cubes, and a category for small cubes, they aren't really large or small, the size of your cube is completely dependent on the type of ship you're building, so the ""small cube"" ""large cube"" categories are somewhat confusing, i think it could have been thought out a little better.  Another note on the cubes are the passage way cubes, i forget exactly what they're called, but there are only strait peices, no T or L or + peices, so you kind of have to figure a sollution to make that cube work.There are a few little things that bug me, but not enough to state them here, and yes, i am aware it is still an early access game, the 3 ones that i posted above were problems to me that i felt needed to be pointed out, overall, the game is super awesome and i would recommend this game 3 times over plus another time, definitely the best $20 i've ever spent thus far.  Another thing i'd like to note is that it's also not as processor intensive i though it would be, as of now (12-11-2014), i have a pentium G630 on an asus p8h77-v and 3.5gigs of ram (32 bit OS) and a geforce 9800gt.  The graphics card does become quite the convection oven though during gameplay it goes up to around 210 - 220 farhenheit, and that fan gets LOUD, if i didn't have the cooling i did, it would probably already be dead, it's minorly concerning, i have a second 9800gt that i might put into an sli but with only a 430psu, it would concern me.

								Don't buy it!  This game is not ready for consumption and has not gotten any closer in the two years I've owned it already.  In fact its even further from being ready than when I bought it. The idea of the game is great and if it actually worked it might be fun, but it doesn't.  ITS FULL OF GAME BREAKING PHYSICS BUGS.For instance:I build a structure with 4 landing gears on top of my station on a planet on it and engage their locks.  While I am grinding I accidentally grind out the block under one landing gear, so I try to put it back.  Placing a block back under the landing gear causes the whole thing to launch into the air and tumble over sideways, despite the fact that there were 3 landing gears locking it down to the ground.I am attacked by cyberhounds so I jump up on my platform and shoot them.  They fall over dead then disappear under the ground where I cannot loot them.I build a car and try to drive it.  The ground is ridiculously rough despite looking smooth.  My car flips over.  I spend time building some pistons and rotors to jack the vehicle up and flip it back over.  I try to walk in next to my vehicle with my welder to repair it.  I walk between the two tires and my vehicle suddenly flies like 100 feet into the air and crashes into pieces. "

								I played for a bit, seems pretty solid. It was off to a rocky start but then the devs started pumping iron and breathed life into the empty void. It started to pick up traction shortly after but that was nothing compaired to the shipments of updates that started flying by. I'm really impressed by how clear the devs vision of what they want the game to be is, its astronomical. Communication has always been a focus of the devs when constructing the backbone of the game: its community. Shortly after I started playing this game the community exploded due to all the direct comms between the community and the devs. I still can't beleive how un-survivable the ordeal started out as only to become the most airtight experience I've had on steam. They've really refined the game into a masterpeice and merged the collective ideas of the community with the pressurized determination of the most productive, effective, and efficient development team I've ever discovered in my adventures.What are you looking for? More puns? Shoo, nobody likes it when you project your wants unto them.			"

								Minecraft meets KSP meets Gmod, but the exact mix depends on what settings you pick. If you pick Survival mode without many ships, welcome to Space Mining Simulator 2014. If you pick Creative mode, the game turns into a space-based version of Gmod. No planets at the moment, but asteroids and the option to add meteor showers mean that you don't have to stick with ships. 9/10 will get better with time.			"

								Honestly? THE best early access game i have ever bought. The developers listen to feedback from players e.g. Solar Panels and then later on Rechargable battery packs. It's easiest to describe this game as ""Minecraft in space"" but that doesnt cover it. Minecraft is about setting up a sustainable base and then eventually defeating the Ender-Dragon or in creative mode seeing what you can build using cubes of various materials. Space Engineers is about seeing what you can create using nothing but the resources dug and refined from nearby asteroids, making them into various parts for assembly and then constructing anything from makeshift cars to fighter ships all the way up to an Eldar Craftworld (although that will lag a LOT its Early access.. c'mon what would you expect?) The only limit in Space Engineers is your imagination. With an active community that uploads items onto the workshop on a daily basis you can never run out of inspiration or other ships to test your latest deadly weapon or attack vessle against. Apart from the occasional lag issues when your world starts to fill up with failed experiments/enormous ships/enormous space station/ thousands of your corpses cause you failed to recharge your suit in time, this genuinely feels like a finished product. Except it isn't. With updates coming every week on a Thursday with simple things like Bug fixes or (more often than not) completely new content this is an enjoyable, constantly in motion game for all the family... Well maybe not, I wouldn't invite little Cousin Jimmy into your world for him to then fly around blowing your beautiful constructs up because he figured out how to make warheads and ""The boom noise is too funny!"" Damnit Jimmy... Anyway at £14.99 its difficult to say no to this game. Unless you hate sandbox construction games in which case go back to CoD or Battlefield or whatever it is you popular people play these days.			"

Every feature is not just a feature to mentoin, but a thing YOU will use.- Sandboxiest sandbox. Create space stations, large and small ships. Become an artist, a designer and an engineer.- Computer systems of the future. Every block that have computer component in it will fight on your side until destroyed, unpowered or hacked. Create a defense system that will kill anyone trying to sneak into your base, while keeping your base open to your friends and their ships.Create manned, automated remote-controlled systems.- Every block count. Everything you see is not a decoration, but a fully working part of system.- Survival. Mine asteroids, explore space and survive meteor storms.- More and more things to tell- Limitless amount of situations and space traffic accidents.- More cool things coming! Upgrade your old ships with brand new blocks from new updates.Also you could try Miner Wars 2081 - not a best game, but it shares the same spirit with space engineers.			"

								With only 50 hours in this game, I'll base my review on what I've learned so far.Build StationsBuild ShipsLoose ship cuz you didn't realize it needed to be stuck to Landing Gear while buildingCreate weird and complex structuresDie cuz you forgot to recharge energyTake your first flight, loose the ship cuz you forgot thrusters somewhereRedesign your ship to get more weird things on.Make your first LARGE shipStart dreaming of controlling your own Serenity, Enterprise or an Klingon Battlecruiser.Play around with Rotors, Pistons, commmand blocks and more to make it even cooler....Watch the tutorials :D .. The first hour I spend not understanding what to do at all! As the super tech guy I am ( I thought ) .. This was no prob to play. .. untill I actually started it. Back on the tutorials to get the basic, then on youtube to watch some tips and tricks, and now ... now the game is just awsome. I'm trying out new ways to build ships, trying my best to make copies of ships like X-Wing, Serenity and more. Building a space station, and just make it bigger .. more complex way to utilize the station .. just to see where it takes me .. I love every aspect of it.It does have bugs .. all games do .. This is an Early Alpha .. remember this.The bugs that are in Creative mode is  more as small hickups .. the funny glitch when you mine something, and suddenly you see through the whole asteriode for a second, then return to the mining again .. can be weird, fun and annoying .. all at once :DIn survival mode I've had one bigger issue .. and it was that my miningship sometimes just broke during flight .. or lost a container or reactor .. once I lost 5 thrusters ... but ... even as annoying this is, I recommend NOT using the autosave .. but rather save at your own so you can get back and redo if you crash or loose something due to a glitch.I have only a few hours in multiplayer, so I will not comment much regarding this. The little I've played have been flawless. I would believe that some of the survival mode glitches might appear in MP survival aswell..Pros:Total freedom in what you want to build, where to go, what to do.Grahpics are pretty good. Lots and lots better than minecraft.. ( I know .. stop comparing it lol )Lots and lots of mods to play around with.You can have a singleplayer survival or creative mode save, and turn it into a LAN/MP world if wanted.Devs are doing weekly updates, from new items/armor and more, to bugfixes and optmizing.Cons:You get thrown into space, not much help there. ( unless you watch tutorials and youtube )Glitches and bugs, but this is a part for ALL games...Unless you KNOW what an item does, there's no helpscreen about the item. ( example: you have rotor, but unless you know what to do, you won't get it to work right... )But!!! All in all. .. I'm very happy I got this game gifted to me. So far I have enjoyed my 50 hours into the game, an I know I will enjoy atleast the next 100 hours. Unless I have figured out how to use ALL things ingame, I will keep playing and playing.I've already made a 10 player dedi server for me and my friends to play on :D10/10Go get it :D			"

								Space Lag…One man dev team can do better, it’s called Starmade.  Get it, its cheaper, and better.I like so many others, want to like this game.  I've played off and on for quite some time now, waiting for things to be fixed.  Great idea if the game would run right.  Dev's release new gimmicks all the time, cool features even, if it worked.  Multiplayer?  Not really.  False advertising there... multiplayer is super broken.Many years, much money, and problems this game had at its start are still present.  It looks like a polished game, it's not.  The bugs in this game have prevented me from buying their other one, midevil engineers.  I was worried when they started that project that they were dumping Space Engineers.  It seems devs are working on both with equal incompetence.DEVS - Stop releasing gimmicks to sell the game and fix the existing game!  PLAYERS - Everyone needs to start posting negative reviews on this game at regular intervals to bring its rating down so it stops selling.  Maybe they will abandon it, maybe they will fix it.  If they stop selling the game, perhaps it will encourage them to do something about the bugs and the total neglect of optimisation. Would be a great game if it would run on something less than a university super computer and things didn't randomly explode around you.			"

								I'm going to be straight forward here: This game started out so promising.. and has now devolved to the point where I don't even think they're putting much effort into it anymore. They are literally adding modding tools so modders can actually finish their game (after Keen made so much money out of it and modders didn't).The last few updates have been virtually worthless unfortunately.After Keen broke Survival MP again during the Christmas holidays, which was fixed an entire week later rather than doing a rollback on the spot, they added suicide dogs no one asked for, only to now break Survival MP again, with, again, something that could have been tested by three guys logging into a test server for 5 minutes. So now we gotta wait, again, potentially an entire week, until we can play Survival MP.Sadly a great idea in the hands of very limited minded people.I do not recommend this game at this stage, they are launching updates every week but useless ones, not real bug fixes or optimization. Just adding stupid features and modding tools so people can finish what they don't care anymore.			"

								~Updated 07 JAN 2017~To be honest, I don't really enjoy this game anymore.  I had hope that it would grow into something with the popularity of Minecraft, where communities would form and different playstyles would flourish.  The progress is slow and it feels like they break as many things as they improve half the time.  I still stand by recommending it as it's is loads of fun, IF you're into these sorts of games.  It's just that there are other offerings (that I will not name here) out there that are a bit more polished as far as space simulation/exploration go as well as survival crafting.  The fact that they were able to put the two together in such a way and not have it all crash and burn is very impressive.  So yes, still a recommendation, but only if you're interested already.  I can't solidly try to sell you on this game.  Good luck!~Original~Simple, Intriguing, Thought Provoking.What a delightful experience.  People refer this game to those who like Minecraft, but there really is something in it for everyone.  From ship design, to base design, to dabbling with engineering and physics; this game is looking to be the next big thing.  Note: Best played with friends.  Oodles of fun.Recommendation:  Pick up a 4-Pack and share it with friends.			"

								SpEn has a lot to it. It's an amazing world with absolute player's freedom of activities. I remember thousands great in-game moments, where I was having fun with friends. SpEn could be my most favourite game for the whole my lifetime, but...But gameplay development isn't thought out. KSH introduces what seems the most fun and arcade for them. Once upon the time they even introduced randomly spawning and exploding dogs, with no backthought of, for example, instead using coders for redesigning communications to be more comfortable and fun to play with, or implementing just a simple volumetric map.Then multiplayer, the reason of this game should be even played, experiencing hundreads of different player-made environments with old- and new-made friends, it's completely dead. The whole netcode, server and data management were randomly put up together, occasionly breaking down and falling apart with whole dedicated servers almost every weak, even though those servers are being hosted sometimes on huge mainframes.And physics. Oh... Those were crashing, exploding, lagging out, torning apart thousands and thousands of my ships, I've been working on for many weeks, for all these 3 years. Pulling run out of power ships against the gravity from ground to the stratosphere, insta-killing my characters million times, who just stepped in the wrong time in the wrong place, breaking out of sync - those are just dumb ways to die.The most fun part is that, devs say, they are fixing physics and multiplayer, that they are making a progress. Well, I believed them for the last 3 years until now. And now I'm just too tired to continue holding on these hopings.I saw felt so far no code improvements or reworks even by a tiny bit for the last year. Every single 'fix' of every single older bug just pops out bunch of newer bugs. It's the product of coder's lazyness to go deeper in their own code, I suppose. I'm not kidding, coding proccess is really awful. Sometimes I even think, coders put bugs in on purpose, to just fix them later, for the work proccess imitation.Why is it so? Well, my guess is, teamwork has became hulking. KSH grown out in a bigger studio, but it's leading style stayed as small-team one, which is unable to control or monitor coding forces with required flexibility.It feels painful to give it thumbs down for the game with this variety of features, because they are ruined for the comfortability of players experience by some primitive management issues.

Early Access Review
								Edit 7 April 2016: Went back last week and started a new SE game after throughly enjoying Empryion Galactic Survival (big thumbs up for EGS!) the last couple months. Space Engineers hasn't changed. Still broken; pistons, wheels, power 'grid' still broken, etc. Hand mining after Empryion's much better system is incredibly bad in SE. Very very short interaction distance means lots of grief/frustration and due to still broken 'moveable bits' like wheels & pistons, trying to make a working mining truck is hopeless. NPC/PvE is -so- much better in Empryion! SE's idea of PvE on starting 'Earth' are jihadist exploding 'dogs' that would make Isis seem like a sweet old grandmother. Pointlessly OPed. Still have to ""engineer -around- the game"" not -with- the game. Some simple things that Empryion got right and SE devs seem too depressed to even consider; EGS uses Hovercraft instead of wheeled starter vehicles (hovers work great in EGS), Empryion has elevator blocks to get up & down (and they work when un-powered!) SE just has ramps. EGS starting survival is very nicely balanced with well done Hunger/Health/Oxygen systems, and NPCs -add- to immersion & are useful to boot.Bottom line: I can easily recommend Empryion at full price but can't bring myself to recommend SE even at this weekends sale price of $7.49.--Original review--To be fair there is a lot to like about Space Engineers.  But the 'engineering' part leaves an awful lot to be desired.The game in general is 'box' based, similar to Minecraft, though natural parts aren't restricted to cubism & landscapes on moons & planets is very nice.  My main dislike is the lack of things like hinges, winches, cables, etc.  Basically the only moving blocks are a piston and a rotor.  Pistons have basically been broken since I bought the game in Feburary.Oh, almost forgot wheels.  arrr, maybe I should have.  Wheels, well they'll just drive you nuts.  Especially in a gravity field like a world.  Their behaviour isn't even close to what you'd expect & never has been.  Which leaves me repeatedly trying to 'engineer' around the game, not -with- the game, and that's not only silly, but non-rewarding as well.  So I've learned to not use pistons or wheels, and only very carefully (and not on ships, only bases) to use rotors.They're not cruising with the game, they've added many significant & large features since Feb, like oxygen, hydrogen and new thrusters for H, also Planets, some with cool alien spiders, and just today Cyberhounds to attack you on Earth (which, ""you won't be able to turn off for a few days"" a forced ""Test this!"" I'm not happy about).It's their game & they decide what & when to implement; I get that.  It's Alpha, so not everything works & things will change.  Got it.  Reason for my thumbs down is I'm free to desire a real engineering challenge, which I don't get with the game as it is.  Yes, I've had some fun, but hours played on my profile don't reflect at the keyboard time.  You need to mine then refine ores to then make components, then put those together to make blocks.  Refining takes quite a while and at least half my 'played' hours were simply me leaving game running all night, refining.Now -design- challenges?  Sure.  There are enough different blocks to make some astonishing ships.  And they fly in space!  Just bear in mind that you can't make a simple hoist that will hook a cable to a crate and move it.  Yes, you can make a rigid arm, use a landing gear to magnetically lock onto a block and then move that, but any pistons you use are likely to explode on next game load if left under pressure.There are many many mods for the game, someone even made a hinge that folks swear by.  But I only play vanilla, and that's what I'm reviewing.I really do hope that one day the game will have solid working movable bits like gears and jacks and cable hoists cause I really need an elevator to get 400m down to the valley floor from my hillside retreat.  As soon as they do (if I'm still around) I'll happily change to a thumbs up.			"

								This game was a revolutionary concept back in 2014, and even now it is a pioneering project in the game industry, with full voxel based sandbox system in space with high detail graphics, planets, asterodis, mining, industry building, mechanic systems etc.Unfortunately it became too big for the developers to finish as a quality game, and the underlying multiplayer concept is not working, it is too late to move to a professional netcode like raknet. This implies, that the concept of faction based, persistent, multiplayer game with lots of players (30+) will never be realised, which makes the game a pointless, unfinished sandbox. It can be considered as an abandonware, stuck in early access, with constant pretense as being fixed, while underlying fundamnetal problems never get fixed.			"

I'm lucky that got this game for free otherwise I'd be very angry about how they keep this stupid ""weekly update"" no matter what happens, skip testing, add a feature and fix a bug just to break the game completely for a whole week, add content no one asked for and that's plain stupid without the option to turn it off (Explosive cyber dogs [MC creepers] while net code is a broken thing that barely works), or even try to make the game less demanding (yes memory leaks and 8 gb of free RAM to run a planet I'm looking at you)In short, sell some cards and buy it on the next sale if you want a voxel space building game, otherwise hope corneroids comes back from the underworld.

								Great idea but multiplayer is frustrating/buggy to say the least.  For example: servers often crash, assets dissapear( jump drives delete ships after use), sim speed is slow because servers have to render more than is needed.  The game development appears to pander to users who play creative mode rather than multiplayer(eg planets instead of netcode).  I wouldn't recommend this game >edit<  to players who often play MP until it moves out of alpha stage or unless you're a die hard SE fan(like me).  If you want to play dedicated MP, get used to all I mentioned above.			"

								I've been having a real blast with this one. The level of customization is pretty awesome. You build all of your ships and bases from scratch, peice by peice, and they are simulated with physics. Amazing work.There are now planets with stuff living on 'em, too, which is pretty cool. Flight controls are very nice, and you can turn off your inertial dampers at any time for vectored flight.The enemies are pretty simple. This is more about creating than surviving (though you do need oxygen and power). Hope there's an upgrade to the PvE element later on.Awesome setting fine-tuning. Create exactly the sort of map you want to play on.Programmable blocks! Ok, yes, the API is kinda (very) clunky and unintuitive. Also the documentation (or lack there-of) is shameful. But it's early access, so I put that down to something that'll get worked out over time. The important thing is that you can actually program your creations to do anything you want. It's a mind-blowing level of customization. And it uses a limited set of standard C# - you don't have to learn some niche language to use 'em. Of course, you can just download scripts in the workshop, too ;o)Anyway, lots and lots of thumbs up on this one. Great game.			"

								The game by itself is extremely fun and time consuming. With mods, it turns into a comepletely different monster, much like Skyrim. My game time may not amount to much but I've made plenty of ships, large and small, from scratch and watched them break apart in use and get blown up my cargo ships. The fun is in the ""engineering"", if you will. Designing ships that will last and doing what they're supposed to is so immersive. Playing with friends makes it even more fun to. The constant updates keep the game fresh too. Overall, this was a great buy and even though it's early access it still feels like a full game on its own.  "

								Updates come out every thursday evening like clockwork, and each week makes the game better.What with planets and DX11 in the pipeline this game is promising to be something truly amazing.I can understand that a lot of people have trust issues with alpha releases and developers, but the guys at KSH really have done a stellar job, and have kept up a consistently good job for nigh on two good years with this game, it has got to the point now where, if they promise something, I trust them to stick to it.However, it is very important that when people buy this they remember that this is still alpha, and as a result optimisation in both single and multiplayer has not been tackled yet, and hence larger online servers are rather unstable and filled with many occurences of rubberbanding, or lag, although with a complete re-write of multiplayer on the way I can see these issues soon being a thing of the past. I see buying into this game not for it's playability factor now, but as an investment. Even so at it's current stage the game is more than worth the money they ask, with basically infinite creative possibilities single player is fun and can eat hundreds of hours into building things that look really great, and in multiplayer small 'race to eliminate the other team' competitive servers with a few friends are one of the most fun experiences I've actually had with a game.All in all, even if you don't feel like its an amazing game now, (which it is by all means) check back every now on then on the KSH forums, see what they've added, see what's on it's way, because this game really does get better every week.

Early Access Review
								I will start out by saying i have spent an extensive amount of time in this game and have loved nearly every hour of it. Those that need structure and plot to guide you through a game this game wont be for you,  it is truely open free-form gameplay.  anyone who loves sandbox play however will get lots of enjoyment out of this im betting.  There are limitations on this game like any alpha stage early access game.  Im going to try and cover some of the pros and cons of this game in its current state.  The Cons:: Audio issues,  multiplayer sync issues but still very playable,  a lack of direction or set goals can be frustrating to some,  no obvious ""enemy""  to work against/attack/defend against, not optimized graphically yet,  game breaking bugs do exist but none that cant be worked around ussually.  You can expect a distinct lack of ""polish"" being an alpha so just make sure you look at it in the view that this game is /not/ finished so keep that in mind when a frustrating issue pops up. The Pros:: Price! (14.99),  FREQUENT updates (every thursday it recieves content updates with new fixes,  blocks,  game mechanics), very active community modding support via workshop,  multiplayer host shares mods with anyone joining so people without your mods can still come and go easily.  Survival and Creative modes are distinct and each offer their own entertainment values offering freebuilding or resource gathering and piracy of npc ships, support for pvp via factions and ownership privileges that allows you to form a team of other players to fight with/against, intuitive controls,  nearly limitless building options! If you can dream it you can build it in this game..  from a giant carrier to little mining pods,  stations to sprawling solar farms. The pros outweight the cons i promise,  this game is very highly recomended to anyone who loves sandbox building,  or playing with legos lol.			"

								I can not believe how incredibly adicting this game is!Build anything you want, from a simple spacecraft or station over a mech to that super battle donut destroyer that everyone on the server fears.With both creative and survival modes you can also be sure that your inventions will function as you want them to (especialy since you can make blueprints of them)features I love:- ........ EVERYTHING!Light and heavy armor blocks, thruster damage, doors, sensors, timers, programable blocks, motors, pistons, lights, cameras, refineries, assemblers, solar pannels weapons........... there are soooooo many, and of course, you need to get your resources off those asteroids (in survival).So, learn how to survive in space otherwise you will end up an everlasting floating corpse...

								This is the space game that I've always wanted. I can build whatever spaceship I can come up with, and I'm not limited to single-seat fighters. I can build ships that are as big as I want and I can walk around in them and maintain systems and such.It's updated every single Thursday with new features and bug fixes. I can honestly say that this is the only Early Access game that I've been thoroughly impressed with.There's also some really cool stuff coming in the future like a complex scripting interface.This is really one of the best games that I've ever bought and I can't wait to see what it gets in the future.

Gameplay is fun for a short while and then it just gets boring there's nothing going on or anything interesting to work towards, other than cool ship designs of course. Don't buy until it's finished.			"

								Good game just needs more.Graphics are alright not bad.Sound is weird because you are in space and there is barely any sound, but you get used to it.The building, mining, constructing, creating confuses the hell out of me.  I physically do not understand anything on what to do, so I just build random crap and try to get used to it.The controls take some getting used too, and you find yourself drifting around a lot at first, before learning to suck your character to everything you come close too.I like the game, it has potential.  It would be amazing to see aliens and shoot them down.  Having colonies etc.Anyway the price is really cheap and I am happy to pay that.I only have one worry, and that is hearing stuff about the developer I have heard ALL bad stuff but so far everything is good..... I think and hope.			"

								This game has huge potential, which I'm fairly confident at this point, it will never meet.  If the game performed and worked as intented, it would be one of the best games I have ever played, but it doesn't, and I'm failry certain it never will.I just went back to the game after shelving it for about 10 months, with some hope that things would have at least improved somewhat.  In about 20-30 minutes of play time, I ran into about a half dozen extremely frustrating bugs while playing on a private dedicated server.  The thing is, most of the issues I ran into are for the most part the same issues the game had when I first played it 2 years ago, the ones that haven't been around that long have still been around for many months without fixes.  These devs just don't seem capable of fixing things.  They haven't been able to get basic gameplay systems and mechanics to any sort of stable state.  I expect a game in early access to have bugs, but I also expect the devs to work on fixing them and at least make some progress.A game like this really shines in multi-player, and gets old really quickly while playing it by yourself.  If I only played single player, I could probably avoid some of the issues I ran into, but it would be a medocre gameplay experience at best while playing by myself.Edit:  The most furstrating part about this game has been watching week by week, and month after month as ""Improvements and Bugfixes"" patches are released, yet all the same substantial issues still exist that where there one or two years ago.

During an online gameplay you experience some lags, Actually a lot of lag. Example : When you trying to put some Building block on a ship or a station , something it isn't placeable, you might need to wait sometime until it worked again, Me personally had experience this issue in all the server I played. Hope the dev can fix and focus on this issue. This is not an issue in Singleplayer.			"

								This game is magnificent. With weekly updates and a development team that really cares about what the players want, few can compare.A short list of things you can do:=========================* Build a space fairing bohemoth of a vessel to explore the universe.* Build space stations to replicate any sci-fi metropolis of your dreams.* Build a small ship that can even take a family of 4. (But you don't have one... because you're in space...)* Become the CEO of a space mining conglomerate with a legion of AI programmable drones at your disposal (Once you've built them of course).* Have a soul searching journey into the depths of space. (Hans Zimmer track not included)* Colonise an asteroid* Colonise a moon* Colonise a Planet!* Have a bundu bash on said moon or planet. (Seriously these things are huge! Planets have an average diameter of 120 km.)* Build a fort and protect it against invading AI like pirates or sabiroids.* Enjoy the vistas of these different worlds* Settle down on your favorite space rock.* Make a weapon using gravity generators and artificial mass blocks.* Play multiplayer with your friends so you can build, explore, raid and fight pirates together.* Go on servers and enjoy the different game setups available.* Torment your friends with the gravity weapon you made.* Lose your friends...* And find them again using a well built communication relay. (Once you've built that as well)* Just kidding I still haven't found them, I just like to fly around in my intergalactic space ship (I designed it myself. Let me show some of the different lengths of wire I used.)* Write a review to praise it's ingenuity. (Just like I did right now, yay)This isn't for the faint-of-hearted when it comes to sandbox games though, but the final payoff with any project is always awe-inspiring.Also with the addition of planets as well as other goodies like a thriving modding community, you can customize your game according to your taste.This game isn't a virtual world, it's a virtual universe!Honestly, buy this game, get your friends to buy it too. Space sure is quiet without a familiar voice.If I could give a numeric score it would be the same as the possibilities this game possesses:∞/∞ (Apply L'Hospital... or not)TL;DR - This game is REALLY great, buy it.

								I never write reviews for anything, however I'm gonna have to for SE. Like seriuosly, You owe it to yourself to just buy it. Its Minecraft, Space, and No Mans Sky made better. It can get tedious to begin with, boring per se, but if you prevail and try each time you build a ship, it can become one hell of an amazing game. The devs give you an update every week, usually on a Thursday. Yes it may not be always new content, but at least they are active, and are still trying hard to make the game better. You can build anything you can imagine, within game limits, and the workshop for the game is THE BEST. The amount of mods, and community created ships is literally insane, the multiplayer although buggy is hilarious, and is fun when you are OP and rek your friends.Honestly I cannot recommend this game enough, and don't get why people have so much stick to the bugs. They will be fixed, and whilst you wait, it is stupidly fun to play. I rate this game very stronk.Also better than No Mans Sky.			"

								 As of this writing, no. It's a glorified tech demo. A very well done tech demo, but nothing more. If you think I'm being harsh, let me explain. First of all, there's very little to actually do. Planets are an unfinished, glitchy feature with lots of half-baked ideas shoved into them. Ship to ship combat is... There, but there's no real point to it. There's no auto-repair systems and the structure of your ship is tinfoil, so unless you're fighting in creative (You know, being a child smashing his toys together) you'll spend maybe a minute trying to shred an enemy and the next two hours patching holes in your hull and replacing damaged equipment. True, there is survival, and early game survival is fun, but sooner or later one of two things will happen. If you're playing with the enemies disabled, you will struggle to find power and oxygen. Resource managment is gonna be difficult. A minor mistake in piloting a mining ship will cost you dearly. It's actually pretty tense and you'll have to think about how to survive... But then you'll tip. You'll build a bigger base, then a bigger ship, and you'll feel accomplished. Then you'll upscale again. Then again. Then again. Resources are no longer an issue, so it now becomes a case study in how much of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥welding every single hull plate of a capital ship can be. If you're brave enough to play with enemies on, you will die. The resources required to make even small arms ammunition are scarce. Very scarce. Every time I've ever played I built building-sized mining vessels before I had bullets for my rifle. That might actually be an interesting choice if the enemies appeared when you met some abitrary condition, but they don't. If you're in space, a big Argevantis cruiser is gonna show up and raze everything you spent hours building because there's no way you can adequately defend yourself against it. If you're on planets, have fun, because space spiders and cyberhounds are going to rip you a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as soon as you land. ""But I'll join a cooperative ser-"" No you won't. In a game as horifically glitchy as this, you won't play with more than 2 or 3 friends at a time. Physics has always been SEs biggest failing, and though they've made major strides there's still a very long way to go. Even if you could find one, there's no asset protection outside of a big gun. If you didn't play for 3 weeks with no sleep and build a deathstar, someone is going to come along and take everything from you. While I'm thinking of Physics, Spacecraft design is all art and no science. If you've played KSP, Robocraft, Gmod, or any similar games, you know the challenge of balacing your CoM and CoT. You know that long ships have high rotational inertia, but thrusters mounted further from your center of mass generate more torque. There's a million different engineering tradeoffs you can explore. Space engineers has... None of this. Rotation is handled exclusively by gyros, so even if you try to build manuvering thrusters they will do nothing. The physics engine simply cannot comprehend that applying thrust on unbalanced vectors will impart a rotation. The only engineering challenge you face is ""But how much of this crap can I cram onto a ship?"" That and how much of your ship to dedicate to solid blocks of metal to absorb incoming fire. Above all else, the Dev team seem to has no idea what to do. They go with the fist draft of an idea and almost never look back. Sometimes they get an idea right, like with Hydrogen thrusters. Thrusters that need fuel instead of power were a long requested feature, and people were happy when they were released. I was too, because I figured I could use them to make smaller and lighter ships - surely a fuel tank and a few thrusters is lighter than a big heavy nuclear reactor. Well, we were happy until we found out even sparing use of thrusters drained their fuel reserves in mere seconds. They had much better thrust, but at mindbendingly low effeciency. So low, in fact, that Keen immediately patched them to something more reasonable. They're still stupidly ineffecient - a Mercury/Redstone rocket from the 50s has preformance far superior to anything ingame - but at least you could fly for a minute or two instead of 15 seconds. Cyberhounds are the exact opposite end of the spectrum. Nobody wanted self-destructing bomb dogs that bring death and ruination upon any planetary base, but we got them. I could rant like this all day, so here's one final point. It's just not a very pretty game. Starmade might be basic but its graphics are far more polished. It does a very, very good job with what it has. Space Engineers has a DX11 powered rendering engine with 1999 level texturing and modeling work. Hell, Shores of Hazeron and Homeworld 1 more visually pleasing than this. Don't buy this game. Not now, anyway. It has a very, very long way to go and you're only gonna burn yourself out on an incomplete product. Maybe in six months they'll have addressed all these issues.			"

Early Access Review
								My rule is never buy early access games. Only exception is beta versions. Its kind of like flushing your loved ones down the toilet. Yes, I was talking about money. Well, i blame steam sales. Actually, never buy early access games, unless steam sales, and pricing under 10 bucks.After barely five hours......Like most people here, I really like what i see. Even though some may find it tideous, the game makes you WANT to build and explore. And with the co-op with friends or anyone, it makes up for a rather exciting game. If this game also get a broader and more intriguing npc factions, wildlife with both grass eaters and predators, heck maybe even fishes....it could become a great game indeed. It certainly have potential. Forget then about all those silly zombie survival games that also never vill be finished....There seems to be huge graphichs issues with this game. At 1920 x 1080, with a Radeon HD 7870, I have to put everything to low, to have liveable framerates. Says a lot about this game, considering its not exactely high fiedlity in graphics. As a comparison, Battlefield 4 plays with everything on high at 2560 x 1440 or something like that. Also there seem to be a bug with saving game? Game only saved when i use ""Save as"". Like most early access games, I wouldnt exactely bet on them to finish it. But atleast I hope they iron out excisting bugs.I recomend this game if you dont mind to flush you loved ones down the toilet. Or if its on steam sales for max 10 bucks. Else, like always, dont waste money.			"

Early Access Review
								Space Engineers is decent if you want to get creative by building ships or pass the time by mining resources, but it has numerous fallthroughs that will likely never be worked on. The game doesn't come together in the way that it should. Animations are clunky, optimization and perfmormance are pretty bad, glitches are very common, and the game structure itself isn't anywhere near user-friendly.This game cannot be defended by claiming that it's early access. The devs have had plenty of time to polish the weaker aspects of the game, yet seem to lack the insight or skill to address and solve these issues. Instead, their ambition as game developers pushes them to mash in more half-functioning or barely relevant content, which often overcomplicates the game and adds numerous bugs. Keen Software House has bit off more than they can chew, and it shows when they try to conquer something like planets and AI. The ""monsters"" are of absolute amateur quality, the planet rendering is atrocious, and everything comes off as awkward. The world design is horrific, in my opinion. The aesthetics of the planets are very out of place, not to mention the overbearing lack of purpose. The game suffers from what many open world games like this do, and that is the extreme lack of feeling like there's anything the player actually -has- to do. TL;DR The game feels empty. It's nice for the first few hours, but the dark underbelly of Space Engineers reveals that it is simply a hollow, awkwardly assembled shell of an amazing idea. I would not recommend it.			"

								The game is great, and while I'd like to recommend it, I got it for Multiplayer, and multiplayer is pretty much unplayable becasue the SE development team doesn't see multiplayer as a priority. Its very buggy and they refuse to fix it. It also anoys me that the CEO of the company took the funding for SE and created and funded 2 more unrelated companies with it. The original SE development team is now split across 3 companies, so SE doesn't get the love it once did, and users are basicly ignored on the keen software forums.			"

								Good luck playing if you assinged windows key to a control by accident.Good luck playing LAN with your friends it never spawns you next to them.Good luck landing on a planet you can't go below 100 meters per on ships when ur landing them and u cant go forward only down which is the gravity of the planet.After over an hour of trying to do at least some ♥♥♥♥ing miniscule thing in this god damn game all I did was crash my ship over and over again and I never ♥♥♥♥ing made it to my friends base.  I got really close one time, really really close.  You know what happened?  He ♥♥♥♥ing walked into me and I died HE ♥♥♥♥ING WALKED INTO METhe only reason I reinstalled this stupid game is to play it with friends obviously I can't do that			"

								Ok so I made a review a while back and it was negative and this one is too, but I have my reasons. I have a computer that surpass the requirements for this game. In fact I used to be able to play it on my crappy HP laptop. I know that I don't have very ,any hours on it, but thats becuase there wasn't much in the game when I could play it. I love the concept and the gameplay, but it just runs so poorly. If the game was actually playable then I would play this game sooooo much. I would contribute to the modding community too, but I can't. So I'm begging you to please fix this game for me and all the other players out there. Because there are so many more problems than just the optimization			"

It was neglected and poorly managed for the past 6 months and the game has suffered.The devs appear to be making a serious attempt to get Space Engineers back on track, and when they do I will change my review to positive.

								Stay far away unless you are content to build alone in creative mode only.I purchased this game June 2014.  As of this writing, that was 1 1/2 years ago.  The game is so bugged now that I cannot even stomach launching it any more.  Let me explain..I have a deep love for the concept and great hope that KSH can pull this game together.  When I first purchased it, I played solo survival for a month and had a blast.  I then moved on to survival multiplayer PvP and had some of the most thrilling fulfilling gameplay of any game ever.  I made a dozen new friends, had factions and teams.. what a truly wonderful time.But as time progressed, the Thursday patches became less of a anticipated feature gift and more of plea not to kill the game with crushing bugs.  After 6 months of almost completely killing the multiplayer community, the remaing few of us left in abject sorrow.  We could no longer play the game we loved so much.2015 came and went with dozens upon dozens of new features.  Great for the solo creative crowd, and kudos to KSH for keeping such a brisk pace.  But as 2015 closes, multiplayer is still unplayable.  The few server owners cry on the KSH forum for help just keeping their servers from crashing after 30 minutes.  A whole year and zero progress on MP.I will absolutely return to this game if KSH ever gets MP working.  Until then, it is in the ""what could have been"" category. And I will absolutely never ever purchase another Early Access game.  Developers have no incentive to ever finish the game, release it, and be accountable for its performance.			"

								Space Engineers was by far the most interesting, pleasurable and pleasing to the eyes game I had ever played. I had a good month and a half of fun. Now however, with the cyber hounds everywhere, this game is no longer playable. It never fails, someone can always take something good and destroy it.  I am very disappointed. On second thought... I could not stay away from this amazing game for very long. So I must in fact think it's pretty darn fantastic!			"

								Probably the best sandbox game I have ever played.  Space Engineers is realistic on almost every level. The graphics, the physics, the construction and of course the collisions, have just the right amount of reallity that creates an amazing experience.  Updates are another great thing, new content is added every week for just about as long as the game has been around and they seem like they are focused on the requests of the players. But of course, the game has its drawbacks, exploration is pointless, there is asolutley nothing other than a handful of static asteriods in the center of the map and thats about it. Also there is the classic ""whats the point?"" feeling that sanbox games generally have, which leads to a pretty boring single player.   However I definitly recommend this game, even if you only play on single player.			"

								Space Engineers is not minecraft in space. Ok so now that we have that out of they way, Space Engineers is a great game if you want to create ships with guns and blow stuff up. In its current state the multiplayer is playable but sometimes abit buggy, but that is to be expected from an alpha state. The game offers two modes, Creative and Survival. In creative mode you can build what ever you want with no need to collect resources, this is good if you just want to build some wonderfull ships. The Survival mode is just what its name suggests, unlike Creative mode you have to actually mine resources to build parts in this mode. In my personal opinion Survival mode is best played with friends as playing it alone can become boring very fast, but with friends it is very enjoyable and fun. The game is updated every Thursday which is nice as it is something to look forward to. In final review I would give this game in its current state a 8.9/10, it would have been a 10 if not for some multiplayer problems, but as I said the game is updated regually so prehaps these issues will be fixed soon.I hope this review was helpfull.

								Build your own space ship. Arm your space ship. Take your space ship to battle. Build a space station to store your space ship. This game's survival mode really makes you work for it and every little thing you own is precious to you. If someone destroys or takes over your space station, you wish you'd have the power of an Imperial Star Destroyer fleet to dispose your enemies.Or perhaps why not build a Death Star? Build tons of turrets on it and activate them. Anyone who goes near your space station is Bantha poodoo. Create a clan...no....create a Federation or an Empire or an Alliance or a Separatist movement. Then go to war!  "

								The most fun i've had playing a game in a really long time. Make sure to set all the settings to max if you get bored easily. At 1x speed it can quickly turn into an eve online snorefest.. but at 10x it really picks up. You don't need a lot of players on a server to be fun as 1v1 combat is enjoyable. The crafting and destructable environment / physics / graphics are an amazing addition to a block building game.The game is in alpha so there are bugs and a bit of sync issues on multiplayer, but avoidable. The game updates every thursday on the dot, and the devs interact and listen to what the players want. A must have game if you have ever played Kerbal/Eve Online/Minecraft.			"

								The only thing that would make me discourage people from getting this game is if I know that the person gets dizzy and sick easily. Yes, you will be spinning and turning and whirling in space trying to find what you just looked away from a minute ago. Mastering your jetpack can take some time depending on how used to this kind of stuff you are.Other than that, if you like sandbox games and would like to take things to the airless, zero gravity zone, this is the game for you.Each update added very interesting things, and this pattern is making it difficult to not wish for more stuff sooner.

								In its Alpha stages the game is already cool for a few hours, but can get boring rather fast because there is not much to do yet in my opinion. It requires some patience due to its Early Access business model. It has a great deal of potential at being a nemesis to Minecraft for space exploration with better graphics, but will seemingly require a great deal of work to reach that status. You have multiple scenarios at your disposal, but in each, it is basically the same at the moment; you need to find Uranium as fast as you can while at the same time save your given energy in the games various styles of survival beginnings.There is a multiplayer mode that is not yet in the condition it should be but it is getting there slowly but surely. Things take time, of course. Dedicated servers seem to be a step for the developers in the near future so players can build huge things with their friends...and destroy them.A decently high computer is required. Mine is sort of lower mid range at the moment and there are some graphical bugs due to that and presently multiplayer seems to me impossible to play. Like I said though, if you are a player who enjoys going out and gathering resource to build a huge space station or some ships to your exact liking with not-so-many-yet building parts yet then this is a game for you. I can't wait until it has AI to fight off however, and a faster way of moving the high amount of resources you mine from asteroids into processing and storage. It has weapons and blocks designed for item transport but it isn't finished yet due to, again, the Early Access model. It's still an Alpha build and for that, is damn good already.In the end, a game with a great deal of potential. If you enjoy idea of ""survival in space"" then this is for you for sure.			"

								It's a diamond in the rough. Right now, Space Engineers is riddled with bugs and other inconsistencies but it has the potential to be a game that splits the minecraft community. It's single defining feature is that the things you create are functional. In other creative games creativity is the sole motivator but Space Engineers has unlimited potential for ship contruction and combat. I'd highly recommend buying this game now before they raise it's price when it's out of alpha.			"

								This game is insanely big in it's concept. Almost anything you can think of is right here in this game regarding space. Space ships? Check. Travel between planets or around planets? Check. Work in space? Check. Build space stations, ships (from attack ships to resource ships)? Check. An intricate power supply system or conveyor belts with control panels? Check. Loads of tools to work and craft with? Check. This game can be lotus for the space fans.Space Engineers gameplay is pretty decent at the moment. The movement and frame rate is smooth but some major lag can appear in certain servers if you're playing online. All essential movements are here from sprinting, jumping and crouching. Additional features include the ability to turn off inertial dampeners, a flashlight and activate a jet pack which allows the player to move freely in all three axis. The jet pack doesn't use any fuel at the moment unless you're playing in a certain mode. Either way, I like having the ability to move around and craft without worrying if I can get to the top of the structure. The player may also zoom in the camera as they please and may even play in first person mode. Smaller ships are piloted in first person mode while larger ships are only seen from 3rd person (as you will move about in larger ships). Ships are also equipped with a flash-light ability by pressing L.Building is relatively simple in game but can take a bit of time to properly master and get what you want. The basic building unit in Space Engineers is blocks. Blocks can be cosmetically small, large, rounded and edged. The player doesn't simply build blocks and then have a ship. Power supplies (that come in blocks), doors, antennas, cockpit, connectors, control panels, conveyors, windows, seats and even guns can be added. The player will need to build a power supply for any vehicle or air unit they plan to build. Engineers can also build ground units and stations using any combination of block they please. Power is transferred through blocks once they are touching so there isn't a need to become an electrician and run wire. Some useful key shortcuts are ctrl+p (to pick a color), shift+p (to set a color to selected block), ctrl+mouse1 (hold) to place multiple blocks in a straight line and ctrl+shift+mouse1(hold) to place multiple blocks on a plane. There are currently two game modes in Space Engineers : survival and creative. Survival mode requires players to collect components/materials to construct objects. Welding also takes a lot more time in this mode. If a player dies, there is a good chance (unless the material is stored), that the material on the player will be lost. To make it even more difficult, every space suit in this mode is given a certain amount of life support. The player will need to recharge or face the ultimate consequence of not breathing oxygen. Creative mode allows the player to respawn as many times as they want without losing any of their material. Moreover, this mode allows players to build as much as they want for no cost. These blocks are also created instantly and do not need to be welded or pre-made. In either mode, random enemies can attack the player. Players do not need to worry about energy/oxygen/hydrogen levels in this mode.When I mean this game is big, it's quite big. It will take some time to learn and definitely take some time to create something significant. Players can be placed in different settings such as earthly, martian, alien, moon or even asteroids to begin building their legacy. There are scenarios to choose from in which will put the player in all sorts of scenarios. Some scenarios will come with already made stations while in others you may start with extremely minimal parts. Players will want to equip their starships (or themselves) with some fire power before exploring the wilderness. Some ship weapons include gatling guns and turrets, rocket launchers, missile turrets and warheads. Hand-held weapons are slightly limited at the moment but include an automatic rifle, a grinder and a hand drill.Graphics are pretty good at the moment but sometimes have an occasional hiccup. It's nothing game-breaking or anything but is noticeable.Overall, it's a pretty good game and the fact it's still early access and being updated is fantastic. It's a BIG game though and would recommend patience while playing. I'm very impatient myself and like simply jumping in the game and playing. This is possible but you'll catch yourself asking ""how do I do..."" a few times while looking up information on the internet. There is a good tutorial that will help the player discover how to properly master the game. There is still a lot that can be added to this game to make it better (like a sumo mode)!!! Some may find it's appeal fun for the first 5-10 hours then look the other way while others may indulge in such a space adventure. It's all up to the creativity of the player to determine their entertainment.EARLY ACCESS RATING : 7/10ScreenShots : (to come)[url][/url]			"

								My Review is about the early Access version of Space Engineers.Since its in this phase i do not want to go into details about if the game is fun or not. There are a lot of youtube videos to show the actual gameplay.( for me it is one of the best survival games out there at the moment).It is not because of the content , but more about how the developer is able to show us how early access should be.As a player, you get weekly updates ( most of the time at thursday) , which is not only content , they actually fix existing bugs and are very active in the community and also involve the community like no early access game out there ( see future patches,bugfixing etc.)If you want to see how early access should work and given that you are intrested in seeing a game getting better and better, this game is a must have.I saw a lot of people saying its minecraft on hardmode. this is not the case. You can play it on a hard difficulity (survival realistic) , yet it offers you some options to tune the amount of work needed for crafting and also offers you a creative mode where you can do whatever you want to do.TL,DR : Buy it , you wont be disappointed			"

8/10A really great game about building beautiful ships. AND THEN CRASH 'EMNo, but seriously, this game is awesome!Pros:- often updated- useful updates- enough shapes to build nice space ships, big or small- quite balanced CPU usageCons:- now in early access a bit lonely- the background looks meh, but can be changed through a ton of mods at least- light causes heavy lags (especially on those big ships you find in the workshop)...but light effects very likely cause lags =SSo I still think, really buy this game, give it a try. The price is really worth it, it's fun, you can get creative, and its potential seems to be used by the developers of this game very well. They don't add some crap nobody needs, but they add what really helps the game getting completed one day.			"

								I like this game, I really do but I can't recommend this game. Mainly cause it runs like trash. Sure it's cool to make your own space ship and fly around space smashing it into things, but it's very fun when you have to restart the game multiple times. So in the end I'd say wait for this game to not run like garbage it's really fun just annoying having to deal with all these bugs.			"

It works much like Minecraft and Starmade in that you can fully build ships with parts at your disposal and has a lot of promise, but is still early in development.

								2 years in and they STILL can't make it JUST WORK.Unfortunately I have to side with those suggesting that you carefully consider before buying.  At this point it seems to me:1. there are too many bugs left in, or added via new releases2. have no idea when / if will leave early access and be bugless and finished3. mining and building in it is fun and certainly the pinnacle of what it offers now when the bugs don't send you awry, but it seems Empyrion has quickly eclipsed it in playability if you want to build things like hover vehicles, spacecraft and base stations and is less buggy, or, if you want space flight, combat, trading, mission objectives with less construction and instead can live with just customizing space vehicles as you pick and choose your way through a wide variety of spacecarft with customizable components and optimizations for different ways of playing, Elite Dangerous is way ahead and Star Citizen is supposed to be on our side of the horizon this year.So, at this point Elite Dangerous has stolen what time I might have continued to put into SE to get my outer space Star Trek fix and it's hard imagining they catch up to reach a level of playability that's more fun than the competition is already at.At a minimum buy it on SALE and don't pay full price...

The devs adds new features and bugfixes on a weekly basis and the community is active. This game if very close to minecraft, so if you are looking for a strong story telling, this game may not be right for you.

								I cannot recommend this game at its current stage. Unless you build something that doesn't move (no pistons or rotors), or only ever play single player, your creation will break immediately or at some point down the road. Creative is great fun since every time something breaks you don't need to worry about resources having been lost due to bugs and desynchronizations, you just build a new one. There still isn't a whole lot to DO in the game though, just lots to look at. Planets are a huge step forward though.			"

								In space engineers, you take control of a Space engineer in the middle of an asteroid belt with no way to leave, despite having multiple spacecraft around him to pilot. The goal in the engineer's mind is unknown, but it likely has to do with attempting to create the Enterprise, or Star Destroyer. The engineer has two ways to accomplish this. He can either manually mine ores and resources using his drill and spacecraft, or he can use his powers of mind control to conjure up entire ships out of nothing. When he tries to mine things using drills, his drill has an invariably long lifetime, meanwhile he must charge himself every five minutes or so, or he risks dying of being tired. As he constructs his ship, he uses parts built by an assembler, which uses robots to assemble various refined ores into complex parts. He then uses various parts to construct spacecraft while welding in an inconsistent manner, which may explain why his ships usually fall apart when shaked. When he uses his magic, however, he can remain awake forever without negative consequences.However, despite all the magic said engineer can use, he cannot stop a small meteor from blowing up his spacecraft. The meteor storm is the least of his worries, however. He must be on constant lookout to not knock his ship about before he has installed all necessary systems, or he risks it falling endlessly into the void. He must also be careful not to cut his ship in half, since engineers cannot understand the concept of welding two halves of a ship together without special ""merge blocks"". You can however, create a space station that does not move, no matter what, with no visible means of keeping itself in postition, but again, magic.Space Engineers also offers a heightened challenge, titled, ""Cram more cool-looking sci-fi junk into your ship"", under the guise of the steam workshop. Despite all attempts, no one has successfully crammed enough sci-fi into their ship.The engineers also use this ""workshop"" as a way to teleport to another world someone has created, and admire their works, before attempting to destroy them through all means possible, before giving a sort of rating based on Facebook.

								Note: While I do recommend this game you should be aware of the following problems:The game developer (Keen Software House) leaves much to be desired, interaction with the community is in general very poor and they have a habbit of implementing features that are poorly thought out and often untested, normally this would be okay but for some reason they do not have a development branch so player are often forced to deal with game breaking bugs, some of which can take weeks to be resolved, still they do update every Thursday which is a plus even if it's just bug fixes.Performace in the game is very bad, even with a fairly high end machine you can expect problems, planets for example can consume 6GB of memory on low textures, at higher texture settings it's possible to reach 10GB or more which is insane, multiplayer is poorly optimized with frequent crashes on the dedicated server, this is extra annoying since you die if you get disconnected while not inside a cryo chamber, you also need a DirectX 11 card, I'd suggest the GTX 970 at the minimum, performance is significantly better in space.If you like this type of game and have a good PC you may be able to overlook the bugs, it's a lot of fun when everything works and there is a nice variety of mods on the Steam workshop, I'm hopeful these issues will be fixed in the near future but for now you should carefully consider before buying.

								The developers and this game are broken. You will run into the most game breaking and frustrating bugs if you play this. Here is the kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥you will deal with:-The game crashes every single time you play, sometimes 5 minutes in, sometimes an hour in, but it always happens.-There are several blocks you can build that just don't work. Want to make a cool hangar door that hinges open? Use a rotor. Oh wait, too bad they randomly explode for no reason and destroy whatever you worked hard on. Want to build a cool rover like the devs claim you can do? Too bad, the wheels are basically aesthetic and usually end up making your rover fall through the planet and kill you.-Want to build on the planets and make a cool base? Tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ the planets are so poorly optimized that even a mid-high end gaming computer can barely run them.-Using one of the most critical block in the game, landing gear, instantly crashes the game most of the time.-You also can't land ships on planets. The ships will violently shake themselves to death or explodeYou would think the developers would actually make these game ruining bugs a high priority and make their games at least usable instead of cheating their customers out of their money, but nah, instead update the game to add robot dogs that self explode. At this point maybe the game is actually about keeping a ship in one piece for longer than an hour without it crashing or exploding. "

								I have had this game for quite a while now and have been impressed with the steady development.  Updates are frequent and follow a content-bug fix-polish cycle.  New content seems to be prioritised based on what is most missing from the game after listening to player feedback.  The developers clearly have their own vision of the game they are making, but they listen to the audience they have attracted when deciding how best to go about integrating the many necessary elements.Early Access games have something of a bad reputation, but the team behind Space Engineers have behaved with integrity thus far and I definitely feel I have gotten my money's worth of fun already.The game is still clearly not a finished, bug-free, polished product.  However, barring financial considerations, I have no reason to doubt that it will be in time.I want that to happen, so I recommend this game so more people may buy it and the makers are less likely to run out of money and more likely to get a decent reward for behaving admirably.What is the game like itself?  Sort of advanced giant virtual lego in space I suppose.			"

								One of the better ""early access"" games, in that it actual feels like its moving forward and will be finished.  Most will say SE is just ""Minecraft in space"" but not really.  Ship/base building is only half the game with mining/transporting resources need to survive in space make this game fun, even more so when playing CO-OP w/friends.  The new factions/protection are still in progress but from what they have done so far I like were the game is going.  Lastly Steam support for mods is amazing and people have come up with a lot of cool stuff in the short time its been available.  If you like building sims or space games give this game a try.What I'd like to see in the future:-More exploration (expanding space or warping to other pockets of asteroids)-More tools/machines-More ores/resources-More variation of asteroids both in size and amount***8.5/10***			"

Now picture the excitement when you look at the weekly updates that PLANETS had finnally been introduced. It was going to be amazing but when i loaded it up constant lag and took 1 hour to load. oh well i thought after all this was the first day so surely they will optimize it. But month by month it got worse and worse with the RAM requirements actually doubling for playing without planets and despite constant bug fixes and Optimisation. The game today is a sad and depressing shadow of its former glory. If this had been 2 years ago I would have told you to buy it rightaway as a must own but now avoid this game likethe plague until the situation improves however at this rate that may be never.			"

Game have some bugs, but works perfect, no CTD (or only few), runs smooth, FPS without problem on weak old machine. a lot of serwers, Good perfomance on serwers, driling works very good. It was something amazing to create a ships and play with this ships on MP. Becouse it is ALPHA so i say, few bugs oki, they will fix it. We have a ""patch"" every Thursday, and I like it, at the beginning. Now I don't play any more. I stop playing when planets arrive in to game.Now we have a game which is poor optimized, with more bugs. Each of Thursday patch fix one bug, but create 2 new bugs. :(Until planets arrive in to game I was playing on DX9 even when i was able to set dx 11. Planets force you to use DX11!!DX11 looks awfully compared to DX9. I hate play on DX11.DX11 is poorly optimized!! A huge stuttering and low FPSDX11 the colours are awfully, light are ........ !!! Olny shadows are better.We have bugs from the beginning of game, which Devs CANT FIX !!!...I can write about this game a whole wall, but i will write it shortly:- Poor optimization DX11.- DX11 look awfully .- A lots of bug - Huge amount of bugs.- Devs can't fix a bugs form beginning of game. Even if they fix it after 2-3 weeks or more devs make that this bug return.- MP is almost dead ( at the beginning there was a lots of server with better performance).- Planets look not so good with poor performance.- Thursday patches are ""crap"" make more bugs then they fix them.- Drilling, welding will kill good machine, on MP kill serwer. - NPC with ion engines respown on plantes :] - nice boom !!!- New simspeed on MP- MP ENGINE is it a joke- Rotors, pistons, landing gears, merge blocks, and some other bloks don't work properly on MP. - Some bloks can ""kill"" serwer :]+ Still creating of ships is great !!!!!!My recommendation in DON'T BUY THIS GAME. wait until devs fix this game. But in my opinion they will never fix it. My spec are:-I7 4470K-16 GB ram-SSD-Radeon R9 270XMy setting in game - medium .			"

								This game had so much potential, yet it seems like that potential will never be fulfilled by the developers. I bought this game a while ago. It is poorly optimized, the AI is sloppy, and the building is tedious, but the game was ""still early access"" and it ""has so much potential.""Well, many months later, almost no new content has been added and this game is still poorly optimized. Planets were added, but they're extremely buggy and laggy. I've given up hope that the devs will make this game great, which is a shame. It really did have the potential, but instead it plays like a slightly improved version of Masterspace. And Masterspace is a garbage game, so that's not saying much.So, where's the new, meaningful cotent? Where's the optimization? Why are there still so many bugs that still haven't been fixed? Seems like the devs have put this on the backburner ever since planets were added. Don't waste your money, this game is a bad investment.			"

								Space Engineers is a geat game, or at least it was. Today its pretty much dead if you ask me. The game started off well and development really kept the community interested. The major problem is the game was basic at the start so the fact that its terribly optimised really wasnt all that bad even for mid level computers. But they keep adding more and more stuff to an already poor performing game. The game has had a long development cycle at his point and barely playable for a lot of us. Even the most tricked out desktop will run this game fairly badly. Your pretty much hoping for your computers worst performance to be able to run the game smoothly. Rather than fixing any optimisation issues however they continue to add new features and more complex systems to the game making it basically unplayable nowadays. Even a simple sever with a small ship is likely to have framerate issues and generally look graphically bad which to be honest has always been the case. I just wish they would actually think about properly finishing the game instead of just throwing new gimmicks to the player base which is getting smaller by every update. It feels now like the game has fallen into that development abyss and doomed to die slowly and painfully when in reality this was and could have been a great game. Its a great idea after all. Who doesnt want minecraft in space with huge cool looking ships you can build, fly, destroy, salvage etc etc. It an awesome idea but totally dead now. Even building anything moderately big will cause major framerate issues. I enjoyed the time i played this game because i got to enjoy that slightly lighter and ealier build which worked despie all the problems. Nowadays though i dont even bother looking at it anymore because its just sad to watch a game like this run so poorly. If im honest im angry at the developers for really screwing this up soo much. It was even mentioned about an xbox one and possible ps4 port at one point. Just another development failure but not to worry, or at least they shouldnt worry because they already took your money and didnt deliver on the promises. Either way they win.			"

								It's a real shame that this game doesn't work at all on anything below the ""Recommended"" section in System Requirements, because the conept is an awesome one. However, the reality is that this idea has been badly fleshed out.The developers just seem to want to pack on knick-knacky features and ignoring the plethora of bug reports in the forum.Oh, and integrated graphics? Forget it.Overall, I'm not impressed with this and I think I'll be putting my money on a game that seems like it's actually going to leave early access at all.			"

								Pro:+ weekly updates+ infinite space: 500.000.000 kilometers of space to explore in every direction. You can literally never find the border of the 'gameworld' / galaxy. + random encounters with NPC ships+ Aliens (after a 2 year wait), finally alien life is in the gameCon: - Open to griefplay: Work on  each design for 10 hours, in your 150 hour savegame while behind your back some random fool sabotages your desings in 10 seconds. Let your friends in, nobody else. - The weekly updates are too small. A zoom function on a an exising camera block is considered an update ? lol. - Insane learning curve: Will make 95% of your Steam friends turn around and run away screaming. - Insane depth: Infinite possibilities. It's a job, not a game. - PVE: Lack of content. No food. No crops. No anything. You only get to find ores and shoot the odd alien. - No liquids, no water, no oil, only solids.- Optimisation issues: Get a NASA approved PC before installing SE.- blueprint mayhem: The blueprint folder is a knuckledragging primitive system. IF you use it, it will turn into a giant mess very quickly.- script mayhem: Same deal for scripts. Primitive interface to manage scripts. - Maximim speed 110 m/s: This has to do with load timing, still it's very annoying to fly a ship design that can never reach over 110 m/s speed. Even though you are in frictionless space. Ugh just don't think about it. - Apart from a few YouTube people who make a living from building complex designs, I'm not sure people still bother with it. Conclusion: . 1) The game is a fun concept to think about. Infinite space, generated planets, generated asteroids, limitless possibilities. But in practice I can't find anyone with enough patience or inspiration to join me in my game. 2) The game takes too much building time to make it a viable PVP game. build for 20 hours, get destroyed in 2 seconds...The game needs way more PVE content. recipes, plants, aliens, random places to visit. Right now it has none of those. 3) The game defeats itself. You get ore to build a ship, a ship to get ore to build a ship. Then you realize survial mode build ships are garbage so you switch to creative mode and build a perfect ship. Now you switch back to survival mode and can't find a reason to actually spend 10 days to find the resources to  build the ship from the blueprint you've just made in creative mode. End game reached.			"

								20 Dec 2016, still major bugs in multiplayer did keen not rebuild the muliplayer to work better?It is now 12th aug 2016 and still the bugs have not been fixed I can still not play online with friends without masive lag spikes.I have given this game chance after chance to improve, no matter how many times they say this bug or that bug has been fixed it never is. Every time i join a friends game i am faced with bouncing up and down and even falling through planets (a bug that they claim has been fixed) randomly dying just an unplayable game. It is almost as if they don't even test the fixes that they say they have done. I use to love this game when it first came out but now I'm not sure i can even play it anymore.Single player mode seems a lot more stable but that's not why i own the game I don't want to be stuck playing by myself all the time. I can only recommend you buy this game when it is on sale because it really isn't worth £19I wish Steam's refund system was out when i bought this game			"

								UPDATED 2/2015Several months have passed since I purchased Space Engineers. The name of the game is exactly that: the challenge of engineering in space, being able to procure resources on site, and use those resources to become more efficient and defend your creations. Although the game is still in alpha stages, the potential is huge! The developers release updates almost weekly, most of which include new features that change game play and introduce new challenges! I don't want to be cliché and compare it to Minecraft. It's more like LEGOS in space, but you have to survive by creating all of your block from scratch, and procuring resources to keep you alive!Building ships in creative mode shows the potential this game has for creation, especially if you can imagine several people building, mining, and fighting at once. Multi-player AND survival adds a whole new kind of engineering challenge. All weapons exist and work in game, and the use of factions allows for greater organization when playing on MP servers.Space exploration is now enabled, which allows you to travel more than 6 AU's from the center point of the map. 6 AU's is 6x the distance from Earth to the Sun, so it's practically unlimited! The addition of derelict ships and stations is great, especially when you're drifting through space with the default spawn ship and little resources. Cargo ships now shoot back when you approach them, and there is a ""super secret AI project"" in the works.If you've been on the fence about purchasing SE, I wouldn't procrastinate any longer. The more people there are testing and making suggestions to the game, the faster it'll be released in beta, and final forms. Besides, the game is well worth it as it is!Just remember, this game is in ALPHA, which is before BETA, and you will encounter some minor problems than an unfinished game has. I personally have joined the forums at Keen Software House and have been involved in suggested features and bug reports.Pros:- Creative/survival mode- Multiplayer- Ship weapons enabled- Procedural asteroid generation / limitless map- Awesome damage and repair effects- Huge potential- Very fast development/weekly update releasesCons:- It's alpha; if you can deal with the fact that things will change over time (so far for the better), then this isn't a problem for you!

								One of the freshest gaming concepts to come along in years. Take the crafting of Minecraft, the Zero-G insanity of Shattered Horizon and the resource gathering and tech-trees of Starcraft and you've got Space Engineers.The one element that really captured my attention to begin with, was how after mining, I'd have to float above the conveyor belts, drop the ore from my inventory and then that phsyical item would drop into the refinery and I could both hear and watch (through its own inventory screen) as it refined that ore into a usable format.You take the stuff out, select what you want to build then place it and the framework appears.. you then pull out your welder and get to work, eventually your object will be fully formed. Throw in co-op, meteor showers and the incredible ability to build and colour your own moving spacecraft and this is just an endless experience.Hit me up, I need a co-op partner!			"

								Space Engineers is probably my most favorite game at the moment. It allows you to set your imagination free, build any kind of ship you can imagine, and even make them usable. After you make the ship, you can smash into some asteroids and witness some of the most top-notch destruction physics I've ever seen. Remember, this game is only in alpha, so you're going to see some bugs, and a lot of the things that have been promised for the game hasn't been added in yet.I honestly think that this game completely lives up to its price tag, and more.

								Space Engineers is one of those games for those who love to build things. It makes itself unique from its terrestrial counterparts in that you build everything in the weigthlessness of outerspace. Space Engineers strikes a great balance between realistic and fun. The resource system gives good meaning to what you do;collecting resources isnt as easy as punching a tree you'll either need to go out and drill it in zero-g (not easy) then refine it at your base (if you've a refinery and fuel to run it.) However attachments like the rocket launcher and placeable warhead make for some great sandbox fun.I will say my favorite part of Space Engineers has to be the damage system; things look awesome when you wreck them together. That coupled with the physics system.. is a match made in heaven. You will immediately know if your ship is missing somthing on its maiden voyage as it will hurdle out into space or charge wrecklessly into your space station. It's a blast.Best building game I've played so far in my life and I have played a lot of minecraft.			"

								Decided to remake my review of this game, since a lot of stuff has been changed.So, what the♥♥♥♥♥♥is Space Engineers? Another Sandbox game. It's pretty much what anyone wants it to be. You can build ships as you deside to do so, make space-stations, mine minerals, make weapons, annihilate other players, you name it.In creative, you can pretty much build whatever you want, and test your creations with infinite materials. In survival, you start with almost nothing, and you have to get everything working with your own hands. You can either do this alone, or with friends, but really guys, games like these can get boring really fast if you don't get friends to play with. Things are added constantly, and the Devs actually hear what the players say, and add things that we all suggest. Of all the ""Early Access"" games on Steam, I would say this is the most active one. To be fair, it's not an Alpha anymore, more like a Beta.The game runs smoothly unless you do crazy stuff like crashing multiple large ships into each other, or a big fight between 15 or more players, each one with their own ship. Lag does happen at times in multiplayer, but anyone can make host their own server, so it's mainly the host fault. There are some griefing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s already in the game, these things happen, that's why the Devs will add some sort of ""Faction"" thingy, so groups of friends can go together, with their own big♥♥♥♥♥ship, and stuff like that. Like I said, playing alone is kinda boring, specially because you will be alone if some dumbass wants to destroy and take your stuff. Even though, it doesn't always happen, and you can set your parties to be private, or just for your friends. Also, in most servers (and in most parties, and events), people just set two teams, build their own ships, and have fun killing each other. I've been in 3 of those battles, and I can tell you, it's fun as ♥♥♥♥. Specially when you're the captain in the biggest ship of the team, trying to command your team to victory, while giving orders using Skype. Yeah, there's no communications ingame yet. That sucks.The game is quite fun already, but still, if you want to enjoy it to the fullest, get some friends to play. If not, you should wait for a sale or price drop in a Steam-event. But be aware: The base price of the game will only rise for now on.			"

								17.06.2015One of the gratest game ever created. It is a minecraft in space but with extended mechanics, physics and good graphics. Still under development, weekly updates make that we discover this game again and again. This game is recomended for engineers, roboticians, players who want something more than stupid mindless warfare, or just for those who want create simple things also. You can create spaceships with several functions, programming language is provided into game but is not necessary. This game everyone can play. Creating scripts, logic gates makes your creation alive. I've playing this game for years and still cant be bored. Space Engineers are still under development.-------------------------------------------------------------3.08.2016For 1,5 years only one update with new content. Devs are fooling arround, catching their own tail. Same bugs since 2 years. New models, features and other stuff that they were teasing more than a year ago, felt into the void of oblivion. They claim that there are 14 people developing game + 7 working on engine. With overall timeline it seems that only one lazy person is making any updates. Roadmap for the game is for next 50 years in this ""developing"" speed. Game is unplayable without mods and second hand - using mods is suicide. 1 update can ruin everything (What happened with DX11 support - it could be avoided with one additional script, but they didnt.). Past few updates devs are reversing updated content (like disabling by default pressurization). Still missing most basic blocks.Im also working on a game and im telling You that in one week one person can do more than 1 year develop whole team in KSH.Summary: game develop is dead, weekly ""updates"" are only illusion. Same thing with another KSH title: Medieval Engineers.			"

You can do that in survival mode though you need all the resources to make that and that can be a bit of a pain.There are astroids in space and you get resources such as uranium, gold, nickel, iron and more.I recommend this game to everyone who loves space and spending time to make huge ships and get the top score.I give this game 99.9/100 "

Say goodbye to Minecraft-in-space sandbox games.Space Engineers is, in my opinion, a masterpiece and, while still under development, is most definitely worth your time and money if you're in to the creative sandbox 'genre.'As of now, I won't criticize it too heavily since it is still in Early Access. However, I will review the general components of the game:Graphics: The realistic graphical style of the game is quite fitting and very easy to look at, boasting a ton of high-quality textures. The lighting is also very well done.Sound: The sound design is pretty solid, even though not all of it has been implemented. Although, the music soundtracks are very engaging and fitting. If the game had its own official OST, I would buy it personally.Gameplay Mechanics: What's currently presented is quite impressive. However, there are some hiccups. As this is an Early Access game, you will most likely find bugs, glitches, and generally unfinished mechanics as you play. Once again, keep in mind that this game is still a WIP.Multiplayer/Optimization: Now this is where the game currently falls short. The lag in multiplayer can become unbearable. Same can be said on singleplayer, although it is much less severe. Both instances of dropped framerate, both in MP and SP, are usually caused by either(or both) how many objects are in the world or the host's connection. Thankfully, they have added dedicated servers, but they are still a WIP. With this kind of framerate issue, it is nearly impossible to have large-scale projects with you and/or your friends without a hint of dropped framerate. While the devs are working vigorously to optimize the game as a whole, it is probably a category of the game that won't be perfected for a while.Replayability: This is something I really don't need to go into. It's a SANDBOX game! It only ever ends when you stop playing it entirely, and since there are essentially limitless things to do, there's an infinite amount of replayability.While the game does suffer from optimization issues and unfinished mechanics, remember that this game is still in Early Access. It's not the final product.With that said, here's my take on the rating system based on the game's current state: Graphics: 8/10Sound: 7/10Gameplay: 7/10Optimization: 4.5/10Replayability: 10/10Overall rating: 7/10, a solid sandbox title, especially for the price of $20.00. However, this rating could go up or down in the future. As this is an Early Access title, this rating is based on what the game is like now, not on how it will be in the future. I have high hopes for Space Engineers, and I hope it is all the Devs and the fans want it to be when it is released as a final product.			"

								Normally I'm not an early-acess type of person, but I saw the developers of this game are EXTREMELY competent and consistent with a schedule of weekly updates every thursday which include new features and bugfixes.I'm happy with the game's current direction really. The developers enabling modding support was a really smart move on their part because modding communities often contribute fantastic gameplay and features (much like Garry's Mod!). Gameplay-wise the game is just a sandbox survival with a main focus on construction and resourse gathering. For anyone to have more of an experience of that they need to roleplay or create their own sub-games.What I'd like to see now is different game-modes and less focus on construction/manipulation. Even something simple like a Science Unlocking system would work, or more random events like direlect space stations with aliens in them to explore (and explode!)The game is going a great direction, is plenty of fun to mess around in, however can get quite boring over time if you're playing by yourself in survival.

Early Access Review
								Ahhh, Tricky review again. I love this game but can't recommend it yet.The game mechanics are simply great and that allowed me to spend quite some time in the solo game, though, as soon as you hit the multi player game... it becomes a nightmare.Let's start from the beginning.You've got 2 modes: Creative and survival.But also Solo game and multi player. They both differ greatly in terms of playing experience.As I enjoy the challenge, I always play in Survival where all the game mechanics are in place.Maps:It's absolutely great that you can choose between different environments for your survival.Choose between an asteroid field or a star system and you will have to fight very different issues.The asteroid field will force you to wander from asteroid to asteroid with your space suit that has limited oxygen and energy supply... so... it will be hard.But this is absolutely great as you can engineer your way through most of the problems with tons of solutions.- Build a tiny transport ship to resupply yourself and put your ore in it maybe ? Oh... you forgot that the ore was weighting a lot and your thrusters are so weak that you need 2 minutes to stop ? ah well, if you didn't explode your ship, maybe go back to the drawing board ?- Build a driller ship ? so easy to eat the asteroid without having to collect stone by stone- Transport your platform anchored in an asteroid in a huge barge that will bring your production to the resources and not the opposite way around ?- Oh your platform is a bit too huge to rework ? Well, just build a welder ship !You chose the survival on a planet ? Well... first learn that the mechanics with the air and gravity are a bit differentThen, learn that even if oxygen is not a problem anymore, the local animals might be an even greater pain.Great features:- The ore- The ease of construction (if you have the resources of course)- Flight and ship creations- Moving parts and well thought docking abilities- Very smart conveyor system for resources, including filters- Gravity generator and Newtonian movements, though physics are approximated.- Realistic demolitions / crashes (though... see CONS related to that)- Blueprints that allow you to save and copy items- The really beautiful planets and seamless transitions with space- Oxygen pumps/generators and pressurised structures.Game killers:- The weakness of the parts in general. I kinda love the fact that you can destroy a landing gear because you landed... HOW DARE YOU LAND ! You'd better use the wheels as landing gear instead (as they can't be used for wheeling purposes anyway...see further down)- The deadly ""I'm a thruster and I will stop working because I just decided to"" that will basically destroy your ships on planets due to gravity- The wonky wheels that are so bugged that your vehicle will bounce in the air and flip every 2 minutes. Which is actually a pretty fun problem to solve in itself as you'll have to engineer you out of this situation again.- Characters getting stuck everywhere. HOW DARE YOU JUMP ON A VEHICLE !- The elastic effect : sometimes you think you are somewhere but the game never let you go at this place at the first time and you will feel some kind of elastic force preventing you from going further from your real position. very very annoying as any stair or corner will trigger that problem- Similarly to the above, you think you were welding an object...but...remember, you are not where you think you are ! therefore you can't be welding. Basically you can be welding and not at the same time hence why I called my welder Schroedinger- The steel nibbling wolves. Yep, you heard me. On planets, wolves will spawn once in a while which is great for the survival aspect... though... they are light-speed demons, first, and then they will literally nibble whatever metallic structure that is touching the ground... and believe me, they've got a fierce appetite. This is killing the survival as the turrets are kinda inefficient and they destroy rare resources.- The incredibly annoying collisions. whatever design you make, the slighest proximity of another cube (its edge, its corner or its face) will provoke a grip that will soon lead to a very spectacular explosion of your structure soon. It ruins the building experience of mechanisms as you can't really see what is happening. The collision blocks are often not corresponding to what you see.- The air tightness is incredibly painful too. Some blocks are strangely configured and even if they look like sealing your ship, they don't, and your cockpit will never get pressurised.Minor things they could improve in the future:- more parts because you always need more- More dynamic events (not necessarily deadly) like missions with rewards- elastic or spring parts that would allow more flexibility in your parts- allow lifts in shafts as it destroys the structure when you do that nowI have to admit they made a great leap forward recently since I played the game for the first time. The multi-player is now kinda playable but still so irritating.Globally the game is a gem still in the rough. I wish the developers could assess those problems first as this is really what prevents the game from being a hit.I wish they could make me change my review as I really love the game but I would feel unfair recommending the game for the moment.Some might say ""you're harsh, it's a Beta"". Well, yes, this is why I waited quite some time before reviewing it.			"

								Unoptimized garbage.That's Space Engineers in two words.  I'm on a pretty new rig with a decent graphics card, a fresh Windows install with up-to-date drivers, and this game barely even wants to start up properly, never mind actually play.  The fact that the devs behind this godawful nightmare 1) started development on a new game (Medieval Engineers) before this one could even run properly; and 2) were totally on board with the paid mods fiasco that Valve tried to make standard, is a firm display of ethical integrity on par with the worst mainstream game publishers such as EA.If this game is ever fixed, it'll totally be worth a purchase.  But that will probably never happen.			"

								This is one of the most fun sandbox games. It allows you to build ships and stations, create logical operations, make scripts in game, and anything else you can come up with. Another great thing about this game is you can construct things with precision without have to having to place thousands of cubic meters of wool to create it (*cough* Minecraft *cough*). It gets weekly updates, has Steam workshop mods, worlds, and ship blueprints support, and you don't have to port forward just to host you're own online game. The only cons I can see with this game is community griefers, but that's an issue with any sandbox game and there aren't that many now (At least what I've played). So why not get it!?			"

								This is one of the most fun sandbox games. It allows you to build ships and stations, create logical operations, make scripts in game, and anything else you can come up with. Another great thing about this game is you can construct things with precision without have to having to place thousands of cubic meters of wool to create it (*cough* Minecraft *cough*). It gets weekly updates, has Steam workshop mods, worlds, and ship blueprints support, and you don't have to port forward just to host you're own online game. The only cons I can see with this game is community griefers, but that's an issue with any sandbox game and there aren't that many now (At least what I've played). So why not get it!?			"

								I want to like it. I has so much potential and is innovative and cool. But... it just doesnt run well for me. Graphics are decent, but when i move around the map the controls just feels... wrong... its feels kinda floaty. I tried all kinds of different graphics configurations.Also, its quite complex starting off. The interfaces arent explained particularly well in my opinion, and when i start a game im not exactly sure what im supposed to do. The crafting system is just overly complex. I still do not understand the systems or how to build quite a few things. Building ships is pretty fun tho, but I usually lack enough of an imagination/knowhow to build anything really neat.			"

								This is a great game that can provide hours of fun building complex machinery in the vastness of the cosmos.So long as you don't use any moving parts.Or play with your friends.By no circumstance should you allow your friends to play with the moving parts you made.If you do, then I hope you're okay with everything clipping into everything else and exploding. Yes, making things not explode is an essential part of being an engineer, true. But I'm not so sure about changing the laws of physics themselves, or controlling how physics operate when you load your game. Yes, I could lock all the moving parts with landing gears before saving and quitting so they don't spaz out when I reload the game. The point is I shouldn't have to compensate for a failure of the game code.I mean, if you can't use moving parts and have them function reliably then it's not really about engineering, now is it?It's just architecture.

								Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game. The premise is great, and the game that *could* have been made was also great. However it's become very clear that the engine chosen at the outset simply cannot achieve any of the things that Keen ever wanted for it. Every patch brings more bugs and the game simply doesn't work properly now. Multiplayer is a joke - it's impossible to keep in sync with even a single other player and the bugs simply multiply when you try. Single player is so buggy as to be unplayable. Crashes, freezes, broken items and components, performance all over the place.Check back in 2017 maybe, something could have been salvaged if Keen ever address the core issue of an unsuitable engine.

Space Engineers ReviewNeedless, to say, Space Engineers is a great sandbox set in the vastness of space.  I became consumed by my own personal projects, meticulously piecing together a ship which would dwarf my friends'.  If you don't feel like reading, the game's a great combination of physics and creativity, definitely a game worth checking out.  The game's most recent update added planets to the game and I can't wait to see how the developers expand on their ideas.  If you are into sandbox games and wish to dive into something new, Space Engineers will definitely be worth your money.Gameplay 8.5/10The game sports 2 primary game modes: creative and survival.  Players can choose to join a friend's game as long as they are willing to host a session.  The objectives of each are self-explanatory.  Hostile AI has been implemented into the game, but in survival mode, most of the challenge comes from the extraction of resources from mineral-rich asteroids, which the player must drill into for resources.  Players start off survival mode with a tiny yellow ship equipped with drills for extracting minerals.  I gave it as score of 8.5/10 for gameplay, provided that players actively seek out creative ways to have fun in the game and make full use of its wonderfully made sandbox, though survival mode is a bit too unforgiving to appreciate the game's design in my opinion.Lore N/AAs of now, the game has no lore, nor does it require lore, therefore its absence doesn't affect the scoring.Visuals 8/10There's honestly not much to look at in space.  The newest update which introduced planets is a huge step forward for this game, the shaders prove their worth and the physics serve as enough of a spectacle.  Sadly the demanding nature of this game drags down the score, but just a bit.  Optimisation can always be fixed and will only affect the player for a second or two.  Personally, my framerate takes a nosedive during large-scale ship collisions and the firing of projectiles.  I have to admit that I had been carried away with the ship's firearms at the time, so your experience may be different.ConclusionI have to say, I'm deeply impressed by the quality of this game and its focus on creativity.  A friend of mine taught me how to manipulate the game's physics to create a ""hyperdrive"", sending your ship shooting off in a straight line.  It's moments like these when you realise how much freedom you are given in Space Engineers, and how much fun you can get from exploring a game.  The game's attention to physics, detail and developer support net this game a whopping 16.5/20, the higher end of the indie game spectrum.  I truly believe that this game has great potential and if you like sandbox games, the $20 price tag is a more than reasonable price to pay for countless hours of fun.  16.5/20 "

								I wrote a review over a year ago recommending this game. At it's current state, I don't recommend it. It crashes regularly, has texture tearing issues, the AI is abysmal, numerous frustrating bugs, very poor resource spawning...Here's my recent experince: I try planets because it sounds cool. I spawn in a lander and spend AGES flying to find resources. Navigating on planets feels awkward. The enemies are so poorly designed that I just turn them off. Minecraft has better AI enemies than Space Engineers and yet Minecraft's enemies AI is simplistic and uninteresting. It's amazing they managed to do something WORSE than Minecraft's enemy AI. So, I decide planets need more work so I start a world in space, my old favorite. I spawn in a respawn ship and instantly die. I try again and instantly die. I try every respawn ship and instantly die and the only one that worked was the planetary lander, WHICH DOESN'T WORK IN SPACE. It has atmospheric thrusters! So, that mode was unplayable. I made a new space map, this time starting at a platform station. No problems respawning. I think this is great now. I go around getting resources and building stuff. However, every 5-10 minutes it would crash randomly. I have Windows 10, gtx970, 16GB ram, 3.5GHz processor, and no other applications running that should interfere with it. Yet I get consistent crashes at random. I put up with the crashes and keep playing, saving constantly. I realize that for no reason, my assemblers stop automatically taking resources they need to build. So I have to MANUALLY DRAG INGOTS INTO IT. This is something basic that used to work just fine. Another major pain for me was finding resources. My starting asteroid had iron, ice, Pt, Ni. So I had to search for the other resources on other asteroids. No big deal. I go around searching asteriods and I leave a GPS marker at each to keep track of the ores that I find. I had to search over TWENTY ASTEROIDS to find silver! And I only found two little patches of silicon and magnesium. It took way too long. It was a tedious and unfun experience, which used to be no problem. They've made many changes to the game that introduced instability, frustrating bugs, poorly designed AI and poor random generation. Do not buy SE until they fix these things. It used to feel like a Beta, now it feels like an Alpha.			"

								Even after two years in “Early Access”, Space Engineers still has: long loading times, plenty of bugs, visual glitches and clipping, some clearly incomplete elements, and a plethora of performance issues (stuttering, frame rate drops, audio hiccups, and generally not the best optimisation)… But at the same time, its gameplay model is a true sandbox with almost endless possibilities, with brilliant music and sound design, its graphics are more than decent, and most importantly of all – when played with friends – this unfinished indie game from Czechia has the potential to give you more entertainment and playtime than many big budget AAA productions from the gaming industry’s giants.The tools you are given here are truly complex with so many options giving you opportunities for interesting contraptions, from tiny planetary outposts and starfighters to enormous subterranean metropolises and Death Stars – the galaxy is your playground. The similarities to Minecraft and its cousins are obvious, but the two things that really set Space Engineers apart from many other creation/crafting/survival games are its carefully developed physics system and atmospheric setting. Moreover, unlike with many other Early Access titles, Keen Software House cannot be accused of reaping the benefits of this scheme without putting effort into the project, as Space Engineers has actually grown in scope.Substantial performance problems are the main hindrance that can get in the way of the amount of fun you are having with it. Although some might argue that this is justifiable because Space Engineers is not yet finished, I disagree; they are charging you for it and so it should be in as stable a state as possible. However, minus those technical hitches, this game is masterfully designed.If you are patient enough to accept that, then you should buy this game. If you are unsure – wait for a sale. If you know you are the kind of person who does not tolerate games with such problems, then hold on until it leaves Early Access, but at some point you just have to get it and bring your friends with you. The things you can do with them in multiplayer are the key selling point.			"

								Sigh, A year ago this game was relatively playable and quite enjoyable. I could go on about dozens of sleepless nights playing with friends on a PvP server, building our little fleets across the stars; claiming asteroids and looting other people’s bases while they slept. Mapping out the entire map with GPS coordinates and a 3D calculator + spreadsheet was something that gave us an edge. Here we stand almost what--ten months? from when I left and the game still memory leaks and crashes to the desktop. I just don’t know how a game, when I got it, goes from a playable and very basic Alpha version to whatever SE is today that’s completely broken. And I mean it: I can’t even load a blank creative world without the game memory leaking and then crashing. So when you see my 700hrs, make a note to yourself. That’s the game from three to one year ago.			"

								The game itself is very entertaining - or rather it would be if it weren't regularly rendered unplayable by Keen, the company responsible. They regularly break basic functions of the game with ""patches"" and render it effectively impossible to play multiplayer for long periods of time. They almost never communicate anything of substance to the community and generally seem unaware of the damage they do to their brand (and the aggravation they cause) by releasing untested, ridiculous, unwanted ""content,"" refusing to acknowledge almost all of the bugs and problems in the game, failing to do what they say with respect to the direction of the game (claiming for example that creation of new content would stop and bugfixing would become a priority), and seeming overall to be disorganized and incompetent with little desire to fix and finish their so-called ""alpha"" game (where it's been for two entire years). The game could be great were it not for Keen. Your money will not be used wisely by this company - spend it elsewhere.			"

								This is an extremely bugged out alpha game that will give you hours of severe frusteration as you build a massive ship only to have a bug detonate all the ordinace on board and leave a gaping hole in your beloved weapon of mass destruction.  With that said... It is truly the most awesome game I have had to pleasure to experience.  When things are working the possibilities are endless.  The final refined version of this game may very well redefine MMO and sandbox style gaming.  When you loot something you really LOOT SOMETHING.  The idea that when you kill someone you can truly take EVERYTHING THEY HAVE and use it to build your stuff.  People will be building secret bases and uber defenses around every corner to avoid being the next victim of player vs player perma death raiding.  Of course there are different rules for different servers so you can find the one that suits your style and enjoy.  Did I mention I decided to rename my oldest son Keen?Thank you Space Engineers!

Early Access Review
								Perfect start, now plummeting into a bad crash landing...The game was great. I really love it. It clicked into everything I've wanted from a sandbox. It's a great time consumer, it's a game I've always wanted to be made. Bought it ages ago for a relatively huge amnount of money, but I didn't regret it. Until since about half a year things went worse. The once smooth performance went drastically low, the game itself is plagued with bizarre glitches after every update. None of those things seem to be addressed - adding more irrelevant content took all the shiny spotlight. I don't have the best computer but it used to run satisfyingly good; now it's a 800x600 nightmare in about 30 fps... if I don't build too much. Maybe if there was some sort of a warning that I'll have to buy a 3x times more powerful PC after a certain number of patches I wouldn't be ranting.And even if I had a real gaming rig, Space Engineers would still be unplayable. Multiplayer is a distant memory; there's no real way of enjoyably playing with someone. Single player is not much better.Everything just explodes, lags, disconnects and crashes. Rotors and landing gears generate more explosive force than actual warheads in the game. Nothing works like it's supposed to. Mining anything is a suicide either literally or performance-wise. Wheeled vehicles can't go a hundred yards without making tons of collision noises, eventually falling apart and exploding or plummeting into the void under the planet surface. Explosions? Explosions! Mr. Torgue must have approved.Not to mention that actual content is dusty and lacking (What about ladders? hatches? hinges? treads? everything in the workshop?), and must be expanded through gazillion mods that put a strain on the dying performance - or just don't load. The devs weekly address those issues through their own vision of needed content: the likes of self-detonating dogs (as if eveyrthing wasn't exploding anyway), different colored ""new"" tool variants no one cares about or ""modding support"" to things that have been already modded ages ago. What's the point of forcing weekly updates and showing off unneeded things if people want a functionable game ?Sorry KEEN but unless you start making the actual game playable after all these terrible months, I'll have to tell people: don't waste your money on it like I did. And I was a real maniac, I really loved the thing. I know you're just a bunch of indie devs and you always had my sympathy for making this experience possible. I would still be building tons of stuff for the sake of enjoying it... if this game worked.    Start listening to your players, they're the ones funding this ordeal. It's been long enough.			"

Terribly optimized and by terrible, I mean 5 -10 FPS. Maybe something's wrong with my rig or so, but I seem to be able to run every other game in my library just fine. Some problems I've ran into: crashes every now and then, corrupted save files, complete lag when standing on planets. Multiplayer makes it lag even more. There are ways to tweak the game yourself based on your rig, but they're quite a pain to figure out eventually ranging to editing your game files, trying to find the right version of your graphics driver, etc. Don't get me wrong, once I got this game working for a while it was actually really fun, but at the moment, unless you're a diehard alpha tester, I would recommend staying out of this game until this game gets an optimization update. I still have faith for this game in the future though, the concept is really neat, it's just the terrible current optimizations that bothers me. I wasted most of my hours in this game trying to tweak it myself.TL;DR You literally need a NASA computer to run this thing without any sort of bugs/crashesEDIT: Some typos and other things I wanted to mention			"

								Instead of opting to fix/optimise the game they already had, Keen Software House has released a series of mostly useless updates, aside from scenarios and planets.  They have also commited the cardinal sin of working on a second game while this one is still in development.  The planet update and most after has rendered the game nearly unplayable due to both even worse framerates and having more bugs than an Indiana Jones movie.  Multiplayer flat out crashes constantly.  I will be more favorable when focus shifts to fixing the game, but I am not holding my breath in anticipation of this happening soon.			"

Early Access Review
								Space Engineers may still be an Early Access title, but this game is definately worth it and I strongly recommend this game to those who enjoy sanbox/survival type games. The game does a great job at making you feel small. Flying around space and mining off asteroids gives you a good perspective to how big the universe really is. This game does support the Steam workshop and mods are frequently being uploaded to the workshop to provide the game with new or improved content to suit your playstyle or needs. With that being said, I feel it'd be best to start with the negatives...As I've mentioned before, this game is still in early access and is expected to have bugs and crashed here and there. From what i've experienced so far, here are some things you should take note of:- Don't try to load a world with more that 15 mods enabled, your game will most likely freeze or crash to desktop. (However, this may just be my system) - This game does require a beefy PC when it comes to running planets. I was only able to get a max framerate of 40 on a planet without foilage and on the lowest possible graphical settings. For those who do have a decent system shouldn't have any issues however. - Whilst playing on a relatives server, i've noticed anything that a client does, would also appear for the server host. E.g - I take my helmet off, it'll come up with the same message for the host. Or if I had ran out of materials for an upgrade, it'll not only tell myself, but it would also tell the host. - When connecting to lets say, a friends server with mods enabled, sometimes the mod will not install correctly and will not work. I'm having this issue currently on a relatives server and are still trying to solve it. - Changing your graphics setting from lowest to highest or vice versa can cause your game to crash. - The camera is a bit dodgy at times, especially when it comes to crouching or mining in small spaces.  (There are many more that I could go into detail about, but those are the most obvious)Seeing there will be problems with any game that's in early access, don't feel it should stop you from buying it. The game is updated every now and again and the devs are trying their hardest to fix the problems. That being said, this game will keep you occupied for hours and in my opinion, is definately worth a try.			"

								WARNING: This game MIGHT embrace the Paid Mods feature. If this happens, consider not buying this game.This is a game that was made for people just like me. It looks like Minecraft in space, but it's more than that. It gives you the tools to solve problems, and the fulfillment you get after coming up with your own solution is a feeling sorely lacking in other sandbox games.The survival mode in this game gives you a lot of content. I've been playing it for more than forty hours and I haven't even managed to set up a decent mining operation. You can also hijack other ships and take them apart to build new ones. You can stop them in a craft that you made or even just in your spacesuit (if you know what you're doing) - they're all coasting on autopilot and  with automated weaponry that makes approaches tricky. The fun is in the trial and error, and figuring out the best way to do a seemingly simple task.Is your mining drill inefficient? Build a mining ship. Is the hand welder too slow for you? Make a welder-equipped craft. Do you need to strip and salvage a giant capital ship you just captured? Maybe a corvette with six  grinders is what you need. Creativity and resourcefulness is rewarded.The creative mode is also great for shooting things with other people and making fantastic designs of ships on your own. There are ways to save schematics or blueprints of your designed ships so that you can build and use them in survival mode. The devs are also great in that they update really often, and for an alpha version (I rarely buy games on Early Access) my money has already been well spent. BUY IT AND PLAY WITH ME AND YOUR OTHER FRIENDS!			"

(Review as of January 27, 2016)I will preface with this:This is most certainly an early access peer review. Space Engineers updates weekly, sometimes even more frequently, and constantly changes, adjusts, and updates factors that may alter gameplay.I'm an aspiring aerospace engineer. I've set my sights on attending the ever prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where some say aerospace engineering was founded. Naturally, I immediately devoted some attention to Space Engineers for this reason. Using voxels, modules, and some ingenuity, you can create incredible entities. One may pay homage to great movie and show starships, or develop real-life historic vehicles largely responsible for mankind's presence in space..... or you can do whatever you want, create whatever you want, and play however you want.Let's get down to brass tacks and discuss what currently works and what could use improvement:What works:An innovative ship and space station creation system with robust options in function and form through voxels and parts.Some realistic grounding with physics, especially with inertia and momentum.Two varied game modes (enduring survival and imaginative creative) with adjustable environments and settings.A mod-friendly execution.What could use improvement:Multiplayer. Long time veterans knew this would be first on the list. Network optimization is poor and gameplay frustrating.Performance in general. This is a pressing issue to Keen Software House's Marek Rosa and should likely be addressed within the year. Let's hope!Static animations most certainly testament to the game's early access nature. (Most evident with astronaut movement.)Painting. Painting is the stuff of nightmares. Be prepared to fight the poor paint-application system.What doesn't work:Building two separate station / habitats and connecting them together with voxels. (Some things are just too difficult to cut-and-paste.) This is an exercise in patience.Ultimately, Space Engineers is a fascinating game. If you have any desire to design, create, and fly your own spacecraft, then this is a wonderful experience. Share your creations with your friends, enjoy the vast network of mods available to you, and start your own space empire!			"

								The short of it: don't buy Space Engineers. If you're honestly interested, check up on it every once in a while, read the forums and reviews, consider it if it ever reaches a far more playable state. But right now? I cannot recommend a purchase.Now for the long expository part. I've played a lot of Space Engineers, and from quite some time ago. Back then, it had its problems and was rather clunky, but it was still for the most part playable without too much complication. Yet as this game has continued to progress, and this is especially true within the last numerous months, it has regressed into something even worse than its earlier states, riddled with bugs far more compromising and unacceptable.I am no stranger to Early Access titles, owning more than a handful. While EA games certainly have their ups and downs, in its more recent versions, Space Engineers has been down after down after down.I would first have to say that planets, while they were greeted with much hype within the community, are completely uninteresting. They offer no intrinsic value by their own right, having no resources exclusive to planets while still having to deal with atmospheric navigation which is less convenient than space navigation, and not to mention that, last time I tried, which admittedly was a while ago, using your landing gear could potentially destroy your ship due to its glitchiness. Your ship could start to jitter and shake until something finally breaks on it, or at worse, blow up. Not to mention that any kind of rubber-banding could also lead to the destruction of your ship as you could suddenly find yourself crashed into the ground.Or that ship speed used to be consistent. While I can understand that due to revamps, there may be problems, what I have to consider as unacceptable is that the developers have yet to properly fix the problem, and in doing so seems to have shifted the bugginess from one area to another. Earlier, if there was a server desync or even if a player joined a game, your ship would lose considerable speed, as well as simply losing speed over time. If I may digress, this review is spurred on by my experience earlier today when I decided to kill some boredom and play Space Engineers again. While the aforementioned speed problem has seemed to be alleviated, with speed fluctuating at roughly the same m/s, instead walking has been severely crippled. I tried on multipe servers and the issue was recurring on most of them. When I got out of the cockpit after my ship moved, not even at a particularly high speed or expansive distance, walking would become significantly hindered as the game would refuse to let my character stop moving. Now, I do not mean that he continued to ""walk,"" but more as continuously jerk forwards, like trying to scoot himself forward while going through a seizure.And that is not to mention long-standing bugs and issues that have been with the game for months or even over a year. Or that, due to a myriad of bugs and patches of instability, multiplayer is more of a chore and experience in patience against frustration than a fun sandbox to play in.I cannot recommend this game in its current state, and barring an incredible transformation, likely in the near future, either. Not until there is a clear indication that these complications get ironed out, that the development of this game isn't so helter skelter and destabilizing, and that multiplayer is in a state of respectable operation. During its EA development, while it attempts to improve, it seems to be a case of one step forwards and two steps back, leading to an arguable even worse state than it was over a year ago. At best, keep an eye on it and see if it improves; otherwise, save your money and maybe wait for a different game with similar themes and genre to come along.			"

								The biggest problem with Space Engineers, which threatens its entire future...Keen's overall lack of progress and commitment to the game. The second issue...the bootlickers who cry ""it's Alpha"".Well, Alpha means full steam ahead for development. This is NOT the case with SE. If anything, the original team packed up long ago and the game is floundering. I would almost classify the game as abandonware. There are huge issues with the game (mostly multiplayer) which have existed for months. If they can't address these, how can they claim the game is in Alpha and moving forward? It's ridiculous.Somehow, they have reached the point where they cannot seem to move it forward without breaking things severely. Patches are something to be afraid of. The game has incredible potential, it's just struggling to find someone to take it there. We spend HOURS and DAYS trying to make things work. Lost hours and days of time working on bases, ships, etc...only to lose them due to bugs. The neat screenshots and videos you see? Most of your experience will be just trying to keep the game running.  "

Wish I could get my money (and time) back. I've spent about 200 hours actually playing the game, the other 400 has to be from idling.Keep in mind that this game has been in 'Early Access' for over three years.

								I have had this game since just after planets came out, and I loved playing it. It always had bugs, but they were tolerable and not game breaking. As you play and develop more complex things, more bugs keep showing themselves.  The developers are good about coming out with updates every week, but somehow the game just seems to be getting more buggy. They will fix some bugs, then 3 or 4 updates later the same things break again. Sorry Keen, this is a great idea for a game and I got some great times playing it, but I cannot recommend it anymore. I sincerely hope the issues get fixed, and will try back in a couple of months.			"

								This review is based on the lifetime of the game thus far.  Early Access is understandable, and things are going to break and become buggy.  Everyone that's buying EA games should know this, and it's written as disclaimers in a lot of games prior to even playing it.The Developers of this game have always operated under the idea that people want content, and more content they shall have.  I don't believe this is actually to please their fanbase, but it's more of an in house quota that they're trying to meet as a business.I am not recommending this game to anyone that's currently thinking about purchasing this game.  I am also recommending that anyone who has played this game for a relatively long time that has written a review, or is thinking about writting a review to give your true honest opinion for whether or not you recommend this game given the track record of the company.I will say the cliche thing that you read time and time again, ""I really want to recommend this game and give it a positive review, but with it's current state I feel I cannot.""  However, the current state that is being referenced is not just this weeks most recent Forced Update (the game needs PATCHES, not updates) but more so how this game has been pumped with more content than it can currently handle given the underlying bugs from previous content pushes.I will change my review at a later date if the KeenSWH developers start polishing up the current state of the game, and by polish I mean, don't add new content, don't change animations, don't give us new sounds.  Putting lipstick on a pig, still makes it a pig, and the people that understand that will not stick around and endorse your game to their friends and especially not on an Anonymous Review board.TL:DR - Don't buy it.  Don't let the 91% positive feedback rating persuade you into thinking that the developers listen to their fanbase.			"

								Already fun!In creative mode it gets boring quite fast as there is not that many components yet, but it does allow you to tweaka and test designs so you know what to build.In survival, building a large ship requires a lot of ore, so it will take some time to get it going.Which is great as you can create the framework and then work together in multplayer to fill it in.Inventory management is a bit of a pain, but hopefully the process will be improved in future patches.The refinery supplies directly to the assembler, but currently that is the only autmated process.It would be very helpfull if one or more storage container could be used to handle the input and output.Also moving the ore from your drills to the storage on a platform or large ship would be very helpfull.A collector hooked to a container and a jettison option on the drill could solve the problem in a realistic way.It could also allow for slightly more efficient mining with all the small blobs or ores floating around during mining.Creating a mobile gravity platform with collectors on it would automatically scoop up everything and place it into connected storage (or just require a little bit of sweeping or kicking the ore around to get it all in there).It's early access so I expected a few problems, but so far only storage management and the slow auto-save are the only two. The rest is solid and fun.I am looking forward to what the future brings for space engineers!			"

Strongly reccomend for fans of Space and Freedom.(There are other servers too for your action fans and ect ect. (PVP  PVE, Roleplay servers))Many Updates Later:I would buy this 4 times in a row.Hope the Developers share my passion :)Edit: Planets are out! Jumpdrives, autopilot, and some really detailed mods ;)So much has been added since i first wrote this reviewHighly reccomended if you like freedom and or building.Also can be highly competitive if you join a PVP server (joining a faction, launching a fighter out of the capital ship)There is just so much to this game i can't sum it up quickly enough. Just Buy it.Only game i think i have ever given a 10/10 rating. (Except Half Life series which is just awesome)			"

								Space Engineers is the epiphany of what Legos in Space would be, you can create from the most simple ship with barely anything but your imagination, to a Hulking behemoth-class capital ship that could rival with the deathstar itself, the potential offered in this game is gigantic, and its very well playable despite being on alpha stage (at the moment of this review). The creative mode allows you to create at your hearth's content without worries of materials or energy usage, and the survival mode requires critical thinking by the number of materials you can get, energy consumption, meteor showers and the size of your ship based on your ability to micromanage each and every resource, and to have at least some degree of anticipation for a backup plan in case something goes wrong. Lastly, the online space battles while are limited for now in resources and needs optimization, do not dissapoint, specially on the collision models, just looking at the capital ships with major damages and still battling is enough to keep you entertained for lasting hours.edit: oh and you can mod the game on steam workshop, which i ve found easy to use!

								Space Engineers is actually an impressive and  indepth space survival building and simulation space design concept. If you like building with creativity and making impressive Ships, Structures, Stations, Systems and work in a team this is the game for you. I find SE as the most realistic asteroid multiplayer exporation and realistic simulation I have played thus far.The game is complex and equipped with indeepth material, you will have survive and gather materials and think how to use realistic concepts such as energy, rotors, wheels, thursters, gravity generators, refinaries, assemblers, conveyors, solar panels, grinders, welders.You will have to survive asteroid showers or to capture anomaly npc ships that fly by or engage in pvp. Trust me you dont just pick up a rifle and hike in space...If you like to just pop in for 5 minutes blast around in other games and have a 15 second attention span this game is not for you.I highly reccomend to detailed and inclined gamers that use intelligence in all aspects of life not just in a game.

Do what it takes to kick some toosh as a hot as sh*t Astronaut sent in to space by Gabe Newell for a mission to find a new species of money! In survival mode, you will be tested to the ultimate by your ever decreasing health and energy! Mine asteroids and salvage abandoned ships to continue your life and mission for Gabe! This game is definitely made for playing with friends, playing by yourself would make Dead Space look like Ricochet! So if you have second thoughts on getting the game, slap yourself in the face and get ready for action! Get this game, prepare yourself and...Gabe is depending on you! :D!			"

								After attempting to play this game multiple times with friends I can honestly say there is something interesting there.  However you have to dig through a mountain of bugs and glitches to be able to play anything on multiplayer at all.  Solo play seems to be a bit more stable.  My biggest complaint is that I shouldn't be punished if the game crashes when playing multiplayer.  I've built bases time and again only to have some glitch crash the game.  Oh you want to log back in to the base you've spent an hour building....sorry here's a new lander.  Oh you found the landscape where you had originally built your base to land.  Whoops your entire base has been wiped from the server.Theres a good game there if it actually worked			"

								This game has most of the features I've been waiting to see in a single game for along time now. If you ask anyone else, They will compare this game to Minecraft. And for good reasons. However, this game (even in its early access alpha) has far greater potential. Anything you build, can fly. (provided the design includes necessary blocks) even your base. In its current state, the game is playable. Play some Single player Asteroids then when you're good, Jump into some online games.I can only think of a few downsides to new comers.1-Learning curve. This game takes sometime to get use to. I recommend practicing your controls.2-As of the time that I am writing this, The game has some poor optimization. Don't let that deture you. The game is worth it. and will improve over time. 3-This game can be one hell of a time sink.Other then those few problems and others that aren't worth mentioning.

								If you grew up with lego's, or you simply just love constructing and deconstructing things, or just blowing up your creations... This game is for YOU. This is probably the best $15 bucks I've spent yet on any Early Access Game. The developers are pushing updates out like hotcakes, at least 1 big update every 1-2weeks. The game is very playable, and has plenty of workshop content to keep you in awe. All your favorite sci-fi shows, movies, books and the like are available to be made or looked at from other peoples creations. Battlestar Galactica? Check! Star Wars? Check! Star Strek? Check! Starship Troopers? Check! Star Citizen? Check! You name it, you'll find it in the workshop from somebody already exploring ways on how to create it and make it to scale and share with the community. Or why not just built it yourself? It's all here and available to YOU. Don't hesitate, if you've been on the fence like I was, just BUY it! You won't regret it.			"

								Hugely addictive! I really recommend trying Survival if you haven't played Space Engineers in a while. I find myself immersed in an endlessly growing space station with so much to do. Every time I log in I come up with another 10 things I need to build. Looking forward to seeing what new content will be brought to the game soon.			"

								10/10 kipper scoreThe game is what you would get if someone over the age of 12 makes a building game in space. Basically   its not Minecraft(not that I don’t like Minecraft, just lacks someone on the dev team who is over 12) it’s a space building sim game. Great fun and the is lots more too come.I own loads of early access games, alpha, per alpha games the lot. But space engineers smashes its way to the top for me. Because it updates all the time with new stuff and useful stuff. Not like DayZ Standalone where it might add a new type of soft drink or even a new zombie skin.. it puts thing in it that you want like blue prints, remote controls for your ships. Not silly things.

Early Access Review
								Let me first say that regardless of my small playtime in this game, I've still been keeping tabs on the development and workings of it.Quite honestly, this game is the model by which all other early access indie games should abide by.Most early access games will put out a game and do a billion bug fixes in their update and/or attempt to release some new content that just leads to loads more bugs to fix, and they all rely on the excuse ""Oh, but it's early access."" These guys are not the same. Although things do have their bugs (as does all code), the developers of this game always tend to pump out new things that add another nice element to the game in addition to fixing the bugs that may have existed from older builds.What's even better about it is that bugs are far less common in this game than in other early access games! It's great to see quality work in such a small span of time (every 7 days or so). This shows me that there are still some indie devs out there that don't take complete advantage of the ""Well, it's an alpha"" excuse, which is such a rarity amongst the top indie game devs (no offense to them, I'm only speaking my honest opinion). Due to this, I can confidently say that even though this game is amongst the top selling steam games, I truly think it deserves more attention and credit that it already has. Why? I've just explained it all to you, but allow me to list it:1.) Consistent weekly updates2.) Clean work-even though their updates are weekly, they're not sloppy or just tossed in to satisfy the consumer3.) When bugs do arise, they fix them in a timely manner4.) This game has immense potential to be an amazing sandbox experience, and is already pretty awesome as isNow everyone who reads this might say ""Oh, stop kissing the devs asses so much!"" To that, all I have to say is, ""Why?"" This game deserves every bit of praise I gave it. People may try to bring up this bug and that bug, but in the end, this is an early access game done right. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, no ""It's alpha, so it's okay if there's loads of bugs, many of which may break the game"", no waiting horribly long for updates, nothing but quality work. If the devs of this game can do this, I don't see why other indie devs cannot, especially when this game isn't even recieving as much attention as some others.Those working on this game put in truly hard work, no matter who you compare them to. If that's not worth the 20 bucks, then I don't know what is. A sincere ""thank you"" to the devs for keeping my hopes in quality indie game devloping alive.*Disclaimer*Don't get me wrong, there are some other good indie developers out there, just not many, and this is just the team that got my attention.

You can shortly check the workshop of the game to see some of the possibilties. It's relaxing but sounds are premature right now so don't forget to put some music at the background. I totally recommend the game !Türkçe: Bu oyun benim favorilerimden birisi. Yapabileceğiniz, inşa edebileceğiniz sayısız şey var. Eğer ki Minecraft oynadıysanız, blok tarzı inşa oyunlarına aşinaysanız bunu da bir denemenizde fayda var. Workshop'a bir göz atarsanız içeriği biraz görebilirsiniz. Dinlendirici bir oyun fakat müzik bakımından kıt ve arka fon sesleri sinir bozucu olabiliyor. O yüzden iyi birde müzik seçin. Kesinlikle öneririm !			"

								Extremely fun space game!As far as I know it's the only game based in space with real physics, this is an excellent game and can be ran on medium spec computers without any issues. Considering this is an early access game it has a very little amount of bugs and it's rare they'll happen. The game feels like it's influenced somewhat from Minecraft however it's still got a good level of detail.The game is extremely fun and realistic but not too realistic on survival but creative is great for learning what everything does.It's kinda a spacey sandbox game, you can build whatever you want out of blocks and ship parts and fly your ship around to do whatever you want however it'd be nice if you could do more in this game ( I understand that it's early access and this game is updated all the time.)It's definitely worth buying this game at this state and it's more than worth the money, if only my friends could run it with their terrible computers I'd be playing it more. This game is great for killing time and if I could get friends to play it'd be even more fun for longer, this game has real potential it just needs time.10/10 This game is awesome the way it combines realistic physics with building blocks is fun in a way.

								When it comes to survival games, Space Engineers is very well done. I've spent more time than I like to admit on this game due to the fact that it allows for a challenging, but rewarding experience. As a space engineer, you are unable to perform too many tasks on your own, as your inventory is severely limited and welding/grinding/mining speeds are too slow for massive builds. While that may sound as a bad thing, it is quite the opposite! It forces you to build ships/contraptions to perform the tasks for you, which is an aspect of the game that I really enjoy. If you think you're mining too slow, build a bigger/more efficient ship! If it's taking hours to weld your base, create a ship that can hold more building components and weld faster.Overall, I highly recommend this game.			"

								Update July 2014  While the game is still missing some key features, It's a great buy.  Of the Early Access games I've gotten it has by far the most substantial updates on a regular basis.  Update March 2014 Now with Survival & Multi-Player. Well the game had multiplayer before, and it still has a long way to go on that front, it's buggy, prone to lag issues, as well as lacking some obvious multiplayer features. However the update is a big step in the right direction. There are still a lot of things that clearly don't work as intended, or are just poorly balanced, but it's easy to spend quite a few hours in this game, and have a fun time.Feb. 2014 I picked up Space Engineers because it looks interesting and was on sale, so why not.  I have to say if you are thinking about getting this, and want a playable game, you would be better to wait.  It's not so much a game as a somewhat buggy physics demo with an editor.  It's a pretty rough alpha, and not as playable as it looks in the videos.  You don't get to see the game breaking lag you will encounter in multiplayer when anything interesting happens, or all the graphics glitches.  There are much better games you can get now for $10, and come back in a year to see if this one has delivered on its potential.  I'm not saying it's bad, it's just not a game yet.      This is a rather negative review, so you might ask 'why the thumbs up?'.  This one should definitely be on your watch list if you have an interest in space games.			"

								Let me preface this by saying that I have over 275 hours logged at the time of writing this.  I purchased the game right before 1.033 was released and I have never regretted it.Space Engineers is an absolutely fantastic game where the only limits to what you can build is that of your imagination, and engineering skills to make everything fit together exactly how you want it.  If you enjoy Minecraft, but find it unrewarding or unchallenging, this might be a good step for you.  If Starmade felt too simplistic or too blocky and unrealistic, Space Engineers can fill that gap.Space Engineers is clearly labeled as an alpha game, so don't let 1.0 versions fool you.  The very nature of the game makes it rather performance intensive, stacked with the lack of optimization due to more and more content being pushed every week.  I'd recommend you have a beefy system, or be prepared to deal with a slide show, before purchasing.  There are too many people who whine and beg for optimization that isn't coming because they want it to.  Being an alpha, stuff is unstable in multiplayer, a lot.  Stuff can break, float off, spontaneously explode, or just quit working.  Play on dedicated servers with caution.Now Sierra, what's so great about this game after all that?Well, for one, you can build capital warships, and then take them against hostile craft or duel your friends.  Build a milenium falcon replica!  The limits of what you can create is your own imagination and your CPU strength.Instant-build too easy for you?  Try out survival mode where you have to aquire the resources & refine them.  Make the compoments, and then weld every block.  You don't just build ships piece by piece, you build each block, piece by piece.  There's a lot of respect for large, amazingly detailed capital ships done in creative, but the ones done in survival, although rarely as big, carry a lot more prestige knowing that ship literally came out of an asteroid.You wanna build your UNSC Infinity replica in survival?  Good on you and good luck!  Manage your full production process from mining and refining the ores to manufacturing and welding on the components to laying down the ship's framework for the welding crews if you have help.  Improve your efficiency by building small, and later large ships to drill, weld and grind.  Build small strike fighters and later larger frigates to defend your operations.You can build a small mining colony or a huge piracy empire.  Play alone, with friends, or on larger servers where the targets are almost limitless.  Watch out for griefers though, who will try and steal your stuff for themselves.  Throw up some guns, stockpile a bunch of ammunition, and show them who's boss!Whatever you do with this game, may you find many many hours of enjoyment in it.  Hope I was able to be of some use to people.			"

You name it you can build it here.And Keen updates it WEEKLY with new content and bug fixes.However I would recommend this to players with only higher end machines at least for now.The game still has a long way to go as far as optimization.But personally I think the game is fantastic and has great potential.If you want to get into a alpha game, build your favorite ship from your favorite sci-fi series and just except the bugs and help shape the game in the forums this game is for you.If you cant stand sub 40 FPS, CTD every third launch and a somewhat lack of content, stay away for about a year or two…			"

								Updated Review even though i said i wouldn't...So, after over 2000+ hours shown, and the other 300-400 i've played on another account... I have to say i still enjoy this game considerably. The dev's do keep track of bugs and fix them accordingly. There are of course bugs and things still in the game, but games have bugs, crashes etc, you can't judge a game based on just that. Gameplay wise, lots has changed, new blocks, new controls, new features, just so much more new stuff in general that you have to play to get your hands on... literally. There have been vast improvements from when i first played (below) and now, the game went from unplayable due to net-code and now it's playable again for me. So huge props to the dev's for looking out for all the players who were unable to play when the netcode changed!I don't really have much more to say because it really is just such a nice game to play. So just grab it, and enjoy building ships for no reason at all :)All in all, I don't think I could recommend a game better, because nothing is even close to this game. space is virtually unlimited, you can go to the GPS point for Billion, Billion, Billion and the game still runs fine. and if that isn't enough, you have multiplayer, for space battles and factions, and really just a huge amount of space to do whatever you want. it's a true Space Sandbox and I don't think anything will be on a similar scale anytime soon.I am also a server admin and have made a few mods for the game as well, so my experience is from all sides. I truly love playing this game, and I hope you will too!P.S. my server is called Hydro Survival if you are ever interested in playing mp! :)OLD REVIEW:""To start, this is a great game in it's alpha stage, granted it's been in alpha for a long time, I still have managed to rack up 300+ hours in-game. It's great in both Single player and Multiplayer, although it's a bit lacking in Single Player due to there not being alot of 'campaign' type maps to play. The focus is to really just enjoy yourself, build a base, a ship, etc. This is better with friends obviously, as you get kind of bored doing everything alone. The game has weekly updates for being in alpha, and while it is still in alpha stages, it's very much playable and enjoyable.Please take note that it is an alpha game and WILL have bugs and glitches, which are usually fixed, and new things are added, so new bugs/glitches appear. This is an alpha game and it is expected, and known that you WILL find bugs and glitches in-game. The developers are great, adding player requested features, and weekly updates fixing bugs and adding new features, which I take it as a challenge to break the game because I enjoy blowing things up... multiple times.All in all, it is a great game and very much worth it's price. If you enjoy 'creative' building games, and wish you could fly into limitless space while stopping on planets and asteroids for resources, or just want to play with friends and build a huge base in the mountains, this game is for you!Note: As stated, this is still an alpha game, and all review content in this review is for the alpha stage, which is known to have bugs and/or glitches in this state. This will not be updated and a new review will be posted as the game is fully released. ""			"

Over 100 patches released (and counting), fixing things and adding new features and blocks etc, this game will be going down in the history books. Well deserved ""BEST INDIE GAME OF 2015"", i SO TOTALLY RECOMMEND this game! Why dont you have it yet? Get some friends, chips and play this amazing game.

								I love this game, it's a great building outlet for me. The mining, grinding, and welding is fun.It is amazing in Survival, when you spawn in with the basic yellow starter ship. Grind it down to start a base. Move the main components over to the base. Mine for ore and refine those into ingots to assemble in to building parts. First thing to do is build a small mining ship. Find Uranium and you are good to go.The modding community has made it even better. Check out the Workshop.Creative is great and Survival is great. (side note)If you play on a server, for the love of Meko, use TeamSpeak or other voice comms software, not the text chat. Once they implement the in-game communication system, it will be even better. I can see them making the comms clearer the closer your antenna is to others.			"

								The developers choose to ignorantly add in new features and fix minor bugs rather than focus on issues which have plagued this game from the beginning. The vast possibilities of this game lie in multiplayer, which is ultimately broken and always has been. No substantial changes have been made to remedy this. Instead, new features are added and tested at what seems like a very minimal standard *on single player* (or maybe LAN).Players do not find it fun to put countless hours into creating complex grids to watch them randomly, without propulsion, and without any force applied, fly off into the depths of space. Or have a ship using landing gear suddenly fly through 3 layers of a station's hull and tear up hours of timing, piston control, and power management.Most of us generally understand how things like pistons and rotors work; push/pull and rotate, respectively. We definitely do not understand how, sitting there idle, on default values, on a stationary base, on a planet... these things explode and launch what it's connected to off into the distance or directly at the long grind of a construct ripping holes through and auto-destroying all it comes in contact with.Taking a look at their forums, several solo fan boys cheer them on. Several others voice their 'lesser' opinions. When requested to fix these ongoing issues with multiplayer (the true potential of the game), they are either ignored... OR DIRECTED TO THEIR CODE REPO! The developers are asshats. We are the gamers; the players. We are the END-USERS; the CUSTOMERS. We are not their code-lackeys. We have Steam. Then there's their own forums. They also want to throw in their repo? NEWSFLASH: when customers are looking to purchase or further support your product, we're looking at the point of sale and possibly a forum. Both of these being either ignored or deflected by the developers is an extremely poor practice.Until they fix what is actually important before adding in new shinies, I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. That truly sucks because I have a group of friends who have been asking about Space Engineers for more than 9 months now. I know the devs couldn't give less of a crap about the little drop of 3-5 more sales in their large bucket of a scam but there's people out there waiting for some stability.			"

								Where do I even begin on this AMAZING fantastic piece of GOLD!?!?! The physics are incredible, the controls are simple, easy to use, and I got used to them in 5 minutes, the gameplay is fun, explorotive, full of new experience everytime, and it is an overall GREAT game! Things you can do: I have built a ship and flown it, I've flown ships into other ships and watched while I was inside, I've built a ship online, and then watched it get blasted, exploded, and BOOMED across the map by other players!!!PROS: 1. Endless possibilities 2. Weapons and turrets 3. Great and fun gameplay 4. You don't have to mess with that advanced ""server"" crap, you can just start a game, choose how many players can join, and play and it's online!!! 5. Creative and survival modes 6. EXPLOSIONS, CRASHES, BOOMS, DENTS, SCRATCHES, AND OVER-THE-TOP MAYHEM 7. You can have UNLIMITED sized worlds and travel forever 8. Color all building pieces to make complete customizability (And not just default colors, you can CHOOSE and mix colors on a big color square) 9. Lighting is awesome (in my opinion). You can choose the radius, intensity, and color of lights!! 10 You can have hundreds of ships in ONE GAME!!! Make stations and ships and dock them, or crash them into the stations!!! 11. It is pretty cheap for everything that's in the game...20 dollars!!! (18 dollars if you're reading this during the summer sales)CONS: 1. I've been missing out for a long time now.......that's it for CONS!!!Everyone should get this game if you're into sandbox, destruction, explosions, guns, building, third person and first person, and multiplayer!!! This is a quality....QUA-LI-TY game!!! Get it...NOW!!!			"

								I highly recommend the game for those who are fans of the study of cosmology and other astronomical subjects. This game is a excellent game where you can build any type of space ship you want. Great game to play together to survive the meteor showers and for building up your own economical base.The game has good graphics, doesn`t glitch, and has frequent updating. In updates they add very good items such as sensors and newer cockpits and other building materials. I find the idea amazing of producing artificial gravity in a environment containing microgravity, the idea is great. They made the physics of this game realistic (such as the moment of Inertia, and that there is no friction in space). In the loading screen there is something to read (quotes from Astronomers like Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, and many others) instead of just having a screen with a picture and a sign saying: Loading...MAIN COMMENT: Good game, good physics, good ideas, great building materials (being expanded every month), and plenty of settings to create a environment which you would want. Highly recommend for astronomy/physics/space fans.			"

								This game has most of the features I've been waiting to see in a single game for along time now. If you ask anyone else, They will compare this game to Minecraft. And for good reasons. However, this game (even in its early access alpha) has far greater potential. Anything you build, can fly. (provided the design includes necessary blocks) even your base. In its current state, the game is playable. Play some Single player Asteroids then when you're good, Jump into some online games.I can only think of a few downsides to new comers.1-Learning curve. This game takes sometime to get use to. I recommend practicing your controls.2-As of the time that I am writing this, The game has some poor optimization. Don't let that deture you. The game is worth it. and will improve over time. 3-This game can be one hell of a time sink.Other then those few problems and others that aren't worth mentioning.

								Even though this game is still in alpha at the time of this review and there is much more to be done, this game is amazing. You can compare the block styles to be similar to minecraft, only without the ugly undetailed textures. Features like being able to build anything you want and piloting it, and to destroy it with full destruction, you can either leave a ship/station full of holes or split them apart anyway you like. The potential for this game is huge and it will be extremely fun to build custom fleets to play with your friends. Once the game is finished and the developers fix the current issues. It will be a very likely 10/10 game. But I personally recommend it if you love zero gravity, building and destroying things.			"

								If you like simulation games with a sense of realism and few limits this is the game for you. The physics engin in fantastic, the building system is easy and complicated all at the same time. Mining and looking for resources isn't unbearable. And the energy system with reactors and solar panels offers many options. I love the survival mode but Creative is a great way to stretch your imagination and make something epic or a world to play survival in. The ability to switch game settings and options for saved worlds makes saved games very replayable and customizable. 8.5/10 The only thing missing from this game is some PVP modes not just PVP servers and is missing mobs.

								Great potential wasted:tldr: nice ship building, but as soon as you have 5 there is huge lag; lots of bugspositive:-space survival with resources, build your own ships, moderate level of realism-mod support-turing complete through programmable block-graphics look very nicenegative:-bugs, bugs, more bugs (like thrusters randomly stop working, drills that are full make resources disappear when you continue drilling, rotors and pistons unusable because they start glichy movements that ultimately make everything explode, ...)-very bad graphics engine, eats resources as ♥♥♥♥, seems to be programmed by a unexperienced person as there are many flaws in it that experienced people would have never put in it: graphics engine is bound to physics (no interpolation) -> max 60fps, still feels jittery ->not even smoothly playable on a high end pc-very bad physics engine, again not well engineered, eats resources, is laggy, has lots of flaws that cause ship damage for seemingly no reason, no relative calculations -> gets worse the higher the speed-ship speed limit 100m/s ?????? This is SPACE there is no speed limit (except speed of light), if you mod the speed limit higher everything gets even buggier-small and large ships: every block should be able to be placed small and large on every grid, but again the programmers dont seem to have a high enough experience level to do this-planets: nice idea but eats even more resources, is even buggier etc.-weapons feel like placeholders; you can shoot yourself with your own missile because bugs-wants to be realistic on the one side and on the other side has some very unrealistic features such as your space suit braking a LOT faster than it accelerates, the jump drive that was only introduced because they couldnt fix physics for a higher speed limit, asteroids dont have gravity and all move 0 relative to all other asteroids and planets, static friction with the vacuum at very low speeds or 0 speed, ...edit after big multiplayer and graphics update (Dec 2016):graphics now look very nice, but need even more resouces. Its still buggy as hell (except multiplayer bugs, they were reduced by about 80%)(If I find an issue fixed, i will remove it from the list as soon as i notice)			"

								WARNING: THIS GAME IS DIFFICULT! If you don't like extremely long drawn out creations or you just don't like a lot of complexity in a game then this is not for you! But I personally like this game. This game's physics are unparalled to any other I've played. The multiplayer is great and fun and works pretty ok for me. This game's core is the fact of building and creating (or crashing♥♥♥♥♥♥too). If you liked to build big or small creations then this game is for you! If you liked minecraft (espically the creative mode aspect of it the this is the game for you! This is basically minecraft in space, with no gravity, way better physics, rocket ships, and much more. This game is v ery unique from others that I've played and the short time I've played it.. I love it. If the controllers were easier, and the game was easier to ""pick up"" then I'd enjoy it a lot more, but I still yet have time to get better at it.			"

								I bought this game a few years ago thinking it was going to be just Minecraft in space, and it is. It's a really good game.However, KSH has evolved the specs over time, rendering the game unplayable with my hardware, even on legacy mode. It's just one big benchmark/slideshow for my card nowadays because there are no efforts being placed for serious optimization or even just a low-graphics mode (low-poly everything, minimum shaders).I cannot refund the game since it has been such a long time, Even if I upgraded my computer, my brother would require the hardware upgrade as well, amounting the upgrade costs to be roughly $400 just to play this game. Now you're thinking ""baahh go away poor kid"" but we are the silent majority.If you're an adult with a disposable income, go ahead and buy. Otherwise, you better keep your money in your wallet until you get a new computer.			"

								Space exploration is the ongoing discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by means of continuously evolving and growing space technology. While the study of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, the physical exploration of space is conducted both by unmanned robotic probes and human spaceflight.While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the early 20th century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.Space exploration has often been used as a proxy competition for geopolitical rivalries such as the Cold War. The early era of space exploration was driven by a ""Space Race"" between the Soviet Union and the United States, the launch of the first man-made object to orbit the Earth, the USSR's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 craft on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Aleksei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971.After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS).With the substantial completion of the ISS[1] following STS-133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the USA remain in flux. Constellation, a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020[2] was judged inadequately funded and unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009.[3] The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond low earth orbit (LEO), envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020, transferring the development of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector, and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO, such as Earth/Moon L1, the Moon, Earth/Sun L2, near-earth asteroids, and Phobos or Mars orbit.[4] As of March 2011, the US Senate and House of Representatives are still working towards a compromise NASA funding bill, which will probably terminate Constellation and fund development of a heavy lift launch vehicle (HLLV).[5]In the 2000s, the People's Republic of China initiated a successful manned spaceflight program, while the European Union, Japan, and India have also planned future manned space missions. China, Russia, Japan, and India have advocated manned missions to the Moon during the 21st century, while the European Union has advocated manned missions to both the Moon and Mars during the 21st century.From the 1990s onwards, private interests began promoting space tourism and then private space exploration of the Moon (see Google Lunar X Prize).

								Unfortunately I've had to rereview this game. Intially it was one of my favorite early access titles, boasting some interesting features not seen elsewhere and a decent clip to the development pace.However over the last year or so the game hasn't really improved much. It's become more and more buggy and unplayable with every update, and the only really significant feature added has been planets. The game is barren of almost any core gameplay or content, leaving you with very little to do in the off chance you actually manage to get the thing to run and move past building your inital base and miner.The Creative mode is fairly fun, but there's only so many hours of entertainment availble from minecraft in space using far less parts to work with, and the game has trouble handling truly massive constructions. Plus with the multiplayer as buggy as it is, you're fairly well relegated to building things on your own and not showing them to people.This game could be a really amazing survival/builder game, as well as a very interesting pvp game, but there's no indication it's ever going to become bug free enough to reliably play online, let alone actually get the features needed to support such gameplay.Do NOT buy this game until some point in the distant future when it actually has some core gameplay and isn't more bugs than game, or it's been abandoned and you decide you're ok with paying whatever price it is for an unfinished product.Edit: Hadn't seen the latest update when I wrote this. Holy ♥♥♥♥ this just gets even more unplayable every update. Even if we could keep a server running for more than five minutes the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dog update would make the game impossible to play.Edit:2 it's been what, almost two years since I wrote this review? Well it's still true. The progress on the game continues at a snails pace and there's more bugs than actual gameplay.If the devs would calm the ♥♥♥♥ down on gamebreaking new features and bug fix for two more years maybe this POS will be as playable as it was when I first bought it three years ago once more.

								Space Engineers is one of those games that does it right for an Early Access title.Yes, the game may have bugs and yes, you are most likely to experience them.But unlike other reviews on this game, you cannot forget that you are playing an Early Access game.I don't get why everyone is giving this game bad reviews because of the bugs, unless they somehow expected a bug free environment from an early access title?Space Engineers gets updated every week on Thursday, and the developers tend to have sleepless nights to make sure they deliver an update every Thursday.Recently, planets where added to this game, and man, did they deliver.It's enjoy-full to see how this game has progressed so far -- We went from building ships and then crashing them in single player, to playing survival with friends (or crashing ships with friends) and now, we get to do it all over again, but on beautiful looking planets!Not satisfied with that? Then take your ship and go land on an alien planet, and do your best to stay alive against those ""space spiders""!MultiplayerMultiplayer was added along the way to this game, as the community desired it the most.This resulted in KSH getting it added as soon as possible, which while it works, it does glitch out, but have no fear.The multiplayer is being re-worked completely and we can already see the effects from this. (EG: Space Master Mode)PlanetsAlot of users have been complaining about the performance with planets, and I guess it was slightly expected that they would have a decent performance hit.Sadly, this performance hit can make the game unplayable for most users (Altho, I don't have any issue with running them.)What does sadden me, is that people started to give negative reviews to the game because of this, claiming ""they broke the game completely"", but this is so incorrect.You can always just launch a world without planets (There is literately nothing preventing you from doing this),  and continue playing like you did before. And then just wait until the game receives more optimization.ConclusionFor me, this game is one of the best space building/survival type game i've played so far.Seeing the progress this game has made when it first went onto Early Access to where we are now, is quite impressive.The developers are focused and never fail to deliver new content every weekIf anyone would ask me to recommend this game, I'd give a big thumbs up and say yes....And then blow them up with my ship ""Athena"".

								Greatly enjoying the planets update.  =)  I have heard from others that it can be a bit laggy, and they still have a bit of work to do on netcode.  I have yet to try multiplayer since the planets update, but from my single player experience performance has been great.  The planets add a MUCH needed context to the game, and it feels like a real game now with a worthwhile survival mode, and not just an environment to try out different technical mechanics in creative anymore.  Although that is still fun!			"

								Before buying this game I was not sure if it would be a good purchase but in fact it is: there's new content and updates almost every week and the developers care so much of the community. You should start playing survival and when you learn the mechanics of the game (they are a bit hard) start playing on multiplayer servers, you will find a lot of kind people that would not have any problem in explaining how something works.

								I'm having a ton of fun with this. It is basically Minecraft + vehicles. The vehicles can range from simple car driving around to massive interplanetary battle stations (like the Deathstar). The collision physics are pretty impressive. The only real bad thing I can say about it is the difficulty seems pretty unbalanced. Meteor showers on ""normal"" happen every 5 minutes or so which seems very excessive. Overall I'd give this 4/5. It does what it promises. It just need a balancing pass and some polish on the rough edges.			"

								This game is really fun to play with your friends, and i know i dont have so many hours played on it, but just in the beginning of the game it was pretty fun, it takes some time to figure out the basics like fuel for you ship, how to mine, building and all that stuff. But once you know how to play the game, its fun to survive. And of course you can also ♥♥♥♥ the whole galaxy up with some crazy killer ship you build in creative mode. This game also have some random things sometimes like meteors shooting down places (you can turn those off if you dont like randomly loosing something on your ship/station or dying) Theres also other ships that will just fly in randomly like private sails and commercial satelites (of course you can turn them off) that has sentry guns that will shoot you if you get too close, and lets not forget you get to choose if you want a small, large or extreme amount of asteroids. Multiplayer is also REALLY fun both with friends and random people, survival is hard in the beginning, but becomes fun after you get more experienced while creative is fun from the beginning, but i would recommend watching the tutorial because it has some really usefull stuff. And i havent incountered any bugs yet. I give this game 9/10 because i really enjoyed the time i have played it, but i would love to see some more character animations.			"

								Please take notice that this is my very first reveiw of a steam game, so if I write this incorrectly please bear with me. Thanks!With that out of the way... I would really love to recommend this game, I really would.  The graphics are great, the physics are superb; and the multitude of fantastic creations by other people really makes it exciting.  But I cannot recommend it for one simple reason; Space engineers is nigh-impossible for beginners.  Its a paradox, I know that, but its true.  To start with, the tutorials are broken. Plain and simple.  I don't know if this is a weird/freak personal experience or not, but both the conveyors tutorial (#4), and the conveyors in the game proper cannot be placed.  The ""small conveyor tube"", an item essential to both the tutorial and the game itself literally do not exist in the inventory and there is no help on how to acquire them.  Additionally there are other known problems with the power tutorial and some other issues with the game.  Feel free to shoot me a message if you know how to fix this, until then... I have to say DO NOT BUY at anywhere close to full price.Pros-Great GraphicsPhysics is excellentLooks fun and engagingMod workshop Allows for creativityCons-Tutorials are brokenUI is counterintuitive and confusing at timesItems do not work properly (conveyors)No help from game on how to find different types of items in inventorySo far very few bug fixes...

								This is like Minecraft evolved, in space. The basics are the same: Mine, refine, build, repeat, but with the complexity cranked up  (Along with the upper limit of creativity) to 11. In other words, the new ""Adult"" Minecraft.With that said, some things are far too clumsy in Early access, there is less directed ""game"" than MC (No bosses to find and slay), and starting out is extremely rough, but I can see this going to amazing places. Also, the controls are atrocious but can be rebound in less than 2 mins easily enough. (Also it supports extra mouse buttons!!!)I hope there is a game roadmap somewhere, or will be soon. My only concern is what kind of polish and additional features the devs plan but even what's there now in EA is worth the price.			"

								I bought this game a few years ago thinking it was going to be just Minecraft in space, and it is. It's a really good game.However, KSH has evolved the specs over time, rendering the game unplayable with my hardware, even on legacy mode. It's just one big benchmark/slideshow for my card nowadays because there are no efforts being placed for serious optimization or even just a low-graphics mode (low-poly everything, minimum shaders).I cannot refund the game since it has been such a long time, Even if I upgraded my computer, my brother would require the hardware upgrade as well, amounting the upgrade costs to be roughly $400 just to play this game. Now you're thinking ""baahh go away poor kid"" but we are the silent majority.If you're an adult with a disposable income, go ahead and buy. Otherwise, you better keep your money in your wallet until you get a new computer.			"

Early Access Review
								Unfortunately I've had to rereview this game. Intially it was one of my favorite early access titles, boasting some interesting features not seen elsewhere and a decent clip to the development pace.However over the last year or so the game hasn't really improved much. It's become more and more buggy and unplayable with every update, and the only really significant feature added has been planets. The game is barren of almost any core gameplay or content, leaving you with very little to do in the off chance you actually manage to get the thing to run and move past building your inital base and miner.The Creative mode is fairly fun, but there's only so many hours of entertainment availble from minecraft in space using far less parts to work with, and the game has trouble handling truly massive constructions. Plus with the multiplayer as buggy as it is, you're fairly well relegated to building things on your own and not showing them to people.This game could be a really amazing survival/builder game, as well as a very interesting pvp game, but there's no indication it's ever going to become bug free enough to reliably play online, let alone actually get the features needed to support such gameplay.Do NOT buy this game until some point in the distant future when it actually has some core gameplay and isn't more bugs than game, or it's been abandoned and you decide you're ok with paying whatever price it is for an unfinished product.Edit: Hadn't seen the latest update when I wrote this. Holy ♥♥♥♥ this just gets even more unplayable every update. Even if we could keep a server running for more than five minutes the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dog update would make the game impossible to play.Edit:2 it's been what, almost two years since I wrote this review? Well it's still true. The progress on the game continues at a snails pace and there's more bugs than actual gameplay.If the devs would calm the ♥♥♥♥ down on gamebreaking new features and bug fix for two more years maybe this POS will be as playable as it was when I first bought it three years ago once more.

								I'm having a ton of fun with this. It is basically Minecraft + vehicles. The vehicles can range from simple car driving around to massive interplanetary battle stations (like the Deathstar). The collision physics are pretty impressive. The only real bad thing I can say about it is the difficulty seems pretty unbalanced. Meteor showers on ""normal"" happen every 5 minutes or so which seems very excessive. Overall I'd give this 4/5. It does what it promises. It just need a balancing pass and some polish on the rough edges.			"

								Before buying this game I was not sure if it would be a good purchase but in fact it is: there's new content and updates almost every week and the developers care so much of the community. You should start playing survival and when you learn the mechanics of the game (they are a bit hard) start playing on multiplayer servers, you will find a lot of kind people that would not have any problem in explaining how something works.

								Grindfest. The only objective is to build a ship and that will take you a long time. Nearly impossible to find any other players. If you die you lose everything. Wish there was more to it because it has potential. Oh by the way you will kill yourself very easily if you bump in to something, so you will just find yourself at the respawn screen again.			"

								Greatly enjoying the planets update.  =)  I have heard from others that it can be a bit laggy, and they still have a bit of work to do on netcode.  I have yet to try multiplayer since the planets update, but from my single player experience performance has been great.  The planets add a MUCH needed context to the game, and it feels like a real game now with a worthwhile survival mode, and not just an environment to try out different technical mechanics in creative anymore.  Although that is still fun!			"

								Space Engineers is one of those games that does it right for an Early Access title.Yes, the game may have bugs and yes, you are most likely to experience them.But unlike other reviews on this game, you cannot forget that you are playing an Early Access game.I don't get why everyone is giving this game bad reviews because of the bugs, unless they somehow expected a bug free environment from an early access title?Space Engineers gets updated every week on Thursday, and the developers tend to have sleepless nights to make sure they deliver an update every Thursday.Recently, planets where added to this game, and man, did they deliver.It's enjoy-full to see how this game has progressed so far -- We went from building ships and then crashing them in single player, to playing survival with friends (or crashing ships with friends) and now, we get to do it all over again, but on beautiful looking planets!Not satisfied with that? Then take your ship and go land on an alien planet, and do your best to stay alive against those ""space spiders""!MultiplayerMultiplayer was added along the way to this game, as the community desired it the most.This resulted in KSH getting it added as soon as possible, which while it works, it does glitch out, but have no fear.The multiplayer is being re-worked completely and we can already see the effects from this. (EG: Space Master Mode)PlanetsAlot of users have been complaining about the performance with planets, and I guess it was slightly expected that they would have a decent performance hit.Sadly, this performance hit can make the game unplayable for most users (Altho, I don't have any issue with running them.)What does sadden me, is that people started to give negative reviews to the game because of this, claiming ""they broke the game completely"", but this is so incorrect.You can always just launch a world without planets (There is literately nothing preventing you from doing this),  and continue playing like you did before. And then just wait until the game receives more optimization.ConclusionFor me, this game is one of the best space building/survival type game i've played so far.Seeing the progress this game has made when it first went onto Early Access to where we are now, is quite impressive.The developers are focused and never fail to deliver new content every weekIf anyone would ask me to recommend this game, I'd give a big thumbs up and say yes....And then blow them up with my ship ""Athena"".

								EDIT: 12/22/2016Just recently there was a very large update to the game's multiplayer infrastructure. I participated in beta testing and have played the new update a little bit. I will be playing a bit more before coming to a final conclusion, but many of the issues addressed in this review have been more or less fixed from what I can tell thus far. Only time will tell. For now, this review will remain negative, but that may change soon.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW: 7/13/2016Unfortunately, as of right now I cannot recommend this game to anyone who wishes to play with anybody but themselves. I can sum it up like this: would you want to be in the barren wasteland of space alone? Probably not.Should you play with friends, the inability to walk in a moving ship, the broken state of planets, the lack of ability to just build something massive and cool, all of that is gone. You will never be able to play this game at a decent framerate, nor will your server be able to handle anything more than about 20 blocks long and 20 blocks wide.I had fun with this game, and I really want to like it and recommend it, but until something is figured out to make it worth it to someone without a ridiculous rig or has some sort of managable multiplayer, I don't think it's worth the money.

								So this is about space. About you being a little guy / gal on your own to build. Why? I dont know, build what? Basically whatever you want. No real plot, But it works out well.  You can start in many differnt ways, but I wanted to get a feel for the 'whole' of the game, so I started in Survival mode, ( limited resources ) in a Rescue ship.  This starts you with a ship that has all the basics you need to get going, and about 15 minutes of flight time on fuel. I have been expirementing and working on learning how things do what. Its pretty amazing what all can be built.A good little game to mess with. Granted, all you do right now is mine, build and you can go after NPC ships, or online vs other people, so it may not hold your attention forever, but its well worth the time to try it out. Just remember, in space, its a cold lonely death if you fail...			"

								Space engineers is perhaps the greatest sandbox game ever invented.As the name suggests, it's all about space, there are spacecraft to design, bases to build and asteroids to mine.The physics and spaceship building is incredibly well-done, newton's laws are well at play, for instance, ramming a ship will push it away, and will force your ship to move back aswell (or atleast the part of the ship that survived), by holding the movement keys in a spaceship, it will start building speed, and without thrusters put in the opposing direction (inertia dampeners), it's NEVER gonna stop moving, so you have to put trusters in all directions, should you want to move freely through the cosmos.In order to make your ship fly, you'll need power and trusters, and in order to make it turn, you need gyroscopes, wich are ALL affected by the mass of the ship.The building blocks given by the game allows you to make fantastic looking ships and new items are being added all the time.Bottom line: this game is great, if you like floating around in space and building stuff, buy it, as it is definitely worth your money.

								""I came to explore space. I left dissappointed.""Before you get your panties all bunched up, this is an EARLY ACCESS REVIEW, as stated above. This is not a final review, it's merely a disclosure for people who would buy the game AS IS, NOW. The fact that it's so difficult for people to grasp is quite saddening.This game is grand. Grand is scale and looks. It has great mechanics and fantastic multiplayer potential. However it falls well short of any sort of longevity. The Survival mode itself revolves around plugging yourself into an outlet and charging up energy. In the ""Survival"" mode there's basically one thing you need to do. Mine. So pick up a drill, make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ship and go dig a hole. That's it. Progression? There is none. Blueprints, unlockable schematics, anything? Nope. Earthworm Engineers more like it.Build a space station out of the same four blocks you'll use for everything else and..do NOTHING with it. Can't even decorate it with ..well..anything. It's beautiful, it has potential to be an expansive, amazing, hardcore survival / exploration game..yet the devs have recently shot down any sort of interest in including anything that would enhance a multiplayer survival mode. Expansive world to explore, but guess what..there's nothing in it! The developers decided against adding any form of AI. So no enemies, no rebel ships trying to shoot you down. NOTHING. That is what this game really amounts to. Shiny, shiny nothingness. Sure, you can mess with physics, do some fun stuff like that. Go into creative and build a massive ship. That's awesome! But what's the point? In ""Survival"" building..well..anything nets you..well..nothing. There's nothing opposing you, nothing. Mining nodes are not varied, random ghost ships float around and do nothing, and there are no planets or structures to go to.In my honest opinion they should hand this game over to the modding community and let some people with actual ambition and scope get on the project. The modders of Minecraft came up with a more indepth and exciting ""Space"" mod. I had to worry about oxygen, food, light, a home, my suit, finding blueprints, expanding my station, avoiding monsters. Just beneath the surface is something great, it's awfully sad to see the developers squandering it. But it's their game and my money, and I'll be taking it elsewhere in the future.The bottom line is that if you wan't progression and longevity of your playtime, this is not the game for you. And for me, progression and development are key. So it's not for me, and I don't have to defend that.  ""General Statement. These are my thoughts on the game. Any opposing or likeminded feelings are welcome to be directed and discussed at me, however, don't be an idiot about it.""			"

								To cut to the chase, no I don't recommend this game. But I recommend it to ONLY people who like over complicated and relentlessly hard/sometimes annoying gameplay style, where physics in this game is very realistic, and all of your stats are based on a strict real life scenario, an engineer.Story Line/campaign: Does not exist (yet)Gameplay/replayability/learning curve: 2/10Game mechanics/GUI: 6/10AI: 10/10Graphics/art/models/animation: 9/10Functionality/performance: 6/10Content provided: 10/10Survival: 1.5/5Creative: 4/5Now why are these scores looking generous yet I'm not recommending the game? So let's start off with saying what is right with the game.Planets. 'Nuff said. Planets are huge and blow away 99% of the audience's expectations, INCLUDING mine. Planets are big, Space is big, you can jump your ship across a freaking galaxy, and when you get up to Space, OH... is it rewarding. Resources come at you generously, and you don't have to worry about gravity, and it is so... realistic. Launching a rocket up into space is both hard, and rewarding. The content levels are extreme, and visually + sounds... it's amazing. The full combinations of things you can build/make is great, and the developers of this game are excellent. The detail into imagination of creation is tons better than Minecraft, and you can program your ship to GIVE COMMANDS or MAKE IT AN AI!!!! Though it is lonely... so you should make AI to fend off against other AI.But...As much as it pains me to admit, the game Space Engineers will never be enjoyable to play. The game is fun at times, but it has a limit of fun because of how the game is played and made. Now don't get me wrong, planets is extremely perfect and the devs could NOT have made it any better. The expectations are over the top. But what is wrong with the game? Survival, the controls, and everything about the game via core mechanics and controls is HORRIBLE. You have to keep an ever watch on physics, building blocks take forever to build with limited inventory space, and running back and forth from destination to destination getting this and that component at quantities of 10-100 of EACH component, trying to remember what any object requires, topped with your oxygen AND energy AND jetpack hydrogen ticking down is the most ridiculous thing I have encountered on this entire planet! The game is not even worth playing, when things you build, die and disappear so freaking frequently, that you'll also rage quit once every play through and probably not play the game for another while.Lag is a big concern. Objects colliding is a big deal, and the attempt at generating thousands of trees is a cumbersome experience. Ship parts gets destroyed and disappear at hilarious times when not supposed to, multiplayer servers take time to respond to commands, and few other bugs/glitches to take away from enjoyment, but slightly. Still immersive in the long run, but the core mechanics of this game is extremely stupid, tacked on with bugs makes you sit there pondering at the game....replayability and learning curve is JUST NO. Why would I want to replay my game when the game keeps crashing, my ships keep crashing, I keep dying easily, and blocks are TOO DANG HARD to construct?!?!?! How are you supposed to learn any of this? Because of horrible learning curves, 85-90% of my friends don't wanna play survival, ever.Finally the GUI. What... the... hell is up with the build command complexity. You start with blocks in your quickslots you probably don't use, figuring out how to equip weapons is all tiresome, stiffly implemented, and hard to figure out. The control panel??? A mess. So many clusterfeck options that your brain goes numb, and the defaults of wheels is so WTFU, that building a vehicle on land takes AGES to figure out and get working correctly.Going back to core gameplay mechanics, sure the game is supposed to be slow. I get that, but if you have actual flaws to deal with, it is like a clog in your brain. SURE... you can store items into your containers and build welders on your ships and stuff and start weldin' but your welders if they even TOUCH objects at times, they just explode along with your resources and then that butt hurt flows through you like a disease of TROLLING... then you'll probably sit back and ponder at the screen for 5-30 minutes wondering, ""what am I doing with my life?""The 300 hours I spent into this game is mostly me building up whatever I want (which is the cool part about the game), exploring planets, coding AI, and going back into the game to see new updates released every Thursday.This is why I do not recommend the game. I'm sorry. I really am... as I like this game, but I want to like it more...PS: I know it is in alpha still, but the potential in this game still exists... yet the devs ignore gameplay value over ""perty graphics"" and eye candy.

								-------Edit 2-------Infinite World Generation lost my job CPS took my kids cant stop playing help-------Edit 1-------Not a week after I wrote this review, the Devs did another update and added the option of spawning your own asteroids.For those of you who didn't read this review, I noted my only semi-complaint was the lack of random generation/asteroid fields etc. While not 100% random world generated, it is a massive leap in the right direction. My rating now goes to 11/10----------------------Original Review----------------------Great game. If you like sandbox-y classics like Minecraft, you will love Space Engineers. Dev's work hard to update the game as often as every week. The only con really is multiplayer (And this is kind of a big one because the game, like Minecraft, can be boring playing only by yourself.) Theres a bit of a desync issue when playing with others but Ive noticed it improve with each patch.Worth $20? At first I thought it might be a bit overpriced, but taking time to think, I would spend it again. Great community of builders and survivalists. Plenty of servers to mess around on and the convienent option to play on 'soft server/LAN' mode (you basically make your world public or friend-visible) rather than having to host your own server. Great if you don't plan on trying to build a big community and just want to mess around with a couple of friends.A real nice recent addition was Blueprints. Basically, it enables you to save your precious builds and not have to care about your stuff getting blown to hell. Before, you have to make an offline private 'hangar/shipdock' world to build your designs and save them and import them to other worlds. Now you can just make something, save it to blueprints and take them with you to other maps, worlds and servers.A small irritation, not even what I would consider a Con: The world generation options are a bit limited. I would like to see the ability to have a TRUE randomly generated world like Minecraft where every so many 100 kilometers or so, new asteroid fields spawn. However, currently, when you make a map, you select an option for a small (around 3), medium (6) or large (10+) asteroids centralized in the middle of the map. Everything outside of that is just dead space. Now granted, if you run your own server, you can spawn asteroids at locations all you want. But it would still be nice to have the randomly generated world truely.. well, generate stuff other than empty space. Small asteroid clusters and other intersteller phenemena. I think by doing so it will make the game more fun and give way to more of an exploration feeling. Plus, in Survival mode, you really cant afford to leave the asteroid fields and not have access to raw materials.			"

								i'm finally ready to endorse Space Engineers as a recommended purchase for my friends. recent mods and updates have really brought the game close to being 100% playable and fun. definitely worth early access price, absolutely worth sale prices.specifically the Exploration update has made this game immense and thus troll proof, while still allowing for that extra edge of full open PVP and griefing in a sandbox builder. servers with fast movement (FTL jump drives or Stargates) and navigation (GPS/Waypoint mod) also now provide the tools for a rich Faction vs Faction endgame without any need for arbitraty rules of engagement.basically it's time for you guys to start learning this game so we can build a Faction and start dominating.

								Amazing game that anyone can enjoy. It's less about following objectives as most games are these days and more about using your personal creativity to create your own fun. Like Garry's Mod but in a much cleaners, styled fashion, give users a much more streamlined building system and the tools to do whatever their heart desires. The workshop is rich with mods and other user content, and it's easy to share your creations with others, and just as easy to download and use the creations others make. Weekly updates from the developers means there are constant improvements and fixes coming to the game at a steady pace as well.However, in my experience when ever I have been on to play the game (Most common times players in the AEST Timezone and similar would be on) The amount of players on servers is limited at best. On rare occasions a 10-15 slot server will be full, but other than that the lack of players can mean a limited interaction with others making playing on servers providing the same experience if not less in terms of player interaction plus issues you might experience with your connection to said server. To resolve this I would highly recommend talking you friend into buying this game or even buying it for them if you wish to play multiplayer, at least until the community grows. All in all there are probably plenty of games with a bigger player base and more content then Space Engineers, but the ability to sculpt the game to your needs is really unique feature to have in a game and no other game pulls this off better then this. There is plenty of room for new content and improvements but as it is now this is one of the best games on Steam right now and worth every cent. Can't wait for the player base to grow, see you in game!			"

								To cut to the chase, no I don't recommend this game. But I recommend it to ONLY people who like over complicated and relentlessly hard/sometimes annoying gameplay style, where physics in this game is very realistic, and all of your stats are based on a strict real life scenario, an engineer.Story Line/campaign: Does not exist (yet)Gameplay/replayability/learning curve: 2/10Game mechanics/GUI: 6/10AI: 10/10Graphics/art/models/animation: 9/10Functionality/performance: 6/10Content provided: 10/10Survival: 1.5/5Creative: 4/5Now why are these scores looking generous yet I'm not recommending the game? So let's start off with saying what is right with the game.Planets. 'Nuff said. Planets are huge and blow away 99% of the audience's expectations, INCLUDING mine. Planets are big, Space is big, you can jump your ship across a freaking galaxy, and when you get up to Space, OH... is it rewarding. Resources come at you generously, and you don't have to worry about gravity, and it is so... realistic. Launching a rocket up into space is both hard, and rewarding. The content levels are extreme, and visually + sounds... it's amazing. The full combinations of things you can build/make is great, and the developers of this game are excellent. The detail into imagination of creation is tons better than Minecraft, and you can program your ship to GIVE COMMANDS or MAKE IT AN AI!!!! Though it is lonely... so you should make AI to fend off against other AI.But...As much as it pains me to admit, the game Space Engineers will never be enjoyable to play. The game is fun at times, but it has a limit of fun because of how the game is played and made. Now don't get me wrong, planets is extremely perfect and the devs could NOT have made it any better. The expectations are over the top. But what is wrong with the game? Survival, the controls, and everything about the game via core mechanics and controls is HORRIBLE. You have to keep an ever watch on physics, building blocks take forever to build with limited inventory space, and running back and forth from destination to destination getting this and that component at quantities of 10-100 of EACH component, trying to remember what any object requires, topped with your oxygen AND energy AND jetpack hydrogen ticking down is the most ridiculous thing I have encountered on this entire planet! The game is not even worth playing, when things you build, die and disappear so freaking frequently, that you'll also rage quit once every play through and probably not play the game for another while.Lag is a big concern. Objects colliding is a big deal, and the attempt at generating thousands of trees is a cumbersome experience. Ship parts gets destroyed and disappear at hilarious times when not supposed to, multiplayer servers take time to respond to commands, and few other bugs/glitches to take away from enjoyment, but slightly. Still immersive in the long run, but the core mechanics of this game is extremely stupid, tacked on with bugs makes you sit there pondering at the game....replayability and learning curve is JUST NO. Why would I want to replay my game when the game keeps crashing, my ships keep crashing, I keep dying easily, and blocks are TOO DANG HARD to construct?!?!?! How are you supposed to learn any of this? Because of horrible learning curves, 85-90% of my friends don't wanna play survival, ever.Finally the GUI. What... the... hell is up with the build command complexity. You start with blocks in your quickslots you probably don't use, figuring out how to equip weapons is all tiresome, stiffly implemented, and hard to figure out. The control panel??? A mess. So many clusterfeck options that your brain goes numb, and the defaults of wheels is so WTFU, that building a vehicle on land takes AGES to figure out and get working correctly.Going back to core gameplay mechanics, sure the game is supposed to be slow. I get that, but if you have actual flaws to deal with, it is like a clog in your brain. SURE... you can store items into your containers and build welders on your ships and stuff and start weldin' but your welders if they even TOUCH objects at times, they just explode along with your resources and then that butt hurt flows through you like a disease of TROLLING... then you'll probably sit back and ponder at the screen for 5-30 minutes wondering, ""what am I doing with my life?""The 300 hours I spent into this game is mostly me building up whatever I want (which is the cool part about the game), exploring planets, coding AI, and going back into the game to see new updates released every Thursday.This is why I do not recommend the game. I'm sorry. I really am... as I like this game, but I want to like it more...PS: I know it is in alpha still, but the potential in this game still exists... yet the devs ignore gameplay value over ""perty graphics"" and eye candy.

								Great game. The multiplayer is a bit of a mess but good for a few people with reasonable ships. The workshop mods are great. If you're playing survival be preppared to cry a bit. The god of space engineers name is Clang. When your piston becomes misaligned, the landing gear glitches or a rotor spins out of control you will hear his name chanted Clang, Clang, Clang. Then your devices explode and you know the Wrath of Clang.			"

								Let me just say, concept is AMAZING. I've spent many hours in this game. I love sandbox space games.Do not recommend because the game is broken by the developer about every 2nd patch. Developer is obsessed with adding features regardless of how they affect the games functionality, and completely miss the point when it comes to say, a useable multiplayer. So while we have many widgets with more being added every week, multi player is pretty much unplayable and about every other patch there is a new game crash due to some feature they added. This game is perpetually broken, and I doubt it will ever leave alpha.Keen: If you guys would just make a viable, finished product your reputation as game developers would be much better.			"

								When I first installed this game I was thrilled at the concept. Now as with most early access games it has been shelved until works.If broken buggy games annoy you wait until its finished and come back and check on it later. I don't think it is ever going to get there as the entire project is fundamentally flawed.Pistons don't work, rotors don't work etc and they can't fix them.The price is definitely over inflated. Gamer's need to stop supporting poor software incomplete on Steam.			"

								Space Engineers has potential. Never have I seen a game that so immerses you with the feeling that you are actually in space. Instead of having an obligatory ""up"" and ""down,"" as is common with games to reduce frustration while also relaying a sense of rigidity, Space Engineers only has vectors. There is no ""up,"" ""down,"" ""left,"" or ""right."" All those are lost in translation to space because all of them are relative  to gravity. This leads to comedic events, confusing orientations, and overall an enjoyable experience that seems to be subverted in similar games. The building strays from the blocky features of games like Minecraft, which is beautiful in it's own right, and instead opts to have more shapes to give angular slopes to your creations.This is a breath of fresh air in terms of appearance. However, I previously stated that this game has potential, and that is crucial to take into consideration when buying a game in its early stages of development. The game features a variety of activities that should keep you occupied at first, but grows repetitive after a while. Until weapons, multiplayer, and other essential features are added, this game is soley a singleplayer game with a limited amount of past times. If you cannot bear to have a game and little reason to play it, I suggest you wait until the full release, or, at the very least, until multiplayer is released.			"

								Space Engineers is an open-world sandbox game where you take on the role of a engineer of stellar proportions. While the wonderful screenshots and description of this game are very convincing; the game runs like utter garbage. The developers have built their own engine for this game, but as others have mentioned as well: The game somehow feels like a Unity game. It is well stated that the game is in fact not based off Unity, but the poor performance optimizations tend to shed some similarity between them. Because this is early access, this sort of problem at the moment; is fully excusable. If the game goes out of early access, then this will be a big problem for many gamers. As other reviewers (even positive ones have mentioned); the game's potential is great and the concepts that it lays out are very unique from other open-world sandbox titles. But if the developers don't start focusing on major performance optimizations, then I expect this game will fall short for a long crowd. My FPS in the game with a GTX 680 4GB card never goes any higher than 28 FPS, and often dips to 3 FPS with all the graphics on low. Overall, unless you have a GTX titan with 12 GB of RAM and a Core I7 with 4.0 GHz, you will probably not be able to enjoy this game (the low settings make it look really ugly.)			"

								Fun game, but riddled with massive bugs. The development of this title seems to be focused on pointless things and not optimizing anything that already exists. Most things seem broken or uninteresting after a while for example all vehicles have been buggy pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥ever since they first introduced wheels in the game. Also the global speed limit of the game engine makes everything a bit lackluster as it creates this barrier for creativity and at the same time makes travelling in space unbelievably boring.I'd say avoid this title until it's fully released, if that ever even happens. I truly don't believe Space Engineers will be concidered as feature-complete ever.			"

								This game is fun, but gets old pretty quickly.It allows you to mine for minerals, build surface and space bases, ships and rovers. You can also set-up an automated factory line inside your base or ship, create remote controlled vessels and build other contraptions.And that's about it.Granted, it will give you many hours of fun, but for every hour of fun you'll pay with an hour of frustration. I bought this game years ago, and I was hoping it will improve over time. Sadly, the development is not fast enough (or focused on wrong things)On to the bad things:- Multiplayer is broken. You will be stuck, you wil lexperience lag, there will be jitter, weird things will happen. And even if it works, the only interaction you may have with others is to shoot at them.- Physics is broken. Speed limit is silly, colissions are coutner-intuitive, Wheeled vehicles - so prominently displayed in promo screenshots - work in such an awful way it's ubelievable! There is 0 rewardin building a rover/jeep- There is nothing to do except to survive.tl;dr:Multiplayer broken, singleplayer boring, quality still low despite years of development.			"

								I really like this game. The idea of a spaceship minecraft-like game with an awesome physics engine was really apealling and when I first go it I wasn't dissapointed. But this game has many issues I think you should know about before buying it. When I first bought the game it was fairly buggy but not bad for an alpha title and it's weekly releases left me confident it would only improve from there. I was wrong. The developers were so focused on adding more and more content to the game it quickly became unstable. On planets as far as I can tell maintaining a solid 30 fps is difficult and 60fps is flatout impossible. The game also encounters huge performance issues when you attempt to build larger ships so you can kiss any hopes of massive battleships goodbye. The multiplayer leaves alot to be desired with simulation speeds tanking to .60 or below. But the worst part is, despite all these issues the developers continue to release weekly updates adding more flash to the game with seemingly no intent on fixing it's performance.Now if you stay inside these limitations it is a very fun game if you enjoy building spaceships and I will still come back and play it every onceand a while. If you can learn to live with framerate issues and bugs you'll probably enjoy it too but in it's current state I just can't recommend it.			"

								Space engineers is an amazing game. With constant updates, great modding community and active servers all around it doesn't just dump you in the world and let you fend for youself. Playing the game does, however, plant you in the middle of nowhere and you have to figure stuff out. That is great. Multiplayer suvival is fun, with multiple ways of making your ways around the universe. Creative, of which I've only played SP, is awesome. The amount of things you can build and design, even without mods, is amazing. It does fit into the same catergory as Rust, that being the ""I'm an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a bigger gun than you"" but it takes longer and is harder to achieve getting some serious fire power and every fight leaves you with something to do, like repairing damaged hulls or reloading rocket launchers. 9/10			"

								I have never had the need to (or wanted to) review any game,but Space Engineers deserves all the praise it can get! I have been playing this game for some time and have 590 hours on record and in my opinion this is a brilliant game. The type of player this game best suits is someone who likes survival, resourse gathering,survival building, creative building, and has a good imagination. As I said I have been playing for a long time and I have yet to run out of ideas!There are some disadvantages such as minor bugs e.g lighting problems, the odd ship that just explodes for no reason, and that the game is very taxing on low end PCs, but most bugs are patched and there is just so much to do in the game that these disadvantages are dwarfed by the  size and enjoyment of the game, and as for running Space Engineers on your PC, once you meet the minimum requirements the game works fine (just dont go near planets)The game developers have been excellent since day one bringing out constant updates every week and fixing issues that the community have had. On top of all this there is a vibrant modding community with steam workshop support which enhances the game so so much, allowing you to build ships and contraptions from your favourite movies etc (Star wars!!)This game has been my favourite for a long time and will likely stay that way, and I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested. Thanks for reading and keep building!EXTRA: I have seen a few negative reviews of this game and they seem to be annoyed about the same thing, the un-stable state of multiplayer, but something you need to keep in mind is that the game is fine in solo and in small multi-player servers, the problem arises with lots of people in servers with many complex blocks. If you try and avoid these bigger servers (which can easily be done, I haven't played in one yet) you are still left with a brilliant game with near limitless possibilities.			"

								Limited edition. Like forever and quite limited. Promising ideas at start turned into seemingly endless & almost useless update story. Too much sand in this sandbox.Great community creating and doing incredible things, even repairing bugs themselves but this project is now almost 3 years old and despite weekly updates it still feels like probably 1 year old. Some things are too booring, predefined and after all this time - poor. Some break the whole time. Ingame coding part limited in access to many important parameters/commands. Multiplayer progressively losing simspeeds. Battles lame. Planetary aircraft incapable of aerodynamics without a mod. Planets themselves too synthetic and useless. ""Painted"" Sun on background circling planets. Iron, Cobalt, Nickel,.. Gold, Platinum yet no Copper. Do they really use silver wires? :)Main reason? There are just better games out there. Kerbal for space tinkerers, other for battle oriented.Still a nice try. Would have recommended 2 years ago. Not anymore.Early access. ETA 2021+			"

Not only that but it's also incredibly bug-ridden. I tried playing this game with four people, and ALL FOUR of us experienced multiple crashes. Hell I even got a crash while looking for my friends server to join at the main screen. It is that unstable.It being just an ""alpha"" doesn't cut it. This game was released two years ago so it shouldn't even be a damn alpha now. The developers releasing it as an alpha and never leaving that stage of development is just a means to allow them to be dismissive over this game being buggy/badly optimized for those that buy it. I don't recommend this game to anyone. The only way you can enjoy it is if you're a masochist and can stomach a perma-alpha game.			"

								A very fun and interesting game to play with friends or just by yourself. I would recommend starting things easy before tackling the major parts of the game like survival mode and sceanrios that pit you by yourself or just limited resources.The mods are quite interesting, the mod community for this game is creative with their mods and hopefully that will contiue to last.There are a only couple issues with this game but the primary concern is  the 'tutorial' there isn't any, just a 'guide' of sorts in order for the player to help them guide their way through that particular scenario. Trouble is what supplies go with which? what buttons do i have to press? It's these kind of things that makes tutorials in games like this worth it. Should you get it? yes you should but prepare to really lose track of time as this game will take a long time for you to make any big progress, this isn't a fast pacing space epic, or some action adventure game.

My first ship was an ugly one, it is currently floating unmanned thru space in pieces after I crashed into an astroid. But learning the mechanics of the game I am currently making a way nicer one, that hopefully fairs better than the last one.

								Space Engineers is a sandbox game which should have gotten better as it slowly emerged from Alpha. However sand continues to leak out the corners and cracks. Game content needed to make the game world compelling is still not really there, new blocks and planets aren't a replacement for AI to fight, or NPCs to trade with.This game has so much potential for modding, however the ModAPI remains very incomplete. You can get access to the source code to add things, but Keen Software refuse to assign a programmer to sift through the code people give them that would improve the game/modding. You can ask for things to be added, but months later nothing will have happened.So Keen won't add the content the game needs, and you can't mod it in yourself.Game runs slower than it did 18 months ago, and needs better hardware/OS as well.Players have taken to giving a persona to the game Physics bugs, Clang the god of random explosions or crashing into things.

								I never understood why people like Minecraft. To be honest, it's the graphics. I can get into retro graphics in 2D indie games, but Minecraft just turned me off. Space Engineers, on the other hand, is gorgeous, and demonstrated to me exactly how much fun a creativity sandbox can be. It receives regular updates with cool new features and is quite stable, and the mod community is very active and supported by the developers. I've seen a lot of complaints about the developers recently. Most of the ♥♥♥♥♥ing you see about it is undeserved butthurt from people who want their butts kissed by developers; they do an amazing job at supporting existing players/designs/mods compared to most other game communities.Build spaceships erryday.

								Pros:This game has some really nice features and brilliant ideas, and how some ppl would call it ""some real potential""Negs:---- MULTIPLAYER ----The Netcode of this game is the biggest crap I've ever seen ... Clients connected to the host do constantly have Collision problems, means: You build a vehicle, drive with it, load it, get in and it randomly jumps into the air, does about 10 loopings and crashes on the land again and everything, your whole work is broken. Same for ships. I can't even build one car or ship and try to get 1 load of stuff, it everytime breaks somehow cause of some collision-glitch♥♥♥♥♥♥... If the netcode was better I'd really appreciate playing it but at this point its just unplayable in MP, that's why I not recommend it. Typicall Early Access bug stuff, I will never learn it ...			"

								Original Review (April 2015): This game has a lot of potential, but in its current state is difficult to play. As an early access game, perfection should not be expected. Nevertheless, there are regular problems with server crashes, components failing to work properly, disconnects causing the loss of resources you've spent ages mining, respawns considerably further away from your last position etc. Just establishing a basic medical bay (to allow fixed location respawn) had to be restarted more than 5 times because until you can build a medical bay, every time the server disconnects you, you have to respawn as a new character with no resources and start from scratch. It has a lot of potential but until at least the server issues are addressed, I would not recommend.Updated Review (April 2016): Server stability issues are not as prevalent as they once were, although server restarts are still fairly common. Unfortunately, there are a myriad of issues which have still never been addressed. For example, myself and friends have encounter bugs where a spawn ship will continually accelerate upwards, which forces you to turn upside down and attempt a crash landing. Landing gear frequently attempts to latch onto the ground (even when not set to do so). Mining by hand is still very awkward due to the physics of falling boulders. Glitches have seen players falling through sections of supposedly solid ground and ship components jumping around eratically when they should be in a fixed position. Sadly, for a game with so very much potential, it seems as though the devs are fixing graphical issues and ignoring the physics ones. To charge new players £18.99 for the privilege of a broken experience is absurd.			"

 I hope some day... I can´t recommend this game for now since there are so many bugs and performance issues. the game itself could be a big sandbox game but nothing changed.  major issues are:  -really bad performance-loading screen lasts forever-multiplayer is unplayable right now. if you and your friend travel with the same spaceship, your mate is dying every time. so frustrating-the game is empty just drones and a few ground ""animals"" not really hard to beat and no meaning to the survival gameplayThis game is just a big editor where you can fly or drive your creations. Its sad, cause the game has so much potential. especially for star trek fans with some interesst in spaceship technique.			"

								I highly recommend this game. I think the key to an early access game is having good developers who are working with a flexible engine. The game is given updates very frequently, and always with new features and not just bug fixes. The developers are very intuitive, and have been laying out the bedrock of this game very practically. It's already one of the most fun games in my large library, and they only just came out with survival mode. Creative mode is really fun on its own, but when they released survival, the quality of the game as a whole doubled. If you like Minecraft, you'll love this game.Please, please, please give the developers your money, they will utilize it better than almost anyone.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: Too much bulk, not enough polish. I've tried so many times to love this game. Everything about it makes it seem like a game I should love. I've played this game more than pretty much anything else in my library, watching it grow and evolve. You would think I would love the changes, the additions, the improvements... but the problem is that it feels like many of the improvements aren't really being meshed with the previous iterations. Its difficult to describe, and being a sandbox you could probably argue the you make what you want out of all the parts, but still... there is a feeling of incompletness, of disjointedness about the whole thing that I wouldn't expect out of a game that's been around this long (even in Early Access). It's a bit difficult to describe exact things, but I guess one example that goes back a little ways is the fact they introduced air, but didn't introduce a way to dock ships together that was airtight. Yes, you can make a werid, ugly, jerryrigged thing with mergeblocks and (if you want) airtight hanger doors, but nothing that makes you feel like you're handling a nice, futuristic, fancy space ship - more like you don't have all the right Lego peices because your brother took the right one and you have to make do. It just seems like a basic thing when it comes to space games - a way to get between ships in an aired-up environment. You have connector, why not make one that is the size of a door and when it locks its air tight? But instead of making a previous feature feel complete, they go and add planets (to a game called *Space* Engineers, btw...) and make a big deal out of it, but when you get there you're lucky if your ship doesn't glitch into the ground, and God forbid you want to put a block on top of the one you're looking at while on a planet - flat platforms for everyone! And somehow your drill just never seems to actually drill into anything.I love complex games. I love space games. And I want to love Space Engineers, but in the end the parts I want don't seem to exist or work properly - or they just don't *feel* right. Bulky interfaces, glitchy features, confusing development additions... I know the developers are trying, but in the end I fear they are adding bulk at the expense of polish, and a game this far along really should have some polish to make the bulk something worth admiring.

So much to do and see, with more on the way, limited only by your imagination.This title is only in Alpha, yet already has a fairly stable multiplayer option, and it updates on a weekly basis from a laundry list of things that users actually want.

In Space Engineers you can build a Borg Cube and crash it into an asteroid large enough to whipe out the dinosaurs.Need I say more?			"

								OK, first off let me say this: If there were a neutral option for this game, I would select it. Let's just get that out of the way now.Space Engineers: A game where, essentially, Minecraft meets asteroids. That's not a bad thing at all. It's actually a pretty awesome thing. The graphics are good, even on low, the ships you can make are AWESOME, and the multiplayer...well, I guess it depends on the server. Here's my big problem...the controls. In the trailer, it showed an engineer flawlessly flying, building, repairing, and moving. This was not my case. The way to rotate parts is very odd making the construction of the epic mothership I have formed in my mind much, much harder. Rotating yourself is a little easier, but still a little clunky (I'm not sure how to describe it.)When, after much deliberation, I made my ship, flying was FANTASTIC. The controls for flight are very simple to grasp, and make the game so much more enjoyable. The only relatively tough part of flying is the landing ""sequence."" Other than that, flying = fun as hell. The destruction of ships is very fun, too. I sometimes start up a new world for the sole purpose of breaking apart ships. If I had to score this game, I would probably give it a 7.5/10. The controls were the main drawback for me. If they were...smoothened (Again, not sure how to explain) then it would be much more fun. However, as of now, Space Engineers is a very average game in my opinion.			"

Space Engineers is amazing in many ways, I myself have played this many times (maybe not in the survival mode), where I'd either download mods, download maps or might build my own creations instead. Eitherway, this game sucks the creativity and time right out of your hands. You'll find yourself looking at the clock, wondering how you could sit for such a long time in front of the computer, without realizing daylight was gone.Story -/10 (There's none)Soundtrack 7/10Atmosphere 7/10Scenery 6/10Characters -/10 (There's none)Graphics 8/10Overall 7/10A creativity/survival based game, neither focused on story or action "

								Josh told me to buy this, and he mentioned it is not the final game so I don't know if I wanted to buy it yet, but he was having so much fun while talking on skype so I had to try it myself.I did not watch anything (videos or tutorials) and just got straight into it. It was god damn hard at first but I have been on it for hours trying to create some small ships to start with. It really does take patience to create a huge ship but its up to you on how it will look.At first, I did crash the ships that already are loaded into the quick-start options and it was so fun to see the pyhsics of the damage the ship had taken, not to mention it was fun to crash a ship into another.I then started to get used to the Camera and how it works, it's hard starting out but you will get used to it.I could ramble on a lot for how much fun you will have playing this just in single-player, yet I think they are releasing multiplayer in an update. This is what I (any I could guess a lot of others) are looking forward too. Gathering resources together, building a station, a huge epic fleet of ships to maybe have a war.I am so looking forward to updates on this game.			"

								This is truly one of the most engrossing games I have ever played! There are so many opportunities to build lots of different  ships and machines (using pistons and rotors among other things). The game style is similar to minecraft with the building aspects, but also includes modern graphics, physics (playing with gravity generators is super fun) and a full destruction engine. Also the modding community is alive and kicking with many many different blocks and new mods for the game under development.The gameplay is quite smooth for an early access game. Patches come out weekly and new features are constantly being added (but that is coming to an end in the near future as they have included nearly all intended features at this point). Some bugs are expected and present but that's what you get for an Early Access game. If you do not like bugs, wait for the full release!			"

								Extreamly entertaining and highly addictive. If your playing in survival mode, you constantly have to watch how much uranium you have and your suit energy if your mining without a ship. And don't even get me started on the physics, the little rocks you mined float and roll just like they would in real life. The armour distortion is amazing aswell. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone. This is a must have for all gamers!			"

								Space engineers is... The perfect combination of Minecraft Creativity combined with fun with physics we find in games like Garry's mod. Although many early access games have been an amazing waste of time and money, this game offers the player an original and addicting experience. Creative is a lot of fun, but from the survival gamemode I still expect great things (Although not being at all boring). All of you who have not bough this game yet; BUY! BUY! BUUUUUUUY!Edited: 25-6-2015The survival has more than developped into a well run machine. The addition of mods make the experience a lot more fun as well. Besides the fun with physics we are getting more and more options to operate the ship systems. Sensors allow you to automate systems within an area for example. Ingame scripts can be run through Programable blocks.All and all, this game is worth much more than they ask for it. But they won't, because they aren't EA. SPACE ENGINEERS IS LOVE, SPACE ENGINEERS IS LIVE!			"

								Epic timewaster game. Minecraft in space with jetpacks, vehicles, guns, turrets and huge♥♥♥♥♥spacecraft that you can build/drive around. Mine resources from asteroids and build space stations and defences and stuff and go raid other peoples' ships. LOTS of stuff to learn and see and very fun to play. The worlds are huge too, literally space infinite (well almost). Good physics engine and playable netcode even on distant servers, although the game has quite a few bugs in its current state (but that's a given for an early access title).At first I thought this was some kind of realistic space ""engineering"" simulator, but really it's not, it's more along the lines of very high tech Minecraft with gadgets. Can be played singleplayer or multiplayer and the worlds can be saved just like in Minecraft so you can continue from where you left off.			"

								Update: Now with planets!Space Engineers is a fun and relatively detailed sandbox game. The objective, is to build a ship and survive in your game world, You have to fight off pirates, mine for materials, and manage to survive the other players (in multiplayer). I myself spent the entire free weekend though in creative mode building an insanely large ship that had everything on it, looked nice, and managed to function reliably. I can't call myself experienced in Space Engineers whatsoever but I can say that if sandbox space building games interest you, or that my description of the game was intriguing, you should definitely give this game a look.

								This has to be one of my favorite builder games I have played in a long time. Starting off on the lone survivor difficulty it was a struggle to constantly get enough materials to supply a turret to keep the asteroids at bay (Totally optional as you can turn them off if you'd prefer but survival isn't survival without danger in my opinion) and it was chaotic. But when I finally had an operational mining ship I could expand. And expand I did. And thats the charm of this game. You spend hours putting things together, cobbling ships from whatever blocks you choose. When it finally call comes together and you have built your first ship from scratch there is a great sense of pride. Seeing what you crafted take flight, mine asteroids, construct parts at a far faster rate, tear down old stations in seconds, or whatever you made it for. It just feels great to see your creation come to life. Building a massive station with your friends makes it even better as your collective effort creates a powerful station where you can feel safe from the hazards of space.It may seem slow to craft parts but if you don't have a lot of time to sit and wait you can alter the speed of part construction  and how fast the refinery smelts down ore to x3 or x10 levels. Perfect if you only have time for a quick build before school or work. There is some basic combat right now with gatling turrets and rocket launchers to attach to ships but its not yet polished. I can see the potential though as I had one small ship made for combat. The guns had a good feel and power to them as I blasted a couple ships to little metal bits. And then I got blown up by my own rocket when a gatling turret on a ship auto targeted it as it fired out of the barrel. Sad but decoys prevent that if you have them.Only got this game a short time ago but it is definitely one of the best purchases I've made all year. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys builder games as this one brings it to whole new level of enjoyable complexity. I can see myself playing this game for months to come, and I can't wait to see the things I can build with every patch. 9/10 highly recommended.			"

								There are a ton of space shooter games out there that simulate several kinds of space flight. They allow you to be merchants, pirates, fighters, traders and so on. Some space shooters allow you to travel to other worlds while others let you explore the expansive galaxy.Space Engineers takes space flight to a whole new level of space flight. This is not just a game, it's a creation tool. Space Engineers, not only allows you to fly through space and battle it out with your enemies, but this game lets you also ""DESIGN"" your ship the way you want it, exactly how YOU want it. Space flight is no longer about just ships, it's about designing and showing off your ship designing skills. You can design fighters, frieghters, destroyers, dreadnauts, even space stations that take HOURS to travel the entire station. YOu can even design fighter ships inside the frieghters or space stations, so you havesomething to defend your stations or frieghters. Not only can you build your fighters, but you can also travel to asteroids and drill for minerals to design stronger materials to make better ships/stations for yourself.Space Engineers also lets you do either single edit where you just edit the ship on your own without others watching you, or you can have others join you online, either as allies and team work your stations, ships, destroyers, or you can battle it out against your friends to see who will have the best fighter ships and who can build the better ships.Along with that, if you think you have designed a good ship, you can post your ship creations on the Steam site and you can also check out other designs that others have made and see how they designed their ships. (UPDATE = As of now there are over 1,000 pages of Workshop items to view and download. Ships, stations, animations, asteroids, destroyers, mechanical devices, there's just nolimit to what you can do.)Space Engineers is no longer about just space flight. It's about taking the entire ""Build Your Space Empire"" to a whole new level of build and destroy. Build it, design it, add on to it, tweek it, create it, and use it, any way you see fit. Space Engineers is no longer about the game, it's all about ""YOU"". What ship do YOU want to design, and how will you control the space empire? Space Engineers, you know you wanna be one... ^_^ (The game was still in Beta when this review was given, but during this time, they had updated the game so that you can do online battles or coop, how ever you want to play online)			"

								OK, first off let me say this: If there were a neutral option for this game, I would select it. Let's just get that out of the way now.Space Engineers: A game where, essentially, Minecraft meets asteroids. That's not a bad thing at all. It's actually a pretty awesome thing. The graphics are good, even on low, the ships you can make are AWESOME, and the multiplayer...well, I guess it depends on the server. Here's my big problem...the controls. In the trailer, it showed an engineer flawlessly flying, building, repairing, and moving. This was not my case. The way to rotate parts is very odd making the construction of the epic mothership I have formed in my mind much, much harder. Rotating yourself is a little easier, but still a little clunky (I'm not sure how to describe it.)When, after much deliberation, I made my ship, flying was FANTASTIC. The controls for flight are very simple to grasp, and make the game so much more enjoyable. The only relatively tough part of flying is the landing ""sequence."" Other than that, flying = fun as hell. The destruction of ships is very fun, too. I sometimes start up a new world for the sole purpose of breaking apart ships. If I had to score this game, I would probably give it a 7.5/10. The controls were the main drawback for me. If they were...smoothened (Again, not sure how to explain) then it would be much more fun. However, as of now, Space Engineers is a very average game in my opinion.			"

								Space Engineers is an innovative and creative game. It has many things to keep the player intertained, like multiplayer, roleplaying, creating stations, building, crafting, mining, and crashing. Personally, I really enjoy this game because I would really want to go to space one day, but at the moment that is irrational; this game allows me to feel what it would be like to be in space. If I had to rate Space Engineers, I wold give it a 10/10.			"

								Space engineers is... The perfect combination of Minecraft Creativity combined with fun with physics we find in games like Garry's mod. Although many early access games have been an amazing waste of time and money, this game offers the player an original and addicting experience. Creative is a lot of fun, but from the survival gamemode I still expect great things (Although not being at all boring). All of you who have not bough this game yet; BUY! BUY! BUUUUUUUY!Edited: 25-6-2015The survival has more than developped into a well run machine. The addition of mods make the experience a lot more fun as well. Besides the fun with physics we are getting more and more options to operate the ship systems. Sensors allow you to automate systems within an area for example. Ingame scripts can be run through Programable blocks.All and all, this game is worth much more than they ask for it. But they won't, because they aren't EA. SPACE ENGINEERS IS LOVE, SPACE ENGINEERS IS LIVE!			"

								Josh told me to buy this, and he mentioned it is not the final game so I don't know if I wanted to buy it yet, but he was having so much fun while talking on skype so I had to try it myself.I did not watch anything (videos or tutorials) and just got straight into it. It was god damn hard at first but I have been on it for hours trying to create some small ships to start with. It really does take patience to create a huge ship but its up to you on how it will look.At first, I did crash the ships that already are loaded into the quick-start options and it was so fun to see the pyhsics of the damage the ship had taken, not to mention it was fun to crash a ship into another.I then started to get used to the Camera and how it works, it's hard starting out but you will get used to it.I could ramble on a lot for how much fun you will have playing this just in single-player, yet I think they are releasing multiplayer in an update. This is what I (any I could guess a lot of others) are looking forward too. Gathering resources together, building a station, a huge epic fleet of ships to maybe have a war.I am so looking forward to updates on this game.			"

This happened to me when I was offline, my friend was on and had the server public and then this punk came on and blew everything up! We were lucky to save my big ship! But I find it hard to make a large ship that can transport little ships without blowing parts off the little ship! I think you should add a laser! Well I say if this game had a rating between 1 and 10 it would be a 10! (1 meaning bad and 10 meaning awesome!) Great game and keep it up!			"

								While the movement systems may seem confusing at first, this game allows so much more of the invention and engineering feel that I was looking for in a game than I've found elsewhere, with an ever-growing selection of intriguing mechanics.Where else do you ponder how to control space fighter traffic in a carrier to make reloading quick and easy and avoid not only collisions, but also cutting each other up with thruster backblast?This game throws novel problems at me and expects novel solutions from me, without being designed with a fixed list of solutions in mind. This is a thing that has gotten much easier with the invention of modern physics engines, etc.; but is still relatively rare and something I search far and wide for.I fully recommend this game, though keep in mind it's still in development and lacks a crucial Linux port (they made some bad design decisions locking themselves into Microsoft APIs instead of using standardised libraries). Time will tell if the Wine compatibility improves, as of this writing I'm booting into Windows 7 exclusively for this game.			"

Procedural galaxy (or map, whatever it is) with no boundaries made this a true jewel. I wonder if programming an AI is possible with the in-game coding system :)UPDATE (July 18, 2014): YAY! Batteries!!.. Developer is carefully listening to community and creating the game that players desire. That guy (Marek Rosa) deserves a space ship!.. really... I mean it! :)ORIGINAL ENTRY (July 2, 2014): Think of this game as a Minecraft in space. But with more in depth simulation and lethality.You can build any kind of ship or vessel as you like. You can even give them some useful roles to help you in your harsh quest for survival. Make them mining vessels and they will crush those asteroids to bits, allowing you to get minerals and raw ores faster. Or if you have enough materials, build a ship with welders to help you build that massive capital ship faster! If you think your old ships need salvaging or scrapping, add grinders to it and it will become a ship dismantler!The game has many different startup scenarios both in survival and creative mode. Something for everyone. You can get confused by the UI or HUD at first, but it becomes familiar over time. Game lacks a proper tutorial or detailed help because it is still in development. But you can find vast amount of information from the community and wiki site. A little tip for begineers: If you start to play survival, try to find an uranium deposit ASAP. Everything is dependent on it!I'll give it 9/10 points overall and definitely suggest it to anyone that loves creativity based games. In my opinion, this price is acceptable for such game. (Let's be honest lads!)As far as I played, I never encountered any bugs. My gaming rig only slowed down while the resolution is set to 1920x1080 fullscreen. I don't know the reason, but playing the game in windowed mode solved that, and I'm playing in windowed mode since then. Not too much of a problem if you ask me...""If only there were batteries or battery blocks (that can be charged with electricity) that are reusable over and over!""			"

								Space is a cold, unforgiving place.  This is the world that waits for you in Space Engineers, a voxel-based sandbox game similar to Minecraft but with enough twists to mark its own territory in the genre.In Space Engineers, you must temper the harsh realities of space with a limited set of tools:  A space suit that lasts only a few minutes before requiring a recharge, a set of construction tools (Welder, Grinder, and Drill), and perhaps a space station or ship to keep you alive with scant Uranium fuel.  To last more than a couple of hours, you must find more fuel, via mining ore, which must be put through a refinery before it can be used.  Without Uranium, you can't make more, so making a mistake will cost you your life - and if your ship runs out of fuel - may cost you your progress.  Beyond basic survival, the stars are the limit.  You have your choice of producing the parts for and constructing small ships, large ships, or space stations.  The latter two cost an incredible amount of resources but are strangely satisfying to slave away welding together 2.5 metre blocks of steel for hours on end.  Time invested mining can be minimized with construction of a mining ship and a base to properly refine your ore.Though scarcely an Alpha version, Space Engineers is an incredibly fun and rewarding experience, but as such you must be willing to put up with occasional glitches and clunky multiplayer.

								The game is, at this point, quite amazing. The developers have consistently pushed out one update a week, (friday, in australia) for the Entire year that i've had the game, (Bought it christmas of 2013). Pretty amazing. As of yet there's no real goal, like minecraft pre-ender dragon, but by no means does that detract from the game. If you enjoy building, this is certainly the game for you. I've sunk around 200 hours into it so far, solely creating various spacecraft/stations etc. Definitely worth the price.			"

								Effectively Minecraft in Space thus far, the game is still entertaining. Multiplayer makes this highly enjoyable (though there are some issues for some players who experience horrific Lag when Mining, for example). Irrespective, this can be worked round and not everyone suffers from it.Everything is simple, with all building blocks having clearly defined components you'll need, Mining is easy and everything is a matter of time and effort as opposed to needing an in-depth knowledge of anything. Artificial gravity, turrets and more make a PvP-style experience all possible with weaponry available to engage in Astronaut-on-Astronaut fighting if needs be.In keeping with the Minecraft comment, building small, large and station-sized ships or building is easily achievable. If you can commit the patience you can build up just about anything, with doors and rotational motors allowing you to even put moving parts in place. Already there are a swathe of amazing designs out there that players have put together, from creatively put together mining and processing plants that can devour whole asteroids, to replicas of Battlestar Galactica and Imperial Star Destroyers and Warhammer 40,000 ships.Granted this isn't yet a ""finished"" product, but that aside it's still a great deal of fun. You can import and export your designs and have them tossed into someone else's server with little effort, play creative or use the ""survival"" mode. Some of the discussions on the forums have seen rise to a lot of great suggestions for Mods and enhancements when such things are possible. It's a great game with greater potential but even as-is, it's got the strength to continue to be a rewarding and entertaining experience.			"

								this game is in early alpha keep this in mind that being said,This game is great imagine a mix of minecraft (without the really square feel) and a space sim,asteroids are not able to move but you can build a base by using you're mining drill or a mining drill that can be made for a small ships.Blocks:you can build with a varity of different blocks and someblocks have functions such as rotors or doors,reactors in survival are used for power you can also make power by getting a solar panel they have survival and multiplayer multiplayer can be a bit buggy same for survival, one thing to keep in mind if you have a server up is that People CAN Greif your stuffI Recommend this Game 9.5/10 once they have fixed thoe's lag issues and added weapons for Large Shipsthey might get that extra 0.5April 22,2014 10/10 i love this game now with operational conveyor's,connectors,collectors,etcthis video explains it very nicely

								Every single time I put this game down thinking I'm done for a bit, I think of another interesting thing I can build and test out and have to load the game back up and start testing it. A new ram, different shape ships, a new mechanism that could work just so or something really daft like a small ship made almost entirely out of small warheads. At the moment, multiplayer is just single player with more people, but that works. Things are made infinitely more fun with the inclusion of other people and Space Engineers is no different. For those of you waiting to get SE when multiplayer was added, now is your chance.-:Update:-New survival mode is awesome. Crafting can be a bit daunting at first, but once you get the hang of it, it all comes together and makes even the simplest construction feel fantastic! The lack of objectives in single player survival might put some off, but the multiplayer survival is going to be great co-op or versus fun :D-:Update number 2:-Ok, having limited things and trying to create complicated things by using those really limited simple things was really good fun right? Space Engineers is still good, don't get me wrong, but sandbox games always seem to do this; they take those really complex ideas people have... and simplify them. They simplify them, cram them into an in-game, single, EASY item... and make it boring. Previously, if you wanted a door, you built one. You set up rotors, maybe even pistons in the later iterations, connector blocks, convoluted processes to do the simplest things. Now, you place a door block. Job Done. No challenge, no creativity. Slap a block down, wham! instant door.Personally, this turns things dull for me, but if you like this kind of thing, definitely check out SE as it has only been made better in that respects. This has been a fantastic game from the beginning.			"

Early Access Review
								Space Engineers: Early Access Alpha Review - This review is for Alpha build 1.038.013 Is This Game for Me?First thing you might ask is, is this game worth getting? That depends on a few things. First and foremost is do you like building games? If you like building games like Minecraft or Terraria and you have a PC that can handle it, then without reservation I can say you’d be crazy NOT to get it. What Kind of Game is It?What is Space Engineers exactly? If I could describe it one sentence I’d say it’s a Newtonian physics based space simulation/voxel-based building/survival game. I’m nearing 400 hours into the game and I’m showing no signs of losing interest any time soon. Those who know me, know there are only two other games I’ve put more than a 100 hours into; Mass Effect 3 and Skyrim. That’s pretty rarified company for an indie developed, $20 game. In Space Engineers you scavenge or mine for resources that you then make into building components with which you use to build stuff. At the same time you have to survive the harsh environment of space. It’s an Alpha!Yes it is an alpha game which nine times out of ten means it’s a buggy mess (more or less) with few features implemented. Not so with Space Engineers. It’s a remarkably stable for an early access game and though the full list of features are far from having been implemented, it already has a very robust feature list that has kept me busy for nearly 400 hours and counting. This doesn’t mean you won’t encounter bugs. You will, but they are very seldom game breaking and the devs have displayed a pattern of working hard to address bugs on a regular basis.   Patchmas!!!!What’s Patchmas you ask? It’s something I’ve never seen a dev do. Every Thursday Keen Software House releases an update patch for the game which includes new items, new features  and bug fixes. Unlike other early access games you don’t have to wait for a month or two to get new features and see bugs fixed. With Space Engineers you’ll see something new every single week. That’s right. You heard me correctly. Every week you get new toys to play with in the game. And in between those patches, there are hotfixes that address bugs. So even though the game is far from finished, you’ll see new features added to the game EVERY WEEK. In fact, Keen has been quoted as saying they never want to stop developing the game, even after final release. Game ModesThere are three game modes. First is creative mode which allows you to build things without having to gather resources or worry about survival issues. Everything you build comes into being instantly instead of having to weld it together. You can’t die in creative mode. Second is survival mode which is either solo or you can have your friends come in and help you out. In this mode you must gather resources, make sure don’t die, and deal with hazards. Hazards are probably the most underdeveloped portion of the game presently but that’s definitely a feature in the game that promises to be very interesting once it’s progressed far enough in development.    The third mode is PvP with dedicated servers. I have very little experience with this mode as I don’t generally go for that kind of gameplay but from what I’ve seen on the Keen forums, which I monitor regularly, the PvP mode is the mode that is more prone to bugs and is not as far along in development as other modes in the game. Even given that, there’s still a LOT of people regularly playing in this mode. It’s something that very likely will become more awesome as the game progresses, and once it does progress far enough I might even give it a go even though I don’t usually go for PvP. In short, Space Engineers is a game that anyone who likes to build stuff would be crazy not to give a go. If you are one of those people, then pony up $20 and give it a go. I’m betting you won’t be sorry.Edit: I forgot to add that the game already had a dedicated modding community. The AAA SE mod pack is especially awesome. If you get the game, be sure to check it out on the Official Keen Software House forums. You won't be sorry you did.			"

								I love this game! It has a building interface like that of minecraft, but includes the thrill of space travel and survival. It allows me to control how difficult the game is by manipulating the settings. The things you can do with the game are almost limitless with the availability of mods. If you get bored of fighting the A.I. in singleplayer, then you can test your survival skills online. All this being said, there is one problem; Waiting. However, I don't want to discourage anyone from getting this game. The waiting and lag is a huge problem for those who are only playing games for a few hours as opposed to the people who game at an intense level. It takes long to load even singleplayer worlds, and it might crash when it finally loads. The lag is immense, and I have not even tried online yet. But hey, it gives you time to do other things, like eat lunch while your game is loading. I guess this is why it is in alpha. If you have some patience and a love for survival games with limitless possibilities, then this game is for you. P.S. I have a pretty slow computer, so it is much better on gaming laptops and desktop computers.			"

								A lot of fun with friends, but this game needs some more content before it is fleshed out enough to be a powerful experience. The devs are very devoted to the game, and consistently release a pach each week, often with a couple new features. They also have been working on mod API and encouraging the community to create mods for the game - a very good sign that this game will not only have legs, but is being developed by devs who know what they are doing.

								So, for starters, I've been playing this game for quite some time now, and I certainly have gotten my money's worth of entertainment out of it. It not only has massive potential, it also has some very satisfying gameplay in its current state. If you really like building starships, bases, and all manner of strange contraptions, then you will enjoy this game.BUT ON TO THE IMPORTANT PART: THIS GAME IS IN ALPHA. IT IS NOT FINISHED. IT HAS BUGS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE BUGS AND PERFORMACE ISSUES AT LEAST UNTIL OFFICIAL RELEASE, WHICH IS FAR ENOUGH OFF INTO THE FUTURE TO WHERE KSH HAS NOT ANNOUNCED AN OFFICAL RELEASE DATE, OR EVEN STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT. AS SUCH, IF YOU ARE EASILY OFFENDED BY BUGS, UNIMPRESSIVE GRAPHICS, AND PERFORMANCE ISSUES, AND ARE COMPLETELY UNWILLING TO SUBMIT BUG REPORTS TO THE KSH FORUMS AND EVEN ATTEMPT TO HELP THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAME, THEN DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME, OR ANY EARLY ACCESS TITLE, FOR THAT MATTER. AND PLEASE, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, DON'T POST YOUR UNHELPFUL NEGATIVE REVIEWS DETAILING ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT THE RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY SUBMITTING TO KSH TO GET FIXED, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DO YOU ANY FAVORS. IT JUST MAKES THE COMMUNITY TOXIC, AND NO ONE NEEDS THAT.

								8.5/10There's only so much to say about this game, because I'm at a loss for words.This game is truly a masterpiece. An absolute treasure. The graphics look incredible, the soundtrack is intense, but also calming when it has to be. Gameplay could overall use a bit of work, but then again, this is an Alpha game.I'm normally not a person who likes to spend too much time on one game, however, Space Engineers has taken me by surprise. I've spend well over 250 hours on this game (and that says a lot when it comes to me, as I'm normally not using more than 80 hours on a game). It's addicting and intense. It plays well, mostly, and it gets updated every single thursday! Some updates are small, some are huge, but they all contribute to the game one way or another. I've spend a ton of time on it, and I'm ready to spend another 250 hours!Small note though: Don't start a new threat on their forums unless you wanna get bombarded by haters and critics. The people hanging out there are some of the most terrifying bunches I've ever encountered...- Jounzey (International YouTuber & Game Critic)			"

								AWESOME game, one of my favorite Early Access games so far. maybe just second to Kerbal Space Program. I like space, sandbox, physics, survival, and coop/pvp games. and this game has it all!Design Ships, and building them, mine Asteroids for resources, make space stations/bases, make small fighters, mining ships, gigantic ships or whatever contraption the game allows you to, with friends! the collision/destruction system is a great bonus as well.. I hope it evolves into something like Gmod in the future minus the 10 year old kids.I don't like: no enemy NPCs or AIs, all the danger there is is you running out of oxygen(electricity) and asteroid showers.8.7/10			"

								Post in two parts: Message to KSH/Marek, and a review/endorsement./// @ the Devs, Marek, KSH ///Hi Keen Software House!I LOVE YOU GUYS for making this game. However, I know how tired most of you devs must be by now, working on this title for so long. I know from experience as a mixed creative and technical guy the fatigue from working on a project for so long. Just know that you have a huge following, eventhough a majority of this following does not log in every day, or even every week. Look at the bump in players you had when planets were introduced; amazing! In any case; remember we are all rooting for you in creating this awesome survival/sandbox/scripted campaign multiplayer-driven game. (Yes, Marek; Multiplayer is focal here for the majority of us. Multiplayer is not just a feature! It's 2017 :P)/// Review & Endorsement ///I have thousands of hours into Minecraft, yet I always disliked that everything was stuck to a grid. In this game, there's dynamic voxel terrain, and there's grids of blocks. Separate, physical, grids of blocks. Blocks with their own physical behaviours too, such as rotors, thrusters, wheels with suspensions, pistons, connectors (connect grids). There's 'crafting', there's a survival mode that honestly does still need fleshing out, and most importantly there is the cluster♥♥♥♥ of blocks that you can put together in an infinite amount of ways that'll create anything you set your mind to creating; from orbital bombers to scripted guided missiles, defender drones, mining ships, racing ships, friggin' lunar buggies, carrier ships, ALL THE SHIPS, and even stuff like tabletop games and♥♥♥♥♥♥ And next to all that you have a new scenario-maker that is the best 'build your own game'-game with ever better control over ever better AI. Yes, yes, and more yes. The potential is great, and as of right now is already much fun, if not for the buggy multiplayer and occasional physics screw-up.			"

								1/28/14What is amazing about this game is that it is only in alpha. This alpha phase game currently packs more features that most full games I have. It is truely unique and gives me a lot of hope. The developers are AMAZING and there are already a lot of youtube channels with how to guides on how to play. IT IS NOT YET FULLY FUNCTIONAL, but it is really close. The weapons on small ships and the automatic rifle and drills work. The best part, they just added multiplayer up to 16 people. it's still rough, but holy crap is it awesome. The graphics are really good and the building is really easy once you get into it. The only limit is your imagination. The physics of this game are as real as they can get without you needing to be an expert on space physics to play. There are a lot of things in this game to tickle your fancy. If I cannot convince you, look up Bradphusion on youtube and watch one or two of his videos. this game will keep me busy for years to come. Look out minecraft.REVIEW UPDATE 3/18/14It happened. KSH added the survival update. It is still a little raw and the implimetation of survival somehow messed up creative for some of my friends, but this game is getting better and better. I already play this way more than any of my other games. My recommendation is to get this game while it's still only $14.99. The devs have announced that they are going back to weekly updates. This game is just amazing.REVIEW UPDATE 5/9/14It's been some time since I've updated this review.The game is still going in a good direction. I am happy with every update as it nears completion.Cons: It can still be laggy on multiplayer, but they are optamizing it with every updateThe worlds are not yet unlimited, but there is enough to keep you busy for a really long time.Sadly the public multiplayer does have greifers, but every game has griefers.REVIEW UPDATE 12/11/2014Been a while since I have updated this review.But my recommendation stands. This game has only gotten better since the last review update.That being said, with almost 300 hours into this game, its flaws have started to show themselves to me.Pros:*You can build anything. The only limit is your imagination. 10/10 for freedom*Amazing mod support. There are mods to turn this game into anything you want. If you just want to build in creative for hours at a time, there are mods to enhance that. Want to have large scale fleet battles with your friends? Mods for weapons and combat blocks are also available. 10/10 for the mod community.*Amazing community. To many people, the fanbase of a game is enough to make or break a game. I am one of those people. No one should ever be afraid to voice a complaint, suggestion or question on a game forum. But so many communities have immature bullies that would rather make you feel bad for having a individual thought than welcome you and help you. This game has an outstanding community with groups for just about any aspect of the game. I used to be in charge of one of the first groups (MEC Enterprises) before life got in the way. There are groups for combat, piracy, building, survival, and even salvaging. Anyone can fit in in this game, and if you don't find something for you, make a group and post it to the hub. People would love to join you. 10/10 for the community.*Developers. The dev team is fantastic. I have never seen a better team. They actually listen to the community. We the players have as much of a voice in the creation of this game as they do. If a mod is popular enough, they add it to the vanilla version of the game. They have teamed up with a 3D printing company and when you build a ship, they can make a real life model and send it to you. They update every week. They have quality merchandise on their website and in general, they are just great. 10/10 for Developers. Keep up the great work guys.*Game Play. The game play is great. For zero gravity, the controls are very easy to grasp. switching from ZeroG to a gravity influenced area is without error. Gun play is pretty bad, but it's not a major part or the game and thus not a high priority. Ship weapons and fighter combat on the other hand are amazing yet challenging. Combat in ZeroG is a whole new beast and it doesn't help the fact that you don't know what you are about to get into a dogfight with because they built it. It's both exciting and a new challenge. Building is amazing. If you thought minecraft had building down to a T, this game will blow you away. There are just so many features to building paired with being able to rotate yourself to get a better angle. One of their updates added a projector block, so you can build a ship in creative and then save it as a blueprint, and then you can transfer it over to a survival world where the projector sets up a hologram for you to follow when building the ship. Gameplay 9.7/10 (They had to lose some points for the gunplay).Cons:*AI. This is a frequent issue from the community. There is no danger in this game. In minecraft, you have mobs. The worst you get in this game is drifting ships with guns and meteor showers. The lack of danger is my biggest issue. The only reason I want to play survival is because I want to see if I can survive. For a uncharted asteroid belt in outer space, there are surprisingly few threats to challenge you. The only thing that I felt challenged was my patience. The best you can do right now is try to find a PvP server or set something up with friends. That being said, the devs may be planning something so we will wait and see. There is also a way to script basic AI, so I imagine there is something to be found in the steam workshop for download.*Limitations. While the world can be set to unlimited, there is no procedural generation. You spawn in an asteroid cluster and the asteroids you see are the only ones around you. You can keep going but you will find nothing. There is nothing to explore. **This being said, there was a blog post from the head of the development team earlier this week saying that they will not only add procedural asteroid generation, but they also plan to add direlect ships and stations for you to explore. They will be using designs from the community for the most part.*Survival. I have no issue with creative, but for me, survival got boring after about 3-4 hours and I went back to dumping a couple hundred hours into creative. Overall I do not recommend buying this game solely for survival mode, but I recommend it for creative and the community, and to be a part of the creation of the best voxel game I have ever seen.TL;DR Buy this game.

								It's looking great, lots of potential, constant updating (which is expected from an unreleased game, but still), great feedback.I have my fingers crossed on this one.As of 11 of August 2014: Still looking great, and it's nice to see that the developers are taking their time to hear the opinions of the community. The engine is also showing some promise, very versatile, decent performance and graphics. It still needs a lot of work though.However, I'm afraid that the game is starting to get a bit rushed. Big updates that get pushed forward due to the mass begging from the community. We are patient, the game's great already, much better than most fully(?) released games (like Ubisoft/EA's main titles), so take your time, on ""small"" things like optimization and small content addition (like block forms, small glass blocks, etc).

								Now I was a little hesitant on writing a review about this game because truthfully I didn't know what I was going to say. But now I believe I have come up with a good enough review to share to everyone. This game drops you into space with no intructions except for a few hints here and there but they expect you to build whatever you would like. If you are a fan of any space simulation games then this one is just right. Star Cittizen was shown off at PAX east 2014 and that looked beautiful but if your trying to decide if you want SC or SE then it is completely up to you. SE is a work in progess. Having been just released as an early acess alpha game the game is improving one update by a time. This game will remind you of Minecraft in space and that is a good thing if you like Minecraft but if you want this to be a completely different experience than Minecraft then you can change it. The game allows you to write its story and play the game you want to. If you like making large space stations inside an asteroid or loading a large ship with warheads you can do that. There is nothing telling you you can't. The movement is ok. I feel as if the jetpack doesn't go fast enough to slow you down after you drift away from a platform. The graphics at the highest setting still look slightly dull but they will hopefully be improved by the games full release. This game invovles sandbox building and the ""do what ever you want"" element in it which blends perfectly. I would highly recommend  this game to anyone. Space the final frontier is only a mouse click away!			"

								About the closest start to a perfect game that I have seen in 20 years of gaming. What it does, it does well. You build. The combat isn't sharp or exact, the graphics aren't pushing the boundries of science. You can build complicated machinery designed to handle all kinds of tasks. Your own imagination provides the bulk of the game's content. The level of creativity that you can bring to bear in the game is varied enough to occupy both myself and my 11 year old son, to the point where we have conversations about the game when not playing the game.I'm extremely excited to see where the developers take us next, and with weekly content updates we are getting there in a hurry.

								This game is FABULOUS for anyone interested in anything building your own spaceships, experimenting with gravity and systems design; or simply jetting about in space practicing your abysmal landing skills like me. You can even be a pirate, capturing and processing the unlucky ships that pass through your system. Or take a shot at mining out a whole asteroid and hide a secret base inside. So much to do and see, with more on the way, limited only by your imagination.This title is only in Alpha, yet already has a fairly stable multiplayer option, and it updates on a weekly basis from a laundry list of things that users actually want. I've had this on my wishlist since last October, so thank you Wedgehog, so very, VERY much for gifting me this gem...even though you blow up my saves on a regular basis! <3 XDNow if I can finally get my SSD back, I'll be recording some of this...

								1/28/14What is amazing about this game is that it is only in alpha. This alpha phase game currently packs more features that most full games I have. It is truely unique and gives me a lot of hope. The developers are AMAZING and there are already a lot of youtube channels with how to guides on how to play. IT IS NOT YET FULLY FUNCTIONAL, but it is really close. The weapons on small ships and the automatic rifle and drills work. The best part, they just added multiplayer up to 16 people. it's still rough, but holy crap is it awesome. The graphics are really good and the building is really easy once you get into it. The only limit is your imagination. The physics of this game are as real as they can get without you needing to be an expert on space physics to play. There are a lot of things in this game to tickle your fancy. If I cannot convince you, look up Bradphusion on youtube and watch one or two of his videos. this game will keep me busy for years to come. Look out minecraft.REVIEW UPDATE 3/18/14It happened. KSH added the survival update. It is still a little raw and the implimetation of survival somehow messed up creative for some of my friends, but this game is getting better and better. I already play this way more than any of my other games. My recommendation is to get this game while it's still only $14.99. The devs have announced that they are going back to weekly updates. This game is just amazing.REVIEW UPDATE 5/9/14It's been some time since I've updated this review.The game is still going in a good direction. I am happy with every update as it nears completion.Cons: It can still be laggy on multiplayer, but they are optamizing it with every updateThe worlds are not yet unlimited, but there is enough to keep you busy for a really long time.Sadly the public multiplayer does have greifers, but every game has griefers.REVIEW UPDATE 12/11/2014Been a while since I have updated this review.But my recommendation stands. This game has only gotten better since the last review update.That being said, with almost 300 hours into this game, its flaws have started to show themselves to me.Pros:*You can build anything. The only limit is your imagination. 10/10 for freedom*Amazing mod support. There are mods to turn this game into anything you want. If you just want to build in creative for hours at a time, there are mods to enhance that. Want to have large scale fleet battles with your friends? Mods for weapons and combat blocks are also available. 10/10 for the mod community.*Amazing community. To many people, the fanbase of a game is enough to make or break a game. I am one of those people. No one should ever be afraid to voice a complaint, suggestion or question on a game forum. But so many communities have immature bullies that would rather make you feel bad for having a individual thought than welcome you and help you. This game has an outstanding community with groups for just about any aspect of the game. I used to be in charge of one of the first groups (MEC Enterprises) before life got in the way. There are groups for combat, piracy, building, survival, and even salvaging. Anyone can fit in in this game, and if you don't find something for you, make a group and post it to the hub. People would love to join you. 10/10 for the community.*Developers. The dev team is fantastic. I have never seen a better team. They actually listen to the community. We the players have as much of a voice in the creation of this game as they do. If a mod is popular enough, they add it to the vanilla version of the game. They have teamed up with a 3D printing company and when you build a ship, they can make a real life model and send it to you. They update every week. They have quality merchandise on their website and in general, they are just great. 10/10 for Developers. Keep up the great work guys.*Game Play. The game play is great. For zero gravity, the controls are very easy to grasp. switching from ZeroG to a gravity influenced area is without error. Gun play is pretty bad, but it's not a major part or the game and thus not a high priority. Ship weapons and fighter combat on the other hand are amazing yet challenging. Combat in ZeroG is a whole new beast and it doesn't help the fact that you don't know what you are about to get into a dogfight with because they built it. It's both exciting and a new challenge. Building is amazing. If you thought minecraft had building down to a T, this game will blow you away. There are just so many features to building paired with being able to rotate yourself to get a better angle. One of their updates added a projector block, so you can build a ship in creative and then save it as a blueprint, and then you can transfer it over to a survival world where the projector sets up a hologram for you to follow when building the ship. Gameplay 9.7/10 (They had to lose some points for the gunplay).Cons:*AI. This is a frequent issue from the community. There is no danger in this game. In minecraft, you have mobs. The worst you get in this game is drifting ships with guns and meteor showers. The lack of danger is my biggest issue. The only reason I want to play survival is because I want to see if I can survive. For a uncharted asteroid belt in outer space, there are surprisingly few threats to challenge you. The only thing that I felt challenged was my patience. The best you can do right now is try to find a PvP server or set something up with friends. That being said, the devs may be planning something so we will wait and see. There is also a way to script basic AI, so I imagine there is something to be found in the steam workshop for download.*Limitations. While the world can be set to unlimited, there is no procedural generation. You spawn in an asteroid cluster and the asteroids you see are the only ones around you. You can keep going but you will find nothing. There is nothing to explore. **This being said, there was a blog post from the head of the development team earlier this week saying that they will not only add procedural asteroid generation, but they also plan to add direlect ships and stations for you to explore. They will be using designs from the community for the most part.*Survival. I have no issue with creative, but for me, survival got boring after about 3-4 hours and I went back to dumping a couple hundred hours into creative. Overall I do not recommend buying this game solely for survival mode, but I recommend it for creative and the community, and to be a part of the creation of the best voxel game I have ever seen.TL;DR Buy this game.

Within a minute I was watching massive pieces of debris fly away into nothingness at speeds so high that I couldn't possibly catch up to them. I was laughing hard.Then I weaponized it.11/10 would heartily recommend. The game is updated regularly, the devs seem to be very enthusiastic and do listen to their audience, and once you get a hang of all the systems and all the building, you'll be making monster creations in no time.

								Let's be honest... this game isn't finished yet, and I don't expect it to be for many more years... But in the other hand, you've never seen a game with this physics engine (look at all these bu.. features!), and even if there is a lot of work to do to make this game playable at a reasonable level of headaches, playing it is worth it!Sure if you whant to play multiplayer with your friends, even in creative, you'll see more time going into setting up a proper connection without 'any' bugs (some of them are really, really weird... Have you ever seen a planet desapear in real life? If not, this game is for you!) than into building things and doing some CQ... But at the same time, the stuff that you can come up with in this game is incredible, just take a look at the workshop for example... type in the name of a ship that you've seen in a movie or in a game, and you'll find it!If you ever whant to play this game, don't expect everything do work from start, but give it a bit of love and you'll get it back!

								I highly recommend playing Space Engineers on either a newer or the latest gaming PCs or laptops as the workload will quickly overwhelm anything else after twenty to thirty minutes.Active community and one of the coolest Workshops you'll see on Steam!I've been on this game for years now and I'm very glad that I stuck it through all the bugs, glitched, and other issues because things are coming together in an awesome way with a spectacular overhaul of the block graphics. Everything is even more machine-like than before!I live the dream of being a spacer here, surveying planets and launching probes to the moon. I drift between asteroids out in stellar space, dodging meteors and launching raids on pirate caches and bases while repeling Argentavis raids. Sometimes I'll play pirate myself and go after commercial freighters and mining ships or foolishly taking on a military minelayer or escort. All this while dealing with the problems actual engineers and programmers face.So go! Build an automated starship and crew with your friends or make a simple scrap ship and live the life of a salvage vagabond. Claim entire planets and systems as your own and cover them in cities or turn entire asteroids into weapons of war.			"

								Space Engineers brings to the table everything I wished Minecraft had. Being able to create objects in a setting is one thing. Being able to create objects in a sruvival setting is another thing. What Space Engineers does for the creative/survival sandbox genre is the freedom of utilizing your creations to solve complex problems in the context of early space exploration. If you love stretching your critical thinking and problem solving abilities, then look no further. This game is only in Alpha, and it's running better than most released games. You can drive your creations around, people. You can fly them, crash them, repair them, modify them, dodge asteroids in them, send them careening into space when you lose power! Add to that the willingness of the Devs to add community suggested changes to the game, and I can't wait to watch how this one evolves.			"

								There are a ton of space shooter games out there that simulate several kinds of space flight. They allow you to be merchants, pirates, fighters, traders and so on. Some space shooters allow you to travel to other worlds while others let you explore the expansive galaxy.Space Engineers takes space flight to a whole new level of space flight. This is not just a game, it's a creation tool. Space Engineers, not only allows you to fly through space and battle it out with your enemies, but this game lets you also ""DESIGN"" your ship the way you want it, exactly how YOU want it. Space flight is no longer about just ships, it's about designing and showing off your ship designing skills. You can design fighters, frieghters, destroyers, dreadnauts, even space stations that take HOURS to travel the entire station. YOu can even design fighter ships inside the frieghters or space stations, so you havesomething to defend your stations or frieghters. Not only can you build your fighters, but you can also travel to asteroids and drill for minerals to design stronger materials to make better ships/stations for yourself.Space Engineers also lets you do either single edit where you just edit the ship on your own without others watching you, or you can have others join you online, either as allies and team work your stations, ships, destroyers, or you can battle it out against your friends to see who will have the best fighter ships and who can build the better ships.Along with that, if you think you have designed a good ship, you can post your ship creations on the Steam site and you can also check out other designs that others have made and see how they designed their ships. (UPDATE = As of now there are over 1,000 pages of Workshop items to view and download. Ships, stations, animations, asteroids, destroyers, mechanical devices, there's just nolimit to what you can do.)Space Engineers is no longer about just space flight. It's about taking the entire ""Build Your Space Empire"" to a whole new level of build and destroy. Build it, design it, add on to it, tweek it, create it, and use it, any way you see fit. Space Engineers is no longer about the game, it's all about ""YOU"". What ship do YOU want to design, and how will you control the space empire? Space Engineers, you know you wanna be one... ^_^ (The game was still in Beta when this review was given, but during this time, they had updated the game so that you can do online battles or coop, how ever you want to play online)			"

								While the movement systems may seem confusing at first, this game allows so much more of the invention and engineering feel that I was looking for in a game than I've found elsewhere, with an ever-growing selection of intriguing mechanics.Where else do you ponder how to control space fighter traffic in a carrier to make reloading quick and easy and avoid not only collisions, but also cutting each other up with thruster backblast?This game throws novel problems at me and expects novel solutions from me, without being designed with a fixed list of solutions in mind. This is a thing that has gotten much easier with the invention of modern physics engines, etc.; but is still relatively rare and something I search far and wide for.I fully recommend this game, though keep in mind it's still in development and lacks a crucial Linux port (they made some bad design decisions locking themselves into Microsoft APIs instead of using standardised libraries). Time will tell if the Wine compatibility improves, as of this writing I'm booting into Windows 7 exclusively for this game.			"

								Josh told me to buy this, and he mentioned it is not the final game so I don't know if I wanted to buy it yet, but he was having so much fun while talking on skype so I had to try it myself.I did not watch anything (videos or tutorials) and just got straight into it. It was god damn hard at first but I have been on it for hours trying to create some small ships to start with. It really does take patience to create a huge ship but its up to you on how it will look.At first, I did crash the ships that already are loaded into the quick-start options and it was so fun to see the pyhsics of the damage the ship had taken, not to mention it was fun to crash a ship into another.I then started to get used to the Camera and how it works, it's hard starting out but you will get used to it.I could ramble on a lot for how much fun you will have playing this just in single-player, yet I think they are releasing multiplayer in an update. This is what I (any I could guess a lot of others) are looking forward too. Gathering resources together, building a station, a huge epic fleet of ships to maybe have a war.I am so looking forward to updates on this game.			"

								Great game so far! Written on the Feb 19th, 2014.I can see the potential of the game coming.Pros: -Spaceship/space station building and destruction!-Vast space (diameter of around 800km).-Good visuals.-MultiplayerCons: -Needs some optimization.-Lacks of a few items.-Controls will need to be revised.-Physics collisions needs to be reviewed.-Limited speed to ~104 m/s for a spacecraft.-Lacks of quite a few more options items.

								Update: Now with planets!Space Engineers is a fun and relatively detailed sandbox game. The objective, is to build a ship and survive in your game world, You have to fight off pirates, mine for materials, and manage to survive the other players (in multiplayer). I myself spent the entire free weekend though in creative mode building an insanely large ship that had everything on it, looked nice, and managed to function reliably. I can't call myself experienced in Space Engineers whatsoever but I can say that if sandbox space building games interest you, or that my description of the game was intriguing, you should definitely give this game a look.

								In it's current state 8/11/14 something is wrong with it. I have enjoyed this game on a daily basis and the last 3 or 4 updates I have not been able to enjoy due to excessive lag, frame rate drop, and unplayable multiplayer. I encounter similar issues in single player, but not as severe. I am sure that these issues will be solved and the game will be playable again, so for that I give it a thumbs down. This game without the very recent issues and despite my machine being well over the recommended settings and still not being able to handle this game without terrible frame rate lag on a low resolution at minimum settings since recent updates, is a great game. I enjoyed it quite often prior to these events and would like to see it excell. After they figure out what is going on and fix the situation, then I can continue to recommend this game.EDIT: Sorry I forgot to ever edit this, but yes, the main issues are resolved. The last three updates have been nothing but optimization and bug fixing and it is great.			"

This happened to me when I was offline, my friend was on and had the server public and then this punk came on and blew everything up! We were lucky to save my big ship! But I find it hard to make a large ship that can transport little ships without blowing parts off the little ship! I think you should add a laser!

								It's looking great, lots of potential, constant updating (which is expected from an unreleased game, but still), great feedback.I have my fingers crossed on this one.As of 11 of August 2014: Still looking great, and it's nice to see that the developers are taking their time to hear the opinions of the community. The engine is also showing some promise, very versatile, decent performance and graphics. It still needs a lot of work though.However, I'm afraid that the game is starting to get a bit rushed. Big updates that get pushed forward due to the mass begging from the community. We are patient, the game's great already, much better than most fully(?) released games (like Ubisoft/EA's main titles), so take your time, on ""small"" things like optimization and small content addition (like block forms, small glass blocks, etc).

								Date posted: 16th Aug 2014TL:DR; Game engine and mechnics are finished, just needs more content. High Recommendation.For early access this is one of the most stable and polished early access games around. While the price is quite high it is clera the developers are constantly working on this game with updates every few weeks.Graphics are quite good for such a game and performance is fairly good considering what is being modelled. Super large ships will grind the game to a halt and it would be nice for some macro-based optimisations.Content is short, few colours, few block types (still a lot but not enough when compared to say minecraft).Gameplay has minor issues but nothing that ruins the gameplay. Game locks for a half second when saving and there is currently no way to brace for meteor impact. Also Gravity mechanic needs to become spherical to allow orbits etc.Creative mode is a nice little playground and features like copy & paste make for some interesting scenarios.Survival mode is good, however more events need to occur and possibly some NPC enemies/neutral/allies. My recommendations for survival mode additions are:- Solar Flare (turns all blocks off for 20 seconds, requires manual restart of systems)- Large Asteroids that move (this allows for large asteroid to smash into each other and send rocks flying out)- System degradation (systems over a long period of time should degrade)- System failure (if a reactor is comprimised there should be a chance of the reactor going critical and blowing up)- Unknown Event (An event that cannot be identified, power going out, ship being thrown across space etc) "

								Space engineers is an awesome game. it feels like a game i can play for hours on end with friends and by my self. as the game is still in beta the bug count is very little. every friday it seams to be updated with new things (Last update was Wheels, some sorts of Auto aming turrets and some bug fixes) and keep me waiting for them to come into play. very realistic and lots of fun. Being able to have a mixture of ships deing different tasks and being able to set up space stations is really cool. My self, iv played the game for about 60ish hours (off the top of my head) and the things you can creat is endless. for example, Mining ships, Attack ships, stations with all sorts of creations on board, convyor systems and lots more. The price of the game is amazing for the content you get. only a few things i wish could be added and that is, being able to have a hive you could call it. where you can fly and find other peoples basses. (just on chance.) like every one builds on one huge world. endless astroyeds you can explore and build on. this would bring more meaning to the game, being able to conduct rades of other peoples bases. make the game more challening. and also adding in one huge thing. player interactiveness i gess. if this was added into the game i would find this to be one of the best games of the year. i recommend this game to people who enjoy survival, sandbox games. sorry for any spelling errors. -Santa-			"

								10/10 game, me and a friend ran at each other (actually ran) misjudged our locations, collided, and we both died on impact. I got to watch as his body flew backwards and smacked the opposite side of the station while mine did the same. Excellent.Over the past few days this game has really grown on me and it is really looking good for the future based on my experience.While the game is still in development, at least at the time of this review, it is extremely fun to play. You are given full freedom to build the biggest, most ambitous thing you can think of. The only real limits right now are the time you can invest welding it all together and what your computer can handle. Even without the construction it is extremely satisying to smash two large ships together and watch parts fly off as sections are crushed, mangled, and turned to unrecognizeable chunks: which you can promptly take your welder to and fix right up only to smash them together again!If you enjoy building things via a minecraft-esque system while exploring asteroids for materials, or if you instead just like smashing  stuff together to see how twisted you can make the wreckage then I can definitely recommend this game.

								I love this game! It has a building interface like that of minecraft, but includes the thrill of space travel and survival. It allows me to control how difficult the game is by manipulating the settings. The things you can do with the game are almost limitless with the availability of mods. If you get bored of fighting the A.I. in singleplayer, then you can test your survival skills online. All this being said, there is one problem; Waiting. However, I don't want to discourage anyone from getting this game. The waiting and lag is a huge problem for those who are only playing games for a few hours as opposed to the people who game at an intense level. It takes long to load even singleplayer worlds, and it might crash when it finally loads. The lag is immense, and I have not even tried online yet. But hey, it gives you time to do other things, like eat lunch while your game is loading. I guess this is why it is in alpha. If you have some patience and a love for survival games with limitless possibilities, then this game is for you. P.S. I have a pretty slow computer, so it is much better on gaming laptops and desktop computers.			"

								8.5/10There's only so much to say about this game, because I'm at a loss for words.This game is truly a masterpiece. An absolute treasure. The graphics look incredible, the soundtrack is intense, but also calming when it has to be. Gameplay could overall use a bit of work, but then again, this is an Alpha game.I'm normally not a person who likes to spend too much time on one game, however, Space Engineers has taken me by surprise. I've spend well over 250 hours on this game (and that says a lot when it comes to me, as I'm normally not using more than 80 hours on a game). It's addicting and intense. It plays well, mostly, and it gets updated every single thursday! Some updates are small, some are huge, but they all contribute to the game one way or another. I've spend a ton of time on it, and I'm ready to spend another 250 hours!Small note though: Don't start a new threat on their forums unless you wanna get bombarded by haters and critics. The people hanging out there are some of the most terrifying bunches I've ever encountered...- Jounzey (International YouTuber & Game Critic)			"

								So, for starters, I've been playing this game for quite some time now, and I certainly have gotten my money's worth of entertainment out of it. It not only has massive potential, it also has some very satisfying gameplay in its current state. If you really like building starships, bases, and all manner of strange contraptions, then you will enjoy this game.BUT ON TO THE IMPORTANT PART: THIS GAME IS IN ALPHA. IT IS NOT FINISHED. IT HAS BUGS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE BUGS AND PERFORMACE ISSUES AT LEAST UNTIL OFFICIAL RELEASE, WHICH IS FAR ENOUGH OFF INTO THE FUTURE TO WHERE KSH HAS NOT ANNOUNCED AN OFFICAL RELEASE DATE, OR EVEN STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT. AS SUCH, IF YOU ARE EASILY OFFENDED BY BUGS, UNIMPRESSIVE GRAPHICS, AND PERFORMANCE ISSUES, AND ARE COMPLETELY UNWILLING TO SUBMIT BUG REPORTS TO THE KSH FORUMS AND EVEN ATTEMPT TO HELP THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAME, THEN DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME, OR ANY EARLY ACCESS TITLE, FOR THAT MATTER. AND PLEASE, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, DON'T POST YOUR UNHELPFUL NEGATIVE REVIEWS DETAILING ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT THE RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY SUBMITTING TO KSH TO GET FIXED, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DO YOU ANY FAVORS. IT JUST MAKES THE COMMUNITY TOXIC, AND NO ONE NEEDS THAT.

								*UPDATE 10/9/2015*This game plays similarly to other survival voxel construction games.  You have a tech tree (everything's actually available, just need materials) that you work your way up through via mining and processing.  Since my initial review they've added so many large features like oxygen systems, infinite procedural worlds, AI pirate drones that attack you, sorting blocks that let you sort your cargo,  programming blocks that let you manipulate almost everything via C# programming, tons of performance fixes and updates, and now soon even planets with atmospheres and atmospheric thrusters.  Each time i've played the game i've usually spend about 15-25 hours getting to max tech with friends then again waiting for some large update.  Each time I want to do things differently, arrange things differently, and its a blast on every new world.*June 2014 Review*Got it on steam sale. Played 10 hours straight.

								I posted a review of Space Engineers 12th April, 2014, but a LOT has changed over the year.By Keen Software House, the same brilliant developers who were the brains behind the awesome Miner Wars: 2081, Space Engineers is a unique first-person survival sandbox, which you can see it's parents are clearly Minecraft, and Kerbal Space Program. As an astronaut space engineer, it's your job to survive the barren deserts of space that lie in each and every direction around you.Mine asteroids, or perhaps hollow them out and make a secret space station!Build a colossal space frigate with unimaginable firepower, then add hangers and smaller ships!Have a space race, only for it to become a dogfight to the death with gatling guns and missle launchers, only surviving with that fine♥♥♥♥♥ejector seat you built...More and more possiblities arrive with each mod and update released. Updates are released every Thursday for North America and Europe (I think), and every Friday for New Zealand, Australia, Asia, and other pacific locations. Each update typically contains bug fixes, additional features to already existing blocks, but moreso, blocks from mods and community requests.These are prime good developers, that LISTEN to the community! Something other people need to start doing. But back to these guys, they do respond, they do care, they always strive to add blocks and features that the community requests. Only a few weeks ago, we were asking for cameras, hangar doors, remote control, and they add it!Mod supportPistonsCamerasSCRIPTING/CODING!!!GunsMoar Gunz!MORE GUNS!The big one here is mod support. Almost everything you can possibly imagine, is somehow possible with content on the Steam Workshop, if not already possible in the game. AND. The most popular mods are actually getting INTERGRATED INTO THE GAME!!!Pistons, Cameras, Spherical Gravity Generators, Solar Panels, Wheels, 3 Cockpits, Windows, these were all originally mods, and now they've been merged with the game itself!Must. Buy.Pricewise, it's very good, considering the other pricey crap that share it's genre, it's not released yet, but certainly plays like it! Last but not least, this game is PC only at the moment, but will be getting a release on Xbox One. This version will recieve similar updates with the same content, however as of now, there is no mention of mod support on this version. I expect it'll be more expensive, so I personally would get the PC port over the XONE port.			"

								This was a very, very good and well done game. However, I find that ""Different taste - ophobia,"" a disease common in video games, is REALLY bad here. Of course, given it's player base, it obviously appeals to a lot of people, but I had a bit of a hard time getting into this one. To quote the AVGN, ""It's like trying to stick your **** into a cheerio.""Survival!!!  It is a bit like minecraft, as in mining for, and collecting resources, and also mods, made easier with Steam workshop. And it's a bit not like minecraft, where, for one, it's on Steam, and also the graphics are smoth, the resources are different, and the setting is in space, thus what you build, what you craft, and by extension, how you craft, are completely different.  Also the fan base isn't filled to the brim with complete and total IDIOTS.  With that, experienced Minecraft players like myself (though I don't play it much anymore), or many survival games, shouldn't be alienated while it provides a new, fresh experience. It's good, but my main problem was I couldn't get into it. Probably just me though, don't let that get you down. ;)Creative!!!  What can I say, It's Garry's Mod, but in space!!! And Garry's Mod is an excellent game, and so is this. Build spaceships of ginormous porportions that would slow even an Alienware computer down, or just mess around with stuff. It's up to you.My Final say:  You know, I was a bit on the fence about this game, not being attached to it. And for the record, I LOVE space simulators. However, I ultimately decided to recommend this, as many others will go love this game to death. And to those who did, good for you! ;)			"

								This game has made lots of progress since I first bought it. It still feels a little pointless, but the building, mining, and piloting is a lot of fun. It is a good game to play with a few friends; collaborating in creative mode or working together in survival mode. Unfortunately, games usually end when someone gets bored and starts crashing ships together.			"

								If you've become rigid with early access games, fear not. The developers of this game are taking Space Engineers in the right direction with regular updates and performance optimizations. Features are added in a timely manner, but not so fast that it debunks anything you've worked on previously. If you've got a flair for design, I cannot reccommend it enough.			"

								Minecraft in space! Yes, surely it deserves more than that to be described, but it's definitely the best way to get the message across in a simple way. Still in Early Access by January 2015, but ever since I got it, it has been continuosly growing, and the modding community has been quite active, meaning lots of additional new toys and even skyboxes to change the background a bit. This one, and the upcoming Medieval Engineers (changing space stations for earth castles), are the indie must-have sandboxes of 2015.----------2016-11-29Well, the game keeps going forward, and new 3D models are coming soon. We already got a renewed renderer, and there are 3 multiplayer prototypes being tested to improve that department. Despite what some pessimistic people may think, this game still has a strong heartbeat. :)			"

								The short version of the review is that it is a good game and you can get a large amount of hours on this game if you like openworld sandbox games. I give it a thumbs up for it's current beta stage.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The long versionSpace engineers is an openworld sandbox game based on building spaceships and surviving, the game doesn't have much to the PvE or PvP as there arent many ships flying around that can attack you, and multiplayer is buggy at times. The game has a lot to offer in it's beta stage but does not offer a good PvE game. I bought this game full price (24.99USD) and I enjoyed every hour I spent. Hopefully they add more A.I to the game and bring a real challenge.			"

								I really liked Minecraft and I am glad that one cannot see how many hours of my life I have logged into that game. So when I saw a review of this game I thought ""wow, that looks like Gary's Mod and Minecraft had a baby, and then flung that baby into space."" I really like the game though, because of the same ""rules"" that are applied in game. You try to survive in space, a very harsh and unforgiving environment, and mine different ores out of astroids to build your ship. Now this is only survival mode, which I have not played any of. My 50.1 hours of gameplay so far has been completely in the creative mode of the game, which allows the player to generate any of the ""blocks"" (I guess thats what I will call them). I have had a lot of fun designing and flying ships that I have built. Also, with the flying comes the physics engine, which is one of the best I have seen so far. The only trade off to a great physics engine is the occasional lag spike, during which the computer is calculating where all the bits of my ship have gone. Now, it is also like minecraft, in the sense that it can get monotonous. You do have to come up with projects to keep the game going. But this is only coming from my experience in the creative mode, survival mode may be much  more rewarding, and I am sorry to say that I just don't know. In conclusion, I love this game, I think that if you liked Minecraft, you will like this game as well, and when I say its like Minecraft in space, I mean it. Also, just a side note. The Dev for this game is a really good guy, and has been (so far...) continually pumping out new updates and listening to players from the forums. So in conclusion (again) get this game.			"

With Weekly updates both removing  bugs as well as consistently adding content that players want and care about, Space Engineers is shaping up to become one of the most broad and ludicrously fun space games on the market. Space Engineers is accessible enough to new players, as well as featuring a complexity curve that have you thinking of how establish and improve your designs for days on end. Highly recommended.			"

								I'm not going to lie, it's VERY laggy (at least if you have a potato computer like mine). But if you can get aside that (or go to a friends house where they have a good gaming computer), this can still be one of the best sandbox games you ever play. This is coming from a huge fan of both games, Space Engineers puts Minecraft to shame, and the detail and love you can put into your ships is amazing, until an asteroid says ""f*** you"" and destroys it. I love my ship, the USG Ghostlurker, and if you like space games and space combat/building, you'll love your's too. The best part is, in this game I was never killed over a can of beans or robbed of my pants, here the people are civilized.			"

								Space Engineers is a pretty fun game (especially for creative type of people). there are small things that I hope will be added like tethering so you don't float away (or somthing that can hold you still since it can be difficult to make something in detail when you are just floating around). I think that currently it's strongest point is the destruction of the ships and stations (the videos on the store page shows the destruction pretty well). They've also implemented mining which seems kinda useless at the moment but you can dig your way through a asteroid so it's not all bad alternatively you can just attach a reocket launcher to one of your ships a blast your way through which seems to be much faster. The best features so far are just mostly what they've had in it for a while; crashing ships and building stations/ships. I also forgot to mention that there is currently multiplayer and it works well since you jsut have to create a custom game and select either offline, open, friends or private, it's much better multiplayer. 9/10 purely because playing alone isn't as fun as multiplayer (not complaining)			"

								I really enjoy this game, and its like minecraft in space (but you can place WAY more than 1 block at a time). On the survival mode, I get nervous just like a lonely astronaut losing power in space (but with the immense will to survive), and that just makes it even more fun! Also there is so much possibility and you can make ANYTHING you can imagine, from a tiny forklift in space, to a 144 million Kg super freighter....			"

You can play multi player with your friends to have even more fun and show off your ideas and buildings. It does have some minor bugs and a few major bugs, but that is expected in an Early Access Alpha which are to be fixed a soon as the devs can. I highly reccomend anybody that likes organic building games to play this, it is an amazing experience. :)			"

								You know those promises made by every early access game producer?""We'll update every [relatively short time]!""""We'll include these things before release!""""We'll actually listen to people!""Well guess what?The Space Engineers devs really do update the game every week. And that's not just patches. They actually add content every week. I don't know how, but they do. If they say they will include a feature, you can probably expect it within the month. They are a bit notorious for simply deleting posts on their forums complaining about the game (or at least they were when I last went on there over a year ago), but they apparently actually listen if you have a polite suggestion. This development pattern is basically what all early access games WISH they could even pretend to have.Oh, and it sure as hell doesn't hurt that the game itself is also great.			"

								I remember the Space Engineers of 1.024, back when large ship missile launchers exploded and the number of blocks fitted on a single page. Since then the devs have released a new update every Thursday  without fail, like a mini-Christmas each week. The game itself is excellent, and although the frequent releases often lead to bugs, they are rarely severe enough to impede gameplay. Playing creative or survival in single or multiplayer, this game can be anything you want: sandbox builder, exploration (worlds are effectively infinite in size), space or ground combat simulator, ruthless survival, or anything else that you can build or script; and new features are added every week. Pretty much anything that isn't already included in the game you can download from the workshop.Note: Low end computers may combust when playing on planets, but that will probably be fixed soon: I manage on a 2011 hp laptop			"

								Get this gosh darn game. There are allot of those early access games out these days, and this one is probably my favorite. And its the first that i believe has nailed the development of their game. Many early access games just post the game out then take months to update, but with space engineers theres an update every thursday. And with these updates you actually find yourself waking up every thursday thinking, holy crap its thursday what have the devs of space engineers meticulously crafted with their ones and zeros today. Then you go to youtube, look at your subscriptions box and find out, THEN YOUR MIND GETS BLOWN. for those creative types that like minecraft, [insert other building game here], immersive games, and space, then this game is definatly for you. Dont like those things? then idk just buy it anyway so the devs keep doing cool stuff.			"

								If you enjoy the freedom of space and the ability to create what ever your mind can think of this is your game. I really enjoy the ability to be left to my own devices in a survival session and trying to survive with only my basic tools and then later having a fully functioning station to now sit back and enjoy my creation.  The community is so involved making the ships you will see in the game along with infinite maps with endless possibilities along with if there isn't a way for you to create what you want the workshop most likely has a mod to get it done.

The best part about it is that they consistantly come out with updates, and not just bug fixes, game changing updates! In each update it adds something new to the table, and i find myself upgrading and modifing my ships with the new gadgets that they add.

								This is a good game. even at the alpha stages the game is easy to play and get into. The price is very small as aposed to other games. I have only had the game for a day and a half now and I have already spent 8 hours of my time in this game. The Physics engine is a bit perfomance hevey but you have to remember that this is a alpha game so it will be inproved a lot from its current state. I would recommend that you watch the help guide that is made by the devlopers or you can feel abit lost when you first get the game. To conclude I think that Space Engineers is a small game with lots of potental to be a well polished finished game. I already enjoy this game so much. I cannot wait for the developers to inprove it and bring out new content. If i was going to rate it out of 10 then I would give it a 9. But with time and development i think it could get a 10 from me.			"

								Though by no means a completed game, and still riddled with bugs and glitches this game is quite entertaining for the creative builder crowd. you can build any ship how ever you like. The bugs are acceptable considering this is a alpha early access game. This game gives a far more indepth view at building your ships when compared to it counterparts and then it adds in a more survivalist aspect to increase the difficulty. Hopefully they will complete this game and smooth out what bugs they have. Overall i would recommend this game especially since it only $20.			"

								If you enjoy the freedom of space and the ability to create what ever your mind can think of this is your game. I really enjoy the ability to be left to my own devices in a survival session and trying to survive with only my basic tools and then later having a fully functioning station to now sit back and enjoy my creation.  The community is so involved making the ships you will see in the game along with infinite maps with endless possibilities along with if there isn't a way for you to create what you want the workshop most likely has a mod to get it done.

								Space Engineers is incredible. I think this is the best space game I've ever played, and it's easily my favourite game on steam, even in this stage of Early Access.I can't imagine what's going to be updated to this game next. The planets are absolutely huge, and you can literally do anything you want in this game.Also, the developers LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITY. So many developers of other games simply don't care about people who want to KEEP playing the game; they just make it interesting for the new players, and then they quit the game.But there are some things that I think should be worked on (yes, I realise that this game is still in early access, but I'm just pointing that out)Space Engineers is great, and in the sense that I don't really know what I would be playing when I don't have anything else to do, I also play it as a time consumer. And it's FUN. wait thats not even a time consumer but whateverIn addition, I love how modifications are easy to install, just subscribe, activate, and start. It's simple.I play this game every day, and 1 hour soars by in no time at all when I do play it. I could never stop playing this game, in fact sometimes I play it for an atrociously long periods of time.To conclude, as said before this is an amazing game and my most favourite game on Steam, and it will always be.

You can build whatever your heart desires and the destruction physics are nothing like ive seen in any other game. The best part about it is that they consistantly come out with updates, and not just bug fixes, game changing updates! In each update it adds something new to the table, and i find myself upgrading and modifing my ships with the new gadgets that they add. It is a great game to get involved in and you will find yourself really getting into the ship building.10/10			"

								Get this gosh darn game. There are allot of those early access games out these days, and this one is probably my favorite. And its the first that i believe has nailed the development of their game. Many early access games just post the game out then take months to update, but with space engineers theres an update every thursday. And with these updates you actually find yourself waking up every thursday thinking, holy crap its thursday what have the devs of space engineers meticulously crafted with their ones and zeros today. Then you go to youtube, look at your subscriptions box and find out, THEN YOUR MIND GETS BLOWN. for those creative types that like minecraft, [insert other building game here], immersive games, and space, then this game is definatly for you. Dont like those things? then idk just buy it anyway so the devs keep doing cool stuff.			"

Building ships was great and multiplayer is tons of fun with friends. Alone is fun too but survival mode can get dull without friends there. Downside to game is that it needs lot to run properly and crashes easily if your computer can't handle it. But I am very interested to see this game when nit in early access!

If you're a Star Wars nerd like me, imagine any ship from Star Wars (the millienium falcon, the jedi starfighter, the y-wing, the x-wing) and relize that you can build all of them. If you like Star Trek, relize that you could build a replica of the Enterprise. Or, if you're that guy who wants to know what it's like to live in space, then survival is for you. Now, if you're the guy who doesn't know how to learn the controls by his or herself, then you can go to the very helpful Space Engineers website that has their own tutorial videos.(Trust me, you'll need them)If you're the guy who likes to build stuff and then blow the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it, then this is your game.All in all, this game is really fun, just don't expect it to be fun every moment you're playing, because it does require time and effort to make something worth while. But don't ever give up on something, because it's totally worth it in the end.			"

								Amazing game. Even at early access it surpasses any and all expectations. In depth, detailed, innovative and extraordinary. You build anything you want, from replicas of real space ships to space stations and land rovers, to flying ♥♥♥♥♥ and missiles that penetrate the armor of your enemy and explode when inside. The modding community in this game is outstanding, Steam Workshop is integrated perfectly and I cannot wait to see what things are to come. The regular updates to the game also come out every single week, always adding a new feature. This game has accomplished and fixed much more in a way smaller timespan with a small indie team than a large budget AAA title. I recommend this game to anyone that has a system that can run it, as optimisation is great but not the best for very large ships. With 12 GB of RAM, 2GB of VRAM and a 3.9 GHz quad core CPU it brings my computer down to it's knees on certain creations that are uploaded unto the workshop. This does not detract from the experience, however. If you're looking for a flexible space building/space survival sim, please buy this while it's so cheap. This game has got an incredibly bright future ahead of itself and I am very glad that I bought this after leeching for a couple of months from pirated versions. The Steam version has way more features and looking back at my decision, this is one of my most satisfying purchases for a single game.			"

								There are endless possibilities and that's what i like about this game.You can create a whole star system and do whatever you want , you can habitate planets,make asteroid bases etc.The FPS is fine , could be a little more optimised but it's ok considering the size of the world.In my opinion the survival (and creative) mod is much more fun and much easier when you are playingon multiplayer or with a friend.There are lots of mods on the workshop that you can install extremely easily!The game isn't too expensive , so i say that it's worth the money! 10/10			"

								Are you patient, creative, space lover, and don't mind rebuilding a huge ship because you forgot to put a gyroscope? Then, why aren't you playing Space Engineers? Space stations, motherships, planes, land vehicles, asteroid mining bases, all of this and more, in the same game.Obviously, it has some bugs, it's in development, but anyways, has less bugs than lots of ""finished"" and full-priced games. It's like taking Minecraft to a new whole level.			"

It is very fun to wreck ships, although it is more fun to try to survive and make a base for yourself. Its a good blend, and the physics are incredible.

								Hey, This game is pretty fun, its like minecraft in space, instead of building towns you build space ships and stations, its pretty fun, I really like the open empty space survival, it can be pretty intense, some times i feel like its that movie Gravity. The game can be very awesome, it can also be very difficult to pick up, it has a bit of a learning curve to it. The single player creative can be fun all its own, and the online multiplayer can be very intense expecially when running into someone in open space!			"

								As far as early acess games go, Space Engineers by far receives the most TLC from both devs and the workshop community. With Weekly updates both removing  bugs as well as consistently adding content that players want and care about, Space Engineers is shaping up to become one of the most broad and ludicrously fun space games on the market. Space Engineers is accessible enough to new players, as well as featuring a complexity curve that have you thinking of how establish and improve your designs for days on end. Highly recommended.			"

								I'm not going to lie, it's VERY laggy (at least if you have a potato computer like mine). But if you can get aside that (or go to a friends house where they have a good gaming computer), this can still be one of the best sandbox games you ever play. This is coming from a huge fan of both games, Space Engineers puts Minecraft to shame, and the detail and love you can put into your ships is amazing, until an asteroid says ""f*** you"" and destroys it. I love my ship, the USG Ghostlurker, and if you like space games and space combat/building, you'll love your's too. The best part is, in this game I was never killed over a can of beans or robbed of my pants, here the people are civilized.			"

								Game has its merits, however is highly bugged. Pistons and rotors explode destroying your ship, base, yourself for no reason; after you spent hours adjusting and readjusting and hoping and praying they dont explode. The pirate attacks are weak and non existant. The meteor shower element is pointless, since its nearly impossible to defend against them, unless you want to hide inside an asteroid or a base away from the sun. So unless you just want to build and keep building with no purpose, other than to just build for building sake.... the one thing that makes it fun, the rotors and pistons, is the very thing that makes you NOT want to play it.

								A highly-technical, yet highly-creative open-world voxel-based building game, with a setting that will hugely appeal to sci-fi fans. It is currently in-development, with weekly updates constantly adding features and squashing bugs. Highly-addictive gameplay, comparable to that of certain other open-world voxel-based building games, with outstanding mod support. Set yourself a goal, and bam, 5 hours of your life is gone.It unfortunately sports a brief, but steep, learning curve, and requires kind of a decent rig to get acceptable performance, but I suspect the intended (and potential) audience for this game will be able to overcome these issues.

								I've played this ""little"" game for a while now. 3 Years early access is dangerous because, they add and add lots of things that i can't count, and the game is heavier every patch. Then they added planet to the game, and gravity field for each.That was the quitessence of the updates. From this time, I thought : ""This survival space game is a master piece"". I wonder what they added now, because my computer can't handle it anymore. To much data and interaction. Of course I could launch the smallest map, with the lowest quality, but what's the point ? This game deserves a brutal gamer computer to be enjoyed as it should be.So i'm sorry lovely engi, but i can't commend a game that i can't play, even if i bought it.Maybe in 2 or 3 years, when game will be stabilized and optimized, i will remove this view. Until that, I go back play to Eve.			"

Early Access Review
								I've had this game for over 2 years now.In the beginning it was very bug free, When new features were implemented, they had little effect on existing systems.I praised this game as a really good example of how early access should be done.But in the past 6 to 8 months something has changed. Whether they have new developers or what happened I don't know, but this game is now unplayable.There are a number of show-stopping bugs that creep up, and when you work your way around them, you get face-blasted with another stupid bug that prevents you from doing anything.None of the new features they have been attempting to add can be tested at all because of some basic bugs.Also this games direction to the realm of 'AI' is ridiculous. This was space 'engineering' and when they decided to add dogs and spiders before ever providing us with a proper linear bearing is unacceptable.Planets looks like a great idea, but they can't be bothered to fix the #1 transport that is needed. Wheels.Their steering mechanism is just all wheels = same angle, and makes driving impossible, and your creations will just explode when attempting to drive them anywhere.I do not recommend this game to anyone in its current state.I'm really disappointed with the way the development of this game has been going as of late.EDIT: 3 months later and 15min into the game, my character suddenly gets pulled and stuck in structures I'm attempting to weld or grind. This game is still a god damn mess. AVOID!!!!!!I've now uninstalled this game. It's not worth the HD space nor my time even glancing at updates coming in			"

								i have almost 800 hrs in this game, for first few months this game was extremly addictive for me, until the bugs just got worse and worse to where most my ships or mechs were broken, so i'd have to wait several weeks hoping the weekly update would fix them, to wait for 1 bug to get fixed and 10 more pop up. The community is great and very helpful, large modding workshop as well but i prefer to build in vanilla as it is more creative in IMO. Multiplayer is garbage in this game, there are servers out there that do work ok but your lucky if your stuff is there next time you join :( impossible to play MP if your ship has rotors, most the time it breaks apart as soon as you load blueprint into world or if your not host you cant even see you ship half the time. The idea of the game is epic but Keen has there head up there♥♥♥♥♥bring us features nobody needs like sun flares and cut scene editors, like fix♥♥♥♥♥♥first before you do all the lame features we dont need. i will come back to game when it is more stable if that ever happens, for the price the game is worth it but dont expect a bug free time, some can live with the bugs, some cant like me.

								I love games like Minecraft, Spore, Loadout, and GoD Factory: Wingmen that encourage their players to play their way to win. Space Engineers shows so much promise for being an early access game. It is a little grindy, especially if you don't set any multipliers on tool speed and output, but I'm beginning to realize that that is actually a very good thing. In Minecraft, if you lose a tool or stack of ores/blocks, it's not very hard to just go and get them all back. This game makes you value what you build and adds some very nice flavor/mechanics to the building process as well. And after you're done building, flying around in space ships of your own design, blowing stuff up is the freaking best!			"

Early Access Review
								There's a lot of potential in this game. Just a quick peek at the workshop is enough to convince some people to buy this game, and Ive sunk many hours into the game experimenting with highly customized ships and diverse mods. Despite that, there are some things holding this game back that really detracted from my enjoyment and resulted in my recommendation to avoid this game. Mainly, poor optimization. Ive played single player and made numerous ships and stations, and each save game gets increasingly unplayable as I go. Framerate drops occur within an hour of playing and continue to decline. I can only put a dozen hours into a world before I'm forced to start over, unless constantly destroy old stuff as I go. And if you use mods, the same problems occur, at a much greater rate. Long-term goals and achivements haven't really been implemented, so there isn't much reason to play survival aside from increasing the time and difficulty it takes to build anything.  The game has also been in EA for three years and I'm unsure how well development will continue. I do think it's worthwhile keeping an eye on this, however.  "

								Sure, it's in early access, but this is one of the few games I'd recommend bying despite being out so early.I mean, it's a space version of Minecraft, but instead of building static objects, you can make giant ships and crash them together, make smaller fighters to go about and destroy eachother, or sculpt asteroids to your liking with TBMs.What's not to like?With tons of options on how to build things, you can create pretty much anything you want. Whether it's a ship from a show you liked, or something you made up entirely, chances are you can make it look very similar to the original idea, if you put in some thought.There are numerous parts to choose from, and the creative mode is a ton of fun, it's mainly getting to create things.Survival sets different goals, survival, and has infinitely slower building, which is far more rewarding for the size of the built ship.As for the negatives (written 28/4/04), the multiplayer seems to have problems with ping, non-exploding objects, and sometimes rockets hitting their own launch tube if lagging even the slightest bit, but I'm sure they'll fix these issues.Same goes with performance. Lights are currently unnecessarily demanding, especially spotlights, but again, still in development and will surely get touched up.			"

I like building stuff freely and not having to stick to a story or missions.This in combination with engineering is great, being able to create complex machines, spaceships, etc.Lastly, another thing I like about this game, is that, because its still being developed, new items and blocks are constantly being added which I think is great, because in this way, there is always new stuff to explore.Love it, Great game.-TheJaegerBomb			"

								Hello viewes of reviews; most of you reading this post will know a game called Minecraft.  Minecraft has been one of the best games developed due to its simple but extensive world and creativeness.  With such a great game, can anything match Minecraft?  I give you Space Engineers, to next step after minecraft.  If your wanting to build spaceships, factories, and explore different planets, its Space Engineers.   Would you want to try and survive in space with your friends?  Its Space Engineers.  Do you want to have a good idea what space is like?  Visit Space engineers.    Thus I recommend this game for those who love to be creative and want to hang out with friends.  *Note:  this game is moderately complex and I suggest asking a friend who has the game to give you a quick tutorial.

But after playing for a while you get to know more of the elements of the game and is alot more enjoyable. Overall this game deserves a 8.5/10. Only down sides are bugs and glitches that I'm sure will be fixed and that the game is relatively new.			"

								(WARNING HORIBAL SPELLING)Space Engineers is a mine craft in space in development. It has a soft body engien, creating system for ships, GUNS, multiplayer, and more to come. Server creating is noob freindly (me) so any one can do it. The game is great but you will needed to learn key bindings in the game to give your ship a sweet a$$ paint job or give your guy color. This game for me was fun and creative for all the ships i made over 5hours playing it and sences it still in development it means you have more stuff to look forword too in the game.Overall BUY THE F@$#ING GAME.P.S. noobs or people in general will always shoot you first.

								Prior to the Multiplayer update, I would have easily given this game a negative review.  At first, I was very displeased with the developer of this game, mainly for not intending to include multiplayer, when his kickstarter clearly showed that Multiplayer was in the game.  It was a great disapointment when the developer said that he never, and nor does he now, have plans to release a multiplayer version.  I was sure that this was another one of those early access games where the developer makes his money, and then bails on the project.  However, the developer quickly got his act together, and decided to add multiplayer, and started doing updates at a very quick pace.  Now multiplayer is in the game, and I've got to tell you, its a whole new level of survival and multiplayer!This game has endless hours of content, and while it still needs a lot of improvement (Mainly how long it takes to build a space ship that can literally be destroyed in a fraction of a second), you can tell that it is now going places.I would highly recommend this game, even in its current state!  If you enjoy sandbox survival with mining and pvp, then stop thinking about it and just get this game!Keep up the good work Mr. Developer, your doing much better than you were before!			"

								You need two things for this game: patience and imagination. So I would only recommend it for people who have both.Being fresh from alpha and only just hitting beta, the game still has bugs, which, from my own perspective are being ironed out.I mention perspective, because it seems that people with different machines, seem to have different experiences. Some have had little to no trouble with bugs. Others experience a few problems and others a lot (and it doesn't always seem to be computer spec related).Having got the negative out of the way, the game has so much potential and actually runs pretty well on my ""average"" PC.If you're a problem solver, then this will be right up your alley.If you're the type of gamer who just wants everything to work perfectly with absolutely no effort at all on your part, then you should leave this page. Now. The game is in beta, so you'll need to be a ""guinea pig"" for a while.Some people like being part of the development process and some don't.If you do - then totally get it.			"

								SE was one of the reasons I actually got steam in the first place, if I remember correctly, and that is not a decision I at all regret. The devs are a motley crew of awesome people, who take the time to appreciate comminty works as well as listening to their feedback nd requests. Although the game has been in Alpha for quite some time, the constant stream of updates (now split in to standard and devopment branches) is enough to justify it. But on to the game. You'll have to battle space robot dogs, giant space spiders, the need for resources and of course oxygen/hydrogen, but these can all be disabled in the world settings. In creative your biggest limit is your imagination, myself having built a ship that is 6 miles long. Don't get disheartened if your first few ships are little more than boxes, that's how it always starts!			"

								Let me just say I love the idea of this game.I got this game right about when it came out, maybe a little after. Sure, there were bugs, but it was still fun to fly around on spaceships with your friends and try to survive the harsh realities of space. I can remember late nights spent with a group of friends sitting around a table, all of us gripping our mouses tightly and yelling commands at each other as our ship's engines started to fail, our masterpiece heading towards an increasingly large asteroid. We built epic bases, hunted down pirates, mined precious metals, pretty much did it all. I could really see the possibility for this game. But as the game developed, it got more and more buggy. Adding giant planets sure didn't help. The technology and developement was left in the dust of the ideas. The game became more and more demanding, to the point where it was impossible to play on our laptops, and became mostly unplayable due to bugs. If you want to buy this game, check back here in a year or six months, or until the game comes out of early access. In the mean time, try Emperion or another space based survival game. Space Engineers takes the cake for creativity, possibility, and gameplay, but it is simply not developed enough to be worth buying at this point in time. I sincerely hope the developers fix the bugs and reduce the demand of the game. Just don't waste your money on it now.			"

								Full german review:http://www.topfree.de/space-engineersGrind materials, build a Space Ship and crash it into a meteor. The dream of every kid. Actually, the game is doing good in fulfilling this dream.The game runs on a modified version of the Havoc engine and offers a decent 3D space enviroment with realistic physics in zero gravity and vacuum.With a toolset of different forms of blocks, building parts and engines, you can design really nice looking ships and are also able to fly them.With focus on realism you wont find laser guns and warp drives, but the survival in a hostile environment with the constant need of energy ressources to maintain your vital systems.The game isnt really finished and playing the survival mode doesnt feel, like its worth the time.But the core of the game is amazing:Building: You are able to build complex structures, that can do different tasks in different situations, like battlestations, refinerys, mining rigs, scouts, transporters and space stations.Factions: You are able to team up with other players, and make alliances and war with other factions. Also systems can be protected, so they are only usable by you or your teammates.Technological Playground: To play with the game-engine you have a big toolbelt of tech: Sensors, wheels, pistons and rotors, remote controls, explosives and artificial gravity. From creating an elevator to building a big racing track or an automatic repair station, you can build, what you can immagine.Weekly updates give you a feeling of safety, you dont have in other early access games. Still on an early stage, the game is constantly evolving and hopefully will be a big thing in the next years.Because of the limits to the engine, the game world currently very small and empty.If you dont have a good PC or if you are not creative and just want a space experience, the game will disappoint you.But if it is your big thing to build and create, this game already has everything you ever wanted.

It's as much of a sandbox as it is an creative mode exploring the vast emptiness of space, Newly added features and various other improvements really help with the levels of immersion and realism, It's also received huge optimization upgrades regarding the overall implementation of both it's rendering and netcode, Seeing how I bought this thing early access when it was first available is pretty amazing watching it evolve and change, There wasn't much to when it was first released publicly but since that It's been fleshed out and improved upon dramatically.

								The game can be pretty fun in multiplayer, and it gets boring fast in single player, since there is little to nothing to explore. The optimization, however, is abysmal. It has been getting worse and worse over time and it shows no sign of getting solved. It is safe to say that at this point the devs probably have too much of a cluster♥♥♥♥ in their netcode to be able to optimize it properly.			"

								See below for my original post, as it still has merit in my opinion, however I've spent more time trying to see what this game has to offer. If you're new to it and looking to try the survival mode as I was, turn the environmental hazards off, and don't play on a planet world. They are relentless and make the game virtually unplayable for a new player. Why? Planets have robot dogs that apparently eat metal and space engineers, and prefer to spawn in packs of 3-6 every 1-4 minutes. This results in dying several times per hour, and a naturally occuring ""game reset"" as they consume both your body and the three blocks you've managed to build since the last time you died. Also, the environmental hazards are meteor storms that spawn centered on your head once every five minutes. They might not kill you, but they wreck any bases they touch. For example, I was robodog free on an asteroid base with a pre generated reactor and some crafting machinery. I thought the meteor storms were cool until one spawned on my head instead of somewhere else in ""infinite"" space and hit nothing. Except the reactor, which it obliterated. I had been playing for maybe 15 minutes at this point, so I had some components. I thought I would just build another one, but discovered I was still short some required components. I thought ""No problem, I'll just craft them really fast."" Pause. I need components to build a reactor. I need an assembler to build components.I need a reactor to power an assembler.Ergo, I floated off into space and died after about an hour of scrambling to find Step 1 that every sandbox survival game should have. Turns out Step 1 in Space Engineers is ""Start new game"" where they hand you a reactor, a refinery, and an assembler because the game is unplayable without any one of those things.Where this game currently shines is in the building. Once you turn it to safe mode and lose the dogs, you can actually make progress. Building ships in Space Engineers is immensely satisfying, requiring forethought, intentional block placement, and testing. The blocks they have are just plain cool, and each one offers a level of complexity and functionality that I find other games of this genre lack. The logic is fun and easy to use too. It almost made me forget how infuriating some of the previously mentioned content is. All of that said, I can say that I'm happy I bought it, though my negative recommendation will still stand as long as all that good stuff remains buried under so many half-baked and frustrating features. Original post:It's raw, complicated, and unpolished for a game already in development for several years. I spent 10 hours confirming that the crafting system is cyclical, meaning you can't start from scratch, and if you run out of power, which every thing in the game is trying to make happen, you will float into space and die without a single action you can take to rectify the situation. Pretty graphics, great physics, needs a metric shipload (see what I did there?) of work before I can recommend this, even at $8 on sale. Seriously, go play StarMade.			"

								This ""game"" plays like Garry's Mod with space-themed components, only worse. Despite the simple graphics it's far laggier than it has any right to be. Multiplayer is almost pointless -- though you can eventually find another player there's no real interaction other than being able to kill each other with terrible animations.  Spent my 2.5 hrs trying and failing to get started in a non-hostile environment where we could learn the game.  Thankfully was able to refund this way overpriced game, both copies.			"

								You need two things for this game: patience and imagination. So I would only recommend it for people who have both.Being fresh from alpha and only just hitting beta, the game still has bugs, which, from my own perspective are being ironed out.I mention perspective, because it seems that people with different machines, seem to have different experiences. Some have had little to no trouble with bugs. Others experience a few problems and others a lot (and it doesn't always seem to be computer spec related).Having got the negative out of the way, the game has so much potential and actually runs pretty well on my ""average"" PC.If you're a problem solver, then this will be right up your alley.If you're the type of gamer who just wants everything to work perfectly with absolutely no effort at all on your part, then you should leave this page. Now. The game is in beta, so you'll need to be a ""guinea pig"" for a while.Some people like being part of the development process and some don't.If you do - then totally get it.			"

								Legos in Space     This is my initial impression of Space Engineers. In the time I spent with it, I built a ""Space Bus"" and crashed several different vehicles. The best way to explain Space Engineers is that is operates like Legos in space. You build whatever your imagination fancies out of blocks and other bits. Building is easy and efficient and really only limited to your imagination. You can also color your creation and fly it about the randomly generated space world. For those who fancy construction it does this very well.     Of course, the ying to constructions yang is destruction. And you can do this with anything you build. You can fly ships into other ships, space stations, or asteroids. This is equally as fun as building in Space Engineers.    But, Space Engineers does something even better. The Space part. The physics model is absolutely amazing. Flying ships is not like in Wing Commander or Strike Suit Zero. Space flight is based on actual physics. Thrusters are used to steer and move your ship. Bigger ships require bigger thrusters. Thankfully, Space Engineers understands it is still a game and inertial dampeners are included with your space suit. It makes moving about in space infinitely more easy. Of course, you can swith this off and have some fun just reenacting the movie Gravity. I have not spent much time in multiplayer, which traditionally is not my cup of tea, but it seemed pretty good of what I tried of it. Definitely worth a go, even in its Early Release state.			"

								If you've ever played Minecraft back in the day, during pre-release, and wanted Notch/Jeb/Whoever to expand more on the Contraption Aspect (Red Stone, Pistons, levers and buttons) than the fantasy, you're in for a treat. Space Engineers is what you've been looking for, and more! Space Engineers (SE for short) isn't your everyday sandbox game. Its a sandbox game... IN SPACE! The two main features of this game, so far, are: Creative Mode: A free build mode with the only limitations being your computer, and your imagination!- In this mode blocks are placed instantly, no resources are required to power your creations, and death is no issue (in fact, it can be turned off)- One of the newer features for Creative is the Copy & Paste funciton (Ctrl-X for cut, Ctrl-C to duplicate, and Ctrl-V to paste from clipboard) Survival Mode: In this mode, you can die. -When building only a Framework of a block is placed, and its required for you to gather materials (Through mining, or salvaging other blocks with your grinder) to weld the block to completion. - The health system is divided into two parts: Your suits power, and your actual health. If you lose power while floating in space, whelp, you gon' die, slowly. Remember ""No one can hear you scream in space.""

Early Access Review
								Let me just say I love the idea of this game.I got this game right about when it came out, maybe a little after. Sure, there were bugs, but it was still fun to fly around on spaceships with your friends and try to survive the harsh realities of space. I can remember late nights spent with a group of friends sitting around a table, all of us gripping our mouses tightly and yelling commands at each other as our ship's engines started to fail, our masterpiece heading towards an increasingly large asteroid. We built epic bases, hunted down pirates, mined precious metals, pretty much did it all. I could really see the possibility for this game. But as the game developed, it got more and more buggy. Adding giant planets sure didn't help. The technology and developement was left in the dust of the ideas. The game became more and more demanding, to the point where it was impossible to play on our laptops, and became mostly unplayable due to bugs. If you want to buy this game, check back here in a year or six months, or until the game comes out of early access. In the mean time, try Emperion or another space based survival game. Space Engineers takes the cake for creativity, possibility, and gameplay, but it is simply not developed enough to be worth buying at this point in time. I sincerely hope the developers fix the bugs and reduce the demand of the game. Just don't waste your money on it now.			"

								I might expected too much to an early access game, but seriously? Man, hear me out.Listen, last week, I had a chance to try out a powerful computer which's made up of i7 4770 and GTX 760, and 8 gigs of RAM. Because mine(i3-3220, GTX ""The Swindle"" 650) is clearly no match to it, I got very excited to test it. With... Two major CPU hummers! One is Kerbal Space Program and another is Space Engineers. But I'm not going to compare both of them. Just Space Engineers and its severe limit. Yeah, it has severe limit. Let's take a look.Space Engineers is notorious for using CPU resource a lot. No wonder why weaklings like i3 3220 is not enough. But since I now have full control of i7 4770, if I run SE(Abbreviation of Space Engineers) on there and spawn a capital ship that consists 36 000 blocks, could it maintain 60 FPS? My processor managed to make it visible on screen, but failed to make the game playable. (Average FPS was 5.)After installing and launching SE on that beast, test preparation was done. Time to hit it. The capital ship I used for testing is 'Rangatira Carrier'. If interested, find it in the steam workshop. Aight, let's do it!From the moment when I pressed spawning hotkey, the game freezed for about 20 sec. The result was shocking. 10 FPS. I'm not joking it was literally 1/0/F/P/S. At least it was consistent but.. My poor Ivy Bridge(i3 3220) also managed to have consistent 5 FPS. Don't misunderstand, I was keep talked about average FPS, not highest...I mean seriously, where was Haswell working to? She was working really hard. All cores were loaded to 90%. My i3 can - barely but - do that too! A pity. What a pity that a CPU that is three times powerful than another can't run a game on 30 FPS. Even 20, But 10! What a terribly, terribly terribly unoptimized game... :(Conclusion?Never build computer for SE. You'll need a - ahem, sorry, 'plenty of' - frickin' i7 6950! Cherry on the cake, 'it'll not enough' for rendering aforementioned capital ship at 60 FPS. I promise. Super-high-end CPU has no benefit for being super-high-end in SE. I know I pushed the game to the limit. However, can you accept the fact when you know the i3 does the 1/2 of what i7 does? I mean, i3 does 5 FPS while i7 does 10 FPS. At least I can't.Just... Imagine you're a man who passed doctors course in princeton university and yesterday just got employed where you wished to work there since you're in middle school but all they does are not helpful to company, chairman and directors are making worst decision everytime, and for the berries on a cake, they are forcing you to work so hard that you could die at any moment. Annnnnd the company was a cleaning company, which disguised as high-tech enterprise.Important: Still, buy Space Engineers to fund developers! They are consistently releasing updates every friday. So don't worry about developers. This is nothing like Towns. More crucially, this game has potential. We just need to wait until it leaves early access, and become fully playable! I suggest you to wait 2 years after purchase. I bought this since 2013 and was♥♥♥♥♥♥ determined to wait for 2 years, after two years I played SE and was still♥♥♥♥♥♥ See, this game has some consistency, It'll never betray you. Same pattern goes on, and on, and on...P.S. Don't ask me why important message is placed way down below.			"

								Space Engineers has great potential, but it is let down by the out-of-touch developers who refuse to fix bugs and instead opt to keep cramming the game full of new features instead. This game is a lesson similar to what happened with Skyrim: Your game can be incredible, but it doesn't matter if I can't play it.That is exactly the case here. However unlike Bethesda who got Skyrim playable to an acceptable standard within months, I still see GAMEBREAKING bugs in this game that were around in 2014 still being present three years later. It is clear to me that Keen Software has no interest in fixing this broken game and I am concerned with their statements about the game ""Never being finished."" or perpetually ""In a state of Early Access."" SE is fun, until you get invested enough to past the sugary coating, only to find the filling of cake is actually feces instead of chocolate. I write this, having played the game for years now and just having to delete my longest ever save (Which I invested many, many hours into) due to gamebreaking bugs that Keen refuses to fix. Don't buy this. Instead, check out Empyrion: Galactic Survival. Sincerely, a thoroughly annoyed veteran player.			"

								This game has me very mixed in feelings.  It's the best game ever and it's also the worst.  Making ships is 10/10, Mining and flying through space and landing on planets 10/10.  Finding out multiplayer is potato with over 8 people doing something at the same time is 3/10.Fix the netcode and it will be one of the best online creative multiplayer games on steam.  Single player is good to get started, but it gets lonely when you have a star fleet and no-one to share it with.  Or kill... :PSeriously, this gameplay is meant to be multiplayer and have huge battles, share designs, creative communities, and civilizations!SPGameplay: 8.5/10MODS: 10/10Graphics: 7/10 (Sorry blocky ship designs)Mechanics: 8/10MPGameplay   PVP: Varies; 1.00 Sim speed, it's 8/10, less than .75 sim can be as low as 1/10   Stability: Not too many drops, crashes, but MP 6/10 on averageCommunity: Amazing people!  10/10			"

								If you've ever played Minecraft back in the day, during pre-release, and wanted Notch/Jeb/Whoever to expand more on the Contraption Aspect (Red Stone, Pistons, levers and buttons) than the fantasy, you're in for a treat. Space Engineers is what you've been looking for, and more! Space Engineers (SE for short) isn't your everyday sandbox game. Its a sandbox game... IN SPACE! The two main features of this game, so far, are: Creative Mode: A free build mode with the only limitations being your computer, and your imagination!- In this mode blocks are placed instantly, no resources are required to power your creations, and death is no issue (in fact, it can be turned off)- One of the newer features for Creative is the Copy & Paste funciton (Ctrl-X for cut, Ctrl-C to duplicate, and Ctrl-V to paste from clipboard) Survival Mode: In this mode, you can die. -When building only a Framework of a block is placed, and its required for you to gather materials (Through mining, or salvaging other blocks with your grinder) to weld the block to completion. - The health system is divided into two parts: Your suits power, and your actual health. If you lose power while floating in space, whelp, you gon' die, slowly. Remember ""No one can hear you scream in space."" The other way you can die... well there's a thousand ways to die in space: Smash your face into an asteroid, Someone puts a drill to your face thinking its sweet sweet Uranium, your ship gets blown up, Random space debris decapitates you. The posibilities are endless.Some with the vanilla items in the game to use at your disposal are:-Armor blocks (Your basic building blocks, you get Heavy and Light)-Reactors: needs Uranium for Survival.

As soon as multiplayer is out - Me and my friends are going to have a blast attacking eachother or helping one another on a large project. As an early access - I'm giving it an easy 9/10. May increase or decrease overtime but this is a good first impression of the game. I look forward to future updates. "

If there was ever a game in early access that was worthy of your hard earned cash then this is it. The Devs deliver. Every Thursday something new comes out.The game is like legos with physics for people with half a brain. The possibilites ARE endless with the Steam Workshop integration already in, and on top of that the weekly updates. Finally, the price is right. Who can't spare 20 bucks? Thats when its not on sale. Well worth every penny.  On a personal note. The NERVE of Spacebase DF-9 thinking their worth more then Space Engineers! I wouldn't give them half a cent for that game and would happily double what I paid for Space Engineers!			"

								Full german review:http://www.topfree.de/space-engineersGrind materials, build a Space Ship and crash it into a meteor. The dream of every kid. Actually, the game is doing good in fulfilling this dream.The game runs on a modified version of the Havoc engine and offers a decent 3D space enviroment with realistic physics in zero gravity and vacuum.With a toolset of different forms of blocks, building parts and engines, you can design really nice looking ships and are also able to fly them.With focus on realism you wont find laser guns and warp drives, but the survival in a hostile environment with the constant need of energy ressources to maintain your vital systems.The game isnt really finished and playing the survival mode doesnt feel, like its worth the time.But the core of the game is amazing:Building: You are able to build complex structures, that can do different tasks in different situations, like battlestations, refinerys, mining rigs, scouts, transporters and space stations.Factions: You are able to team up with other players, and make alliances and war with other factions. Also systems can be protected, so they are only usable by you or your teammates.Technological Playground: To play with the game-engine you have a big toolbelt of tech: Sensors, wheels, pistons and rotors, remote controls, explosives and artificial gravity. From creating an elevator to building a big racing track or an automatic repair station, you can build, what you can immagine.Weekly updates give you a feeling of safety, you dont have in other early access games. Still on an early stage, the game is constantly evolving and hopefully will be a big thing in the next years.Because of the limits to the engine, the game world currently very small and empty.If you dont have a good PC or if you are not creative and just want a space experience, the game will disappoint you.But if it is your big thing to build and create, this game already has everything you ever wanted.

								With this game its like with Logitech products: You hate it, but there isn't anything better...TL;DR: Three things that kills this game:- Speedlimit of 105m/s- Bugs with Landing Gears- When you leave the seat of your spacecraft while fling at any speed, its lagging (high speeds result in insta death).These 3 things never changed in all the time I own SpaceEngineers (1-2 years).This results in:- Building/Repairing while fling trough space? Nope, 0.0m/s or you'll die or loose your ship.- I just want to grab that other ship with my landing gears, great it works! 2 Minutes later CRAZY SPINNING EVERYONE DIES- We are moving with 1.0m/s? Lets see how hard it is to get trough that door. IMPOSSIBLE!If those 3 things are fixed this game is worth 60 €. "

								this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. it has nothing in common with the triple-A games nowadays.i mean, seriously, what kind of successful game has weekly updates filled with tons of stuff that you would actually use in-game? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, right?and when did listening to the fans became a thing? just look at the forums, the devs are doing it completely wrong, implementing everything the community wants and asks for!not to speak about the content that's already available...gameplay: i haven't played much of the survival, but i can tell you: on the hardest setting, surviving isn't a task, it's a lifegoal IRL!offering an enormous selection of blocks, your imagination is literally the only limit. they even implemented wheels after a lot of nagging from the players!the similarity with minecraft is that you build with specific blocks. thats where the similarities end.10/10i can't tell you how great every aspect of this game is.

								One of the best space sandbox game out there, but it has still a long way to go before it is finished.Space Engineers has the best 3D space ship customazitation so far, because you simply build every bit of it (along with KSP, but these games are very different). It's very open to the community, the source code is being shared via github and as a result the workshop is full of features like new blocks, utility scripts and other creations. Yes, it is still under development with bugs and it is one long hype train thanks to the enthusiastic dev team that walks paths nobody walked before them.			"

								So I got this from the humble survival bundle. This is the only reason I'm not demanding a refund. I've been playing through the training missions. In one, you need to ""bridge power"" across a section of asteroid. It's four sections wide, and it should be easy, right? Well, the third section won't place, no matter what I do. So I go up and over, and get past..but it's clunky and ugly. A different training mission, I'm supposed to assemble a conveyor belt. Add two sections to two pre-existing sections and weld it all to get it working...one section ""snaps"" in the air a fraction of an inch off from the existing conveyor. I have to re-start the training session because there is no way to remove that component. THIS is fixable by including a grinder in the chest! It's a no-brainer! A few ""training"" missions later, you're building your first ship...step one. Snap a ""landing gear"" to a pillar to start construction...guess what won't snap to any solid surface? So you can place it, in mid-air, and work while it's floating. Eventually it might land and snap...mine landed and snapped to the ceiling on the far end of the hangar. Building upside down without gravity isn't fun, but it's doable..but comon, guys. Also, the instructions on how to change from ""large"" components to ""small"" components is not explained... On the wall it says ""start a new small ship"". Trust me when I say, ""Start new small ship"" is written nowhere in the interface. And, on the next to last training session, I inadvertendly grab the fuel out of one of the ships. Guess what? That ship was built in such a way that you can't access the reactor...so I can't put the fuel back in. I can remove it from the ship interface...but I can't install it. What gives? I honestly don't know why I'm forcing myself through the training missions when they show me I should just uninstall the game and move on, but part of me wishes this game wasn't a steaming pile of wasted potential. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time. If the training missions aren't playable...what the hell does it say about the rest of the game?			"

								Space Engineers has great potential, but it is let down by the out-of-touch developers who refuse to fix bugs and instead opt to keep cramming the game full of new features instead. This game is a lesson similar to what happened with Skyrim: Your game can be incredible, but it doesn't matter if I can't play it.That is exactly the case here. However unlike Bethesda who got Skyrim playable to an acceptable standard within months, I still see GAMEBREAKING bugs in this game that were around in 2014 still being present three years later. It is clear to me that Keen Software has no interest in fixing this broken game and I am concerned with their statements about the game ""Never being finished."" or perpetually ""In a state of Early Access."" SE is fun, until you get invested enough to past the sugary coating, only to find the filling of cake is actually feces instead of chocolate. I write this, having played the game for years now and just having to delete my longest ever save (Which I invested many, many hours into) due to gamebreaking bugs that Keen refuses to fix. Don't buy this. Instead, check out Empyrion: Galactic Survival. Sincerely, a thoroughly annoyed veteran player.			"

								This game is a great building game and is a fun game to play overall. For lack of a better way of putting it, think minecraft in space except a heck of alot better. It uses technology we could conceivably have or hopefully will have in the near future. The game itself is great and will provide you with many hours of entertainment be it in survival mode or creative. Pros: -Design your own fighters/large ships and stations. -Full mod support-can host your own server-variety of mods and blueprints available in the workshop-many different play modes and worlds-wide variety of celestial bodies to explore ranging from asteroids to planets and moons-virtually unlimited space to explore-ships and stations only limited by your time and imagination. if you can think it you can build it-devs are usually very quick to acknowledge bug reports and to start getting fixes outCons: -combat not fully optimized yet and can be a bit laggy-game can be a bit unstable at times though typically not very long-hydrogen tanks take way too long to fill imo. (really more of a nit pick but one gripe i had with survival)-display information not as detailed on objects as I would like. for me there are a few more items I would like to see on the hud or displays for cockpits, such as a fuel gauge and a few other measurements. again kind of a nit pick but still something I wouldn't mind seeing.Overall this is a very great game. At the end of the day though I would advise people to keep in mind this game is still technically in Alpha and hasn't even made it to beta testing yet. As the game is refined, polished and made better, there are going to be changes. Issues that you see now and even ones that I posted in this may not be issues tomorrow. This game has some great potential considering that it's still in Alpha and they already have this much stuff done for it. The final product will be epic. If you're looking for a fun game that you can play with your friends, or team up to take on the enemy computer factions, then this game won't disappoint. The game will only get better as time goes.

								This game has a love-hate relationship with me. I shall name some pros and cons.Pros:* Graphics are nice, decent textures, nice models.* Music is cool (though doesn't change with the progress of the game, it's a playlist)* The concept is nice, it's not your average survival game.* Decent ammount of options to build your things (small ship blocks, large ship blocks and a whole loot of different  blocks  to make your ship do different things.Cons:* Buggy, (landing gear exploded, thrusters broke down for no reason, Died leaving ships. I could go in, in one piece, I have to come out in one piece right? Lose health or even die when seemingly tripping over nothing, pistons break for no reason)* Beginning of the game is very hard. ''Great there's no uranium on my starting asteroid...'' finally found uranium after 20 km's... Also running out of uranium in the beginning, better dump the world and start a new one... Killed by large pirate ships in the very beginning, also destroyed my refinery. Time for a new world...* Very few weapon options, A gatling gun and some rockets, that's about it. We can create the biggest nuclear most advanced stuff, but we cannot build a simple lasergun?* Game is unforgiving and hard to get the hang off. Play without tutorials? gl with that... I'm not bad at this game but it's hard enough to suppress the experience and fun.* Power generators are not balanced. Nuclear generators are OP, solar panels are the exact opposite, aka needing HUGE fields of panels to get stuff working.* Ships are weak... of course, it's not meant to be that you bump into something but i dont want to lose half my ship after doing that. one rocket on your cockpit and its bye bye character. It would be nice to introduce a shielding module.It's not a bad came but stuff is poorly executed. And it needs fixing and optimisation. I can run skyrim on ultra high with 2 k textures and very decent FPS. For this game, I have to set things the lowest settings, and low resolution to get that.Why the thumbs down? I had to choose. If you are willing to overlook the bugs and if you are feeling masochisitc, you can try this game. Don't buy it if you want immediate pay off. "

Simply.Not to mention, after a few hours of playing ships that are spawned in, don't actually... de-spawn.I've been forced to go in, and delete ships manually that are so far away that you can't see them.But are there, and cause a severe memory leak to the game.Causing FPS drop, and crashes.The devs' just took too much on to said plate, at once.Game started off good, but it's now dying with a slow, pop-fizzle.

I shall name some pros and cons.Pros:* Graphics are nice, decent textures, nice models.* Music is cool (though doesn't change with the progress of the game, it's a playlist)* The concept is nice, it's not your average survival game.* Decent ammount of options to build your things (small ship blocks, large ship blocks and a whole loot of different  blocks  to make your ship do different things.Cons:* Buggy, (landing gear exploded, thrusters broke down for no reason, Died leaving ships. I could go in, in one piece, I have to come out in one piece right? Lose health or even die when seemingly tripping over nothing, pistons break for no reason)* Beginning of the game is very hard. ''Great there's no uranium on my starting asteroid...'' finally found uranium after 20 km's... Also running out of uranium in the beginning, better dump the world and start a new one... Killed by large pirate ships in the very beginning, also destroyed my refinery. Time for a new world...* Very few weapon options, A gatling gun and some rockets, that's about it. We can create the biggest nuclear most advanced stuff, but we cannot build a simple lasergun?* Game is unforgiving and hard to get the hang off. Play without tutorials? gl with that... I'm not bad at this game but it's hard enough to suppress the experience and fun.* Power generators are not balanced. Nuclear generators are OP, solar panels are the exact opposite, aka needing HUGE fields of panels to get stuff working.* Ships are weak... of course, it's not meant to be that you bump into something but i dont want to lose half my ship after doing that. one rocket on your cockpit and its bye bye character. It would be nice to introduce a shielding module.It's not a bad came but stuff is poorly executed. And it needs fixing and optimisation. I can run skyrim on ultra high with 2 k textures and very decent FPS. For this game, I have to set things the lowest settings, and low resolution to get that.Why the thumbs down? I had to choose. If you are willing to overlook the bugs and if you are feeling masochisitc, you can try this game. Don't buy it if you want immediate pay off. "

								By far, one of my favorite physics sandbox games. The gameplay might not seem very deep, and a little over-complicated at first, but once you get the hang of it you'll be engaging in stupidity like the rest of us.Smashing your friends ships into reentry, loading yours with warheads and practically cutting an ai ship in half, or taking on a pirate station and trying to recreate the scene from star wars where the A-wing kamikazed into a star destroyer. Endless possibilities, and so much trolling potential. It's only a matter of time before they make survival mode playable, so you might be able to play it like a real video game too eventually, but for now it's hilarious destructive fun and well worth the price of admission.

								The game is a fun little thing. There is much to do and see- especially with yesterday's addition of planets. There are also A.I. enemies that will attack your base. There are multiple types of ships you can build- such as an atmospheric plane, a star fighter, station, probe, drill, star ship, rover, etc. Multiplayer is very well rounded and the game is mostly well optimized. However, glitches, clunky movement, and a steep learning curve keep this one from full marks. I recommend for Sci-Fi fans, KSP fans, and those who want to built their own X-wing and put it in their own U.S.S Enterprise.			"

								Maybe this game just wasn't for me, but I found it honestly a bit dull, not very user friendly, and multiplayer seemed lacking, probably because of the smallish community. I could see myself growing to like this game, maybe after some more investment and getting to know some folks on the servers, but from what i've been reading on these other reviews, the game seems to be stuck in a development cycle where they don't fix bugs and they don't seem to be working towards a release. I question buying the game now, will it be completed? Will the true experience the game should have ever be realized? Or have the developers grown content with the money they are earning and pushing out a new update once a week with flaws and some small changes.I'm skeptical, though I bought this game for a reason: I saw potential. I still do. I'm not saying that others shouldn't get this game, I'm saying you should realize what you're investing in before you play and know it's risky.			"

								WARNING, THIS GAME IS COMPLICATED.     What you have here is a mighty fine space sim here.  Although what you may see at first may be like, Wtf, this is Minecraft, but it is not.  Go jump right in survival mode and try to figure things out, or you could go on Youtube and watch a Let's Play. Either is fine. The gameplay is a little slow at first, but then it goes to be one of the most immersive games you will ever play. The survival constantly gives you things to do and gives you more objectives to do solo or with your friends.  For an example you need to go build a mining ship to get uranium ore for your reactor.  Or then, you need to collect resources to build a refinery so you can convert the uranium or into ingots.     Although if you dont like slower-paced build-it games then go back to CoD.  Like I said, the gameplay is slow at first but you wont even care when you have so many things and oppertunites to take and do.I highly reccomend this game, but only to some people, because not one game can please everyone.

								This game is to the space age what Minecraft is to the stone age. High quality game play, an active community and a responsive development team make this a top-notch game. Keep on mind that this game is in early release (alpha) and as such the developers are mainly concerned with new features and content. Some of this content does occasionally break portions of the game until a hot fix is made available. The benefit is the players are a major force in steering the final product.			"

The GoodOne of the greatest games I've ever played. It's very much like Minecraft, in that it's a survival game where you build things out of materials you gather. You go mining for materials, and can place block like objects in the world to create massive structures.However, the game obviously has much better graphics and gameplay. It also has an awesome system for building vehicles and ships. The physics are (for the most part) absolutely amazing. Space travel feels real, and you get fully immersed as if you really are exploring the vastness of space.Space Engineers allows for tons of creativity and exploration. Also, the modding community is quite awesome, so there's a lot of things to try out. It's also very easy to submit creations you make into the Workshop.The BadThe game JUST went into beta, so obviously there's still going to be a lot of bugs.Multiplayer is practicaly unplayable right now, due to severe lag. It's not due to the servers, it's all the servers, no matter what, due to the fact of how the game is programmed. Realistically, this game is SOOO complicated and expansive that I can't imagine how multiplayer could ever work (just because of system load), but who knows, they might work it out (it is still in beta!).Also, another terrible bug is that ships will randomly fly into the air for no reason, and there's no way to stop it. Basically, that ship is now lost. INCREDIBLY annoying if it happens on a server, especially if it's your landing craft when you start, and even worse if it happens twice in a row (as just happened to me).Even though I'm incredibly salty right now, I still highly recommend this game.

								This is easily one of my most favorite games of all time. I'm a huge sci-fi fan, and avidly play first-person shooters and Minecraft. Space Engineers blends together everything one could want in a game. From survival scenarios involving collecting and manufacturing resources to fleet-sized space warfare, Space Engineers offers something for all players to enjoy. The creativity and ingenuity of the community has no bounds, from extensive ship design to taking munitions past the in-game missile launchers. Play it, never leave it.			"

								I made the mistake of going to youtube and seeing people play this game... it seemed easy... simple to play and it looked like a lot of fun...  So I purchased it in Steam, installed it and got some mods...  I liked the fact that you could play it offline, since I travel extensively, I use my laptop to work and play while traveling...It is a disaster... The learning curve is painful, I realized that I WAS MISSING SOME CRITICAL KEYS... becuase laptops dont usually have numeric keypads...  I looked at the keys that could be assigned to compensate, just to realize that almost all the keyboard is assigned to some function or another...  Like in the era of text only games...  and keyboard only games...  So it became more and more painful...When traveling abroad, the charges for internet services are very high... and this little game proceeded to download the mods every time I started a new world...  I think the game could have been an incredible success, if the developer team had gotten out to the world of people, and realized that there are starndard controls, like when you right click, a menu appears so you can select options...  And that you can click on controls to get something to rotate or move....  :(Maybe next time guys...  I never even tried the community game...  I consider myself an adept to using systems, but a game is for enjoyment, not for pain, frustration and steep learning curves...my advise is: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, if you have a laptop and like to play on it... if you travel abroad, if you like simple, logical, business standard mouse clicking practices...  DO NOT BUY IT...What a disappointment... is like if LEGO had decided to have not only circular pegs, but also squares, triangles and you could only match the blocks if the pegs matched the holes...  :(			"

								I used to love this game when it first came out, the concept was great, but I cannot support this, that has now become a steaming pile.Keen Software can sure add new content every thursday, but they sure as hell can't optimize it worth sh!t and can't seem to understand that fixing the game so it is playable and doesn't have the potential to completely soft-lock your computer just from trying to start the m0therfocking game despite having well above the minimum specs is a MUCH better priority as of now, because at this point I almost want to demand a refund.If they can't understand that, I urge everyone to stop giving them money for this game until they fix the mounting issues they continuously create and then subsequently ignore.We don't need new blocks right now Keen Software, we need a game that doesn't potentially force you to hard-restart your computer (holding down the power button) just to make it operable again.

								I want to like this game, I really do. But the optimization & performance issues that I constantly run into with this game make it unplayable. I even waited over a year before trying it again and it's just gotten worse. Freezing / stuttering are rampant even with a high-end computer. If I can run everything else I own at max settings, this game should be the same. Even runs like garbage on low settings. What a shame.			"

								WARNING, THIS GAME IS COMPLICATED.     What you have here is a mighty fine space sim here.  Although what you may see at first may be like, Wtf, this is Minecraft, but it is not.  Go jump right in survival mode and try to figure things out, or you could go on Youtube and watch a Let's Play. Either is fine. The gameplay is a little slow at first, but then it goes to be one of the most immersive games you will ever play. The survival constantly gives you things to do and gives you more objectives to do solo or with your friends.  For an example you need to go build a mining ship to get uranium ore for your reactor.  Or then, you need to collect resources to build a refinery so you can convert the uranium or into ingots.     Although if you dont like slower-paced build-it games then go back to CoD.  Like I said, the gameplay is slow at first but you wont even care when you have so many things and oppertunites to take and do.I highly reccomend this game, but only to some people, because not one game can please everyone.

								I have owned this game for years and played it plenty. The game is entertaining to a point....but is filled with persistent bugs that the devs seem to ignore. Every update they seem to swing and miss what the community is really looking for, instead adding bogus features most people aren't truly interested in. The game is pretty much unplayable multiplayer, and some of the more crippling bugs even bleed over into single player.I wouldn't recommend it right now. Check back in a year and see if the Devs have managed to salvage this.			"

								Well, I purchased this (in beta) expecting a playable item. It is...to a degree.   I started a 'Lone Survivor' custom game - which is set in space. After a few hours, I decided to build a mining ship.  I saw a handy utube video and thought I'd give it a try. Oh dear! The starting point is impossible. Landing gear ALWAYS snaps upside down so that is impossible as a starting point. I tried just placing blocks then manoeuvring the ship up then add the landing gear later.  Oh dear! The starting block I placed ALWAYS sits off any platform and even with a gravity generator pumping out 1g if you move into the placed blocks they float away. Now, I have to say this is only when trying to use small-sized blocks but, unless you want to build a ship that only has large blocks...you are screwed.  So, unless this game improves into a 'gamma' build, or a workable stable offering, you may be advised to wait...or try some other, similar title.I would guess that if one started on a planet then these multiple build problems may disappear but that handicaps the entire experience. Sometimes the sound disappears so silence is all one has.It would be great to also have the option to relocate items without having to rebuild.			"

								While it is an enjoyable game, I have to stop playing every so often because the dev cycle breaks something. The complete custimization of every aspet is both a plus and a minus, though mostly positive. You can build almost anything, but have to build it one block at a time. The only real exception is when using a projector and welders, but this can be buggy on occasion. The colliders are another issue, with everything from small objects to huge ships, including the player, falling through all sorts of things, even planets, on occasion. I look forward to the later editions of this game when things stabilize.			"

								It's just not playable, and nobody knows why. If you're looking into buying this game there's only a 50-50 chance it'll actually run for you. There's no solid fix, nothing to blame other then lack of optimization, which of course has just been shrugged off to ""it's a beta"". That excuse will only last so long, and I wish I could get a refund. Don't buy this game until it's finished, and maybe, just maybe, it'll run. :)			"

								I have played this game for more than 200 hours and I expect to play it a great deal more.  This game started out as an iteresting ""build stuff in 3D space with physics"" thing, and building on that solid foundation has become so, so much more.The game now has fully alterable planets at 1/4 actual earth size with no load times between space and the surface. You could watch an object (or yourself) fall in real time from orbit if you wanted. Or fly a ship or lander into space from the ground.The recent graphical update is stunning, and you'll find yourself pausing every now and then just to say ""wow, look at the light reflecting off the hull of my ship, that's beautiful.""You can:-Mine asteroids with your hand drill, small custom build mining ships, or gigantic dreadnaught that swallow asteroids whole (all built by you).-Travel through the infinite expance of space to prospect rich ores, dangerous drone protected fortresses, and abandond stations waiting to be salvaged (many are contributions from the steam workshop).-Build huge stations and ships (designing the layout and functions piece by piece) in survival, or full creative modes.-Play with friend to work together / engage in full fps and ship-based warfare, or go it alone and pit yourself against the emptyness of space. Hope you brought your oxygen tank.This game is worth so much more than what they are asking, and will only increase in value. A truely rare gem of a game. I absolutely recomend it. (PS: does require a pretty good computer to run at high fps (on planets), but the developers are continuously increasing the performance and optimization)			"

								Okonomiyaki (お好み焼き) literally means “grilled as you like it” in Japanese. As the name implies, what goes into it and how it’s prepared depends largely on your preferences. That’s why it’s sometimes known as a “Japanese pizza” in the US.In most versions okonomiyaki is made with shredded cabbage and a pancake-like batter, but that’s where the similarities end. Some people like a soft custardy interior, while others prefer a ton of fillings with the batter merely binding the ingredients together. Since there are no hard and fast rules for the filling and toppings, it’s a great way to use up scraps from the fridge.That said, there are a two general styles of okonomiyaki: Hiroshima-style and Kansai-style. Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki is layered like a giant omelette and often includes yakisoba on the inside, with a fried egg on top. Kansai-style okonomiyaki on the other hand is mixed together before being cooked like a pancake.NagaimoNagaimo, which literally means “long potato” is a key ingredient in Kansai style okonomiyaki. It’s a species of yam consumed all over Asia. In Japan, it’s often eaten raw in salads and grated into sauces, but it has a thick mucus-like texture that tends to put people off who weren’t raised eating it. When cooked though, the sliminess dissipates and it provides a wonderful moist, creamy quality to batters like this one. One thing to remember though is that if you have sensitive hands, be sure to wear food-safe gloves when handling nagaimo as it can make your hands itchy.Another key point to getting a soft custardy Kansai-style okonomiyaki is to limit the development of gluten in the batter. That’s why it’s important to minimize mixing once you’ve added liquids to the flour. I’ve found that mixing the flour in with the cabbage first, and then adding the liquids, keeps the mixing to a minimum while evenly incorporating all the ingredients.Okonomiyaki ToppingsOnce cooked, the pancake is slathered with okonomiyaki sauce, though chuno or tonkatsu sauce are both similar and work perfectly fine). Typical toppings include Japanese mayonnaise, aonori (green nori flakes), katsuoubushi, and benishouga (red pickled ginger), but similar to the filling, what you put on top is largely up to your own preferences. Chili sauce, cheese, and even curry are fair game, making it a lot of fun to pair condiments with what’s inside each pancake.I’ve outlined the process and ingredients for a very basic okonomiyaki below, but like pizzas, it can be filled and topped with anything you like. Here are some ideas to show you how versatile okonomiyaki can be.Mentai Cheese OkonomiyakiMake the basic okonomiyaki below (minus the bacon), but add mentaiko and cheddar cheese to the mixture. The mentaiko adds spicy bits of salty pollack roe in every bite, while the cheddar melts, to form pools of cheese on the inside and crisps on the outside. Topped with chopped tomatoes and mayonnaise it presents beautifully and adds a fruity sweetness that goes well with the cheese.Smoked Salmon Thyme OkonomiyakiMake the basic okonomiyaki below (minus the bacon), but add smoked salmon and thyme and top with hollandaise sauce and aonori. With salty, smoky bits of smoked salmon in every bite and a tart creamy hollandaise sauce, this tastes more European than Japanese, but that doesn’t make it any less delicious.Prep Time 5 minutesCook Time 14 minutesIngredients400 grams cabbage (~half a small head)60 grams scallions (~2 scallions), thinly sliced10 grams katsuobushi140 grams flour - all-purpose (~1 cup)280 grams nagaimo peeled and grated2 large eggs1/2 cup dashi or cold water9 slices baconokonomiyaki saucemayonnaiseaonorikatsuobushibenishoga			"

								Great game concept. I love the feel of the game. Its very atmospheric and has great depth. But I have had many issues with the game that really spike some problems. 	1. There are way to many bugs, that should have been fixed a while ago.		I. Like how when your ship is moving when you try to move you instantly die.		II. Home screen lags because of a background video change		III. Even when on lowest render quality, game still runs on 3.1GB of RAM 	2. My computer isn’t id say the “Best” or “Crazy $” but still should be able to play it even on normal quality, “which it cant even run it on lowest,” so I believe that its very difficult for some people to play it, or at all if they don’t have a $3,000 computer. 	3. Game crashes A LOT! 		I. I haven’t played 5 minutes worth of the game without a crash are a stall for more than 10 minutes… I even had to manually shut the game down in task manager because the sound was continuous even as the game was shut down. 	All in all though I still like the game, it is frustrating that its buggy and a pain in the butt. But I believe that sometime they could fix all those issues and make it a step faster and work on it. And indeed if that happens I will be back on in a flash. Great game.. But just needs a little / or a lot o TLC.			"

								Okonomiyaki (お好み焼き) literally means “grilled as you like it” in Japanese. As the name implies, what goes into it and how it’s prepared depends largely on your preferences. That’s why it’s sometimes known as a “Japanese pizza” in the US.In most versions okonomiyaki is made with shredded cabbage and a pancake-like batter, but that’s where the similarities end. Some people like a soft custardy interior, while others prefer a ton of fillings with the batter merely binding the ingredients together. Since there are no hard and fast rules for the filling and toppings, it’s a great way to use up scraps from the fridge.That said, there are a two general styles of okonomiyaki: Hiroshima-style and Kansai-style. Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki is layered like a giant omelette and often includes yakisoba on the inside, with a fried egg on top. Kansai-style okonomiyaki on the other hand is mixed together before being cooked like a pancake.NagaimoNagaimo, which literally means “long potato” is a key ingredient in Kansai style okonomiyaki. It’s a species of yam consumed all over Asia. In Japan, it’s often eaten raw in salads and grated into sauces, but it has a thick mucus-like texture that tends to put people off who weren’t raised eating it. When cooked though, the sliminess dissipates and it provides a wonderful moist, creamy quality to batters like this one. One thing to remember though is that if you have sensitive hands, be sure to wear food-safe gloves when handling nagaimo as it can make your hands itchy.Another key point to getting a soft custardy Kansai-style okonomiyaki is to limit the development of gluten in the batter. That’s why it’s important to minimize mixing once you’ve added liquids to the flour. I’ve found that mixing the flour in with the cabbage first, and then adding the liquids, keeps the mixing to a minimum while evenly incorporating all the ingredients.Okonomiyaki ToppingsOnce cooked, the pancake is slathered with okonomiyaki sauce, though chuno or tonkatsu sauce are both similar and work perfectly fine). Typical toppings include Japanese mayonnaise, aonori (green nori flakes), katsuoubushi, and benishouga (red pickled ginger), but similar to the filling, what you put on top is largely up to your own preferences. Chili sauce, cheese, and even curry are fair game, making it a lot of fun to pair condiments with what’s inside each pancake.I’ve outlined the process and ingredients for a very basic okonomiyaki below, but like pizzas, it can be filled and topped with anything you like. Here are some ideas to show you how versatile okonomiyaki can be.Mentai Cheese OkonomiyakiMake the basic okonomiyaki below (minus the bacon), but add mentaiko and cheddar cheese to the mixture. The mentaiko adds spicy bits of salty pollack roe in every bite, while the cheddar melts, to form pools of cheese on the inside and crisps on the outside. Topped with chopped tomatoes and mayonnaise it presents beautifully and adds a fruity sweetness that goes well with the cheese.Smoked Salmon Thyme OkonomiyakiMake the basic okonomiyaki below (minus the bacon), but add smoked salmon and thyme and top with hollandaise sauce and aonori. With salty, smoky bits of smoked salmon in every bite and a tart creamy hollandaise sauce, this tastes more European than Japanese, but that doesn’t make it any less delicious.Prep Time 5 minutesCook Time 14 minutesIngredients400 grams cabbage (~half a small head)60 grams scallions (~2 scallions), thinly sliced10 grams katsuobushi140 grams flour - all-purpose (~1 cup)280 grams nagaimo peeled and grated2 large eggs1/2 cup dashi or cold water9 slices baconokonomiyaki saucemayonnaiseaonorikatsuobushibenishoga			"

								Do i like this game? HELL YESDo i recommend it? No, just no, not right now details belowPros:80 % of friends made from SEMade your childhood design spaceship REAL!You can be anything, no limit, no rulesYou can build anything(if you have the imagination)Cons:The game is buggy like hell(fun sometimes)Stable is unplayable in both single player and multiplayerMultiplayer is practically impossibleCrash every 5 minRubberbanding is strong with this oneDesync happen every now and then between client and serverClang GOD hate you when you play with rotors, piston, and wheelsDont get me wrong on this review, I love this game, i really really do, but seeing how it develop in these past few years, the game gone from bad, to worse. why you ask? The game is now being split into two variant that is develop and stable. while the develop keep getting weekly update, patch and hotfix, stable on the other hand receive all of that once a month. Recent update 01.144 (http://forums.keenswh.com/threads/update-01-144-stable-update-01-149-dev-bug-fixes-and-improvements.7386481/) have made the game pratically impossible to play both single player and multi player. The develop however is more playable in singleplayer but not multiplayer.Conclusion:If you can withstand the bug and clang destroyed your precious 20 hours of hardwork, i recommend you to get this gameif not, well.. stay away until full release(Will update the review once the game is much better)(29.08.2016)			"

								I bought this game as I thought it would fullfill my need for an open world space exploration survival game. I must say I enjoyed the creative mode, which basically gives you an infinite amount of space-Legos to build whatever crazy you want. I experienced no lag with even huge ships, and had fun for a couple of days with that.Other than that, the survival mode sucks major♥♥♥♥♥♥at the moment -> drilling for materials will most likely clip you through whatever you're trying to drill, resulting in an inevitable suicide. Also, -- !! WARNING !! -- if you are expecting Kerbal Space-like physics realism, this game will not be for you. As a sandbox, it is fun, but for survivalists - DO NOT BOTHER, this is just another broken survival early access which will not work, just in a different environment than usual			"

								A long time ago I purchased Space Engineers, I was a young man back then, filled with joy and excitement for this brand new game that I yearned to play. I gleefully downloaded the game, waiting patiently, knowing all my waiting will soon be rewarded with glorious gameplay. The download finished and in a tizzy, I started the game. The main menu booted up and I was astounded by the wonderous UI. I click join on my friend's game as he waited patiently so that good times could ensue. I join my friend's server and selected where I wanted to spawn. I left click respawn and after a little bit of lag, the game starts but one second after I have a glimpse of joy, I face a frozen screen and no audio, my game has crashed and I've got no escape. I'm an old man now, and have been waiting for years, filled with hope that one day my game will unfreeze. But until then, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself Keen Software House.EDIT:It's been almost two weeks since I've written this review, and nothing has changed, I've been glued to my computer, just waiting for the moment the game unfreezes. I know it will be a glorious day and my celebration is planned. The cake is starting to get moldy and my days are coming to an end. Please Keen Software House, save me from this endless hell and fix your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.			"

								Back in my original review in 2015, I had recommended this game. But seeing the state the game is in now honestly makes me sad.For starters, to experience things like planets you'll probably need to blow all your money away on some overpriced gaming computer. This is because Keen thought it would be a great idea to make the game have so much unpolished, buggy♥♥♥♥♥♥that it's literally impossible (as in, the game crashes upon me starting a world using dx11, despite me having it. gg keen) to use anything BUT DX9. Even then, I only get 20FPS on there now because this thing eats up RAM like a fatty eats mcdonalds.Back in 2014-2015, this game was perfectly fine on my computer. It ran amazingly well on low-end PCs with almost no crashes. Now you can't even play the ♥♥♥♥ing thing on anything but some $15,000 ""le tru ebin pee see mustard rice gaymin cumputer for hardcore gaymurs such as myself"" ugly alienware piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Worst part? There's literally no graphical difference whatsoever, the game looks the same as it did in 2013.Don't buy this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ you won't be able to run it.			"

								While it may be early access, this is a fantastic game if you love building stuff and anything space related. The developers are great too. They don't update once in a blue moon, making you think the game's dead between updates, but actually every thursday (sometimes friday if its late but shush). They listen to the community and fix any issue and add in new features that the masses want, without affecting their vision for the game. Recently planets were added. Giant, fully destroyable planets that exist in the same world as the rest of the game, theres no load time or anything as you plummet through the atmosphere because you put the wrong thrusters on your landing ship. Its not all creation focused too, theres enemy pirates and sabiroids to deal with too. Feel free to wait for a sale, but this game is worth your money, even in this early state.TLDR: Buy it now.			"

								I want to love this game. I really, really do. But it runs like complete and utter garbage. If you think ""Oh, it's been in early access for a couple years, it must be relatively stable by now"" you'd be absolutely dead wrong. If anything, it seems to run even worse than it did when I played it on a free weekend a year or so ago.I've sat here with a stop watch, and loading a new mod-less world on the ""Easy Start Moon"" takes 28 minutes. And when it does finally load, you have a roughly 25% chance that it will just crash. And if it doesn't crash, you'll run into too many bugs to keep track of. Here's a few I ran into just in the last few hours alone:1) Spawned into moon world, entire screen was white with black square artifacts floating around. Had to restart game. There goes another 20-30 minutes.2) Spawned into world and couldn't move at all. Had to reload world, another 20-30 minutes gone.3) Loaded a workshop ship (that used no mods) from blueprint, and 90% of the blocks in it had no collision model (you could fly right through them).4) Loaded a different ship from blueprint (which again used *no* mods), only 10~% of it loaded, and when I flew near it, I randomly died (in Creative mode, where you shouldn't be able to die at all).Oh, and the game constantly freezes for 2-5 seconds at a time, every 30 seconds or so, and does so even longer (30+ seconds) if you attempt to do almost anything (spawn a block, open a menu, etc.).This is absolutely unacceptable, especially considering how long this game has been out.System specs before someone claims I'm running this on a potato:i7 3770 with cores unparked8GB DDR3MSI 9707200rpm HDDNo viruses, all drivers up to date, all other non-essential programs closed down, drives regularly defragmented. I run other ""demanding"" PC games like ArmA 3 and Planetside 2 at max settings with no issues in either general performance, or load times specificially.Easily 2/3rds of my total playtime is in a loading screen. The other 1/3rd is fighting bugs. I don't think I've actually played this game yet, over hours of play time. Something is very, very wrong with this game. Don't trust Youtube videos that make this game look playable; it isn't, and you should avoid it like the plague.			"

								More or less nothing works in multiplayer after 2 years of early access.Rotors, pistons - useless; randomly explodes anything attached to them.Connectors - useless; randomly disconnects / blows up your ship / launches it into space.Constant crashing, especially when mining anything with the hand drill.Ships randomly stuck in autopilot mode - even when no remote control modules or anything autopilot enabled anywhere in the current game.Countless other issues that make the game impossible and incredibly frustrating to play anything other than creative mode - but only in single player.

								I have held off for quite some time now on writing a review for this game.  I have 1,661 hours logged of construction and destruction in space and on the planets.  It's in Alpha, but it would take almost a year of work to get it out of Alpha and into some sort of beta.  As other reviewers have stated, you weekly updates that add some things and ""fix"" some things.  Inevitably every update also breaks something.  Multiplayer used to be doable; however, it's completely bogus to try to do so now.  The sad part is this game does have an extreme amount of potential.			"

								Planets?  Well, the planets are really bugged, in my opinion.  You can't build a vehicle and drive it without it flying or bouncing up into the air.  Atmosphere ships tend to crash more than anything.  There is no air resistance designed in, so traditional winged craft is out of the question.  You either have thrust, powerful enough to raise the mass of your ship, or you nose dive into the surface.  EDIT: Removed speed comment, as I was in the wrong.  - Thanks for replies.They have added so much, but everything comes with bugs, they don't test much and they tend to ruin things that previously worked ok.There are a lot of fan boys who when you ask a question on the game forums or demand answers in exchange for having spent your money on their product tend to just spout hatered at you for daring to question their Lord Keen.It is my belief that planets in this game were the first test of Medievil Engineers, was a flop, so they started over and rather than abandon their work, put it into this game instead.  It is my belief that they hope to skim off a few more sales of this before they completely abandon it.Patches seem to come once per week, but usually are pretty small with not a lot of anything fixed.  They typically are some very small patch that sometimes has to do with nothing else but to be a distraction.Because of the way they release patches and the way they do things now, it is rare that you can continue with a map into a new large patch.  You usually have to restart a map from scratch.  If you like survival, like me, that really isn't anything to get too excited about.  It is very difficult to get going from nothing.  The bugs then make is very frustrating to do a lot of things.  A lot of people like creative mode, but that is just building things at random until you get bored of putting blocks together.  Not worth it if that is what you want to do at all, in my opinion.They opened the code to a source code so anyone can manipulate it.  My guess is that is so that people can fix the bugs and add it as a mod, which is what has been happening.  - Isn't this what the company is supposed to do?  Maybe those people who create mods to fix the bugs should be getting paid for making the game playable.I'll get flamed for this review, but I don't care.  I bought this game for myself and a friend of mine a few years ago, and it was once great to play.  Now, though, it is littered with bugs and seems to only be getting worse with anything they add.

								I bought this game when it was in a very young alpha state.  And I hated it.  My first instinct was to get my money back, I hated it that much.  And I don't return games.  It was buggy and frankly just boring as♥♥♥♥♥♥  But I waited.  I kept tabs on it while I played other games and (this might be a shock to some) lived a life outside of Steam.  Today I decided to give it another go after seeing it was now in Beta and read some fairly encouraging reviews.  I have to say, this is a very fun game now.  I'm only two hours in as of this writing, but I can see myself pouring a lot of time into it while my 3D prints chug away on the desk next to me.  As a space advocate and a lover of all things sci-fi, I give this game two thumbs up and look forward to spending hours I'll never get back in a world that doesn't exist.  As every good game should encourage us to do.			"

								Here we are. I've played this game a lot and finally decided to write my review.Let me start with good things. PROS:- I love the idea. Really I do love it. - Modding community.  Hundreds of mods, thatever you like you will probably find already implemented in workshop.- Since I am a patriotic guy, for me Pro is also this game is being developed in my country - Singleplayer is acceptable in terms of stability, despite of some graphical glitches. And some bugs. But you can save-load. HMm.CONS:- Enemy AI, NPC enemies. They are just dull. Disable them, as they are just screwing up the immersion- Multiplayer  If I say that stability in singleplayer is quite acceptable, multiplayer is everything but that. It's not only unstable, it's  constantly non-functional. Client-Server is most of the time out-of-sync: ignorant handling of inventory content, invisible ships, Object displayed somewhere else they actually are.  Exploding basic objects, out of the blue, e.g pistons.  This piston bug is there for a year. Hey, got it? ... Twelve. F**king.  Months!!! For all holy snakes!!- Multiplayer sucks- MULTIPLAYER- did I mention multiplayer already? There used to be so big potential in this game. It could have been a gem in space survivals genre. But it is not.KEEN had awesome idea, made a lot of money from  EA purchases, but they are failing to implement the idea. Maybe some day, but not at present.EDIT: currently Keens are trying to do something with their reputation and fix multiplayer. That is good. There is still so much of potential in this game.Also, I've removed/reworded most thrashing parts at the end of the review.12/2016EDIT2: massive update is just being downloaded for space engineers. Its description promises new netcode, and Marek Rosa's blog is announcing focus on great MP experience.I wish it was what it says. If so, I wouldn't hesitate to rewrite my review and to give thumbs up, if it's worth it!03/2017EDIT3: Well. Here we are. Couple of months passed  since my last comment. This game is still buggy. It still implements lots of featured glitches for you. But! There is light at the end of the tunnel! We tried to play MP with guys. It's almost playable! Maybe someone paid an attention and listened out our loud cry.SE Devs. Please. You are almost there. You made some progress, congrats! You have still issue with pistons, flying away grids, etc. However it seems bugs manifest in lower frequency, and sometimes there are workarounds. So, keep going. I will be more than happy to change verdict. Really.			"

								Buyer beware!After 2 years in Early Access, SpaceEngineers is still a buggy and totally unoptimized game. That it's implemented in C# .Net by some amatuers who clearly haven't got a clue how to build and maintain a project such as this clearly doesn't help - just look at the source code at GitHub, if you don't believe me. Nothing short of a total rewrite of this mess will take this ""game"" out of Early Access.I'm just glad that Keen Software House isn't constructing buildings and bridges. Ask them to build a skyscraper and they would probably start by building a wooden shed as the foundation and then try to add stuff hoping to end up with a skyscraper.			"

								This is a review from some one with over 3,091+ hours in game (as of May 27,2016).Things you need to know,- This game is still under development, (aka it has bugs)- This game is updated every Thursday and any new bugs usually get hot patched Friday- Bugs from time to time will make the game unplayable (for a day or two at most)- Multiplayer is available  it has its fair share of problems, most of which are being fixed with each new patch. But patches do break it from time to time so be aware of that when getting in to multiplayer. But for the most part multiplayer is coming nicely, and I only really have issues when playing with  20+ people. But new netcode is in the works, so hopefully this will only be a temporary issue.If you have played Minecraft, you will enjoy Space Engineers. This game has come a long way in the last 2 years. If you want to see how far this game is come, just go to YouTube and watch the weekly update videos, and you can watch this game transform before your eyes. In Space Engineers, you can do pretty much anything. The only limiting factor is what you, yourself can come up with. You start out form humble beginnings, with noting more than a respawn ship, and have to gather resources, to build new ships and stations, and to keep your medical bay operation, so you can stay alive. You will run in to pirates, military ship, and if you engage in multiplayer other players.Me personally I've been pretty involved in the PvP aspect of the game. Its fun (and good practice) to take out Pirates and NPC cargo and Military vessels. In recent patches Pirates and NPC ships are a lot riskier to attack so its really a challenge to face an enemy now that can no call for help. And when help arrives it will attempt to mercilessly hunt you down with total disregard for its own safety. Plan you attacks carefully or you will be overwhelmed and destroyed. But the real challenge (at least for me) is the human player. Hunting them down, finding their bases and ships and attempting to wipe them out before they wipe you out. PvP in this game can at times drive you mad, as I said above multiplayer is still a tad bit unstable, and every new patch makes multiplayer a bumpy road, but the Devs are working on new Netcode and are slowly, seeing improvements to multiplayer stability. Recently things have been improving at a steady pace, we gotten several huge improvements to multiplayer (saving ship tool bars, server side character and ship tracking, etc.,,) but we are still waiting on netcode, but it will come.If you give this game a chance and are willing to stick with it, even when it drives you mad at times, you will get hours of enjoyment from this game (did I mention I have 3,091+ hours?).

								This game is awesome, I love it, pure and simple.But when you love something, you also, at times, hate it, and I hate this game.There are so many things, that could put this game on par, with a game like Minecraft.But nothing seems to improve, some weeks it plays, others it lags or crashes after a few minuts playing.And so I wait till next week, for yet another try.I urge the developers to look at their game, look at it, NOW!Then ask yourself how the following makes you feel...""Engineers like to solve problems. If there are no problems handily available, they will create their own problems."" - Scott Adams""Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety nine percent perspiration."" - Thomas Edison""I have offended God and mankind because my work did not reach the quality it should have."" - Leonardo da Vinci""Failure is not an option."" - Gene KranzThis is why I am here, writing this review, I'm here because of science, I'm here because of love.The love and science of Space Engineers.I bid you farewell, and godspeed, ending with these last words.""I love you, even when you break my heart, I will still love you"" - DIEDIEDIE""An object in Motion will not change its velocity unless an external force acts upon it."" - Sir Isaac NewtonPlanets > Cyberdogs			"

								The new update has made things harder to find as far as building blocks go.  I cannot find easily angled building blocks.  Also I have to get closer to build things now,  Without the command to build a ship or station it seems everthing in building  has to be done much closer which takes alot more time and effort.  Instead of bringing new things to the game, the layout continually changes which I feel doesnt have to change.  I really think updates should bring more content to the base game rather than changing things that dont need to change.  Right now the game is unplayable.			"
