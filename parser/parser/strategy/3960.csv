												Here is a guide for getting Shattered Union to work on WIndows Vista/7/8 etc.http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=230301http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=230085Sorry about that... for some reason I was convinced there was a link to more details in that post. My mistake. Here's how you do it:1. In your Start Menu search field, type in ""msconfig"", without the "" "" of course.2. Click on the Boot tab.3. Click on the Advance Options button.4. Check the little box next to ""Maximum memory"" and set the max to 2048.5. Reboot computer.Now when it reboots, Windows will act and run as if there is only 2GB of memory installed. This will allow Shattered Union to run. After you're done playing, go back to msconfig and uncheck the Maximum Memory box and then reboot, to allow Windows full use of all your RAM.Again, sorry for the lack of detail earlier. I really do need to stop posting after I get home from work, but before I've had dinner...			"

												As was said the game will not run on modern systems that use Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8. I'm using Windows 7  and get nothing but a black screen and then the game crashes.Read the small print of the system requirements which they have conveniently changed since I bought the game, it used to read XP, Vista and Windows 7.I also think older XP systems that have more then 2GB of memory/RAM may have problems running the game as well. If so there is a workaround where you go into MSconfig and set your system to only use 2GB of memory. Search google for the exact method. Be sure to turn it back though after playing the game as your computer performance will suffer with only using the 2GB of memory.Luckily I bought this game on sale for like $2 so not much lost but be forwarned everyone else.

If Steam isn't going to patch the product, then they shouldn't sell it.  The ""fix"" that was posted does not work for everyone, and is not a ""fix"" but a workaround.

												Pretty annoying this game will not run on a very significant percentage of the machines used by the Steam customer base.  I agree with many others that there should be a BIG warning on the game's store page it will not run on systems with more than 2GB of RAM.  Not having such a warning causes a lot of bitterness.			"

												Do you like hexagonal wargames? This one isn't really breaking any molds or moving the genre forward, but it's rock solid. Shattered Union has a very niche market and never really sold well for the original Xbox, but interest in the Steam sale may have prompted a brief revival. In all fairness, that's probably a good thing.Shattered Union is an entry-level strategy game that just about anyone can pick up. It's probably not a game most people would put a lot of time into, but it's at the very least worth owning.			"

												A basic and simple game that appeals to the tactful minded. The main strategy is to keep your units protected from airstrikes while keeping them out of range of groundforces until you decide to attack. With multiple ways to win a mission this game has decent replay value and may appeal to the die hard tactician as well as the casual gamer.			"

												To those saying it won't work - there is a simple workaround, easy to find with a quick search.Now, this isn't a great game. It's an ok game. But, for 5 bucks, Shattered Union is well worth it. Fight a modern day civil war across a fully destructable US as one of 7 factions, like the Midwest, California, and even the EU. The AI each has different personalities per game, which affects how it will fight.  Each map focuses on a small region of the US, with accurate towns/geography.  Your actions on the battlefield affect your reputation - preserve landmarks and buildings and you gain precision abilties; destroy everything in your path to victory and gain powerful destructive weapons.All in all, it's a fun, old, tactical turn-based military game.

												Game crashes when loading certain maps. The game was made for the Original Xbox, it seems nothing has changes since then. It does not work on computer running Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8. Look at the forums and reviews and you will see what I mean. If you do get it running, you can expect a simple but fun turn based strategy game. Fighting other states and their armies. Reuniting the nation by force, state by state. Taking cities, destroying land marks, bridges, and factores to gain the upperhand. Dispite being a competent and fun strategy game, I have to say pass on this game since it seems most users can't get it working or working properly.			"

												Doesn't work anymore. Steam should up its quality control, as the game is unplayable on any modern Microsoft OS (7,8, 10). Yes, i am aware the community found a fix, but this didn't work for me - and some others as well, and've damn tried to fix it - and i'm not particularly sloppy with these kinds of things. It simply doesn't work.I used to play this game a few years back, which was an enjoyable - though unoriginal - TBS. Could've recommended it back then, but considering the circumstances, steer clear of this game.			"

												For people who like the older turn based hexoganal strategy games, (Panzer General comes to mind) this game is for you. The graphics arent all that but who cares! Its got all the military units of the U.S. along with its sound effects. Although futuristic, its still an enjoyable strategy. Its a slow paced games where you have to really think out tactically your moves. Since money is sparse you really have to be careful on losing your expensive units. Yes I cheated a bit and simply re-loaded the game when I would lose an expensive unit. But all in all, this game is awesome for your average day armchair general.			"

												First time I played this game was on the XBOX 360, when I saw all the negative reviews I held back on buying it again. Well the price droped enough to make the risk worth it, and it has worked just fine on my Win10 OS. It is a great game that requires tactics to win, the graphics are better then the XBOX360 and it seems to have all the features I remember. Finding a manual is as easy as finding google maps...you just have to hit a few keys and you have it.			"

												Disappointing. I expected an RTS. Turns out it's a tactical wargame. Turn-based, hex grid and everything. Guess I didn't read the description very closely in my haste to spend 49 cents during a Steam sale. Thumbs up for a creative storyline, but I don't have the patience to play this.Also - be forewarned that it takes some system tweaking to make this run in Vista or 7. You can find that information in the Steam Forums. It's not difficult.			"

												I saw great potential with story and idea.  As one of the few turn based games I was hopeful.  It falls short, however.  The handoff between the strategic level and the tactical level has too many holes.  Also and I hate this common dodge but it does seem handicapped to the AI.  Perhaps with more digging in and such I could find the game worthwhile but it couldn't keep my interest enough for the effort.			"

It was fun but was a little simple and weird in its management sections. It was fun but HARD AS HELL because the AI knows where you are at and you are just praying that you set up your men right for the hordes of troops that will be attacking. When I bought it on Steam I found out that it no longer works on modern computers anymore. This game was fun but not worth the effort of hacking to get it to work.I liked this game, I am going to Recommend it but be aware that it most likely wont work for you.			"

												Many games have tried to be like Shattered Union and all have fallen short of the mark.  While this could be far more than it is, no one has managed to do any better.Control US and Warsaw Pact units in a campaign to restore manifest destiny and re-unite the United States.  While the units themselves are more Panzer General than Steel Panthers, it is still very well done.Only major flaw is the need to reset your computer to run on only 2 Megs of memory using MS config before the game will work properly.  Runs just fine on Windows Vista, 7 and 8 once you apply the proper settingTwo thumbs up			"

												When getting this, I expected some sort of engaging top-down strategy gameplay with a somewhat fleshed out world. Instead I got a clunky menu, unbalanced maps, gameplay that is beyond stiff, an annoying camera, and the same old generic  CoD story about Russia being behind all this and regressing back to the Soviet days. The factions all feel the same and there really isn't much substance as far as engaging gameplay, just build more and bigger tanks than everyone else and try your hardest to steamroll people. Terrain really isn't a factor in most battles and a smaller, more agile army can almost never outwit a larger, high-firepower one, brute force is ALL that matters, very little real tactics. Kinda regretting my purchase.			"

Once your ""state"" grows too larger, than all the other ""states"" will begin to attack you constantly and there is really no true way to win.

												Bought the game on the basis of an interesting premise; turns out the strategy elements of this game are extremely shallow and the premise isn't developed into an interesting story either.  If you've played any turn based strategy games at all, there is nothing new here; it will remind you of a whole bunch of other games, but with all their distinctive features removed.  It's generic and simplistic.  If you want a lightweight strategy game with some actual gameplay, try Warlock: Master of the Arcane.  If you want a very strong (albeit real time) strategy game with an alternate-present feel to it, try the Wargame series (e.g. Red Dragon).			"
