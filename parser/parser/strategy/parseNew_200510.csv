												You know this game did something right when characters that have no backstories and barely even talk die and your first reaction is to feel deep pain. Not because of the gruesome death that a wild Chryssalid can make, not because of the large grenade explosions or the laser beams of a Sectopod, but because an XCom Operative, a squadmate, a friend, will not see the end of the war that got us all together.Feels/10			"

												I managed to make it to 2/3 of the way through this war without losing a single soldier. I was riding high, getting win after win and promoting my soldiers by the Skyranger load. We were cleaning the streets, cleaning house, cleaning Earth.And then it happened... It was supposed to be a standard op, man. It was supposed to be easy. That's what Xcom command said. ""Just a downed UFO"" they said, ""standard sweep and clear.""We were deployed in Western Canada. The target was a UFO a little larger than what we'd encountered before, but we were big boys and girls. We were ready... We engaged a couple of X-Rays outside the front of the downed ship. Nothing we couldn't handle, a couple of Mutons that Sophie 'Baroness' Mercier put down. We were all ready to send the MEC in when it happened. Kate... she was taking cover to the front, but her right side was exposed. A God damn Sectopod came out of nowhere, man. It just walked right in, man... Tore her apart...We beat the thing, we ""won"" the mission. We even saved mankind a few months later. But nothing was ever really the same after that day.God bless you, Kate 'Doc' O'Connell			"

												I have always been a big fan of the XCOM franchise since the very first game all those years ago and I have to say that XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a worthy 'reboot' of the series. The game is an odd mix of strategic base building/management and turn based tactical combat. You will research new weapons, armor and even technologies such as genetic engineering and mech warrior (half man, half machine ... although more like 5% man 95% machine). You will have to capture and interogate the aliens, perform autopsies, and try to understand why the Aliens are here, and how you can stop them.The visuals are great, although they are a little over the top. You can field warriors clad in pink with bright blue big hair, or you can choose dark comoflaged spec ops type soldiers. It is up to you and has no effect on the game other than to meet your own preferences. You can name you soldiers to make it more personal, and more dramatic when they die.All round this is a fun game, and with DLC such as the Enemy Within and mods such as Long War this game has a lot of replay value, and potentially could be something you sink hundreds of hours into.

												This review is totally superfluous. Don't bother reading it. Anything I can say has been said by others before me. Well, if you must read on:XCOM Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within is one of the very best games I have played. And replayed. And replayed. At the time of writing, I am replaying it now on Impossible difficulty, in fact.You will lose countries to panic. Your best friends will die horrible deaths over and over again (so don't name your soldiers after your friends, eh). Your interceptors will be shot down. Your base will be destroyed shortly after your last soldier falls. Dozens and dozens of civilians will be slaughtered by aliens or turned into zombies. Whales will hold nasty surprises....Yes, XCOM hits all the right buttons for an amazingly tension filled turn based adventure into the terror of an alien invasion. In the beginning you will be playing catch up, very badly and will wonder why cover is so useless. Just useless.And then, you figure it out. And the game becomes so addictive that you will be grumpy at work the next day. Your grades will suffer. Your spouse will commit adultery. The world will end due to alien attack. But you won't realise it because you just know there is some way to get to that next MELD cannister before it expires next turn.If you just move your assault trooper after your sniper has taken out that floater, and you have supressed the overwatch from that muton by blowing it up with a rocket from your heavy trooper, and the MEC has blown a hole in the wall with an alien grenade, but oh, hell, ""run and gun"" is on cool down, so your support soldier is gonna have to make the run instead of reloading.But can she cover the distance and activate the cannister? Who knows? The world ends. Stop reading. Just play.			"

												I could tell you about the many times I played through this game's campaign. About Enemy Within, and the chances it brought. About the mod Long War and how it turns this great game into an epic marathon. But you don't want to hear that. You want to know if this particular game is worth your money and your time. In short: It is. This is game about adaptation. About turning the weapons and technologies of the invaders against them, about choosing where to pool your limited resources, or where to send your troopers to fight, knowing some may not return.And boy, does it hurt when your beloved sniper, the one you've been watching over from the start, that guy that could always be counted to nail a crit at extreme distances. He has just died because you send your fire team ahead and he was left behind to offer support... until a flanking alien killed him in cold blood. That's X-COM. Those memorable moments that happen amidst the familiar landscapes. You'll also offer silent prayer to that unfortunate civilian that had to die so that you could hit that alien cluster arround him with a rocket.In terms of crunch, the tactical aspect is very solid. A large part of the battlefield can be brought down, and so can your cover, making each battle less about hunkering down and dealing and taken fire and more about manuevering. A flanking, agile soldier can become just as deadly as the one hunkered down behind a wall with the giant machine gun.A very enjoyable game, with engaging mechanics and a smart AI that makes for very emotional, un-scripted moments.

												X-COM: Enemy Unknown is high quality.It was a long time since i had a game with more than 50 hours of playing in a week.Since i never play the X-COM classics before, i'm not the one who gonna spit on that game because of some lack of fidelity from the original series, which seems to be what people was most criticizing about.Even the story is good, although is not the focus, and it's not so well explored. You'll have to manage resources, research alien materials, train and customize your soldiers, capture aliens alive to study them, build facilities, weapons, gadgets, robots, all kind of features to help you to deal with an unknown alien menace.The biggest part of this game is at turn-based strategy battles, with a third person point of view on shooting enemies or doing another actions.I got some minor bugs, mostly concerned the camera movement, which can be very annoying some times, but nothing truly deal breaker.

												Review includes the add-on ""Enemy Within"".The remake of one of the golden oldies of the strategy genre. Naturally this made it quite difficult to satisfy the fans of the original as well as to attract new players in equal parts.What Firaxis did well, was the graphical style and presentation, XCOM offers the style of the first UFO games, while bringing it in the new era. Nothing extraordinaire for sure, but fitting graphics with the one or other really nice possibility to take a screenshot or enjoy the headshot with which your sniper eliminates this pesky alien.Regarding the gameplay they tried to keep the balance between streamlining and complexity. The maps are handmade, offering some nice details and mostly destroyable enviroment, but since the random element is gone, they keep on repeating themselves after some playtime.The same can be said for the progression of the game itself.. your soldiers are basically divided into classes, which have fixed perk trees to choose from on level up. Without the added options of ""Second wave"" and the additional possibilities from ""Enemy within"" to enhance your soldiers with mech or gene modifications, this brings up a similiar problem to the maps, the soldiers are very similiar to each other. As mentioned the add-on options change this in a positive way, beside the modifications you can for example enable that each soldier has different starting stats.Still this does not reach the complexity of the original X-Com soldiers, but helps the diversity significally. As for the base management and battles themselves.. once again it is the mix of old and new. The Action points of the old soldiers are gone, now each soldier has two actions per turn (with the right perks, it can be way more though) one for moving, the other for shooting. Again perks as well as equipment can change the possibilities of a soldiers actions.This system together with an intelligent cover system works quite well and makes for interesting battles.The base has fixed fields, which you have to fill during the game. Also with the add-on the possibility of the enemy invading your base returns, though as a scripted event.What gripes i have with the game is, that for example it forces you to go a certain way in science and engineering, besides the story elements themselves. If you don´t rush satellites for most of the states you have a hard time to survive. Same with the interceptors. A bit more freedom and variety would be helpful, especially for a game with such a possible long time motivation. ""Enemy within"" helps in this respect, but cannot eliminate the weaknesses in full.Nevertheless they did quite a good job, bringing the alien hunt to the modern age.So if you like strategy, grab this one :)			"

												This is for EU and Enemy Within. This game is not for the light hearted. You will lose. You will fail miserably. You will have a lot of fun. This Sisyphean experience starts off easy enough. Couple of greys, a world moderately in danger. Then the panic strikes, then the world starts asking more of XCOM, then somewhere along the lines you lose 3 men in a Muton ambush, or a squad wipes on a crucial civilian extraction. Then there's the once in a lifetime chance shotgun blast across the map that kills the Sectopod, the single Archangel sniper spitting death from on high like some blessed avenger with a plasma lance cutting a swath through the heathen hordes of aliens. ""That's XCOM, baby"" is the common phrase other players will use. The emotional rollercoaster you ride through this game is a unique experience, should you buy into it. (The canned ending, personally, is the worst, but your personal experience each playthrough is unique and randomly generated. Your mileage may vary)The turn based gameplay is one of the best and worst parts of the game. There's a lot of unskippable cutscenes and dealing with the ""aggro"" animation when you run into a mob(s) is rather annoying. On the flip side, the tactical control is intuitive and you'll find yourself slowly starting to game the game (lol) and thinking imaginatively. XCOM wants you to do this, I think. Its designed to be unrelenting but it has chinks in its armor. On the 'backside', building your fortress of badassery is either a mundane task or a nailbiting terror fest. Every click could spell disaster for your budget or you may find yourself spamming ""scan for threats"" for ages at a time. It plays with you, which is only fair since you play with it. EW expands greatly on EU's strengths. There's a few setpiece missions that do intend to wipe your team, raising the stakes and discouraging spamming a single A team for every mission. The new Mechs and other units will test your Commanding skills and livened up the ""meta"", diversifying how you respond to missions and consquences. Rocket punching (a la Pacific Rim or Big O) a berzerker is one of the best video game moments I've ever had. The EXALT half of the game is interesting, but a distraction at best (you can clear these segments rather early in a playthrough) and the extent of their treachery wasn't really felt. The story of the ""furies"" is a pretty forgettable story itself, but the boost to your psi units is worth the risk. All in all, the idea that each playthrough will have its different moments outside of the canned story is a pretty cool and integral part to the XCOM experience. While new ""second wave"" options will spice up that even further, it could use a sandbox mode or a 'infinte wave' mode as you can stumble through the game or carefully plan every step and still get to a weird, grindy moment in playthroughs. I'd definitely try ironman mode for later playthroughs or things like ""training roulette"" to let the RNG throw everything its got at you.Good luck, and happy hunting, Commander. "

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is incredibly fun. I love turn based games and this takes strategy to the fullest. In this game it is man vs. alien and we are fighting back to remove the aliens. You control a squad of soldiers that you move and tell them who to attack, defend, or to do overwatch to attack moving enemies. There are four types of soldiers you can get randomly when they level up and each will gain rank and you choose from 1 or 2 abilities when they do. If your soldiers die you have a chance to save them by healing them before they die but if they die they are gone forever. You also have the build up your forces by researching technology and spending resources to buy new technologies, weapons, and buildings.This is a highly addictive game which can be pretty difficult if you don't cheat (save often and reload over and over again to get the best results). An interesting thing about XCom is it saves its random number generator so that means if you load a game and do the same actions over again you will get the same results but if you do things in a different order you can get different results (the chances to hit will be the same but if one soldier is more likely to hit, he might hit an enemy when another would miss).The only thing I didn't like about this game is it seems to be very short to finish one playthrough but you could always play again with a higher difficulty or it also comes with Second Wave which lets you chance certain settings in the game. I would highly recommend if you like turn based strategy games.			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is the crown jewel of modern designed turn based tactical games.Here you will not find a true sequel to X-COM, but you will find a good game nonetheless, even if it's in a totally different league. This is more like an evolution of a Final Fantasy Tactics, rather than UFO.The tactical gameplay and the strategic layer are interlinked and form a choesive whole. The more mission you win, the more goods you will bring home and use to beef up your squad, until you win against the alien menace. The Enemy Within Expansion adds more stuff and goodies to research and to spend your resources on, making for a more varied gameplay and providing the player with more choices to make, both in the strategic layer and in the tactical layer. The permadeath that permeates the whole experience, makes this a game that punish you for bad decisions, from start to finish. It's higly reccomended to play this in 'Iron Man' mode, which is a mode where manual saving is not possible and the game autosaves after each action, increasing a lot the tension.The game also offers nice replayability options, thanks to possible different squad layouts, a big numebr of maps and the 'second wave options', modifiers that change the behaviour of many of the game mechanics, avalaible for a second, third and more runs.The game suffers from an inverse difficulty curve, where the lategame is much easier than your early game, and the Enemy Within expansion makes this worse. The descreased difficulty and teh lack of major events make the late game a bit of a slog. I suggest playing EW on a higher difficulty than your average EU playthrough to compensate. The game also has some bugs here and there, even if in EW and with the latest patch, their number should be reduced.All things being said, this game is a must buy for gamers looking for a bit of turn based combat, which is so rare to find nowdays.

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE 1: This review will include an XCOM: Enemy Within expansion review.NOTE 2:I'm reposting some of my old reviews because I adopted an easier to read format (and because for some reason I can't edit my old reviews)INTRODUCTION:XCOM: Enemy Unknown is an isometric turn-based strategy game and a remake, or rather, reimagining of the classic UFO and X-COM games.  The 2012 version aims to bring back the turn-based genre into the mainstream market by introducing the series to modern day graphics, mechanics, and a streamlined and revamped gameplay but still maintaining its tactical stratigic depth.The player assumes the role of the XCOM Commander who is tasked to lead an elite team of soldiers, scientists and engineers from all across the globe in an effort to thwart a massive alien invasion.  You are Earth's first and last line of defense.PROS:XCOM: Enemy Unknown (BASE GAME)+ High Replayability with multiple interchanging missions.+ Very challenging difficulty.+ Streamlined Gameplay Mechanic: This remake of the series streamlined the gameplay in a way that it is easier to learn but very difficult to master.+ Good voice acting and cut scenes.+ Tense and action-packed gameplay.+ Customization options for your base, air force and soldiers.+ Good enemy variety which forces players to adapt.+ Well Optimized for the PC.XCOM: Enemy Within (EXPANSION)+ New 'Mechtrooper' Class is fun to play and a great addition to the roster of soldiers.+ New 'Meld' resource forces players on a more aggressive and fast-paced play style.+ New 'Soldier Augmentations' using the Meld substance will provide soldiers with alien-like abilities which is fun to use.+ Localized Voices: The expansion now gives the option to use the localized version of the game and make their soldiers speak in their native tongue (not all countries though).+ New missions such as Infiltration with Extraction Missions and Base Defense.+ XCOM: Long War Mod is available and easy to install to give the game a fresh new life.CONS:- Bugs: Updated, patched plus an expansion, but still having some of the day one bugs lingering around.- Graphic and Camera glitches.- No Co-op challenges or missions.- Not enough special missions.- Interceptor Jets have limited upgrades and customization (can't even change the name of the pilot).- Late game is a bit too easy and may become boring when everyone in your team is fully upgraded.- No mid-battle or mid-mission inventory change.- Some maps repeat if your campaign drags on too long (ex. If you enable the Second Wave 'Marathon' Option).CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  X-COM: Enemy Unknown / Within, is an excellent remake with a revamped game mechanic that is easy to learn yet hard to master.  It has updated graphics and visuals that bring the world alive.  The combat is tense and action-packed that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Plus, it has lots of missions that have good variety which provides a very challenging difficulty.  And above all, it provides a very fun experience for both fans of the series and new players alike. Well worth its full price. I never had the pleasure of playing the original X-COM games and I know that some of the hardcore fans might have been put off by the streamlining of the series.  As for me however, the 2012 remake is a game that delivered one of my best experience on any turn-based strategy game in a long time.If you're looking for the Classic X-COM experience, check out Xenonauts: "

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: XCOM: Enemy Unknown Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Turn-Based Strategy; RPG; Tactical Strategy; Gridiron-Battles  My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 25-50 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWXCOM: Enemy Unknown is a reimagining and modernization of the XCOM franchise that manifests as a truly great and entertaining game.  The combination of the turn-based tactical strategy during combat, the simulation/management meta-game, and the basic RPG elements produces a total package that should appeal to enthusiasts of several genres.  And rounding out the wide-ranging gameplay is a well-designed atmosphere and a decent narrative with good pacing.  It all adds up to a great all around experience that should pique the interest of large percentage of gamers.Put simply, this is a masterfully crafted game.  It has many elements of many styles of games, which sometimes can result in a sloppy mess, but luckily the developers of XCOM: Enemy Unknown did a great job finding the perfect mosaic of the concepts.  The battles are strategic, challenging, and have just the right amount of luck based influence. Also, various difficulty levels and anti-“savescumming” options allow you to tweak the game to your challenge preference. The meta-game aspects between battles are engaging and addictive, consistently pushing you towards something new and making it impossible to stop playing sometimes. And the flow of the narrative and gameplay layout allows for an extensively branching path through the campaign.  Every playthrough is a unique.The graphics aren’t the most visually stunning, but they are definitely pretty damn good and they paint a vivid picture.  And the overall atmosphere is very engaging and well-designed.  The eerie effects and soundscape produce a creepy and mysterious ambiance that is quite fitting to the theme of the game. For a game that focuses primarily on gameplay, the presentation is pleasantly high-quality.And the narrative, while concise and shallow, is also pretty well implemented.  There isn’t a huge story-arc or any empathy invoking writing, but the plot is intriguing and offers amazing pacing that really helps to keep the game flowing and considerably contributes to its addictiveness.Auxiliary to the campaign, there is also a multiplayer mode.  It’s basically a dumbed-down version of the combat from the campaign.  I played a few rounds against friends and it was moderately amusing, but nothing outstanding.  It’s certainly possible you may find hours of enjoyment from the multiplayer; nevertheless, you can feel free to ignore it because the campaign is definitely the focus of the game.There is also a rather large DLC, XCOM: Enemy Within, that is reminiscent of the old-school expansion packs from the days of gaming yore. It basically expands upon all aspects of the game: deepening the narrative; adding new characters, weapons, tech and abilities; adding new level layouts and enemies; and also adding content to the multiplayer mode.  In my opinion, it is worth picking up as it greatly increases the total content. If you are interested, you should just go for the “Complete Pack”, which also includes the other, smaller DLCs.And so, while XCOM: Enemy Unknown isn't really that innovative, it somehow feels very fresh and unique.  There are many games out there that produce a similar experience, but not many do so at a level of quality this does.  With a wide range of genres influencing the style, this game should appeal to many gamers. If any of the aspects sound interesting, you should definitely check it out.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Alphabetically one of the last games on my backlog, I thought I'd never get around to this.This game tells the tragic tale of an Argentenian man who watched his friends die in the tutorial mission, went on to obtain over 100 confirmed alien kills, developed psychic powers, and died in a ship as it flew into space and collapsed in on itself like a neutron star.It's all written from the point of view of a psychic Irish man with a sniper rifle--the only one to survive the final mission and tell the tale.

												As soon as I played XCOM: Enemy Unknown for the first time, it quickly became my personal SOTY (surprise of the year). You play as the XCOM commander and an enormous weight sits in your shoulders since no decision is easy when you are at war.  Decisions will be made right from the very first time you play the game weather on choosing some locations above others, depending on what advantages each brings to the table as well what technologies you want to focus first. Strategy is key in both combat and the XCOM facility. It’s not about simply erasing any possible threat but also trying to capture some species for further analysis and study as well to bring more researches that can improve your armory and fleet giving you a better chance at surviving. It is also wise to build a squad in different ways, using different skills in the battle so you can be ready for the most scenarios the game will throw at you. If you let immerse yourself during the brief introduction to the Story you will get a sense of constant panic and terror due to the global alien invasion showing no mercy killing everyone, civilians and soldiers. While the strength of XCOM is the pure strategy gameplay there will be plenty of time for you to get a raw sense of fear, as well for most of your untrained soldiers since panic will also be part of the battle and will influence their behavior during critical times. Paying and attention and playing the Tutorial will be very useful in the game but later on you will learn from your own trial & error experiences. While some strategies can work based on some luck, other will require for you to grab every single chance and make every single bullet/turn counts. Difficulty can be a bit harsh if you are not used to genre but believe me, it’s worth learning the basic stuff. I would say that Easy difficulty felt like Normal and Normal sometimes felt like Hard (and so on). If you are a truly adventurer and fearless commander, higher difficulties will put your patience, skills and strategy to the test during every single turn.The soundtrack is minimal since it’s not a big focus on this game but I felt quite excited each time I was in my paramilitary facility and I became aware of a new threat. The music right when you choose which member will fill your squad to fight in battle give you a decent sentiment of anxiety making you eager to find the next battle location, type of terrain, possibility of new threats and so on.In the end, XCOM: Enemy Unknown proved to be a time sink, but a good one, there’s no doubt. There is plenty of options for you to make the game adjustable according to your difficulty preferences and there’s a decent amount of content while pushing for new technologies, new weapons, new armor and suits and new ways to fight the enemy. Make your choices wisely, time is short, resources are limited and remember, you can’t save everyone so expect losses in the battlefield without forgetting to extract wisdom from each battle, won or lost.

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a turn-based tactics developed by Firaxis and Published by 2K Games. A great games this is.XCOM: Enemy Unknown is about an alien invasion, well not really a full scale invasion, not yet, but it's an invasion. You are XCOM, an organization that responsible for any threat regarding to allien or anything that comes from outer space. It's quite addictive like Civilization games.XCOM: Enemy Unknown gameplay is so addictive, build up your base, train and promote your soldiers, research technology based on captured allien tech on the field, build interceptors to take down incoming UFO's, stopping alien assault and abduction of humans, assault alien UFO crash site, it never stops. Soldiers can be customized with armors, better rifles or shotguns, give them some laser weapons and they look like a Stormtroopers. There's also a time when your base will be attacked by the X-Rays, it's what they called the alien there since they don't really know what those aliens are, so many creatures. So much to do.XCOM: Enemy Unknown, for a strategy games, it has quite great graphics and effects, better detailed and all. Performance are perfectly great, no issues whatsoever.If only modding is officially supported, nevertheless I recommend XCOM: Enemy Unknown.Rating 9/10			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown sucks...... you in like few other games are capable of!I have never played the original so I'm not going to judge the game through some nostalgia colored glasses. XCOM: EU is a very tight, lean and challenging game. I commend Firaxis on an excellent difficulty selection where ""Easy"" really allows for a pretty casual game once you figured out the basics and where a multitude of options and modifiers (Second Wave) allow you to tighten the screw as much as you like.Combat is tense and tactical, easy to learn but challenging to master. The action cam makes some cool ""cutscenes"" out of your movements. And the occasional directional hint towards the nearest enemies helps reducing downtime on larger maps.If you are willing to accept a few simplification over a more exact and detailed simulation you'll be pleased by an elegant design, a great atmosphere and an awesome expansion once you had you fill of the basegame.

												Xcom Enemy Unknown is a great reboot to the Xcom franchise.It's your job to defend the planet from a massive alien invasion. The game does a great job conveying a strong sense of urgency along with a risk/reward system as you're often forced to make difficult decisions.The game offers tactical combat, and RPG elements. Your soldiers will level up and unlock new abilities while scientific research awards access to new weapons, armor, and gadgets.The game is great and definitely worth buying.

JUST TO CLEAR THINGS UPThis review is for XCOM ENEMY UNKNOWN (INCLUDING ALL DLC) ONLY.XCOM Enemy Unknown has an expansion pack called XCOM Enemy Within. I'm not going to include that in the review because I'm planning to write a separate review for it. This review will only be about the BASE GAME + ALL DLC.Also, I have not played the original XCOM games (shame on me, I know) so I won't be making any comparisons to those.TL;DRFor the people that don't like reading walls of texts.WHAT IT IS:A Tactical Turn-Based Strategy Game where you're the Commander of an organization formed by the Council of Nations called the XCOM. You are tasked with defending the planet from an alien invasion by sending your squad around the world in order to fight the aliens. GENERAL RECOMMENDATION:YES. I highly recommend this game.RECOMMENDED FOR: Those looking for a hardcore tactical turn-based strategy game. Make no mistake about it: XCOM EU, even on lower difficulties, is HARD. Those looking for a game that features aliens. Those looking for a game that would test their patience. In a good way. Those looking for a game with a ton of replayability. It's a great time sink!NOT RECOMMENDED FOR: Those looking for a casual experience. This game is anything but casual[i.imgur.com]. Those who don't like strategy games in general. Those who don't have a lot of patience. Those who hate RNG. Those looking for an active multiplayer community. There's barely anyone on when looking for a multiplayer match nowadays. THE REST OF THE REVIEWFor the people that actually like reading walls of texts.THAT'S XCOM, BABY!Tutorial mission. Four of your soldiers were sent in to investigate the first alien activity of the game. The game teaches the player with the basics on how to play the game. So far, so good. That is...until the game starts introducing combat.Your team gets ambushed by the aliens and your soldiers get picked off one by one. By the end of the mission, only one of your four soldiers is left alive.The tutorial mission teaches the player a lot of basic things such as moving, flanking, and shooting. But more importantly, it teaches the player that the game is not going to show any mercy even during a tutorial mission. That it's going to be brutal. That losing some soldiers in battle is required to win the war. And this sets the tone for the entire game.XCOM is brutal, but it is also fair. It's one of those games that is easy to get into but hard to master. And it's also one of those games that punishes the player even for the smallest of mistakes. The game can get very tense and gives the player a great sense of urgency. Thus, making each victory feel very rewarding.It's this difficulty that is actually one of the game's main selling points. And it fits perfectly for this type of game because after all, alien invasions are not something that humanity can easily prepare for.LOOKS GOOD EVEN ON LOWI can't talk much about the graphics because I play on a crappy laptop and I'm not really the type of person who plays games for the graphics. But all I can say is that the graphics look great even when putting all the settings to ""Low"". It also runs decently on low-end laptops (like the one that I'm using).YOU'LL KEEP COMING BACK FOR MOREThis game has a ton of replayability. Every playthrough could turn out to be different. There are four difficulties to choose from: Easy, Normal, Classic, and Impossible. There's a ""Second Wave"" option, which allows the player to start a game with different modifiers. And if that's not hard enough, you can try Ironman mode where the game automatically saves every move you make and you can't load any previous saves aside from the latest one.You can also customize a couple of things in-game such as the name of your soldiers, what their nationality is, how their armor would look like, among other things. Even though a single playthrough can last for over 20 hours (on lower difficulties), there's a ton of reason to keep playing again and again.GREAT SOUND BUT GETS REPETITIVE OVER TIMEThe music in the game is good especially during combat or when you're about to send your squad on a mission. It fits well into the setting of the game. Sadly, it does tend to be very repetitive especially after playing the game for hundreds of hours. This is understandable because music wasn't really a big focus of the game. It can also be easily remedied by just playing your own music in the background.BUGSThere are a couple of bugs in the game. Most of which are just bugs that affect the game visually. But there are bugs that can actually turn the tide of a battle. During my entire playthrough of the game, the bugs didn't bother me that much. And I guess I'm just lucky to not have encountered any game-breaking bugs during my Ironman playthrough.CAMERA ISSUESThe camera and manual targeting system are very wonky. This is especially true when trying to throw a grenade or blasting an enemy with a rocket. Sometimes, I end up throwing a grenade at my own soldier by accident thanks to the wonkiness of both the camera and manual targeting system combined.RANDOMNESSRNG. Random Number Generation. Some people love it, some people hate it. In XCOM EU, RNG determines how successful you are in hitting an enemy. A 99% chance to hit still has that 1% chance to miss and trust me, in XCOM EU, it CAN miss.I can understand how frustrating it can be but on the upside, it does add more tension into the game knowing that as long as your chance to hit is not 100% you're most likely going to miss.CONCLUSIONXCOM Enemy Unknown is a must-buy video game especially if you're into hard strategy games. Great gameplay and replayability combined will ensure that you'll keep coming back for more. It is in no way a perfect game, but it is still amazing nonetheless. It may not appeal to everyone, but if you're like me and this is your cup of tea, you'll love it.This is also the base game needed to play XCOM Enemy Within which makes an already great XCOM Enemy Unknown even better. But that is another review for another time.REVIEWER'S CREDIBILITYThis is only my second review ever on Steam but I feel like I've played enough of the game[i.imgur.com] to be able to write this review.

												(TL;DR I like the game so buy it.)This is the story of Jordan Walsch.Jordan Walsch signed on with XCOM to fight the alien menace. His best friends, Grace and Matt, tagged along. Each of them were promoted to Squaddie during their first missions, and they were given their combat roles. Jordan became an Assault trooper, Matt Support, and Grace Heavy.Matt gave his life to save Jordan in a botched mission. Grace spent weeks recovering from her wounds.Jordan was given the nickname ""Spitfire"" after his next mission. The loss of his friend turned him into a hardened killing machine. The commander recognized that, and Jordan began receiving promotions and being given experimental weapons and armor.Jordan picked up a few more friends on the battlefield. He swore not to let any more good men die. But it wasn't long before the aliens took another one of his companions. Beatriz, a Brazilian medic, was gunned down right in front of Jordan. He and Grace made the aliens pay with their lives.After that Jordan was the spearhead of every operation. The commander sent him on every mission. And Jordan never failed. His fellow soldiers relied on and supported his unorthodox brute force tactics.Eventually Jordan and his friends were promoted to the highest combat rank of XCOM: Colonel. They became a cohesive unit on the battlefield. The researchers made sure they were equipped with the most advanced tech available. Jordan was even hand picked by the commander for a special project. He was the only one in XCOM that completed the training.*Spoilers censored*When the time came to take the fight to the aliens, Jordan did not hesitate. He led his team to the enemy (spoiler). But in the end, the aliens' psionic powers turned half of the squad against itself. The cohesion was lost, and Jordan called for covering fire from the team sniper, Boone. Boone was a crackshot, perhaps a little too good. His bullet went straight through the (spoiler)'s skull, severing the link between it and the squad. Jordan's heart sank, however, when Grace slumped to the floor. The experience shattered her mind, killing her instantly. He called to the squad's medic, Miracle, but for nothing. Miracle had also died from the experience. Two more of his friends, dead in an instant. What if he could have disabled the alien, or somehow severed its link without harming his friends? He didn't know, and it didn't matter. As the rest of the squad began to evacuate, he turned toward the (spoiler). He knew what he had to do. Boone and Domingo were the only ones to make it home that day. They had won, but at what cost?Rest in peace, my friends.Mayara (Heavy)Matt (Support - Medic)Beatriz (Support -Medic)Benjamin (Rookie)Grace (Heavy)Miracle (Support - Medic)Jordan (Assault, Psionic Operative)All of these characters, along with a few others, were named after my friends. I cared about them, I panicked when they were in danger and I was heartbroken to see them killed. Leaving the bodies behind to evac the surviving soldiers when things went south was not easy. This was the one of the most emotional experiences I've ever had in a game (Note: I haven't played Spec Ops: The Line.) and I loved it. The fact that it didn't have to come from scripted events and cutscenes made it even better.I've only played through the game once at this point, but I certainly plan to run through it a few more times. This game is worth its current full price, but if you can catch it while it's on sale there is no reason to pass this up.10/10 would tell my rl friend that he died in my game again.			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a re-imagining of the classic X-COM: UFO Defense and as such has a similar setting. Aliens come out of nowhere and attack earth. The multinational organization X-COM has to battle the aliens, reverse engineer their technology to create equipment that is on par with that of the invaders and eventually defeat them. As the X-COM commander the player decides about the building of base facilities, instructs the scientists and engineers, is in charge of the deployment of soldiers and commands them in battle.XCOM: Enemy Unknown naturally takes much inspiration from the older X-COM games but also changes quite a bit. Some of those changes are actually good. Some are rather bad and some are just horrible.In this game you have one base and cannot construct additional ones like in the previous entries in the series. Also the squads have been downsized to four people at the beginning and six with upgrades. I actually like that because it counteracts the grindy nature of the game a little bit. Building one base to completion takes quite a lot of time anyway. Also while playing the original games I always took machines with me because they would take four squad slots thus reducing the number of soldiers I had to command. Spending the whole first turn with just moving a dozen people out of the landing craft was tedious. Also there are character classes now. Every class gets to choose from different abilities to learn as they level up. This adds depth to your squad selection, especially since squads are smaller now. The game also mixes up the grindyness with some missions that have special objectives not seen in previous entries. The developers also chose to have some non-interchangeable talking characters at your base. That actually adds a lot of personality to the game and I really like it. In my opinion XCOM: Enemy Unknown gets those changes right. However, there are changes that are more problematic.The previous X-COM games use an action point system. Moving, shooting, ducking, turning, switching out equipment all takes away from your soldier's action points. XCOM: Enemy Unknown however drops the action points. You just have two actions per turn. For example moving and then moving some more. Or moving and then shooting. This system would not be so bad if it was not flawed. Shooting ends the soldier's turn. Reloading also does. Because of that there is not benefit to standing and shooting as opposed to moving and shooting. Also, reloading and shooting in the same turn is not possible. Reaction shots to enemy movement in the earlier games where possible whenever the soldier ended his turn with enough unused action points. In this game however, you need to activate the ability ""Overwatch"" to have the chance of a reaction shot. Using this ability also ends your soldier's turn. Also whenever moving you have to decide beforehand where to move. You cannot move step by step to check if you got a line of sight to the enemy. If you have no line of sight at the end of your movement you cannot shoot. That is especially frustrating because unlike in the prequels it can be very hard to judge if you will have line of sight after moving to a certain position.Cover in this game does not act as physical barrier anymore, it's just a modifier on the attacker's hit roll. Yes, it gives a certain protection from enemy fire but everybody can be hit at all times given there is a line of sight to his cover. This doesn't work well with the games' rigged RNG rolls. Sometimes enemies will just one-hit your soldiers who are standing behind heavy cover from a great distance while your soldiers have problems hitting enemies that are five meters away from them in the open. In the original games you could stand so close to enemies that missing was virtually impossible because an actual projectile was going out on a 2D plane. Also, there is no collision detection for shots anymore. In the previous X-COM entries you had to be careful with your positioning because friendly fire could be a serious threat. Now you can only hit the target that you were aiming at in the first place. It is not possible to accidently hit a teammate or another enemy instead.XCOM: Enemy Unknown handles armor in a bad way. Armor does not reduce damage taken. It just adds more hit points. In the classic games energy armor would make a soldier nearly invincible against small weapons. In this game however a soldier in the heaviest armor can be worn down by sticks and stones given there are enough sticks and stones thrown at him.I think it is great that there are character classes now. The problem is that soldiers start without a character class. They get assigned one after their first promotion. This assigment is random though. That means if you need more soldiers of a certain class you have to constantly take rookies with you and hope that they survive, get their promotion and turn out to be the class that you have wanted in the first place.Some of the upgrades have the only point of battling bad design choices. You can for example upgrade your weapon technology to slowly reload automatically over time. Also, with the gene mods you can use in the expansion you can enhance your soldiers with hit point regeneration per turn and with an ability that makes them untargetable in cover given that the enemy did not see them at the beginning of your turn before moving into cover. You can also buy an upgrade to have your rookies already start with a character class. However it is still random. Those are sure nice upgrades but none of them would be necessary if reloading, cover, armor and classes would not have been handled that badly.Enemy movement: This is the aspect of the game the does not want me to recommend it. The game has many flaws but this one is just infuriating. Every time you spot a group of enemies they get a free turn of movement to get into cover, flank you or run towards you. This happens during your turn - in a turn-based strategy game. Also, most of the enemies appear in groups now and you always trigger the whole group of them. It often happens that you move all your soldiers without seeing any enemy and then you discover an alien squad with your last soldier, letting them get into optimal positions to fire at you in their upcoming turn. This doesn't work well together with enemy types that can one-hit kill rookies, converting them into bullet-sponge zombies afterwards. After you spot them they use their reaction movement to get closer and immediately close in for the kill in their turn.It happens really rarely that enemies move before you discover them. In most cases they are standing in place waiting to be triggered like land mines. Because of that melee combat is completely unviable now. In the classic games you could sneak up on enemies if they were not looking in your direction. Now they always now that you are there and start moving at once. Also, sometimes enemies will just drop from the sky - sometimes right next to you - making all planning and tactics kind of useless. The only other game in which I have seen such levels of lazyness in enemy placement and AI was Dragon Age 2.I still have my fair share of fun with the game and maybe you will too. But as it is I cannot recommend it since it is full of really weird design choices some of which are so blatantly bad I cannot even imagine what the developers were thinking. Sometimes it is really infuriating. The most frustrating thing is that the developers got so much right just to screw up royally in other departments.If there would be a re-release with a proper action point system and decent enemy movement and placement XCOM: Enemy Unknown could easily become one of my favourite games of all time despite its other flaws. As it is now it sadly cannot.More reviews here "

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is an isometric turn based tactical strategy where you are commanding a squad of four to six on missions against alien enemies. Its not just a tactical strategy, because between missions you'll be managing a secret base with easy menus. You'll get to buy equipment, assign what to research, add facilities to your base, hire new soldiers, manage the ones you have, get air power to combat UFOs, launch satellites and see how you're doing across the globe when it comes to ceasing alien panic. A failed mission isn't a game over. Without successful missions, panic will continue to rise in regions. Sometimes, you'll need to chose one of three regions to defend. Do you take on a mission in Nigeria and ignore Germany and China? On top of that, each mission has rewards they tell you up front. Japan gives $200, but Australia has a Lieutenant Sniper and Brazil offers 4 engineers. The choice is yours Commander. Each month, regions pay you based on your performance in that region. The only game over is losing most of Earth to alien forces.The gameplay for the turn based tactical strategy is simple, yet deep. Your usual squad consists of 4 - 6 members. Each of your troops have two turns. Once all of your troops have taken a turn, then the opposing side gets a chance.  In these turns, you can move a troop, attack an enemy, reload, defend your position, overwatch and use abilities. Some actions like overwatch and reload will end that troop's turn. Move troops to cover so they don't get murdered. There is half cover and full cover. Cover can be destroyed with grenades, rockets and gunfire. Attacking enemies is easy enough, the game tells you who you can attack, what your percentage is that you'll hit them, up to how much damage and a critical hit percentage. Gold icons mean the enemy is out of cover. Each enemy has energy that you can see above them unless you off set that in options. After three or four shots with your primary weapon you can either switch to a weak pistol or reload. Overwatch allows that troop to attack an enemy if they pop out of cover during the enemy's turn. So if you have a 20% chance to hit the enemy, best to overwatch for when they move during their turn.The abilities get based on classes and unlocked for each soldier as they rank up. When a troop has reached its first rank (squaddie), he or she earns one of four classes: sniper, heavy, support and assault. Other than abilities, it gears the soldier more toward certain weapons and tactics. Snipers use long range rifles, but need a pistol for short range. Heavies have the most powerful heavy weapons and rocket launchers, but cannot get critical hits. The rocket launcher, grenades and other things can be freely aimed so you can use them to destroy cover. Assault classes use shotguns, assault rifles and pistols. Support classes can use the same thing, but they move further on the battlefield.Its not just unlocking abilities, but for every rank you chose which of two abilities to unlock. So you can make every soldier different. I can't cover them all, but snipers unlock things like headshots that increase critical chance, a recon throwable to see more of the battlefield. Assault class has abilities such as run and gun to fire your weapon even after using two turns to run and flush that forces an enemy to run out of cover. It all adds so much variety and the choice is yours. You can customize all your troops down to their name, look, country and so on. You're not forced to micro manage them.Each unit can get equipped with armor and an extra item, such as various grenades, more armor, med kit, scope for better accuracy and an arc thrower to capture enemies alive for research. Your troops can be flat out killed in battle. Death is permanent. Sometimes you get lucky and the soldier isn't dead, but needs to get stabilized with a med kit or they'll die in three rounds. That doesn't mean they'll be back in the fight without an ability granting it. If you chose to abandon a mission, you need to get everyone back to the ship or they're lost forever. There is a memorial to show you all the lives lost.You are in command and beyond a mission or two that teaches you, you'll be on your own with no hand holding. The game does a good enough job explaining things so you can make informed decisions from equipment stats, to research and objectives on a mission. There is a lot of freedom in this game. You can micromanage as deep as you want.The game shines when it comes to the enemy variety and intelligence. When you first begin you face common sectoids that will laser at you, but the moment they seem insignificant, they can use metal powers to create shields around greater enemies. Thin men not only explode into poisonous gas, preventing you from killing them up close, but they also can shoot the poison to ensure they're always hurting your team. There are items to prevent poison, but its not worth it. The game amps it up to floating creatures and giant mechanized discs complete with drones that do little damage, but heal the robots. Later on, there are much stronger soldiers that intimidate, which can cause your own troops to become uncontrolled with fear if their will power stat isn't high enough. Other variations continue to charge at whomever shoots them. There are even enemies that will mind control your own troops into fighting for them. If that wasn't bad enough there are fast moving aliens that cause people to become difficult to kill zombies. The enemies will try to flank you and if you can't find any to kill your squad will hear them make noises in directions to bait you over to them.The maps are well put together. No matter if you're in a giant alien mothership or in the middle of the woods next to a book store. Everything is credible, both the grandiose and the mundane. The missions have compelling objectives that sometimes tell a story. Its more than just kill em all, its save people to prevent them from getting turned into zombies. Rescue a diplomat and get him back to your ship safe.Outside of combat, there is the day to day operations of your base. You can have your crew research weapons, do alien autopsies, sift through futuristic technologies in order to unlock new gear and weapons. The engineers will construct the weapons, ships, armor and equipment. Everything not only costs money but parts you find from missions. You can even build new facilities, things like laboratories grant you more scientists to research faster.  There are satellite relays to increase the satellite capacity you can have in orbit. All these things need power and there are a variety of generates to construct. You have a limited amount of space at your underground compound, so make good use of it. Putting two similar facilities next to each other gives them a bonus.With satellites operational, they'll detect UFOs and you send out continental aircraft to shoot them down. Each continent can have up to four jets and you can equip their armament. Not just that, but to make combat more engaging for you watching, there are items you can buy and use to help your jet win the fight. You can also break off from battle to keep your jet from getting obliterated if it gets too bad.All the research, satellites getting launched and facilities getting made isn't done in a day. That's where you wait. Day by day, you scan for activity. Sometimes there is a string of days with no contact. Other days there are UFOs, missions, crash landings and the council sends you on missions. It really sinks you into a world all its own. There are a few different personalities in your base. All with different perspectives. The head scientist prefers you capture aliens instead of killing them. The lead engineer could care less. The ring leader is your even keeled assistant, helping you, and keeping you on point. It all blends together to make a convincing game world where you save the entire planet one mission at a time.

												Intense. Satisfying. Frusterating. Rewarding. This is XCOM: Enemy Unknown. And you'll love it.Seriously though, developer Firaxis did an excellent job wih this game. Coming out of Civ V, this was a nice change of pace from waiting for your opponents to do something interesting (Civ V), to spliting your squad into two groups near the end of a mission, only to encounter an enemy that forces you to take a step back and regroup. One soldier may die, one may miss A LOT, and one may got shot in the face while running away. But you know what? That's the charm of this game. It requires that you change up your tactics on the spot, and use each solider's strength's to the enemy's weakness. Some enemies may be able to throw grenades, some may jump around the map, and some may be able to infect your guys into zombies (No, seriously). The maps themselves are all excellently hand-crafted, even if they pop up again from time to time. You'll also research new techs for your engineers to build, gaining new equipment, armour, and weapons. Sometimes a UFO will pop up, requiring you to scramble a jet to take it down. Other times you'll be required to choose which country to assist, raising the panic level of another. What happens if the panic level gets too high? Well, the country will revoke its support. Lose too many? You fail the game. Mission variety is also a thing in this game. You'll sometimes have to investigate alien abductions, clear out UFO crash sites, and repel terror attacks. My personal favourite is the UFO missions, but the others are just as fun. As for this games presentation, it's done wonderfully. The graphics may not be HOLY BALLS AMAZING, but they set a tone and art style that gives the game the atmosphere that hummanity is getting hammered down. The music ranges from cinematic fight music with a sci-fi flavour, all the way to creepy atmospheric trakcs. The story itself is very basic: The aliens are invading, and XCOM is formed to fight them off. The cutscenes definitely add a cinematic quality to this game that is masterfully done.Also, don't expect this game to be for the light-hearted. You WILL fail. Your soldiers WILL die. Countries WILL reach critical panic levels. But prevail through it, and you'll find your success. If I had to rate this game, I'd give it a 9.5/10. I forgot to mention that intercepting UFO's is extremly barebones, but either than that every other problem is extremly insignificant and shouldn't bring the game down at all. I should also mention that this game makes my laptop overheat, but that's more my fault than anything else. "

												Xcom is pretty tragic, I guess.You play as a commander for Xcom, an organization with a fatality in the thousands. Your duty is to stop dirty alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s from descending from that place where baby Jesus may or may not live, and killing everyone you've ever known and love. Don't worry, everyone you know and love will still die, only at a slower rate. With the world's leaders at your back, you recruit soldiers, engineers, and scientists from the greatest bunch of cowards planet earth can provide. After you set up your base, you begin researching, purchasing, and building, using satellites to watch the skies for the spooky aliens. When one of those grey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s finally decides to show it's big dumb stinky head, you shoot down it's stupid looking space craft and send your friends to die horrible, brutal deaths. Oh yeah, and you can customize the name's and appearances of all your Xcom operatives, so you get super attached to them right before a horrible spider creature disembowls the guy and lays eggs in his scrotum. I will never forget you Stinky Poo Poo Marine. But it only goes downhill from there when you realize that the crotch eggs turned your bff into a zombie which will then explode into a crotch alien that in turn can turn the rest of your squad into angry crotch aliens. I will never forget you, Stinky Poo Poo Squad. Combat with the little green men is handled turn based, and unlike it's predecessor games, you actually have a chance to bring someone home alive instead of drowning your enemies in corpses. You take turns moving your units around cover to take pot shots or flank the aliens in small scale squad combat. And while the enemy brings powers and weapons far beyond your own, you have your own advantages as well such as actually being able to aim or your soldier panicking and actually shooting at the enemy that made him panic. It's not all hopeless, though. In between the murders of your best friends and the pants wetting terror that your operatives endure, things slowly begin to go your way. The more aliens you wipe out, the more space stuff you pick up, the more space stuff you pick up the more stuff you can research. But the end of the game, after all the aliens have been sliced open and eaten, I mean researched, and all of the space guns have been carefully looked at. The operatives lucky enough not to get their skulls punched out the back of their heads gained enough new equipment and experience to go head to head with even the toughest alien. Sectoids become a nuisance at best, Muton's who were once like mini boss fights become the standard infantry you have to contend with, and all the big scary robots that the aliens used to have romantic evenings with your operatives sphincters are completely over come by being covered in a large angry blanket of plasma fire. It's quite the empowering experience to be the ones doing the alien♥♥♥♥♥♥pushing instead of the other way around. The expansion pack goes even further beyond, adding a human enemy faction that likes to take your lasers in the face the same way fat kids like to eat cake,  as well as giving you the opportunity to make both battle jedi and giant robot men that make you feel safe in their big strong arms. But should you play X-Com Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within? Yes, you should. While one can argue that it's nowhere near as expansive or in depth as the original series, it offers a newer and more accessible way to enter a fairly old and reveared series. It's a gateway drug into the older and more demanding games. Just don't go naming your soldiers after your high school crush if you don't want to see her murdered and eaten by crab spiders. I give DBomb: Adversary confused/ Combatant Inside, Seven old timey UFO movies out a possible four War of the World remakes.I saw the face of god and it was weeping.Oh yeah, the curator.http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curationWe're nearing 200 followers now and 100 members in the steam group.

""VIGILO CONFIDO YOU ALIEN FU**ERS-""-Cpt. Heavy McHeavyface, before launching a rocket at a Berserker.The rocket misses, killing a VIP plus the rest of his team near the evac point in the process.TL:DR:XCOM: Enemy Unknown is an intense game, almost nerve-wracking at times, but generally rewarding as you plan and fight your way through droves of alien invaders with a variety of classes, equipment and abilities. You might find yourself save-scumming (reloading saves for better results), but that happens to the best of us. The game will push you to take risks and deal with consequences, both in long-term strategy with base, crew and international management, and in short-term with tactical combat. While lacking in a few aspects such as a deeper plot, and leaves some optimization work to be desired, Enemy Unknown will get your tactical thinking at full throttle for a steady incursion of (sometimes brutal) enemy forces.Notice this review covers the base game content plus DLC and the Enemy Within expansion pack as one product.OverviewDeveloped by Firaxis and 2K Games, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is the first in a series of reimaginings of the classic strategy game X-COM: UFO Defense (also known as UFO: Enemy Unknown in some regions). Directed by Julian Gollop, the award-winning game gives the player the control of a secret elite military organization called XCOM: the Extraterrestrial Combat Unit. After the confirmation by XCOM that a series of freak incidents spread worldwide were the first few units from an alien invasion, the unit deploys with full force to learn, adapt, and fight against the alien menace. As the Commander of XCOM, the player must train their soldiers, expand their base, respond to alien activity, adapt and make the alien technology our own, and drive away the enemy invaders.PlotIn 2015, after the occurrence of several mysterious incidents of alien nature, the XCOM Project is activated by an international Council of Nations. Its objective: to study, reverse-engineer and neutralize any alien threats to humanity, led by a single officer only referred to as ""The Commander"", introduced into the operations center ""Geoscape"" by Central Officer John Bradford, the main co-coordinator of XCOM alongside The Commander. In XCOM HQ, The Commander meets Dr. Moira Vahlen; the science team lead of XCOM, and Dr. Raymond Shen; the Chief Engineer of the unit.The invasion starts out rather subtly, with minor localized incidents of alien activity mainly perpetrated by the archetypical alien ""grays"", dubbed Sectoids in the game. Over time, the continued resistance of human forces causes the aliens to take steps by deploying units containing several alien species and mechanized units with more aggressive, war-like behavior and role.If XCOM's prove successful, the integrants from the Council of Nations remain with their continued support to the project, with additional crew and funding as rewards. Should XCOM fail to provide the Council nations with proper defense against the alien threat, the panic among the populace rises beyond repair, all ties and support towards XCOM being cut by the nations leaving the project.Through the course of XCOM's operations, an alien-sympathizing shadow group referring to itself as EXALT emerges, publicly encouraging the nations to surrender to the aliens and hand over control to them in exchange for their technology and guidance. However, EXALT is in fact a militant armed group, actively disrupting XCOM operations throughout the globe. With the EXALT threat causing unease in the worldwide populace, XCOM is tasked with taking down its leaders.As the invasion progresses, XCOM discovers the leaders behind the attacks against Earth -- a mysterious alien species only known as ""The Ethereal Ones"". Being the heads of the invasion, it is first imagined they came with the intent of wiping out humanity or conquering Earth. However, their purposes towards humanity are revealed to be something else...GameplayThe combat aspects of the game are played in a tactical turn-based-strategy format over four difficulties and the option for an 'Ironman' mode (disables reloading past saves of a game; decisions are permanent), with players controlling their squads throughout the maps and positioning them in 'tiles', coordinating their instructions and attacks. Cover is paramount in the game, as exposed soldiers are guaranteed to take additional damage. Should a soldier's health ever fall to zero, the soldier can either be knocked unconscious into a 'bleedout' timer (to be possibly stabilized or revived during the mission, or evacuated with the surviving squad members if the mission is completed before the soldier bleeds out). If the soldier does not enter bleedout on health depletion or has the bleedout timer exhausted, they are permanently killed and removed from the roster. Attacks in XCOM: EU are made using percentage-based chance rolls based on the attacker's ""Aim"" stat, with an additional roll for critical hits with additional damage. The chance for a target to be hit is increased or lowered depending on conditions such as the presence of cover, the distance between the attacker and the target, the target's base defense value, their specific traits, relative height of position in comparison to the attacker, etc. Targets can receive increased damage depending on whether or not they are in cover, being flanked, or through special attacks and traits from soldiers and aliens alike.In some cases, missions are preceded by ""Interception"" segments. In this mode, XCOM launches their interceptor aircraft in order to shoot down enemy UFOs that are detected through satellite networks. If the interception is successful, this will prompt a mission for clearing the UFO crash site and potentially acquire new technology from the downed UFOs.At the Geoscape, the players can manage the base by constructing additional facilities for XCOM HQ, selling unnecessary supplies at the ""Gray Market"" for extra funds, managing XCOM's Interceptors, creating and equipping new weapons and equipment for their soldiers, customizing their squad members, scanning for alien activity and deploying missions.Soldiers randomly are assigned a class after levelling up from the ""Rookie"" rank, selecting one of the following:(Due to a gross underestimation of possible review lenghts on Steam Reviews, full review is available here instead.)

												Great tactical game. In some ways its quite limited here and there compared to original X-Com titles of 80s, but overall, I'm loving this game.Things to love about XCOM:- replayability - every new game is fun in its own way- hella lots of fun with 2nd wave options (after you complete the game and decide to start another one, some new options unlock, randomizing your game)- great customization (make sure you get all DLCs for this)- interesting missions, good map variety (Enemy Within, Slingshot DLCs)- the game sometimes gets quite brutal, wiping your team in a matter of seconds. Now try playing in Ironman mode, where you can't load! While this feels horrible, it forces you to learn your sub-optimal strategy won't work well in higher difficulties. Which is a good thing, overall.Things to note:- losing soldiers makes you feel bad- enemies hitting with unrealistic odds every now and then- your soldiers may miss 3-4 shots with 80-99% accuracy, one after another (don't worry, 100% shots always hit, although they may miss even at point-blank if its not 100%)- some game mechanics seem weird and take time getting used to- loading a game won't make your soldier hit instead of missing. More than that - your soldier may actually miss instead of hitting!- skipping a DLC mission will make it never return (in Enemy Within), so don't skip it. It comes back in Enemy Unknown. Launcher treats these as separate games.- some bugs 3 years after release. Nothing game-breaking, though.Overall - I absolutely LOVE this game and highly recommend anyone who played Xcom of the past or any tactical shooters. Turn based tactical shooters.			"

""It's ruthless, it's punishing and it's fantastic.""— Beaglerush, XCOM: Ironman Impossible Season 1, Episode 1Note 1: I've played XCOM on both Windows and Linux (thanks Feral for the Linux port!).Note 2: If you're going to play the game, check the comments for a list of useful resources (websites and mods).GameplayGameplay is divided in two sections: the base management component and the actual turn-based tactical combat.The base management part is very straightforward. You build labs, workshops, satellite arrays, order new equipment, choose your research projects, hire new soldiers, and so on. Basically, you'll be stressing over budget and deadlines (""How many sectoids corpses and UFO parts do I need to sell to build that satellite to save Egypt? What... It's gonna take a whole month to research a half-decent armor? Maybe I should get more scientists..."").But of course, the core of the game are the field missions. Every in-game month you get roughly 4 or 5 of them. Most of the time your goal is simply to eradicate all hostiles targets. Every now and then you'll receive special council missions where you have to extract/escort a VIP or deactivate some bomb. In addition to all that, the Slingshot DLC adds three story-driven council missions and the expansion pack Enemy Within includes another set of linked council missions (you have to enable them before starting a new game[i.imgur.com]).The combat requires some thinking. You'll be controlling a small squad (usually 4 to 6 units). If you move your soldiers around like they're a bunch of kids high on sugar, you're going to get your butt handed to you on an alien platter before you can say ""yolo swag 360 noscope"". So, don't spread your team out! Instead, keep them tightly together if you haven't engaged the enemy yet. This is especially true if you're playing on Classic or Impossible difficulty. The first time I played, I thought the game was stupid and obscenely unfair, but upon reflection I realized I was playing too aggressively and with complete disregard to the true nature of the cover system. With that in mind, learn the strengths and weaknesses of each soldier's class (assault, heavy, sniper, support) and how the cover system really works. Always go for full cover. Most of the time half cover is a big fat NOPE! If a soldier is in half cover and you can't take the alien down in your turn, hunker down or move to full cover! When attacking, your chance to hit is based on a lot of factors as the aim skill of the soldier, type of cover of your target, range, weapon used... The RNG can be a real pain: you're going to miss some 90% shots so always have a plan A, B, C, and D before pulling the trigger.There is a decent variety of enemies. During most of the early-mid game you're going to be completely outmatched by the aliens. But in the late game, you'll have access to some sweet, sweet gear and, with the Enemy Within expansion, gene mods. At first they may look OP, but in reality the aliens scale with you (damn you, mind-controlling Ethereals and nightmarish Sectopods that somehow take only half damage from all hits).Aesthetics and soundGreg Foertsch, the art director who also worked on Civilization IV and Alpha Centauri, did a stellar job designing the visuals of XCOM. The levels feel dark and creepy, yet the colors and effects are incredibly vibrant. XCOM really breaks the old stereotype of the awesome-but-terribly-ugly strategy game, as you can see it for yourself in the screenshots: (1)[i.imgur.com] (2)[i.imgur.com]. My only complaint is about the textures, even on PC they are basically console-level quality. Usually you're going to look to the battlefield from a considerable distance, so at least it's not that big of a problem.What about the soundtrack? Epic, just epic. Nothing will get you more in the mood of kicking some alien scum♥♥♥♥♥than the badass deployment song. Kudos for Michael McCann. The guy also did the soundtrack for Deus Ex: Human Revolution, so his work speaks for itself.StoryXCOM is not a narrative-driven game. The story is simple: aliens are invanding and your job as commander of XCOM is to lead Earth's finest soldiers against the bloody barbarians. So how can this game elicit such a wide spectrum of emotions, throwing the player in a mix of grief, anger, and joy?Why XCOM is so good?Every soldier you get is assigned a gender, nationality and, when he or she is promoted to Squaddie, a random class. Everything else is up to the player. You can edit name, nickname, change physical appearance, choose special abilities, and so on. Differently from other strategy games like Age of Empires or Total War, you're not controlling a vast army of faceless cannon fodder. In XCOM, you typically have a roster of 15 to 25 men. After some time it's inevitable to start forming a bond with your soldiers. The game is hard, is brutal, and it's meant to be played with Ironman enabled, that is, no save scumming, no reloading, no undo. While some games are like a dull superhero movie, where you're never in real danger and you just steamroll your foes, XCOM is more like Shingeki no Kyojin: your enemy will outclass you in every way, eat your best soldiers alive and make the rest go back to the Skyranger♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in their pants and crying. The thrill of battle, not knowing whether or not your men are going to survive, and the dreadful challenge of facing an unknown enemy: that's XCOM.A last note about the DLCAlready have XCOM: Enemy Unknown? Maybe you got it for free voting for the Golden Joystick Awards 2014? There are two small DLC:The Slingshot Content Pack adds three new missions, an unique character, and five new achievements.The Elite Soldier Pack just add a few comestic options for customizing armors and one new hairstyle.As you see, they're kind of cool but not really necessary. Maybe if there is a nice sale and you have some money laying around...Now, the must-have is Enemy Within, the third big one. It's an incredible expansion pack with a lot of new awesome content. New items, new aliens, new human (!) enemy faction, genetic modifications, and MEC Troopers. Yeah, you read it right. Freaking M-E-C-H-S! You have no idea how satisfying it is to falcon punch a Thin Man in the face.If you don't have XCOM: Enemy Unknown yet, grab the ""XCOM:Enemy Unknown Complete Pack"" when it's on sale.			"

												A fantastic turn-based squad tactics game. Premise of Xcom is simple. You're in charge of a secret organization that's at the frontline of defending our world from an alien invasion. To do so you must train an elite team of able soldiers and give the invaders a fight they'll never forget.Gameplay consists of a variety of elements. The main aspect are the combat missions where you move each squad member on an isometric grid in a turn-based format. Enemies come in a good variety, each one having their own strengths and weaknesses, and all having a smart A.I. Taking cover and using teamwork are essential to winning the battles. Your soldiers are all expendable and die permanently if killed in combat. Where this is not a big deal when you lose rookies, you really want to take special care for your higher levelled people (gladly they also have a higher chance of simply being K.Oed and able to be revived with a medic).The combat is pretty challenging a lot of the time and gets you thinking tactically, even on an Easy difficulty. There were a few instances where I felt that the difficulty spiked a bit too sharply. Those were mainly regarding the main story missions. I think you're supposed to really take your time preparing for those, because the game doesn't have levels and the like that tells you how powerful you need to be in order to handle these missions, so it's easy to go in too soon without realising it. Moreover, the game constantly highlights main story objectives as high priority, which is also very misleading, because it makes you think you have to do them as soon as possible. Aside from main story missions, there are many optional missions. Some require you to simply clear out an area off hostiles, others require you to shoot down a UFO and then send a team to finish off any surviving invaders, and at times you also get missions where you have to rescue as many civilians in an area as you can whilst aliens are trashing up the place.Aside from combat missions, you also have to do some management behind the scenes. That mostly involves deciding what tech to research, how to outequip your team, as well as launching satellites over specific countries, each one giving you their own bonuses, and overall monitoring the level of panic on each continent and making sure it doesn't go into the red zone. In essence, there's a lot of choice on how to advance through the game.I was quite surprised by the high level of presentation in regard to story cutscenes, voice acting, and things of that nature, considering that most tactics-based games usually have a very minimalistic approach regarding these aspects of a game. The music is also pretty amazing (particularly the squad selection track, which is my favourite).Xcom is very good at sucking you in and making you really feel like a commander who has to make difficult decisions and look after his people. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys squad-based tactics games or any games with turn-based combat.			"

												The original X-COM is one of my favorite games ever, one that I have played through many times. I found the tactics in this game to easier than in the original (especially in the beginning), but the base management side more challenging to figure out, which is good (WAY too easy to make easy millions in the original). I LOVE the ""chunky"" aesthetics of the game that are a throwback to the original's look, and I've even taken a liking to the change from time units to Final Fantasy Tactics style combat; it really helps the game move along at a nice pace without changing the feel of combat very much. I always used to leave enough time units in the earlier X-COM's to move behind cover and crouch after a shot, so I am pleased that this whole sequence of ducking in and out of cover to fire is built into the game's cover-mechanic. The alien's getting a free move when you see them does not bother me in a thematic sense (they're on ""free-move-overwatch"" I guess), though it is sometimes immersion-breaking, since you know you cannot be shot at until you ""activate"" a group of aliens. A bit different feel than the original, due to unseen aliens not shooting, and XCOM soldiers being MUCH harder to kill.Anyways, I LOVED IT. I haven't encountered the bugs I've seen others complain about, fortunately, and Firaxis has somehow made this game even MORE addictive/compelling than the original, with that same ""just one more turn"" feel that the Civilization series has. I totally see the complaints about the camera with multi-level maps, though; it's really terrible!Also, it feels a bit more scripted than what I was expecting, both in the strategic level (3 uninterceptible abduction missions at the same time) and tactical level (aliens don't move until encountered).

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a turn-based tactical RPG, which can be played in single-player campaign mode or in multiplayer mode. Released in 2012 and using the UE3 Engine, Enemy Unknown takes place in a future where aliens have invaded earth and you are the last line of defense. As the commander, you direct soldiers turn-based style to eliminate alien threats, secure objectives, and more. At the end of each mission, prior to the start of the next, you have the ability to use do research, and create new technologies, as well as handle your finances. Visually, I think the game looks pretty good for being 3 years old. The fog of war is well done, and there are multiple difficulty settings to give players even more of a challenge. I played on Impossible mode, as well as Ironman mode, with all the special features turned on to make the game as challenging as possible and it worked. The AI is great and can present a challenge to those who rush in, forcing you to actually use tactics to clear objectives. Enemy Unknown also has an expansion called, XCOM: Enemy Within, which adds a variety of content. The Elite Edition contains all DLC Content and is the best deal if you are interested in picking up this game. I'm not a huge fan of turn-based gameplay, but this is actually a really great game, nicely done, and worth paying for.			"

 Want to know how PTSD is like? Then just play this gameYou bought this game thinking it was your average tactical strategy squad-based shooter. Until you realised this is an actual war and every soldier that returns home in a coffin is another blow in your already shattered heart.Enter XCOM, or Extraterrestial Combat Unit, an organisation funded by all the goverments in the world with the sole purpose to defend Earth against the alien invasion. Your job as the man in charge is to guide this organisation to victory through research, experimentation, building your base and commanding your troops in battle. Do well and the nations will make it rain on you with them precious dollars. Do poorly, and the nations will pull out, leaving you with reduced resources to fight.Every aspect of the game is all about making the right choices, as there's no such thing as fully upgrading everything. Will you keep a soldier in battle to upgrade his skills or will you pull him out to undergo psychic training? Will you buy more satellites to spot alien aircraft faster or will you buy more interceptors to deal with the ones you find? Everything has a price to pay and tensions will rise very soon once the main bulk of the game reveals itself. Combat-wise, as your soldiers take part in more missions, they get more experience, which allows them to unlock certain skills. It's a well-made system, because it allows you to tailor your troops as you see fit and adjust them to your playstyle. You can also rename your soldiers and change their appearance. Later in the game, you will have the option to unlock their psionic powers or turn them into cyborgs for greater efficiency. All these combined, give a sense of personality on each soldier and you will feel differently about them, mostly sympathetic. That means that their deaths can leave you in a state of sadness, since you know that from now on you will only see them in the dead troopers' records. And that's the game's magic, you will develop a bond with the men and women that are ready to sacrifice everything for victory.The missions are pretty difficult, especially in higher levels, requiring careful planning and tactics to pull them off. The alien enemies have different races, skills and weapons at their disposal, meaning that each enemy requires different approaches to defeat. You will always have the feeling that the aliens are two steps ahead of you and you are struggling to keep the organisation alive between demanding nations, alien spaceship assaults and dogfights on the Earth's atmosphere. It's brutal, harsh and unforgiving, granting a huge level of immersion.The game looks beautiful, colorful and well-made. By the time each mission finishes, the map will be full of debris, exploded cars, crushed walls and dead bodies (alien or not). Your soldiers look incredible in their special battle armors, even if some players might find them slightly cartoonish. It really does a nice job giving you a feel of the battlefield as you see the firefights and explosions everywhere. Better yet, even though everything can be used as cover, that means cover will often be destroyed by gunfight, leaving an unpredictability factor in the game, forcing you to think on the fly to save your precious soldiers.On the downside, the fact not all your soldiers can't reach the highest point of their abilities, means you won't have much room to make the most out of their abilities. You rarely will see a trooper fully-upgraded, let alone one with all his psionic powers mastered, for example. This is, in my opinion, a major failure of the game. True, it adds a ""survive"" feel to the game, but you will never feel overpowered and badass against the aliens. Despair and anxiety are realistic factors, but overdoing it is just not gonna work that nicely.Now excuse me, I got to bury a soldier that looks like my nasty boss. Huh, this game has good moments after all...RATING:Gameplay: 8/10Presentation: 9/10Story: 8.5/10Unique Factor: Progression System: 9/10OVERALL: 8.6/10 "

The crew readied their guns and begans spraying in every direction. The rookie was hit with a blaster and then poisoned. The life faded from his eyes.

Seems to add some much needed variety in the gameplay since the base game can get boring after you master it since it basically requires you to be super cautious and inch your way forward on classic and especially impossible in order to have a shot at victory. The comparisons to strategy JRPGs is valid I think. Then again I was a huge fan of FFT and vandal hearts when I was a kid so yeah done right they are awesome.			"

												I really wish that steam reviews had more than a simple yes / no system because as far as gameplay this game is actually  really fun. My complaint comes from the fact that  there are a number of bugs that will make the game lock up and you have to restart and lose any progress you had, with how difficult the game tends to be that is incredibly maddening. I have ended up rage quitting every time it happens to me since it seems to happen the most when I am  really kicking alien♥♥♥♥♥a quick look around  on google finds these issues since 2012 and they are still there unlikely to ever get fixed. I know that negative reviews on popular games always get voted down by braindead fanboys who can't bear to hear any criticism about their favorite games, but i don't care! I hate when these huge game companies keep broken games unfixed because they know the francise name will still make people buy it even if its a glitchy mess! Steam needs to have some method in their reviews to mark that your negative review is in regard to the game having  game breaking  or severe bugs. To me, that sort of info would be nice to filter out so you can see if those buried negative reviews are actual legit complaints vs someone being disapointed  or expecting more of the game or whatever more personal reason people have for rating down a game that is mostly opinion vs the game being broken in some way.

												I really don't know what to write about XCOM: Enemy Unknown. One one hand it is a great tactical strategy game with some cool features, on the other hand it seems to be either unintentionally broken or designed so horribly that it basically makes the turn-based gameplay pointless.Visually XCOM is great, mostly. The designs, weapons, armors, vehicles and bases in addition to most of the aliens are really nice looking and have variety to them. The human characters, mainly the male soldiers are rather unnerving in appearance. The female soldiers are mostly ok and the story characters work well. The music sets the mood and there are some good standout pieces (especially the ""Ready for battle"" song).Now, I know that the franchise is a meat grinder of sorts, fighting tooth and nail to win one battle at a time with the ever-looming threat of making that one bad call and getting a TPK even on a regular search and destroy mission. And I am fine with that.1. Not being able to choose the class of your soldiers when they start ranking up. You would think this is an OK feature and perhaps if it worked well enough it would be. Now it is completely random (or at least I haven't found out how to affect it through my own actions): I started a new game, played the first few missions and leveled up my squad only to find out that 2 of them became snipers, one went to become a heavy and another an assault class. Ok, so early in the game that is not a big problem but when I bought an additional squad member position to my team and picked the next rookie to go on a mission things went from ""silly team composition"" to ""how does this even work"": I now had 3 snipers in my team in addition to the heavy and assault. A basic abduction mission is easy to handle even with an uneven team but when I have to race against time to save civilians of disarm a bomb and three of my squad members can't move and shoot/overwatch at a low level is a big problem. Sure, I could have picked other rookies and started to level them up but once you play few missions and every perk you gain when leveling up is of great importance, you rather choose the ones you have as high level as possible to ensure that a TPK doesn't happen. Especially since the panic levels increase fast in the first hours of the game.2. Me see evil; me no shoot evil. I have come to learn that unless you have a 100% chance to hit a target, you will more than likely miss. It doesn't matter if the percentage is at 90; out of 10 shots with 90% probability to hit the target, your soldiers will hit maybe, just maybe, half of them. Even if the target is standing in an adjacent square. And what is absolutely baffling to me is that your soldier can stand only one square away from the enemy unit that is standing in the open and your soldier's hit percentage is only 65.I witnessed a case where 4 of my soldiers were surrounding a Muton (the big green hulk) that was hiding behind a one square sized cover (an alien artefact that needed to be salvaged so no rocket launchers). The soldiers were positioned so that only one of them wasn't flanking the enemy unit aka the cover was between them. The other three soldiers were one square away from it, flanking from the sides and behind with no cover )this would mean a red shield if it was a player controlled soldier). It took all four of them to bring down the Muton that had already lost half of its HP. Two of my soldiers, the one not flanking and one of the flanking soldiers missed and the rest to managed to hit and kill the Muton. Now, if this was to happen the other way around, 4 enemy units surrounding one of the soldiers, the soldier would have been killed instantly, no misses. It is as if the aliens have a naturally better chance at every shot they take, no matter how good my soldiers' gear is.Also, when an alien like a sectoid is half the map away from my soldier (that would have maybe 10-15% chance to hit the sectoid if it was the soldier's turn) and the sectoid not only hits my soldier who is behind a cover and deals critical damage, I call BS. It seems that when the distance grows, the likelyhood for my soldiers to hit the target diminishes, fairly quickly I might add (which in itself is logical). However, it seems that no matter how far the enemies are, they are more than likely to hit you, no matter the elevation difference. Also the ""higher elevation boost"" for soldiers, especially snipers is ridiculous. I have only once seen it give any advantage and that was when the sniper was only few squares away from the enemy unit that wasn't behind cover and even then with the S.C.O.P.E. the hit probability didn't rise to more than 80%.3. Bullet trajectory. A minor but most irritating and definitely a design flaw in the game is the way bullets, plasma, lasers and whatnot fly when someone is shot. If the game calculates the hit/miss before the actual animation is shown, it would be nice to not see bullets or other death rays to hit a target and then see ""Missed"" in the notification. I mean, how hard is it to program the animations to ""miss"" when the statistics state that the shot missed the target? It is really confusing to see my soldier take hit from a volley of plasma and then get ""Missed"" when I was already mentally prepared to see the soldier die. It is just bad design.4. Statistical cover and visual cover. Sometimes it seems that no matter how well in cover you are, you get hit. I don't fully know how the cover works, perhaps full cover is nothing more than ""a crit denier"": you take hit but don't get hit with a crit, similar to ""hunker down"". Sometimes the bullets and whatnot seem to hit the environment, sometimes they travel straight through it and hit the target. It is rather difficult to place a sniper in a good position to overwatch when you can't tell for certain if a wall is just there for level design purpose or if it is actually a wall/cover. One time my sniper was in a place I never would have expected for him to be able to shoot anybody but surely enough he just calmly stood up and shot an enemy unit through a couple square thick spaceship wall.5. No free aim. This might seem a pointless nitpick but I think that removing the possibility to shoot other than just visible aliens is a silly thing. The game has destructible environments, the rocket launchers and grenades have free aim and there are features in the maps that can become environmental hazards for both the XCOM and the aliens.6. Overwatch works some of the time. The idea of overwatch is important if one wants to survive the missions and more than once it has saved my squad. However, I find it ridiculous that every soldier shoots at the same time if a target comes into their field of view. Once I had 3 soldiers, 2 assaults and a sniper take a shot at a single target: the assault with a plasma rifle slaughtered the target, the second assault and sniper therefore shot at nothing remarking ""I've missed the target"" which is funny since the target was already rendered into atoms. Oh, and most times, if the target isn't less than 5 squares from the soldiers, they are more than likely to miss, even if the target is in the open.7. Enemy movement on my turn. How this feature got through the QA is beyond me. How can you make a turn-based strategy game when the enemy units always get a freebie when you spot them? Wouldn't it be more logical that they move around the map even when you have not yet spotted them instead of creeping in one spot and then scattering around like cockroaches when you finally spot them? I find it immensely bad design that they can move to a cover and then take a full turn after the player has completed their turn. Many more times than I want to remember, I have spent my actions covering my units while assuming the enemy coming from the darkness only to spot them with my last soldier and see them reposition themselves flanking me and then have a turn to TPK my team.

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown and its addons are de facto re-issue the game UFO Defence game 1993 year edition. Established Firaxis Games and published by 2K new game turned out pretty not bad. The basic details and the scenario were simply transferred from the 1993 year game: as the war with the aliens, turn-based tactics, tactical role-playing elements.   The mission of the player is protection the planet from alien attacks, their operations on the ground and in the air. For ground operations under player control will be a special detachment. It is replenished by hiring for the money, so long as you have money and you will have recruits. But a large number of detachment on base  senselessly because the operation can only use a limited number of soldiers 5 in the original game; 6 in addon Enemy Within. After successful operations soldiers who took part in the operation may be promoted in rank then become available new options and opportunities. The game has 4 classes of soldiers, -heavy infantry, support, assault, sniper and unique class - psionic - a soldier who has psionic abilities. The soldiers of different classes differently armed and have different skills. What classes to use depends on the player and his chosen tactics. Battle goes step by step: the player and the enemy take turns. During the battle each fighter can perform two actions (move / open fire / reload weapon / etc.). To win, the player has to fulfill the mission goal (to clean the area from aliens, rescue civilians or hostage). Enemy are various forms of aliens - their number, skills and capacity increases according to the game walkthrough. To destroy alien aircraft,  XCOM need to buy aircrafts, but unlike the recruits its construction takes time.   The player has a secret base. In a bunker is a research center, engineering department, a command post, a hangar for XCOM aviation, satellite control center, barracks, etc. The player decides which conduct research, what structures build, what type of equipment use for soldiers who will took part in operation. Project XCOM financed by 16 countries. Due to aliens attack, if XCOM ignore countries request of help, country can leave project. If 8 countries leave project - player lose.   Since the game is turn-based tactics not possible not to pay attention to the entourage of battles in XCOM. The battles with aliens take place throughout the planet and the question remains, why the location is almost indistinguishable from one another. The same cars, houses, people in Beijing, in London, in Cairo, in Lagos. This is pathetic, seems what game was created not a company with over 100 man crew, but several people who raised money on kickstarter.   Despite some disadvantages, the game still came worthy sequel to the original game of 1993.    7/10			"

												This game like to play with your emotions, you have a favourite character or characters, you root for them and hope they will go the distance and win out right and save the world form the alien invasion, you let yourself believe that it’s going to happen and it seems like its going to happen, your so close to being the hero and then out of nowhere, it happens, it all seemed like a blurr, it happened so fast Out of nowhere your favourite character is horribly murdered right in front of your helpless eyes, you cry and ask yourself what you could have done different, but it doesn’t matter it won’t bring them back, then finally when the initial shock of what just happened has passed, you open your heart again to new characters, you learn to love again, before it happens all over again, again and again like a vicious never ending cycle, until you find yourself crying under your bed 11/10 would defiantly cry again under my bed again			"

												Awesome! If you include the Longwar Mod. Good without it. Be warned ... the long war mod is brutal, your favorite characters will die, but the anxiety/reward factor is fantastic! Said anxiety only allows me to play in 2-3 hour spurts then my mind simply must rest.. :) More of a lifestyle than a game.Edit: Another huge must have for this game are the voice packs from MJpoland and others. You get the voices from Marcus, Coltrain, Baird, Dom, Carmine, etc. from GOW in one pack, Deadpool in another pack, plus COD voices in another and there are even more. I use all of them. trust me, once you install these into the default content ini. you will never play without them again.			"

I'm supposed to be getting my sleep schedule back to normal but this one game keeps kicking my♥♥♥♥♥XCOM delivers an interesting advanced game of chess, with your peices being the soldiers you raised from the ground up, with your opponent being the invading aliens. There are many factors that can determine the battle's outcome, such as what gear you've researched, what buildings you have produced, how you combat the aliens such as ducking behind cover, how accurate your soldiers are, how much willpower they have from previous battles and more. This game gives you many hours of packed fun, from just playing the standalone game (There is DLC but I have not played it yet). There are some nice RPG elements in this game as well, seeing that you can name, customize, nickname, and give your troops a personality and look that suits you. Oftentimes you may possibly find yourself 'save-scumming' from having many of your troops die or an error you felt was a grave mistake, though not encouraged you just simply can't help it.You also have the freedom of choice in this game, which adds to the roleplay, since you are the ""Commander"" of XCOM, you have the ability to make many MANY choices that determine the organization's and the planet's outcome. Not all choices are created equal, some may be hard, but it's all about instinct.In a nutshell this is one hell of a game, I love it, and I don't think I can get much sleep for the next few weeks. Help.- RIP 'Cookie', you were a great medic, a damn good one.			"

												This is a fantastic strategy game with a couple minor flaws. Firstly, let me say that I love XCOM. I owned the original UFO Defense for PC and PlayStation, Terror from the Deep, and Apocalypse. I played many reboots including Afterlight and some community made versions as well. This game comes the closest to remaking the original and adds a few nice elements in its own right.Ill list off the bad first. This game is RNG hell! Try this scenario. You’re down to your last move and have a half dead Muton waiting around the corner. You wisely saved your crit happy, shotgun toting, assault run and gun soldier. You confidently streak towards your adversary with only a slight degree of separation as you stop moving. You check your aim, breathe a sigh of relief at the 98% hit chance. You fire away only to find your Muton buddy laughing furiously as you miss. How did I miss at point blank distance with a shotgun!? Next turn my emboldened Muton friend slaughters my cross eyed soldier with one quick shot to the face. This in turn causes a nearby rookie to freak out and panic. He begins shooting my colonel in the back causing her to bleed out. From this point on in your life, 99% will never be a sure thing again. Now here is the good. Excellent challenge. This game forces you to think ahead and plan accordingly. Do you think you mastered the game? Try classic or impossible difficulty with ironman enabled. And if that’s not enough try out the long war mod. Both tactical and base management layers offer enough strategy and replayability to keep anyone that likes strategy games entertained for at least two playthroughs. Now add all the alien lore discovered by engaging new aliens and base side research and development, and you have one engrossing experience.Graphics and sound are fantastic. The game presents in an isometric top down orientation for the tactical aspect. In between turns you can sometimes hear the ominous movements of moving aliens or mortified screams from unsuspecting civilians. Environments are very detailed and there are enough unique maps to not see any repeats on a single play-through. Music is great, but still doesn’t beat the PlayStation soundtrack in my humble opinion. I highly recommend that any person wanting to experience a great turn based strategy game pick up Enemy Unknown and at least the expansion Enemy Within. Despite the RNG issues, the game is a solid, well thought out attempt to make XCOM relevant again. Fraxis did this game some justice for both stalwart XCOM veterans and new players alike. XCOM 2 has already exceeded my expectations as well. I however think this game belongs in anyone’s collection. "

												With the Steam sale coming up I recommend keeping an eye out for XCOM: Enemy Unknown & the Enemy Within expansion for the base game; Enemy Unknown was pretty dam good, but Enemy Within really adds the icing on the cake in terms of a new sub campaign, new techs, new classes of soldier, new enemies and a more fleshed out customisation system for your own troops. But if you want to see a fairly faithful recreation of the original XCOM series in three dimensions it is certainly worth a look; or even if you never played the original XCOM games then this is an excellent turn based, squad level combat simulator with a fairly comprehensive turn based RTS system housing that.

												Firaxis has made an absolutely wonderful modernization of a classic strategy game. The deep and evolving gameplay is among the best I've experienced in a game like this, along with the fact that everything feels extremely polished and crafted with a a great deal of love for both the genre and the original game.XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a worthy tribute to its progenitor and hopefully the start of something brand new for players who've been dying to get a good squad-based strategy game that lets them not only think, but feel as well.To say that XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a phenomenal remake would be selling Firaxis' monumental accomplishment short. The developer hasn't just managed to capture the spirit of the original; they've also tweaked, trimmed, and innovated enough to deliver the freshest, most engaging strategy game in recent memory, if not ever.Even if you don't like strategy games, if you love action games and have an open enough mind to try out something a bit slower-paced, you will be rewarded with one of the most thrilling, thought-provoking, and heart-pounding games of 2012.Amazing tactical complexity, satisfying strategic depth; slightly dodgy ending, but your own stories are more important anyway. A modern classic.If you played the original, then this is a no brainer purchase; if you haven't, then you are in for a lot of gameplay hours that will both challenge and enthrall you.			"

												New version of XCOM is really great game. As a fan of original games, I was really afraid what will be this new version. This is really good example how to do new version of classic title. Some people complain that this XCOM is simplified in comparison to original title. It's true, but in that way they removed a lot of annoying details like micro-managment.They did new version as it should be done in XXI century but there is still the spirit of original title.VERDICT:If you are openminded fan of the serie, grab it and play it right now! It's worth of your time.If you don't know the serie, but you just like playing good games, play it!If you are fan of the original serie and you think that everything after X-COM: Terror From the Deep which has XCOM in the title is a blasphemy, don't touch this!Like this review?

												This remake of the 1993 X-COM: UFO Defense, an obtuse and painful but ultimately satisfying game, attempts to bring UFO Defense into the 21st century while also improving on the original game's intentions. Sadly, (or happily depending on your faith in such an endeavor) all of these changes present a double-edged sword. For every system Enemy Unknown improves - and they are solid improvements - something of the freedom or atmosphere of the original is lost. Some sacrifices are small but expected, such as the way you've built your base not having an effect on base invasions (a feature that itself was only added to the remake with the Enemy Within expansion). Others are a bit more surprising, such as the total change in atmosphere brought about by taking the original troop limit of 14 down to the much smaller squad of 6. Limiting the number of soldiers on the field at a time means that each individual is more valuable and stands out more readily which is also bolstered by an increased level of customization. I found myself even more attached to my Enemy Unknown soldiers than my UFO Defense regulars and as that attachment was one of the biggest joys of the original, it's hard not to consider that a successful change. However, with only 6 soldiers gaining battle experience at a time, any casualty is devastating, meaning you can no longer afford to send a group of bright-eyed red shirted rookies into a situation as you, an experienced commander, know it is unlikely they will survive. So that sense of constant Pyrrhic victories, of losing three men to breach a downed UFO and eliminate the final alien, are lost to gain a more beloved solider with a richer player-made story. This difference encapsulates the transition between the two games. While UFO Defense focused on the greater conflict, with individual soldiers representing little more than a resource, Enemy Unknown focuses on those called to fight and how this conflict affects them. The overarching narrative hasn't changed much, but the change in perspective makes for a unique, fresh experience.  That being said, Enemy Unknown can stand (and fall) on its own as well. The terror of a completely unknown threat and the slow unveiling of what it is you're fighting and why it's fighting you is satisfying without depending on the crutch of name dropping the original's enemies. The unlikelihood of any one shot being 100% certain in accuracy or damage forces the player to come up with backup plans and to deal with the unexpected, keeping the player on his or her toes. Sometimes, however, the unexpected comes not from an intended monkey wrench, but from an obtuseness in the game's mechanics. After completing two full games on two different difficulties, I still have a very poor idea of what a soldier will or will not be able to see and where. This disastrous flaw could have easily been corrected if I had the option to see from the soldier's point of view. Graphical glitches are also relatively common leading to a rushed and unfinished feel which is only compounded by the expansion, Enemy Within. Meld - a resource introduced in the expansion to fuel the new gene modifying and MEC trooper initiatives - both adds a new time element to missions and sticks out as completely artificial. Again this issue seems like it could be simply resolved with a bit more story relevance and/or more logical placements. The 'abduction' mission type seems equally artificial in that they always occur in threes, leaving the commander to choose only one site to defend while leaving the others to their fate and causing panic across those continents. The player is left with no solution to this 'one step forward two steps back' situation nor is there any explanation for why that's so. Which leads me to my biggest complaint about Enemy Unknown: The whole experience feels like it's on rails. Not only doesn't the alien invasion operate on its own independent timescale (a theme which is repeated with the aliens I meet in the field), but it doesn't even seem like anything I as the player do has an affect on how the invasion plays out, past the basic win-lose proposition. Due to this design direction, some story elements can't reach a satisfying conclusion. For instance, the comparison between the alien's situation and XCOM's current trajectory never pays off. The aliens seem to have undergone some great cruelty which is played up from the beginning as being both inhumane and the reason they're so effective, but there is little to no consequence for the XCOM project visiting the same cruelty on its own soldiers to match the enemy's results. This is possibly the most interesting story this setting has to tell and yet it's simply pushed aside once the situation is realized. Stumbling blocks like these keep this exciting, ensnaring game from achieving the greatness it seems to be aiming for. But if you're prepared for a little (or a lot) of that 'what could have been' frustration, it's not the worst way to spend a good chunk of your time.			"

												More thrilling, terrifying and suspenseful than any turn-based game has the right to be. You'll grow fond of your soldiers- too fond, perhaps, as they're only ever one unlucky move away from a gruesome and unfair-yet-also-annoyingly-fair death.The closest thing to it I believe would be the Heroes of Might and Magic series. It is a game of two halves. About a fifth of the time is spent on the overview screen, the rest in suspenseful battles against lurking aliens.When you're not on the field, you level up your base and choose how to prioritise research and funding. Do you invest in new alien tech? Do you hire new soldiers? Do you launch satellites to keep the world peaceful? It's not as punishing as I would have feared. You're not going to dig yourself into a corner by choosing the 'wrong' decisions. In a way you're simply choosing how you want to fight your foe. There's enough depth and complexity to keep you going until the end of the game and you'll want to play it a second game to see just how different an alternative approach can be.And then there are the battles. You gradually advance your troops across a variety of different battlefields, trying to scout out the enemies whilst remaining safe enough to withstand their retaliation. These adventures span somewhere between 10-30 minutes each and are all gripping and beautifully done affairs. You'll get angry when your characters miss an easy shot, but will squeal with glee when they somehow hit something through 2 walls and a car window. It really is something to behold.The down-sides? The graphics aren't too good and yes, it is annoying when your characters die. It almost makes you want to re-load- BUT DON'T DO THAT! That removes the fun.Xcom is a fantastic game. Get it.			"

												Started to get interested in XCOM when a friend kept going on about XCOM2.  He recommended I pick up Enemy Unknown as an entry into the series, and I'm glad I did (went with Complete though, so I got both Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within).If you have time and go with Complete, I recommend playing Enemy Unknown first to learn the game, then playing Enemy Within, which adds a lot of elements to the original story, as well as new units and play dynamics.I rarely play a game to completion more than once, but I've already beaten XCOM twice, and with 40+ hours of gameplay I might play it again in future before picking up XCOM2.  Still have yet to try the 'Long War' mod many have talked about as well.			"

												First off, I'd like to say that I was never into strategy games; but only because of the simple reason that I SUCKED AT THEM. The last real turn-based strategy game I played was Heroes 3 Might and Magic, and even that I failed to play above casual level.So when I saw all the reviews about this game, about how unforgiving it was in difficulty, even at a bargain sale price I had to think about my purchase 3-4 times. For once, I played a game with all of my expectations fulfilled. I started the game and looked out the window on a beautiful Saturday morning (4:00 am) and continued playing it until I realized it's been almost 24 hours after.This is probably one of the most PUNISHING, RAGE-INDUCING GAMES, anti-perfectionist games I've ever played. It's so sadistic it will drive you half-insane while playing it. I LOVE IT!!! The difficulty and learning curve even on EASY for casual gamers is not forgiving especially if you are new to the genre like me. I've already given up on 100% this game (Impossible Difficulty + Iron Man mode), but fun enough to keep trying. This game makes Dark Souls Series look easy, and that's something special.This game certainly changed my view on strategy games in general, which I originally avoided.			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is an immersive, tactical, turn-based, resource management oriented and unpredictable strategy game. It's bloody amazing.PROS:+ immersion(you care about your soldiers and the missions at hand)+ squad customization(both the looks and the combat skills)+ difficulty+ randomness(the legendary 95% hit chance misses)+ you are in full control of XCOM project's developmentCONS:- little bugs and glitches here and there, they are more of an annoyance than a flawIf you are into tactical combat, finding yourself in scenarios in which odds aren't in your favour and the difficulty is fair- instabuy. There's a lot of replayability value thanks to the Ironman mode(the game saves automatically after each turn, what's done is done) and the Second Wave(after your first playthrough, you can customize some of the gameplay elements, tinker a bit to make the game a more personalized experience); moreover, there's a multiplayer component, so you can test your inner tactician when battling live opponents.Save our planet from the alien invasion and become the saviour of humanity.XCOM needs you.""Good luck, Commander.""

Posted: June 28, 2016
												XCOM: Enemy Unknown (and its almost necessary expansion pack, Enemy Within) has been out a while now, so I don't feel I need to go into specifics as to how it plays, as it's pretty common knowledge by now. So let me just get this out of the way: I absolutely hate this game.I understand that it's meant to be challenging, to give the player a feeling of impending doom, as if all life on Earth hangs in the balance. I understand, too, that there is a good deal of risk-taking involved with the tactical side of the game; it becomes necessary to run your soldiers through enemy overwatches in the hope that one perfect flanking route can break open a drawn-out, bloody battle. And I understand that death is a part of the game, and it often comes swiftly and cruelly to even the most experienced soldier.But let me tell you, it gets REALLY old. It gets old to see what is supposed to be a world-class soldier whiff a shot on a stationary enemy less than 10 yards away. Conversely, it gets old to see your enemies land across-the-map, one-hit-kill shots on soldiers in full cover, causing a chain-panic and reducing the remainder of your squad to whimpering, blubbering infants. It especially gets old to have to utilize cover and think heavily about your squad's positioning, only to have enemies swoop in right next to you like their lives are meaningless, invalidating all that critical thinking you've done about where to place your troops, and land a flanking kill shot from a foot away. Anyone who has played this game knows all about missing 90+% shots that get your squad killed. Or having to gun down one of your favorite troopers that you've had since the start of the game because some jackass Sectoid mind-controlled him. Or getting jumped by Chryssalids on turn 1 of a terror mission - I could go on.Ironically, the sense of dread and despair that the designers intended to bake into XCOM works a bit too well - when I finish a mission I don't feel accomplished or rewarded, I'm just glad that it's over. May I ask, is that good game design? To just breathe a sigh of relief that nothing major happened to make me want to rage-quit? To me, it isn't good game design: it's frustrating and unfulfilling.Let me at least say that for the most part, I like a lot of aspects of the game: the chunky action-figure character design, the atmospheric music, the ant-farm strategic view, the system of progression and unlocks that allow you to improve your base and squad with seized alien technology. I even like the genre that this game falls into as well, so I'm not deliberately trying to find fault with what is, to me, a good formula for a fun game. But it isn't fun. I've yet to get more than 15-20 hours into a single campaign before throwing in the towel in complete disgust. I periodically come back to the game to see if the medicine is as bitter as I remember, which is why I finally feel like I need to put my feelings into words, so I can let this game rest. Even the vaunted Long War mod does little to fix what is ultimately busted game design. If you are a glutton for punishment, this game might be for you. As for me, I'm putting this one back on the shelf for good.EDIT: If you bothered to read this to the end and you still somehow find this review unhelpful, leave me a comment stating why. I realize that I'm dumping on a lot of peoples' favorite game here but my ""Not Recommended"" rating was not given without a lot of thought and many honest attempts to give the game a chance (I would hope that much is obvious with just over 100 hours on the logs). Your choosing to find the review helpful or not should reflect on the quality of the review, not on your opinion of the game. Thanks.			"

												Enemy Unknown is a good turn based strategy game that has great base management which is in my opinion the highlight of the game. Trying to keep the panic level down for all of these countries you are trying to protect is a very deep and fascinating mechanic because there are so many factors that go into it like the satellite coverage, intercepting ufo’s, having to choose what country to help out while ignoring another because there is not enough time for both etc. Customizing the loadout of your soldiers, choosing which class you want in the field and what upgrades you want for them is very compelling as well as researching and building new equipment for the soldiers and upgrading your base etc. The turn based gameplay itself is well done as well. This is another one of those type of games where I enjoy playing in the background while listening to podcasts, videos and music because I can’t see myself being enthralled and captivated with this kind of gameplay for a long period of time because this genre is not really my thing but I wanted to give this game a shot and I’m glad that I did. 8/10 (Great)			"

You can name and personalize your soldiers, and the character developement is great.This is a new game in the old X-Com style, but not the same (Why should it be ?? The old games are already there !!??!!! ) . There are of course stuff from the old games I would like to see included .

												I have to be completely honest with you all. I was a newbie to xcom. I had to tone down the difficulty to easy as well as reload my previous saves so that I could successfully beat this game.This game does not hold your hand, and every decision taken feels important. I loved the tension within this game as I tried to frantically manage my resources and not loose too many soldiers.Props to the developers for providing an excellent UI so that newcomers can easily get into the game and with an excellent soundtrack(Shout out to Michael McCann!!!) which makes this game feel like a thriller movie.Unlike other turn based strategy games, Xcom is fast paced, intense and fluid. Short missions with tons of procedurally generated maps will keep you interested, even on a second playthrough.Buy this game and it’s Enemy Within DLC for sure. It’s worth it, I swear......			"

												Cons:- Some 'random number generator' frustrations because of the way 'chance to hit' plays a big role in the game.  At 75% chance to hit, you can count on missing multiple times every couple of battles, which usually results in a teammate dying.  (And even though the game is kind of designed to let characters die now and again, it's actually such a big penalty that you do NOT want it to happen).  Even at max, 95% chance to hit, you'll get the occasional 2 or 3 in-a-row miss that drives you crazy.  Save often so you can quit and reload when someone dies.- It's possible to ruin the game for yourself early on through the base management (the Sim City-ish bit).  I can't remember what it was, exactly, but one thing you can invest in results in the aliens levelling up.  Invest too much too early, and you'll be facing deadly aliens while you're still at low levels with no cash.  At that point it is literally impossible to win.  Definitely look up a couple of FAQs before you start, so you can avoid this.Pros:- Absolutely, utterly, everything else.  - The storyline is brilliant.  Intrigue, conspiracy, side-stories that tie in well with the main story, and gameplay and character and facility development that is heavily tied into the storyline. - I was really surprised that the sci-fi alien attack setting was really well done.  Enough human development and intrigue focus that it didn't feel overly 'Star Trek-ky' or anything.- Base and facility development isn't my kind of thing, but it was actually quite enjoyable in this case - more about levelling up aspects of your team than really micro managing everything Sim City style.  There was one thing related to how you level things up to avoid (see above), but otherwise it seemed secondary to the actual missions and battles.- A good amount of variety amongst the types of soldiers you can get, with such different abilities that you really utilise them in different ways.  This really plays up the strategy aspect, as you decide which combinations of soldier types to use each battle.- Having soldiers get injured, so they can't join missions for a while, is a great idea.  It forces you to play with combinations you might avoid otherwise, which adds extra variety and depth to the game.- The abilities... and then the super duper awesome abilities that you won't believe you get later!  (Hint: If you read any FAQs, don't trust them when they say you need to focus on one set of the two super sets of options that come available.  You can afford to invest in both, and it's MUCH more fun to have both).- Quite a good range of mission types and alien types keep the variety going.- Other stuff that I can't remember or can't tell you for spoiler reasons.The cons are pretty big, but you can avoid one if you read up on it a little and reduce the other by getting into regular saving habits.  I did both, and I honestly think XCOM is the best game I've played in years and years.  There are some other great games (like Divinity: Original Sin) that come close, but this edged them out because... it is simply THAT cool.			"

												I'm not a big fan of turn based games. That said, I have immensely enjoyed XCOM Enemy Unknown and its expansion. It took me a good long while to finish and the experience was amazing. In this game you can’t save everyone, so don’t even try. Being inpatient gets you killed and overreaching will result in failure. It is very challenging and addictive, especially on higher difficulty. Even if you have never played a turn based strategy game, this one is definitely worth a try.			"

												XCOM:EU was an excellent game, but lacking in some refinement. XCOM:EW fixed all of that. What an amazing upgrade. The extra mission types, the added modifications on the soldiers. I wish we had more choices for armor and colors and a few cosmetic things of that nature, as well as more localized languages and the like, but wow what a great game. I am enjoying it immensely.			"

												XCOM: EU/EW is gonna make you mash the load last save button countless times, one of the best turn based games I've played that's entirely based on strategy. I don't see the hit % as RNG as many players do; instead I look it as a mere tool that makes you rethink your strategy until you're sure to engage in combat no matter the odds. Don't get attached to your soldiers, you'll regret it later.[✔]> good replay value (+mods)> lengthy campaign> no mistake is forgiven> relevant difficulty slider> soldier customization> well optimized[✘]> lack of coop content> bugs occur sometimes			"

												Never having played the original XCOMs, I got my newbie butt handed to me more than once during my playthrough of this, and it was great fun even when I kept losing to my own silly mistakes.The game is fairly straightforward and simple to begin with and naturally dives into more difficult territory later on. I played it without the expansion my first time through, not to get overwhelmed with research, engineering, and options. And for me that was definitely the best thing to do, because the base game has droves of stuff in it to keep you invested.The hours flew by like so many overconfident Interceptors and pregnant Skyrangers birthing my soon-to-be-sorry-or-promoted Alien Death Squads of dashing, grenade-tossing, laser-wielding soldiers onto the battlefield, again and again. Good times.If you have a hard time grasping WHY a certain action is better than another, watch the brilliant Youtube videos of Beaglerush playing it on Ironman Impossible. You will still mess up at times, but just watching a few minutes of those videos took the game from being ""pretty cool"" to being ""an absolute joy to play and finish"". I'm looking forward to crush (and being crushed by) my alien friends in Enemy Within (and, heaven forbid, The Long War mod).So, what are you waiting for? Earth needs you, soldier, get ready to flan-...I said flank! Not you, the assault guy, not the...Oh dear, not more enem- Okay, he's gone, rookies are cheap so I don't care, now what do I have left to work wit- ANOTHER ONE!?

Just one more. You got this.			"

												One intense strategy game right here. Researching new technologies, leveling up your squadmates, expanding your base of operations, and even aiding other nations means there's a lot to do in this game. You also have some deep gameplay where you have to utilize cover as much as possible to insure that your squad makes it out in one piece, because once a squad member is dead, Scream in horror as your lovingly crafted squad of four brave men and women get gunned down time and time again by E.T. and his angry siblings. Giggle hysterically as a group of anorexic lizard people give your allies the plague and they collapse around you, gasping their last, pus filled breath. Roar in outrage as that ♥♥♥♥ing bug thing that just took at least 20 rockets stabs your best marine and turns them into a mindless zombie, which will decimate your entire team all by itself. After another successful mission out in the field, losing all of your squad, failing a mission to defend an entire continent, causing half of earth to be under occupation of an alien menace, head back home to sit in your concrete bunker with pride, as you watch agent 47 grill you about how ♥♥♥♥ you are at this game, then shut down your base.

												Probably one of the best, if not THE best turn-based tactics games out there. Before I start with the good, I think I should look at the bad.First thing that comes to my mind for what's bad about this game is its value for money. The Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 have what's essentially a Game of the Year edition (dubbed XCom Enemy Within: Commander Edition) which comes with the base game, the Elite Soldier cosmetics, the Slingshot Pack, and Enemy Within, all for an MSRP of how much you'd pay for the base game on Steam. Because of this, you're better off waiting until March 4 for the Complete Edition (Essentially the Commander Edition for PC)Another issue i have with this game is that it does not illustrate your soldiers' line of sight. More often than not, I found myself moving a soldier to a piece of cover where I would think has a good shot at an alien, though I end up wasting his or her turn due to a lack of line of sight. This is even more of a nuisance for players who enjoy using Snipers with the early-game Squadsight ability.And now for the good: While it's a difficult game in its own right, it certainly has enough content for several playthroughs. While you may get intimidated by the fact that you're often outgunned, you'll learn to get used to the combat. However, shooting aliens is only half of the game.The other half of the game consists of the XCOM Headquarters, where you will need to research new technologies, arm both your soldiers and aircraft, shoot down UFOs, and manage global panic. Oh, and because you'll find yourself dealing with simultaneous abduction events, you'll find yourself having more problems with global panic than the actual combat, but this doesn't necessarily make the game unfair, as the resources to maintain panic are reasonably accessible.The final verdict: GET THIS GAME			"

												It has been a long time but Xcom is back. Still a third person strategy game. Compared to the original there is a lot less to manage at your xcom base and mission preperation. Feeling a bit dumbed down but much easier for new players. I welcome the change but could of had a bit more options at the xcom base. Character customization is nice but could of had some more options. Combat and gameplay is extremely crisp and fun. If you are not in cover and flanking correctly you are getting your♥♥♥♥♥toasted. Enemy designs are spot on sounds and wepons sound energized! This xcom offers difficulty modes which further help new players to the series get accustomed and vets get their♥♥♥♥♥♥wet with unforgiving difficult. 2K continues to uphold excellent 50's themed games and makes me wish I lived back in that time period spot on clothing and areas. There is a decent amount of gameplay here but you are punished for taking your time getting some requirements for other missions and taking every side mission for extra xp and items. Feeling like you are on a timer the whole time you will feel rushed half way through the game ruining the experience. There are very little cutscenes though the ones that are there are perfectly fine. I will say this is the worst ending to a modern gen game I have ever witnessed. After everything me and my crew went through for a 10 second ending. YES A 10 SECOND ENDING. I felt slapped in the face. Makes Mass Effect 3 forgivable. In the end Xcom enemy unknown leaves you wanting more in every area of the game. A decent start to bring the franchise back but they need to do a lot of work to the next game to restore its place among the best strategy gamesFinal Score 7.25/10			"

Summary“That's XCOM, baby!”ReviewXCOM is a game that tests your understanding of probabilities.  If you think it should be impossible to miss three 75% chance shots in a row, or that a 95% chance is a guaranteed hit, then you're going to have a bad time.  This is a game that will punish you for your mistakes, mercilessly grind your successes under its heel, and basically conspire to beat you at every turn, leading to a tense, addictive experience that will knock you down and keep you coming back for more.  It works because while the game is brutal, it's fair, which has inspired fans of the series to coin the phrase, “That's XCOM, baby!”The premise is this: the earth has been invaded by extraterrestrials, and in keeping with the trope, they are aggressive and more technologically advanced than us mere humans.  The XCOM project is an international organization, and you, as its commander, are given the unenviable task of protecting earth from the hostile invaders.  Failure to diligently carry out this objective will result in member nations panicking and pulling funding, which means fewer resources at your disposal and eventually defeat if enough nations leave you high and dry.Gameplay happens in two phases: base management and missions.  Your base is depicted in a really cool cutaway view, showing your facilities deep underground.  While it's not the most functional presentation, the attention to detail is amazing, and you can zoom right in close and see what your personnel are up to.  It's purely cosmetic because all of the real work happens in menus, but it's still fun.During the base management phase, you can visit the “Situation Room” to get an overview of how close member nations are to panicking, assign research and construction tasks to your science and engineering staff, maintain your fleet of interceptor aircraft and satellites, hire new recruits, customize and train your soldiers, and expand your facilities.  It's a balancing act because you have limited resources, and each task takes a period of time to complete, so it's important to prioritize your most critical tasks first.Once you've organized everything to your satisfaction, you head to Mission Control and click “Scan For Activity” which advances time, completing your various projects and discovering alien activity around the globe.  Sometimes there will be multiple simultaneous attacks, but since you can only respond to one of them, you again have to balance various considerations, such as the expected difficulty of the mission, what sort of rewards you will receive upon successful completion, and how close each nation is to bailing on you.  This is when the real fun begins as you dispatch your troops to deal with the alien menace.Before launching a mission, you have one last chance to fine-tune your roster of soldiers (initially four, but you can eventually have up to six) and their equipment, and then it's time to head out to the field.  Missions take place in a three-quarter perspective turn-based arena with you and the aliens alternating turns, and each unit gets two actions per turn (however, using a weapon will end that soldier's turn even if it's their first action).  This is a perfect realization of Firaxis' “less is more” game design philosophy, because each action you take carries so much weight, and it keeps the pace of battle fast and exciting.  Some people criticize this portion of the game, saying that it's too easy to leapfrog your soldiers from cover to cover, putting them in “Overwatch” which gives them a free shot if the enemy moves into their line of fire, and simply waiting for the aliens to come to you, but this isn't necessarily the best or most effective strategy.  Sometimes you need to be more aggressive, especially during abduction missions where you have to kill the aliens faster than they can kill innocent civilians; then there are the time-limited “meld” canisters you'll want to collect which appear as part of the Enemy Within expansion (which I strongly recommend).  Furthermore, “Overwatch” comes with a to-hit penalty, so there's no guarantee you'll take down the enemy anyway, and even with your most carefully laid plans, things can fall apart in spectacular ways, leading to your soldiers being injured – meaning they'll be out of action until they've healed – or, worse, killed.  It's amazing just how quickly the tables can turn, so it's always important to stay on your toes because sometimes even a single mistake can cost you the mission.As your soldiers participate in – or perhaps I should say survive – missions, they gain experience and are randomly given a specialty such as sniper, support, heavy, and so on.  As they continue their careers, you can choose from a variety of special abilities like smoke grenades to make it harder for your enemies to draw a bead on your troops, or allowing your sniper to target any enemies within another soldier's line of sight.  You can even customize your troopers' appearance, nationality, the color of their uniforms, what sort of head gear they wear from full battle helmets to stylish fedoras, and even give them personable nicknames.  All of this is ultimately a cruel tease, however, because it seems like just as you start to become attached to your individualized soldiers, they get brutally killed in a hail of gunfire and their names enshrined on the Memorial Wall where you can revisit your depressing failures whenever you want.Ultimately, XCOM is a vicious slog to your own inevitable defeat at the hands of a superior foe – there's a reason the sequel takes it as a given that the humans lost the war – yet despite it all, I love this game.  As I said earlier, it's brutal but fair.  Yes, there are times you're at the mercy of the “random number generator” gods, but the majority of the time, if you lose, it's your fault.  The reason people think the game cheats is because they remember their losses, like that time they missed two 95% chance shots in a row (and, yes, that is statistically possible), but they forget their wins, like the time they took a desperate gamble on a 40% shot and got a lucky critical.  That's XCOM, baby!The presentation is excellent with attractive, detailed visuals and solid sound design.  I especially like the “action cam” that is occasionally triggered during missions and gives you a ground-level view of one of your soldiers taking out an alien (or alternatively, an alien taking out one of your soldiers), or showing one of your troopers kicking down a door or vaulting over a counter.  It's a nice touch and happens infrequently enough not to wear out its welcome.  On the Linux side, Feral once again has done an excellent job giving us Linux fans another top-notch game.I would also strongly recommend buying the Enemy Within expansion.  This is a proper, old school expansion pack rather than a soft sequel in that the new features are seamlessly incorporated into the base game.  You get access to more soldier upgrades, more maps, more missions, more enemies – basically a more complete and fleshed out XCOM experience.Good luck, Commander.			"

												Remake of one of the best games ever made!Xcom is an isometric 3D  strategy game with turn-based combat. It has streamlined or removed some aspects of the original game, for better or worse. To me the changes are mostly all positive. Game still feels familiar enough to appeal to many of the veterans. Xcom gameplay consists of two parts, the tactical combat on the field and little bit of base management. In base management you get limited options to build laboratories, workshops, power generators, satellite uplinks etc. with their different benefits. You can purchase different kind of perks with games currency, you can research new tech, manufacture new items and gear in engineering and sell items you acquire on missions on black market. The combat itself is really fun, you have different classes of soldiers and you can level them up by completing missions and shooting up aliens. With levels (promotions) you can choose one of two special abilities depending on your soldiers class. Different classes are sniper, support, assault and heavy. There is a multiplayer option but it's a bit lacking. You can only play 1vs1 matches with your custom made squads. Somekind of co-op would be nice. Firaxis games really is the master of turn-based strategy with Xcom and Civilization. I recommend everyone to get the expansion pack Enemy Within, even for the first playthrough. Since it doesn't add new campaign but implements new storyline in the orginal games campaign. It also comes with new tech and some new enemies. Another recommendation would be playing with Iron man mode on, when every death of your squad is permanent. Since then game autosaves and you cant save manually. It really adds some great tension to the game.An amazing reimagining of a classic that works really well either on keyboard and mouse or a gamepad![Score: 95]			"

												As turn based strategy games go, XCOM is a fun one. Aliens have invaded, and it is up to your secret military organisation to kick them off this rock. And you do that with a combination of clever tactics, superior firepower, autopsy reports, and interrogations.As you capture and torture more alien visitors, and as you study more of their tech, you can seriously upgrade Earth's defenses. For example, at the start of the invasion, you have fighter jets, with basic missiles. Later on, your pilots are flying the Firestorm, highly advanced fighter ship which is more or less alien in origin, and can be equipped with such awesome firepower as the plasma cannon, or the fusion lance.Your weapons and armour similarly are upgraded as you progress through the research tree, starting with basic weapons as you might find these days, upgrading to lasers, and then plasma weapons.So, what are you waiting for? Go kick some alien butt.			"

												I have mixed feeling about XCOM. As a gamer who played games in early 90s allready and played the first XCOMs when those were brand new. After i played Enemy Unknown i had a feeling that this isnt what i expected.I bought XCOM long time ago and i must say that i found the price of the DLC outrageous later, especially because it actually added what i expected to be in the base game. Since this experience i dont buy brand new games until they have expansions out and they have GOTY or complete packs available. I miss the 90s and early 2000s when internet not existed or was used only by the minority of the population, because game DEVelopers had only one chance to release their product so they released complete products. Nowadays none of the AAA games complete, if i play any of them i have empty feelings, i feel that something is missing, in sequels i have a feeling that ""omg this was in previous version, why not in this"" ofc those coming with DLCs but this feeling ruins my entertainment.In this case i missed that aliens dont invade my base and a few other things, dont missunderstand that, the game was ok, but when my first playthrough ended, i was like: ""ok, that was it? hmmmm am i rushed through or really that was it?""Do i recommend the base game? yes, if you not played any original XCOM game, but if you dont own the game i suggest the complete pack with DLC (i still find it outrageous that complete pack cheaper than buying the DLC for those who bought the game before, i promised, because of this, that ill never buy DLC but suddenly i got it as gift).Do i recommend the game with DLC? yes, its awesome, no emptyness feelings, the game got what should have been at release, this what we should have gotten for the price of an AAA game.The game is pretty hard and challenging, i liked it, need to plan every movement of your units, i felt some classes are useless, i actually preferred only support and snipers for my crew because supports can explore area and avoid getting hit with ligthning reflexes while exploring and snipers can eliminate enemies from long and safe distance.Base Game: 3/10 for me at least, its my opinion.Game with DLC: 10/10 original XCOM feeling, i wasnt able to stop while i played.I encountered still a few BUG in the game but usually quiting game and reloading fixed those, so nothing serious.

												This game really is not anywhere near as good as people think it is. I would promise you that at least 90% of the people who have praised this game have not actually played it in a true Ironman and Classic playthrough. And I want to make two poiints here: Why the game fails as a game, and why it fails as an XCOM game.Why it isnt an XCOM game:This game is simple, and by that I mean REALLY simple. Xcom enemy Unkown plays like a really old board game(think Monopoly/Risk), the ruleset is extremely simplistic and leave such a large gab to chance that almost all decisions you make are irelevant.Most people(even those who dislike this game) do not seem to understand this as they complain about 'bugs' that cause shooting through walls, floors, and other things. If you actually play this game and look at the ruleset applied it becomes clear that those were never bugs or oversights, this is simply how this game works. 'Props/Cover/objects/ground' never exists in this game, it all applies a very Warhamer/LOTR/40k logic, but simplified: If you have line of sight on an enemy you can shoot at it, only you and the object matter, the hit calculation is PURELY created by the different effects on a unit.(aka, if he is in cover you get -40% on the hit chance. What is the cover and how is it actually position and what about the 5 other things obscuring the view? Like I said, board game logic.As such the shooting through a wall was never a bug, it simply is that the ruleset has no consideration for anything but the 3 or so objects used in the calculation.(That is why there is no free shooting, 'bullets' do not exist, that is why explosions always do the same damage, through walls or not through walls. That is why all cover works in a very binary state of existing or not existing.)Why am I rambling on this? The people who played the old Xcoms and say this has the spirit of xcom are utterly wrong, Xcom (as silly as it sometimes was) was in a way  a simulation. It tried to ""simulate"" squad combat, based on a ruleset that was as 'reaslitic' as would be possible while being fun. If you looked at something and thought about how it would work based on your reasoning then most of the time  it would react the way you expected it to. Bullets would travel, if they missed or were shot at a bad angle they would travel in an angle away from where it meant to go, if the bullet hit an object it would damage or destroy the object, an explosion would damage objects, if the bullet can travel the path and is shot in the correct angle it WILL travel the path. Expectations were formed on your understanding of how things would interact, not simply by the very (often binnary) ruleset given to you.This game has nothing to do with XCOM besides the skin and that both are a Turned based strategy, their fundemantal game design is different and as such it fails to be an XCOM game.Why is it a bad game even on its own terms?As said, it plays like a board game would, which can be fine, I like board games...It plays like a bad board game.A board game will give the player a defined set of rules the player has to adapt to in order to overcome a certain problem. Almost any board game ever will be forced to fall back to the concept of luck as certainty on everything will become boring.But the job of any good game is to give the player a multitude of meaningful obtions for allow him to minize the randomness of the dicethrow to such a level that he can confidently predict the outcome based on the rulest the game uses.This game fails to do that across the board.Why? Because just about every single thing you can do has simply has far too little actual impact on the game. Cover can either lower your chance to be hit by 20%, or 40%. Which might not sound like so little but considering that the whole game is cenetered around the concept of cover and by extension of it flanking, it means that flanking is not a nessesary move, cover simply isnt reliable as it is. Compared to other such games(Warhamer/LOTR/40k) where a wall would be a wall and it would give you 100% cover, and flanking it would give you 100% more of a chance to hit.(small cover would amount to something akin to 50%)Add to it that just about every unit in this game has 60 to 75% aim, and the fact that the 20% and 40% is a simple reduction(not a multiplcation or such, simply: 75% is your aim, -40% is cover, 35% chance to hit. And 1 hit mostlikely means dead) and you quickly find out that hiding behind a wall has very little actual power, at which point it becomes clear that  the direction of engagment is rather a minor detail.What about height?Well, the game gives you a set boon for being 'above' an enemy, but do to its very simplistic nature that 'Above' is often rather wonky.An enemy can be in 'high' cover, getting a 40% defense boon while being two floors below you(meaning you could easily shoot over their 'high' cover as it is not as tall as the object you are standing on) While you are in 'low' cover, still two floors higher.In the end you will both have the same odds of hitting each other and even if you have 'high' cover while being on a roof, all you got is an extra 20% hit chance.Do you see the general theme? Anything and everything you do moves the hit chances up or down by such minute amounts that they really have very little impact. Throw a smoke granade(of which you got 1 per mission in early game) and you get 20% more cover for two turns. In what sitersations is a 20% shift really that important?Because often those 20% is all you can change when it comes to winning or losing your 10 hour long campaign.The dice throwing is also made much worse by the fact that all engagments are very small scale, while in a game like Warhamer you would throw 30 dice and 30 units, you throw 5 or 6 here, of which any can decide the whole game. The more dice the more likely things will even out to be reasonable odds, here they never do.So, playing this game pretty much amounts to playing a extremely simple(to the extent of being almost completely binary in logic) board game that doesnt even have the curtesy to let you infulence it. It gives you a lot of strategic options but most of them will have such minor impacts on the dicethrows that the most important strategic advice for this game is 'never trigger more then one group at a time'(As implied by that, the game is also full of really bad design decisions which I won't even touch on as those are commenly complained about)Besides that it is worthy to note that big oversights were never fixed in this game even though the expansion 'fixes' it. The example being that there is no button to easily disarm all your troops so you can re-equipt things.(Which is a UI oversight and should have been patched, not an expansion feature).Look at Xenonauts, look at this and give it some thought, you'll figure out why I called this game 'simple' and a 'bad board game'.

												While I am a HUGE fan of the original game, Enemy Unknown/Within is absolutley a worthy successor to the franchise.  There are some major changes from the original game, but they all make sense and really benefit the game overall.  If you are looking for a fantastic strategy game that is relentlessly tense and addicting, look no further. XCOM is one of the best games of the past 8 years and one of my favorite strategy games of all time.			"

												Let's talk about ""Enemy Within"", shall we?With the Enemy Within supplement/DLC, the flaws of the XCOM game are addressed, and it finally becomes what it deserved to be: a really great, turn-based strategy game.In its original form, there weren't enough maps, and the missions felt samey: a repetitive grind to build a party that could take out the alien invaders main ships. The improved game introduces Exalt, a group of UFO cultists who are working to undermine the XCOM project and bring the aliens to Earth. The cultists are not very powerful, but they provide some much-needed variety. With the DLC in place, XCOM is complete, and it's worth playing. Buy the whole bundle in a sale.Replay value is limited, as the story will always evolve the same way, but it's a good story, and some of the additions (like where your base gets attacked) elevate it from 'nice idea' to really nice game. It's surprising that 'Enemy Unknown' came out wih so little variety (shot down UFOs always find a wooded area to crash in?) but that problem is a thing of the past. Get 'Enemy Within' and you'll be a very happy Earthling.			"

												""XCOM: Enemy Unknown"" is an eligible descendant of a blockbuster strategy series ""UFO"". It responds to roots with piety and conscience. Yet, it's a completely different game - and I think I know the reason. It is a victim of new age in game design. A casualty of ""fit to casuals"" tendency.If you want a clear picture, imagine a cute girl. She was born to sweet-hearted and smart parents. She is nice by nature, as they say. She has no problems with seducing almost every guy in her class. And then she goes to high school, where somebody occasionally points to our girl that she is too fat to be popular. Or too witty. Whatever. Our girl is too good to not abide those stupid marketing rules. And then comes diet. No fat. No protein. No books. Only to look ""decent"" compared to the so-called high school elite.See, she's still real pretty. But very skinny too. And she never allows herself to be really clever. Never slips more-than-one-word-a-second from her mouth. She doesn't smile now.Or maybe she doesn't smile just for me? Let's take a closer look at her.First thing we see is a very cunning make-up. Visuals and sounds are great, all those movie-type cut scenes in game are fascinating, and some of them bringing good memories for those who have seen the original UFO game.Next thing we'll be involved is a sharp turn-based shootout with unknown lifeforms, rational and deadly. We gotta think tactical to overcome it, one wrong step and your soldier will die in vain, making others stunned and shocked, just to be shot in the next turn.Those two parts, visuals and chess-like tactical shootouts are dominant. A primo. Sales hook. Love the game for those - and you won't be disappointed. But if you are a geek like myself or just remember good old UFO ... let's go further.Next, we see a kind of a micromanagement system, a strategic part of game. There come the bad signs. See, economical part of ""XCOM: enemy unknown"" is anything but realistic. It's manageable, balanced... but dull and frustrating. Most players will spend more time personalizing suits of every soldier in squad than in ""strategic"" part of game.Next… we see restrictions. The most powerful military alliance in the world have only one transport plane, for six soldiers maximum. So if aliens are striking in three places, we can secure only one of them. Two others will be infected. That’s cadaverous feature, reflecting to both size of invasion in contrast to human forces AND modern gamedev tendency to ""make moral choices”. X-com organization can deploy only one aircraft at the time to shoot even a Battleship or Carrier type UFO. Only if it will be shot down, they let you send another… but even a heaviest UFO can outfly our interceptors. X-com can’t directly hire engineers and scientists – it relies on small grants from council from time to time. .. And so on, and so forth… So. It can’t be compared with previous games ‘cause they're still way ahead in all terms, except for graphics quality.But, returning to our girl portrait, maybe she still deserves to be loved, if only for small things? Not exactly. Her flaws are not brackets that can be turned down sometime. It’s in the thinking. A new age child, never heard of ""Depeche Mode"". 21st century big media project. That’s not something you'll want to spend life on. All she wants from you is a decent lunch in restaurant, sweet talk with her … and she’ll spend a night with you. Maybe even a week or month – she’s still a good girl from good parents, remember? But no love. No hard feelings. As SWAT says, “we move in, and we move out”.It’s not a game “from fans to fans, 4 fun”. It’s a product. AAA Product. Fine by looks, working well for its price, engaging at multiplayer… but definitely not a sleep-taker. Not a masterpiece. Pompous and shiny money-taker, that’s my decision. 7.5 out of 10.			"

												X-Com Enemy Unknown is a rare type of game that only come's around once in awhile. It is gripping, crafty, and terrifying. An engrossing, deep turnbased combat game, married neatly with a real time strategic base mechanic makes this one of the standout titles of 2012.   X-Com is a successor of the classic X-com titles from the mid to late 90's. While this new title has been developed by a differrent company, Firaxis, they have managed to preserve what was so enthralling about X-Com and the alien threat. With a new engine,powered by Unreal Engine 3, Firaxis brought X-Com to a new generation with slick graphics and fresh gameplay.    X-Com has two main layers. The first is the ""meat"" of the game, which is the tactical combat. Players are tasked with squads between 4 to 6 elite soldiers, each with varying skills and abilities that are unlocked as they get kills and survive more missions. A range of custumizable options are in the game, such as changing their appearance or names, and choosing different skills as they become available. On the battlefield players are faced with the ever imposing alien threat, which is intelligent and ruthless. The aliens have many different species, which act as the classes. From the lowly sectoid to the fearsome muton, players will be constantly challenged with ever increasing numbers and powers. All the aliens feel very distinct, and the ai does avery good job of keeping players on their toes. They will use any advantage they can get,be it suppression and flanking, or simply ganging up on one man, and will remorselessly destroy the unprepared squad. Thankfully X-Com has a few tricks of their own. As players progress, new armour and weapons become available, such as the S.H.I.V, a mobile weapons platform that replaces a soldier in the field and can act as agressive mobile cover, or the skelton suit, which allows soldiers to use a grapple hook to reach elevated positions. Perfect for getting that sniper in for the kill. Late game will players will see even more advanced alien technologies be adapted for your soldiers use, and even delve in to phsycic abilities.      The second layer of X-Com is the base management. This is where players are tasked with monitering global panic, issuing promotions to vetrans, researching alien technologies, and contructing a fortified base from which to launch operations. It is here that all new weapons and tactics become available, so it is crucial to manage X-Com's limited resources wisely, as one mistake could leave you  without the proper weapons or technology to survive the increaing alien menace. As permadeath is in the game, players must strive to keep their soldiers equipped with the latest and greatest if they hope to achieve victory. Missions will occur at random and vary from seek and destroy, a timed bomb diffusal in which the player must find and diffuse bombs scattered around the map before an alotted amount of turns, to Vip escorts. Each mission takes place on a randomly chosen map, so no two playthroughs are the same.   X-Com Enemy Unknown is a a fantastic title that will challenge and entertain, and I highly recommend to all types of gamers.			"

												An amazing tactical game, with plenty of strategic gameplay as well!Tactical aspect of the game is top-notch, with a huge variety of maps to fight at. And as XCOM features humanity’s struggle against a “coalition” of invading alien species, the enemies you face highly vary in both abilities and tactics. Similarly your own soldiers belong to one of four distinct classes, each with different set of perks that determine soldier’s role in battle – and being able to choose between two perks at most ranks give further customization to your soldiers within given class.Tactical battles aside, the game features strategic gameplay as well: between battles you research new technologies, build up your base, plan your satellite network to minimize panic spreading across the world, and overall decide where to apply your very limited funds.Graphics is astonishing: both environment and character models are very well designed, and game provides a lot of cinematic-esque close up shots on characters to show that off.In short, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a must-have for anyone who likes tactical games!

												In a nutshell, this is the best turn-based strategy game. If you like the genre, you must play XCOM. Your mission, as the commander, is to lead the troops who will save the world against alien invasion. Plan your moves throughly if you want to succeed. You have micro and macro management to consider if you want to maximize the odds. Yes a 99% chance shot can miss and you will learn it the hard way. It is specially true if you play in ironman mode which is at the end of the day, the only way to play the game. Reloading a savegame is like cheating. If you think you master everything, play the longwar mod for extra content and duration. But now it is time for me to move to XCOM 2...			"

This one did it right and should be considered to be one of the best games out there. The DLC Enemy Within is a must-have DLC! It completes the game!

												First up. I have never played a strategy game that I really liked. I got this for free when I pre-ordered Bioshock Infinite, along with Civ 5 on GmG. I tried Civ 5 first, but really couldn't get into it at all. So I am only now giving this game a fair chance. I literally said to my best friend that this was the last strategy game that I was going to play if I didn't like this one.This game though...This game is great! I can't fault it so far. It sort of feels like a game of chess in a lot of ways. Nice graphics and art style too. Actually, the visuals and music remind me of Deus Ex, which is great. It sounds like the same composer to me.There are also a lot of familiar voices, which is actually kind of distracting, because I am trying to figure out where I know the voice from and not concentrating on what they are saying...The council guy sounds like the narrator from Screenjunkies 'Honest Trailers' lol (It IS him!) :DHaha, and I guessed the other one right too! It's the Dharma Initiative guy from LOST! :DHa! again! It is the Deus Ex Human Revolution composer too! :DAnyway, the gameplay and strategy elements are very engaging. You need to plan your moves and take good advantage of cover while getting your squad into position.Then there are squad member promotions, weapons upgrades etc. which offer some interesting choices. The engineering and research aspects are very interesting too. You need to prioritise what to develop, research, build etc.At certain points you have to choose where to go and who to help, which causes panic levels to go up in the regions you don't help. So you have to manage panic levels too.There is a lot going on here, a lot of re-playability, and very satisfying gameplay. I am finding it quite addictive so far and I am glad that I have finally found a strategy game that I like. This is definitely helped by the way the game is designed and the intuitive, easy to learn UI, which is a big reason why I haven't liked other strategy games that I have played.So yeah, very cool game so far.

												The true beauty of this game comes from renaming your soldiers after your friends and watching them die because of your recklessness.That aside, it's a pretty darn good turn-based tactical RPG. It's pretty challenging if you don't know what you're doing even on the Normal difficulty.  The second wave feature adds a bit of spice to the challenge if you feel like you are up for it; don't forget Ironman mode to keep you from save scumming! The game lacks variety in the type of units available but it makes up for that with good amounts of customizability options such perks, guns and armor with various effects. It can make each soldier a bit unique from the rest. Just remember, rookies are disposable.At a(n) graphical/aesthetic standpoint, it presents XCOM in an appealing way that even newcomers to the franchise can enjoy. The music keeps the situation tense and engaging during fights and helps deliver the needed ambience outside of it.All in all, Do I recommend it? Of course.			"

												Very very very very fun game! Played on the hardest difficulty, and i rather enjoyed it quite alot. If you want to suceed early on in this game, you want to make the most satelites as possible, and the best aircraft as soon as possible, otherwise, if you dont have a satelite over that section, then you can possibly lose them in the Xcom project. The overall turn based stratergy/rpg is very fun. Would recomend to everyone.9/10ENjoy ^-^			"

												I am usually not a huge fan of tactical turn based strategy, but this game might have just changed my mind on that. Beautiful looking game. Really fun and insanely addicting. This game does almost everything right, and the things it gets wrong you can forgive because the game is so darn fun.			"

												XCOM : Enemy Unknown is a turn based 3D top-down shooter based on a grid system with RPG elements thrown into the mix.The approach this game has taken seems a little more unique than other turn based combat games. It's a turn based chess match that goes on between you and the computer. Throughout the game you command a base and can research aliens for better technology or understanding, add new departments/building to the base that in turn effect production or improve fire power, and train new units. Such things like plasma snipers that are much more accurate, or jet packs to move efficiently. This is essentially the RPG element that adds an extra depth to the game without it jumping simply level to level. Not all technologies are guaranteed to be studied or recovered. If you do too much damage to an alien, you can very well destroy the body and the weapon. When pursuing the aliens, you have the option to choose which country to intercept them in. Obviously depending on who you've helped will determine their stance with the XCOM organization. Every time you end your turn, there could be an invasion, it could simply stay quiet, or there could be a chance for one of your fighter planes to intercept an alien craft. In-game when fighting, you have the basic choice to move a character, tell them to take cover and keep their head down, attack, or be prepared to attack a moving target. The lastly mentioned option is extremely helpful when making advancements in dangerous or unknown areas. The game does a great job notifying you of movement patterns and the amount of cover available at certain areas. Graphics are absolutely on point when it comes to this game. It's not the greatest or finest of graphics, but their choice of style absolutely goes with their theme. Sounds are appropriate for the setting, and sounds of aliens can be heard. If they are heard, characters do react to that sound. I must commend the guy who did the camera angles in this game, absolutely well done. The camera zooms in and let's you see (over the shoulder) what the characters see. Overall a good game and can be very difficult at times if you make the wrong move (so save a lot with multiple slots)! It was a fun game but I felt after playing a good campaign there wasn't much else to play. Challenging a buddy to a shooting chess match is always fun though.For what it's worth, I hate turn based games. I managed to make it through this one and actually came back to finish it.

												XCOM—Enemy Unknown is the best turn-based game about immigration. How should we treat the immigrants? Should we kill them?Your immediate response may be: “We should not kill all the immigrants.” Understandable pity. But what if the immigrants are destroying our cities via their plasma weapons? This game, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, answers that question; in such a case, we must create a multi-national, multi-gender special forces group with which to kill the disgusting invaders.You see, in the game the aliens enter our atmosphere--UNINVITED--and start stealing our women and shooting our men. And for this reason, the commando organization is made--XCOM. XCOM’s elite soldiers fly to the gas stations and grocery stores and office buildings of our pure Earth, in their jet-version of the V-22 osprey, and shoot the aliens. It is..beautiful. Like Mozart.I love how the game slows down whilst you see an alien take its final bullet, no longer able to withstand human fire. Do you know the film The Matrix? Of course you do. Imagine, though, that instead of Neo dodging bullets, it is outer space foreigners slowly getting torn to pieces by our Made on Earth bullets; the yellow, green blood spewing from the bodies. Cross over the ozone layer without a valid passport now, alien! Oh! You can't? Why? Is it because you are dead?But it doesn’t stop with bullets. XCOM eventually gives your troops laser and plasma weaponry, which replace your metal rounds. And they are worth it, so worth it. The laser and plasma are red, green, and bright. They make the killings like Christmas Eve at night. I actually get the shivers thinking about it. Mmmm, yes. I have..so many memories of the glow, bursting through immigrant bodies. I love to just...close my eyes, and conjure up memories from this game. They are so beautiful.I almost forgot the explosives. Grenades and rockets fling the xenos’ bodies like rag dolls. Unfortunately, though, the game doesn’t slow down and focus the camera on their flying corpses.You can also capture the aliens alive. Three times you HAVE to do this. I didn't like those parts.If you decide to get this game, you should do so right before a vacation begins. I couldn’t stop..hunting after it began. ALSO, you should get the Enemy Within DLC with the base game. Doing so will let you turn your troops into large, mutilated, killer robots. They lose their humanity, yes, but that’s okay; it helps you kill aliens at a faster rate, and with greater force.If XCOM’s aliens came in peace, then I guess it would be okay not to kill them all. But as the game shows, the aliens do not come in peace. When the real aliens land on our planet and start taking away our jobs, we should follow XCOM's example.9/10			"

 A masterpiece and a leap forward for the turn based strategy genre Title: XCOM Enemy unknownGenre: Strategy, Turn based strategy , Aliens.Developer: FiraxisPublisher: 2K games The Story: The plot is simple.Aliens are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and want to invade our planet to experiment on humans, after that take over the planet and terminate all resistance.You are the commander of a global Elite defenseforce called the XCOM project. Your job as commander is to exterminate all alien threats. Chase them away from the earth. You have some advisors with you. The Chief engineer , the Chief researcher who give you explainations to what is happening and sometimes give commentary and tips. And officer Bradfort. AKA captain obvious.Find the aliens, cature or kill them, research their bodies, use their own technolagie against them, wipe them out and send them back to where ever they came from. Simple but greatly executed in this game. The gameplay:  This is a turn based strategy game. which means: you take a turn and move your characters, then the enemy does the same. You react to the enemy which keeps it fun and suprising because you dont know where they are based in the beginning. you have to search the area with your soldiers until you run into the aliens. You squad consists of 6 soldiers. (4 at the start of the campaign) and different classes ( Assault, Sniper, Support, Heavy) You can choose who and what you want to take into battle. When you take control of a soldier and move him/her around you have a couple different options. Your soldier can only move a number of tiles every turn. This depends on your soldier's abilities ofcourse. Every class has different abilities and weapons to choose from. Back at base you have a overview of your entire base. Which you can expand underground. you have to be careful with your finances and where you invest them in. You have to research alien technology so you can adapt to the enemy. The mechanics in the game are solid. Customize your squad their abilities the colors the names  its enough to choose from. Its really enjoyable to name the soldiers after your friends and family. You actually care more about your soldiers that way and you mourn them when they die. If you want more custom option there is a DLC pack for more options. Graphics, performance Its nothing really outstanding but it looks great for a turn based strategy game. Im not a huge graphical fanboy but I do appreciate good graphics which this game delivers. dont get me wrong, its not amazing looking but the graphics do the job for making the world seem believable when you are fighting the aliens on random generated maps. The game has some flaws like the turn not ending, but its nothing game breaking. It just works fine with full 60FPS and no stuttering or anything like that. Conclusion & Final verdict This game is a damn well executed turn based strategy game. The mechanics and micromanagement are solid and the game runs well without any issues. It is a remake well done.Everything in this game ranged from great to amazing. I even bought the complete edition with all the expansions. The replay value with this game is great, the story is fine and the battles at higher difficulty asked for a even more careful approach. It gave a fair challenge. For me it was a great time playing this and my final verdict for XCOM Enemy unknown is an amazing 9.5/10 A almost perfect remake  Do you enjoy turn based strategy and tactical combat? Pick this game up. you won't regret it.  Good luck out there Commanders! Want more recommendations? Come see our reviews on our favorite upcoming games!

												I will always have a soft spot for games that are as easy or as difficult as you want them to be. XCOM Enemy Unknown and the expansion Enemy Within are with every single inch of their being, as easy or as difficult as you want it to be.Granted the slower paced combat can be a bit of a slog, doubly so on the larger maps late game but I like the slower paced combat. It lets you carefully consider your options. The only negatives I can think of gameplay wise is that the (starting) continent bonuses are wildly unbalanced against themselves. Also if you get a bad layout of the Geoscape, there's nothing you can do but grit your teeth and get through it.The Geoscape and how you gain resources for it through combat feel very organically linked to one another. I like the gradual ramp up in difficulty. The game isn't going to wait for you to be ready for nasty curve balls if you take too long or if it just decides to throw mission after mission after mission your way. Keeps you on your toes and no two playthroughs will be identical.Oh, and some advice if you're new to the game? Cycle out your soldiers - even if they aren't wounded. You're going to need contingency plans. Lots of them.			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is one of the greatest games I have ever played. I had seen it played through twice on YouTube and thoroughly enjoyed the story.However what made it great for me was the ability to customise soldiers. Creating my own troops gave the game a special edge that made me incredibly invested in it. Knowing the back stories of the people I was playing made me much more motivated to see them succeed, which became incredibly difficult at times as I played it on Ironman mode.I also enjoyed how long the game is, plus the ability to hold off certain events which allowed me to play for as long as I liked before completing it.

												Absolutely LOVE this game. Streamlines many of the micro-management issues from the original 1993 game so has become much easier to learn and play. Later customization options (Second Wave) as well as set difficulty levels allow for lots of re-playability.This is an excellent gaming choice if you are looking for a strategic/tactical game where you are not relying on your reflexes and ability to hit the ""fire"" button before your opponents.

												The true difficulty of this game does not arise from RNG, cheap free moves for aliens or the weight of numbers of the alien assault. It is from the bugs you have to push through to reach the end, particularly the trainwreck of a final mission.Thankfully I'd read enough warnings to know multiple saves were required, saving me from losing all my progress when a bug wrecked a save file close to the end (having already gone through six crashes to the desktop in that one mission).To have such critical errors - including ones reported at least as far back as 2013 -  in a fully-patched game with an expensive expansion pack is not good enough, and nor is 2K's price gouging of Australians.

												Are you and Anime fan or a whovian? Yes? Well here is the game for you:Featuring both England AND Japan you can now dress up your soldiers to be kawaii sugoi Doctors w/ guns! References: Guns(Doctor Who and animes feature guns!), Aliens(Doctor Who and animes feature aliens!) and of course Japan and England.Jokes aside, XCOM: Enemy Unkwown is the newest sequel in a long line of strategy classics.  This time it has been simplified to make it more accessible, or at least that's what everyone says. I can't really confirm that as I haven't played the older titles. Let's see how it holds up to the legacy.Visuals: The game looks very good, especially for a strategy game, however with the visual fedelity of both game and the impressive cutscenes we also have some problems due(probably due the Unreal Engine). Textures load terribly slowly even for the Unreal Engine. The frame rate also seems to suffer due to the engine, however I am not sure about that.Sound: Sound design is actually quite good. Music, sounds, voice acting and of course the general composition of those challenges some AAA movies as it reminds of Alien, and other classics.Gameplay:As already mentioned, gameplay is quite simpe. Now, don't get me wrong XCOM is one of those game that is easy to grasp but you WILL get anal probed trying to master it. As it is a standart TBS you move your soldiers in your turn and get #rekt when the enemies turn comes. You have equipment, a small set of skills and different weapons to fight the ET threat. All quite standart but fan. Maybe you have already guessed but difficulty is kind of a thing in this game. Like in BF3 it's also quite weird. Basicly a ""difficult mission"" can range from ""stomping enemies to the ground"" to actually ""a bit diffucult"", then we have ""very difficult missions"" that can again range from ""this makes me sweat a tiny bit"" to ""oh my god where do those elite mutons come from?"". I would recommend to pick the easy difficulty for unexperienced players, normal for TBS veterans and normal+ for XCOM veterans.Playability:This games biggest problems are it's bugs and the aggro-system. You have multiple game breaking bugs that can scramble saves, block your turn(good luck if you haven't saved), etc. And also quite a few glitches.  What I mean by ""aggro-system"" is the moment in-game where you encounter enemies. That can be random, not only will saving at the beginning of a mission not mean that the enemies come from the same directions(which can be both good and bad), some times you will just be overwhelmed by enemies that throw themselves at you from nowhere.Final Verdict: A fun game when it isn't frustrating as hell. Play this if you are a fan of the originals and want a lighter version, or if you want to get into the genre. I would say that it takes some influence from Starcraft 2, so maybe if you like a combination of SC2s style and a TBS with a faster pacing in a ""Battleground: Earth"" atmosphere then buy this.			"

												Strategy games not your kind of thing? This game will change your mind. It's an extremely fun turn-based strategy game with a cool cinematic action cam (that you can disable if you don't like that sort of thing or if you want to speed up the gameplay a bit). There is also a little bit of ""base management"", where you decide how things operate at your HQ. It fits into the larger theme of this game where choices have consequences. While the game can be challenging, it is definitely not hard to learn. Throughout my entire playing, I never got bored of it because as you progress throughout the game, you get new weapons, new enemies, new abilities, etc. and have to adjust your tactics correspondingly. I only have the base game and no DLC, and I've barely touched the multiplayer (only played a minute or two before I remembered I had to go to work, this game is that addicting!), and I would still nonetheless highly recommend it. I heard the Enemy Within DLC adds a lot to the game.Some minor issues I have with this game is that the user interface seems to be designed with consoles in mind. The camera control is a bit wonky, especially when the camera is backed up against the edge of the map or it's really high up. You can pivot your camera 90 degrees but this only allows 4 different rotations of the camera. Since XCOM 2 is being designed with a focus on PC, these shouldn't be a problem. The text is too big, and generally this isn't a problem UNTIL information boxes that can't fit all the text have it slowly auto-scroll down after a time limit (and they don't let you scroll yourself). Also, another problem with the large text info boxes is that they sometimes get in the way ""free-aiming"". Things like grenades, rockets, and Rift. An example would be this picture: 


XCOM: Enemy Unknown 
A Screenshot of XCOM: Enemy Unknown

You can't see the blue mouse arrow but it is approximately in the center of the circle. Unfortunately, that's overlapping with the text box. Not just that, but ""free-aiming"" can get very difficult to control some times. My recommendation is to just move the mouse slowly.Sometimes you can't see how my red health bars enemies when you're selecting a(n) enemy to fire at and they list hit chance and crit chance. Can be a minor annoyance when you're trying to select the enemy with the most HP to shoot at, or the least or just any certain amount.Trying to finely control elevation can be difficult. I'd say 99% of the time the higher you are, the better (unless doorway arch is blocking your view), but at times I can either choose a fairly low elevation to hover at with my Archangel or Hover SHIV, or go around to the very top of the building (so that you're standing on or hovering above the ceiling), which is definitely not what I want.Selecting teammates who are hovering through clicking on them can be quite difficult (i.e. Archangel armor or Hover SHIV)There also seems to be the rare line-of-sight issue, where you clearly have a direct shot at your enemy but the game doesn't think so, see these 2 pics:


Wut. Looks like they didn't design this level for SHIV

Also, sometimes this game tabs out and switches to my desktop. Not much of a problem because I can switch it back but hopefully this gets fixed in XCOM 2.Not many people seem to play the multiplayer :(I wish there was a way to ""un-equip all"" soldiers so that I wouldn't have to search through my barracks to find who had that last SCOPE or plasma pistol, or whatever piece of gear. I heard this got fixed in Enemy Within though.			"

												This game is pretty much the new gold standard for how to do a remake well: trash all the old annoying stuff, keep what works without gutting the gameplay.Still, I should voice what few nitpicks I have with the game:1.) The UFO interception minigame is hollow2.) The game can often suffer from the 'victory lap' syndrome, where the last half of the game is just you slaughtering everything in your path and building your team for the final mission. 3.) The final mission itself is fun and challenging exactly once. After that, it's just tedious to play through. Like I said, these are nitpicks. This is still one of my favorite games ever, and it'll probably be one of yours too.			"

												If you're ready for your life to be over (at least for a while, we can all stop when we want right?), then give this jawn a shot. Many improbable criticals and flanking shots later, you'll feel the hate flowing through you like a Sithlord. At the same time, nothing beats running your defense force through invaded territory like a xenophobic terrorist. Pull off dirty guerrila warfare strategies against your oppressors by demolishing cover, Scanner-melting faces with headshot lasers and eventually completely out braining the aliens with the latent psychic abilities of your soldiers. And when you lose your carefully personalized soldiers in a cruel and unfortunate twist of fate, you may just hold your own personal funeral for ""CrackShootLiteral"" or ""StraightUpBanger"" in your own domicile, IRL. Ten out of ten for an outstanding and immersive experience.			"

												If you're ready for your life to be over (at least for a while, we can all stop when we want right?), then give this jawn a shot. Many improbable criticals and flanking shots later, you'll feel the hate flowing through you like a Sithlord. At the same time, nothing beats running your defense force through invaded territory like a xenophobic terrorist. Pull off dirty guerrila warfare strategies against your oppressors by demolishing cover, Scanner-melting faces with headshot lasers and eventually completely out braining the aliens with the latent psychic abilities of your soldiers. And when you lose your carefully personalized soldiers in a cruel and unfortunate twist of fate, you may just hold your own personal funeral for ""CrackShootLiteral"" or ""StraightUpBanger"" in your own domicile, IRL. Ten out of ten for an outstanding and immersive experience.			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a tactical round based Strategie Shooter set in the (maybe not so) distant future. You have a team of soldiers and have to complete missions like freeing hostages, destryoing alien ships, killing specific leaders etc. You will be send out to those misisons from your base - a hug eunderground bunker that can be upgraded, enhanced and used for researching aliens and equipement. You will also recruit new soldiers, cure them when they are hit and launch more satelites to get more money. The gameplay is cover & percentage based which means every action you do has a % of succeeding or failing. You can improve your chances, but not having a 100% chance can always result in the death of one of your soldiers. The missions are different and repetetive at the same time, since you basicly always run from one cover to another and shoot at enemeis when possible. Nontheless the overall package is incredibly good. Upgrading your base and soldiers while trying to not let the world fall into panic and trying to leep a positive balance - a real challenge. I enjoyed the game quite much, despite the rising difficluty . I have yet to be able to finish the game, because of a personal problem - i can't let my soldiers die, and i hate failing missions. This made it impossible for me to succeed in the very late game, resulting in me quitting it over and over and over again. Discouraging, but not the games fault.Overall: Fully recommended. The game contains so many hours of good gameplay that it is really worth going for it. I would, however, advise you to buy the full package (Enemy Within) to be able to make full use of it's potential.			"

												As a former Mac user now Linux, I have come to love Feral Interactive. They are responsible for a vast amount of Mac ports, from Borderlands and Deus Ex: Human Revolution to Lego Batman and Worms 3D. The release of the Linux port of XCOM: Enemy Unknown is their first Linux release to date. Feral Interactive's Linux native port stands up well and plays smoothly at the highest settings. This is a very high-quality port and showcases the great work that Feral do. Expext more high quality Linux ports from them!Now more about the game:It's been years since I've played the original XCOM on my 386 computer, but I still vividly remember the hours of fun I had filing my team out of our landing craft to do battle with the alien hordes.While my memory of the specifics of the classic XCOM are a bit hazy, I can tell you that all the major elements that I remember are fully intact in XCOM: Enemy Unknown (XEU). You get to do loads of research between missions, you can scramble jets to intercept UFOs and most of all, you get to send your team all over the world in turn-based combat with the aliens in your patient quest for new technology.Despite the similarities to the original, it is immediately apparent that a lot of thought and polish went into the development of this new game. --Your teammates can go up in rank as they gain more experience. Best of all, more experience means more abilities, but even this is not linear as you are often stuck with a choice of abilities, both almost equally tempting.--Prepare to die a lot, but the Soldier Memorial adds a nice touch and encourages you to be more careful with your strategy to prevent further losses.--Being able to view the ""anthill"" of your base and excavate new areas gives you a great deal of satisfaction between missions.--There are short load screens, but they are integrated so well that you hardly even notice them (in particular the spacecraft cinematic when you fly to or from an engagement).--Having people at headquarters that actually talk to you reminds me a bit of the advisors in the Civilization games.--But perhaps some of my favorite things about XEU, are the global threat alerts and council meetings. Through both of these, you really feel like you are part of a global effort to defeat the aliens, not just America vs the Aliens. As you'll soon find out, aiding other countries is crucial to getting ahead and keeping the aliens at bay.As for negatives, I really have nothing but a nitpicking. The graphics are more practical than they are pretty. You won't be ooh-ing and aah-ing at anything, but at least you'll never mistake an alien for a pile of rubble.One final note, although the game is rated ""M"", my experience (about 5-6 hours worth) has been absolute ""E"", minus a little animated green goo and blood. There is an option to turn off ""squad language"" which is where I imagine the bad language and the ""M"" rating lie. So parents should have no problem with having their kids play this game if it is set up properly.In an age where some developers seem to favor style over substance, it's nice to see a game that remembers its roots. I've put hundreds of hours into ""graphically bland"" games like Civilization, the original XCOM and Final Fantasy Tactics. I foresee that I'll be putting quite a bit of time into this game as well.A must play/buy for all Linux gamers!			"

												Would be a better game over all if you didn't have to deal with conky aiming, like people missing a shot at point blank against a monster 4 feet taller than them, along with spending 30 minutes to an hour trying to complete a mission for the game to crash and not auto save after the mission is completed. Don't get this game, unless you like being stressed out and frustated so bad to the point you want to break your keyboard. I definitely won't be getting X-Com 2. This game has been out for a long time and this issue still isn't fixed..			"

												I'm not a fan of the genre at all, but while it was in free weekend I totally got sucked into this great game.If it has some problems (technical problems and some unbalanced stuff), but it's a ton of fun, even if it is a really difficult game (or at least, for me it was, on the easiest setting).The story isn't interesting but you'll see the real drama during combats, when you lose your precious soldiers.Also, really good effort to make a good-looking tactics game, even if sometimes the camera makes no sense at all.If you missed the free weekend, I reccomend to try the demo.

												A solid rebirth of the classic X-com.  All the gameplay and difficulty of the original with a few added twists and improved graphics and easy to use UI.  The game sports an excellent difficulty progression and speed settings to cater to long or short games.With the additional expansion ""enemy within"" there are interesting and complex maps, new technologies and features and additional missions available.A definite buy for anyone who was a fan of the classic series and a good buy for people who are new to this style of game.

												There are very few games like XCom Enemy Unknown made today. Strategy games apart from sims are far and few between, especially made by AAA studios and publishers. This game was no different, as it took a very long time to get developed since the publisher originally wanted to make it a first person shooter.Instead what we got is a delightful return to form for the series. XCom Enemy Unknown is a game where you play as the commander of a team that specializes in stopping an alien invasion of the planet Earth. The game is a turn based strategy game and heavy in things like cover and approaching carefully. Your squad of soldiers likewise is heavily customizeable, and as you complete more missions they grow identities of their own.What amuses me is how the game likewise punishes you for failure. There's a setting in the game called ""Ironman"" mode which disables quicksaving. What this does is force you to either restart an entire mission from the start, or bite the bullet and move on if one of your favorite squad members dies. Because you can only level up soldiers by completing missions, this mode makes you play extra carefully so you can get everyone out alive.Enemy Unknown is a refreshing change of pace from the nonstop first person shooters we get every few months. A title that injects a little humanity into an otherwise drab and faceless genre. Where your unwilling to make redshirts out of your pawns.			"

The multiplayer mode is poorly balanced and has some bugs, but can be fun. EW expansion is better than EU by itself by far.Buy complete edition on sale for best value.XCom 2 supports controllers finally, but XCom EW supported them from launch.

I try to guilt trip my soldiers by telling them, ""It's because you failed to land three 90% shots in a row that your friend is now dead."" but it never works. Apparently you are allowed to be an elite soldier in an organization that is supposed to be saving the world even if you can't land a sniper shot from 10 feet away. 10/10			"

												I'm 40 hours in now, and I can't get enough of this game.  Not only was it interesting from the get-go, but even after 40 hours, I still feel like I'm learning a huge amount of information in every playthrough.  Exceptional quality in this game.It hits the nail on the head when it comes to turn-based, tactical combat, and I can only hope it's popularity breeds more games of the same genre, as I feel we're lacking in that department lately.  Fans of turn based games should most definitely check this out, but there's enough elements of strategy, base-building, and decision making to draw in gamers of many sorts.  Even though you have access to a refillable roster of recruits (each one costing you in game $$$ of course), you begin to get attached to each one.  With them being fully customizable, you really get a sense of brotherhood with them.  Watching them perform well in combat will leave you cheering at the computer screen, whilst watching them miss an easy shot might leave you rolling your eyes, and insulting them like an old friend.  And besides, who doesn't like going into battle beside the likes of ""Woody Hardcock"", ""Blackie O'Malley"", or Ginger Grundle♥♥♥♥"".  I'm just saying.  It's gold.			"

												Put simply this game is by far the best turn based squad game I've ever played! Even better than FF Tactics! No having 100s of characters that you'll never use. No ""position your party in an x shape to do a stupid♥♥♥♥♥power move"". No doing millions of damage (the HP system makes sense and doesn't just generate high meaningless numbers to enthrall idiots). Just tactics plan and simple. Nice large, detailed maps. Positioning actually means something. Anybody looking to make a game of this genre should look to XCOM as inspiration. Best thing about this game is that it showed that not every game needs to be a FPS or action ""RPG"" to sell well. Hint, hint other big game producers.			"

												I got the game for Christmas and played a fair bit of it, to the point that I felt confident starting a game on classic difficulty with ironman mode activated. I started the game and was doing extremely well... until the stressfull atmosphere got the best of me and I stopped playing right before the alien base assault (sorry for the spoilers). Then I saw the announcement trailer for xcom 2 six months later and remembered how awesome the game was (and how awesomely powerful my assault soldier Sasha Boroso was). So, as any courageous man would do, I opened up the game again, chose my ironman game and booted it up. I wasted no time and headed right to the alien base as brave and heroic as ever. I entered the base, explored a little, and, finding no aliens in the immediate vicinity, relaxed a little and said to myself: ""See! It's not too hard! Nothing to be scared of!"". I opened the first door and found a floater that I could easily flank with Shasa Boroso's run & gun skill. So I rushed in... only to realize that there were 3 chrysalids right behind. They immediatly surrounded Shasa... and I was left with little choice but to go all in and try to explode them all (and hopefully not Shasa) with my heavy's rocket launcher. So, I crossed my fingers, closed with anger the game's warning about damaging a friendly, and shot. Well... the floater was killed (yay?) but the 3 chrysalids were still alive... AND SO WAS SHASA! So I ended my turn with glee and hoped that maybe it was lunch break for the aliens and that the chrysallids would simply turn and run off. IT WAS LUNCHBREAK! ... except they didn't turn... nor run off... Actually they, took turns munching on my precious Shasa that died and became a zombie. At that point my fingers lingered over ctrl+alt+del, but I grabbed hold of myself and said: ""HEY! YOU'RE TOUGHER THAN THAT! THE EARTH NEEDS YOU!"". So I killed the chrysallids with my heavy and a smile returned to my face. Yeah... but then Shasa's zombie came and killed my heavy with a 7 damage hit and poison (7! REALLY 7 AND POISON! CHRYSALIDS DON'T EVEN DO THAT MUCH AND THEY'RE ALIENS!)... Then I really got angry, closed the game through the task manager, and hoped it wouldn't have saved. ... But no, it had, and there was no reverting to autosaves since I was on ironman. So it was officially at that moment that I started to cry. And amidst the sadness, the pain, and the suffering, I realized that me abandoning earth was acually a good thing! BECAUSE IT SETS UP XCOM 2'S STORY LINE, WHICH WAS WHAT MADE ME START PLAYING XCOM AGAIN ANYWAYS!... now all I have to do is wait until November... and mourn Shasa			"

												This would be a fun game if the AI didn't cheat as much as it does. As it is, between the free moves the AI gets when you come into range (essentially ensuring you never get to ambush them and always giving them cover) and the AI hitting you through 2 walls in full cover while you miss with 80+% shots in the open, it's hard to really feel like it's strategy and not just a game of weighted dice rolls.

												The brief explanation is that this game was a painful oversimplification of everything Xcom was supposed to be.The missions were dumbed down into linear tasks where new enemies are literally spawned in front of you once you kill all the ones that were already on the ground.  The combat has been turned even more into a case of rolling random numbers like a tabletop RPG, roll a high enough number and bullets can go around corners, rendering cover into a simple stat modifier instead of a physical object.If you're a fan of the original, check out a game like UFO Afterlight instead.  It's a knockoff of the original Xcom, but if anything it deserves the name of Xcom far more than this superficial reboot does.			"

												(I actually have closer to 150 hrs played, but it was before i added it on steam) XCOM: Enemy Unknown  is the revival of the classic ""X-Com"" series of turn-based tactical games, with modern graphics, utility and design philosophy. The game takes place in the near future, and gives the player the role of commander of the ""XCOM Project"". The game has two distinctly different gameplay scenes: the strategic and the combat screens. The strategic screen  gives you a manager-like control of your base, and lets you make decisions about what to build, what to research, what to buy/sell, etc. The combat screen  gives you control of the tactical, turn-based combat of your squad.The game starts out with basic terran equipment and Xenology, and the ""story"" goes forward only as you achieve certain milestones, which is an interesting way of progressing a game. Such milestones can be the capture or elimination of certain aliens or artifacts, or completion of certain research projects. In the long run, you'll see your base and your soldiers evolve from being small and weak, to being big and effective.There is too much depth and variation in this game to write a thorough declaration of features here, but rest assured; this game  will  challenge you, if you let it. There are however fans of the old games who state that the new game is lacking in features, compared to the classic games, and they would be right. What the game lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality.  Less is more, gentlemen .If, however, you are one who appreciates quantity over quality, I would recommend the varius DLC's for this game, especially  ""Enemy Within"" , as well as a community-made module called ""Long War"". I must warn you though: Both the DLC and  especially  the mod will make the game  incredibly  hard, so i suggest postponing the installation of ""Long War"" until you have clocked at least 20 hours of the game. 20 hours goes by with the blink of an eye as long as you enjoy turn-based , tactical, manager, base-building, role-playing, sci-fi  games.There is also a 1v1 multiplayer mode, which is only the combat screen, and lets the player choose their units from a pool of both X-Com and alien  (and EXALT, i believe?) , but i would again recommend you to postpone that until you are more than familiar with the game.Buy it for: Its excellent single player experience, as well as feeling like the saviour of mankind.Pirate for: To see if it's actually something you might like, especially the DLC's.

												Not being a fan of strategy games, I was skeptic when buying what would become my all-time favorite game. Now, first off, this is not Real-Time Strategy, this is Turn-Based Strategy, and the only previous experience I had with such titles was tabletop games, and Pokemon. So I gave it a shot.The game is set during the begining of a war with extraterrestrial beings. You are made Commander of the Extraterrestrial Combat Unit, XCOM for short and lead a global effort to push back the invasion. With a Council overseeing you, and people being abducted every day, this is no easy task.How do you stop the alien menace? The gameplay is mainly divided into two parts: all of the gameplay that happens at the base (i.e. sending air support, investigating alien technology, changing your soldiers' names and looks, promoting soldiers, choosing countries to support, and expanding your base) and the gameplay that takes place in the battlefield, with your international squad of customized elite soldiers (i.e. moving them, shooting at aliens, recovering resources, saving civilians caught in the cross-fire). Both parts are incredibly well done and very fun to play.Now, when I say elite soldiers you might think this is easy, but make no mistake, this game is unforgiving, sometimes to ridiculous extents in higher difficulties. It should prove a challenge to beat the game even on Normal, as countries stop giving you their support and the world crumbles around you. And, as it is no longer common in most AAA games, death really does matter in this game. Do you have a Sniper Major who you spent hours costumizing, giving medals to, promoting and always saves your team? One lucky shot by the enemy and you have him no longer. If you like intelligent, highly customizable, hard but enjoyable games this one is for you. And don't even get me started on how good the DLC is.			"

												Anfangs war ich skeptisch, weil ich das gute alte X-Com damals auf Amiga 500 gespielt und geliebt habe.Es war perfekt für mich, wenn auch heutzutage nicht mehr grafisch up-to-date.Ich kaufte mir also im Sale dies Game für zehn Bucks in froher Erwartung, ein echtes X-Com mein eigen zu nennen.Was soll ich sagen?Das Spiel macht Spaß.Die Grafik ist absolut in Orndung und die Schauplätze liebevoll designt.Es macht Spaß mit seinen Soldaten den Sektor zu erkundne und gegnerische Aliens auszuschalten.Doch was gibt es taktisch her?Man beginnt beim Avenger, der einen zum Schauplatz gebracht hat und inflitriert das Gebiet mit seinen Soldaten im Rundenmodus.Es gibt verschiedene Klassen an Soldaten.So gibt es den Sturmtrupp mit Sturmgewehr, den Sniper, der auch von hinterletzten Winkel Aliens plattmachen kann, Supporter und Psi-Soldten, die den Mind-Krieg betreiten können, ganz bewährt im alter X-Com Enemy-Unknown-Manier.Die Schlachten machen Spaß und sind zu keinem Zeitpunkt unfair.Das Spiel ist eine gelungene Adapation des Klassikers, einzig alleine (achtung Spoiler!) die Tatsache, dass es nicht zum Mars/Cydonia geht um den Endboss kaltzumachen stört mich.Stattdessen wurde hier ein ""Tempelschiff"" generiert, auf dem der Kopf der Alienbande ist und den es auszuschalten gilt.Ansonsten ist eigentlich alles beim alten geblieben..die Forschung, die Werkstatt und der X-Com-Rat, der einen subventioniert, wenn man erfolgreich Terrorangriffe tilgt oder Ufos-Abschießt.Das Spiel ist sehr linear, aber das ist nicht weiter schlimm.X-Com Enemy Unknown macht Spaß, wenn man auf Taktikspiele steht und abgehärtet ist gegenüber Niederlagen.Kauft es und vielleicht sieht man sich ja mal im Multiplayer, um gemeinsam ein paar Projektile in die Gehirne der Aliens zu treiben.

												XCOM is a study in problem solving. If you want to return to your base with all the soldiers you brought with you, you better approach every enemy engagement with plans A through G. Because every so often, your decorated psychic genetically enhanced Sniper rocking alien tech with 250 kills under his belt will miss his 98% chance headshot, and you'll have to improvise from there.The whole game is incredibly engrossing. You will catch yourself playing just ""one more turn"" for a few hours at a time. You will become attached to your squad of superhuman yet still vulnerable soldiers, and legitimately grieve when your mistake causes one of them to die. You will whisper a prayer of thanks to RNGesus when your Assault successfully double taps two ~25% shots as the last action in your turn to win the mission. If you're looking in the store debating about XCOM 2, buy and experience this masterpiece first. Definitely worth your while.			"

												XCOM is a very enjoyable tactical strategy turn based game. It's one of those games where you look at the clock and get reminded that you played for 10 hours straight. It is one of my favorite games. Pros:Different difficulty modes - Ironmode if you really feel sadomasochisticInteresting missions - although some can be repetetive DLC is worth your money and a must have in my opinion Lots of options - troop customizationI also installed it on my crappy 6 year old laptop and still ran like a clock Want to keep playing and playing and playing....hours pass like minutesCons:Tactical camera mode is kinda limited (4 angles only)How to loose your girlfriend simulater (can also be added to Pros depending on your girlfriend/wife)Verdict9/10 "

												(I actually have closer to 150 hrs played, but it was before i added it on steam) XCOM: Enemy Unknown  is the revival of the classic ""X-Com"" series of turn-based tactical games, with modern graphics, utility and design philosophy. The game takes place in the near future, and gives the player the role of commander of the ""XCOM Project"". The game has two distinctly different gameplay scenes: the strategic and the combat screens. The strategic screen  gives you a manager-like control of your base, and lets you make decisions about what to build, what to research, what to buy/sell, etc. The combat screen  gives you control of the tactical, turn-based combat of your squad.The game starts out with basic terran equipment and Xenology, and the ""story"" goes forward only as you achieve certain milestones, which is an interesting way of progressing a game. Such milestones can be the capture or elimination of certain aliens or artifacts, or completion of certain research projects. In the long run, you'll see your base and your soldiers evolve from being small and weak, to being big and effective.There is too much depth and variation in this game to write a thorough declaration of features here, but rest assured; this game  will  challenge you, if you let it. There are however fans of the old games who state that the new game is lacking in features, compared to the classic games, and they would be right. What the game lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality.  Less is more, gentlemen .If, however, you are one who appreciates quantity over quality, I would recommend the varius DLC's for this game, especially  ""Enemy Within"" , as well as a community-made module called ""Long War"". I must warn you though: Both the DLC and  especially  the mod will make the game  incredibly  hard, so i suggest postponing the installation of ""Long War"" until you have clocked at least 20 hours of the game. 20 hours goes by with the blink of an eye as long as you enjoy turn-based , tactical, manager, base-building, role-playing, sci-fi  games.There is also a 1v1 multiplayer mode, which is only the combat screen, and lets the player choose their units from a pool of both X-Com and alien  (and EXALT, i believe?) , but i would again recommend you to postpone that until you are more than familiar with the game.Buy it for: Its excellent single player experience, as well as feeling like the saviour of mankind.Pirate for: To see if it's actually something you might like, especially the DLC's.

												X-COM: UFO Defense was a terrifying and terrific game that was well overdue for a modern update, and what better developer than Firaxis to take up the charge?XCOM: Enemy Unknown (and Enemy Within) offers a modern take on a great theme: aliens have arrived and they're taking over the Earth. They're going to succeed, unless you, the player, stops them. The player takes over the role of The Commander of XCOM, a last-ditch international cooperative force of the best of the best of humanity's soldiers, scientists, engineers, and pilots. Your squads of soldiers will be deployed on missions to recover alien technology, defeat alien terror attacks, and uncover the mystery of the invasion in hopes of ultimately thwarting it. This side of the game occurs on a turn-based tactical combat layer that will be familiar to those of you who've played the original, or even games like Final Fantasy Tactics and the like. For a good chunk of the game, the aliens have better guns than you and are often statistically superior, so your soldiers must make good use of cover and positioning to overcome that challenge.The rest of the game (research technology, training soldiers, building equipment/facilities, managing aircraft) occurs on a base management strategy layer. It's a fairly light take as far as management games go, but it gets the job done, and there are multiple ways to go about things. You need to deploy your squads, aircraft, and launch satellites in such a way as to minimize global panic and keep your benefactors (countries) on your sideOne of the best parts about XCOM is that it mirrored facets of the original well: the game can be deadly. You can lose your campaign, and then boom, game over, the aliens won. A tactical battle can quickly go awry, resulting in you losing your top squad of soldiers and forcing you to field newbies once more. This terror is best exemplified in the game's Ironman Mode, which only allows a single autosave file, and the game autosaves with every single turn. Lose the campaign, and your save is deleted. Combine that with one of the harder difficulties (Classic or Impossible), and difficulty junkies will surely get their fill.All in all one of the best strategy games to come out in the past decade. The expansion (Enemy Within) and other DLC (Slingshot) add more missions and options to the game in a great way. A must buy for tactical/strategy lovers and a great ""first strategy"" game for newcomers, though they may want to start on Easy or Normal.			"

												With its very engaging and interesting tactical-strategy gameplay, XCOM can easily suck several hours out of any TBS fan. Especially if you're into sci-fi or challenging games.Although some older fans might argue that it is not on par with its predecessors, the overwhelming majority agrees that it is a very enjoyable reboot of the series nonetheless.That is not to say that the game is without its share of flaws, some examples are the relatively heavy reliance on random seed number generator (%) that can easily make some players flip tables and laptops alike as well as a few bugs here and there which you may or may not encounter along the way. But here, what suffers the most is the story. Don't go into it expecting an amazing plot, it is nothing out of the ordinary in that regard.However what this game lacks in plot, it makes up for in gameplay... a LOT. Not only is it addictive and very replayable, the level of satisfaction upon taking on harder challenges and succeeding is outstanding. XCOM's very appealing design, fresh graphics and immersive atmosphere supported by a fitting soundtrack are all positive points that add up into how easy it is to devote a lot of time into it.The macro-heavy part that is base management is very entertaining in its own right and the micro-heavy squad tactical action missions never get old. There's a good variety when it comes to the battle system, enough to keep things interesting and at the same time not so much that would make you feel overwhelmed, along with being fairly simple and intuitive.Sending a squad of badasses into a dark battlefield, heavily outnumbered and making them prevail through sheer decision-making and a bit of gambling has never been more fun.

												First things first: YES it is very frustrating to experience freezes during gameplay and YES you have to assume that you soldiers are slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it comes to aiming on an anemy that stands right in front of them... That are the two main reasons why I cancelled the game the first time and had to engage in a second try years later.But, nevertheless, it finally got me. With progressing gameplay your soldiers become your friends, your family!, and you really try not to kill them during the thrilling battles. There are different types of missions and you can blow up many things, like cars and trees and aliens. Although maps can occur repetetively, the tension is kept up by the great and heroic soundtrack and the bond between you and your troop until the final heartbreaking mission <3Like mentioned before, the worst deficiency are the bugs/freezes, making ironman mode impossible for me. Very sad.Still this game is worth a recommendation.			"

												Xcom and the expansion Enemy Within are a near perfect remake of the original Xcom game that came out in 1994. It is the best squad led turn based strategy game that I have played.  The game is well balanced, entertaining, tense at times (especially if you choose to play on Ironman mode which means you can't go back to your old saves for the campaign if you mess up on a mission).The base management side of the game is good also and ties in well with the development of your squad.The Enemy Unknown expansion introduced a stack of worthwhile game elements (""mech warriors"" being my favourite part).At full price the game is worth it. On a steam sale its outrageously good value.Good luck Commander...(5 stars)			"

												A successful reboot of an amazing game. EU is capable of encapsulating all things that i loved about the original UFO Defense. Tension, fear, and complex choices are the back bone of this genre. While the game does have some cracks in the facade its mostly forgivable. Its obvious that some of the mechanics were rushed, some things were skipped, left out, deleted at the last minute, but this is common in a world of deadlines and shareholders. The team certainly made an excellent core game from the ground up. Make sure to check on the player made mods for this game!			"

												One of my favorite games of all time, XCOM: Enemy Unknown successfully combines deep tactical gameplay and RPG elements into a single, glorious package.  Due to recent extraterrestrial attacks, the XCOM Project has been activated and you have been appointed as its commander.  Your duties include directing the initiative's research, sending order to the engineering department, selecting and hiring the best soldiers for the job, and commanding said soldiers in battle.  You'll also be building and modifying satellites and aircraft to provide intel and defense against the alien threat as well.As the war progresses, the alien invasion forces will become increasingly dangerous.  New alien types with more advanced equipment and abilities will show up throughout the war to catch XCOM offguard.  Fortunately, this is where your research department tips the scales in your favor.  After eliminating an enemy threat you will acquire alien materials and corpses that your scientists will be able to study.  Common results from these studies include new gear options for your soldiers, additional aircraft and air-based weaponry, new facilities to build in your base, and more that will further your cause.  I was always very excited when my research resulted in a new piece of gear based on alien tech that was significantly more efficient than what I had previously used.In addition to improvements to their gear, your soldiers will gain promotions as they acquire experience in combat.  Each of the four classes has a unique tech three that they will progress down as you see fit.  Each rank allows you to choose one of two options that will offer new abilities to use or passive buffs to the unit's overall efficiency.  One Heavy soldier may be built around specializing with his rocket launcher, another might be entirely focused on maximizing their machine  gun capabilities, and a third might have a combination skills from both skill lines.There are two other aspects of XCOM that I feel need to be mentioned in addition to the standard mechanics: Second Wave and Long War.  Second Wave is a menu full of options that is unlocked after having completed the game once.  These drastically change the mechanics of the game and include changes such as a semi-randomized skill tree for your units where one, or potentially both, of their options for a particular rank offer skills that are not usually allowed to that profession.  For example, you might have an Assault trooper who has an advanced talent with medicine that is capable of healing their allies for significantly more health, an ability that is usually Support-only.Long War, on the other hand, is an unofficial mod created by players who saw the opportunity to futher improve an already great game.  Though there are plenty of mods out there, none that I have seen can come close to comparing to the ambition shown in Long War.  I won't go into the details here but I find that it improves almost every aspect of the game for me.  If you're interested, read more on it here:    http://www.nexusmods.com/xcom/mods/88/?There are very few people that I wouldn't recommend this game to.  The variety of difficulty options makes it an enjoyable game whether you're a more casual player of if you're a hardcore masochist (I'm looking at you Impossible/Ironman).  The mechanics are great, the atmosphere is fantastic, and everyone who I've spoken to who has played has had numerous stories to share that are a lot of fun to hear.  Just remember, you'll be losing a lot of soldier that you've customized grown attached to.Now stop reading and save the world from the alien menace, Commander!			"

												A great turn-based strategy game with RPG elements. There are many aspects I like about this game, including the combat mechanics; although the game can occasionally seem unfair (how could I miss with 80% hit chance?), it is actually a well-thought out system that works very well for the most part. I like how there are two different play modes - one is the on ground combat, and the other is managing your base. Think of the management aspect like a simplified Civ game. You are responsible for hiring scientists and engineers, building specific rooms, managing finances, hiring soldiers, deciding which soldiers to genetically modify, to name but a few. I also like the way each solider type (heavy, assault, support, and sniper) have their own tech trees. They are slightly limited, but enough to keep it interesting. The expansion adds plenty of content, such as new missions, weapons, and enemies.  Negatives are fairly minor. I feel there could have been more environment types (they get very stale after a while). Animations are sometimes a bit off, not enough to ruin the flow of the game, but they are noticeable. There is one enemy where their turn takes way too long, and can be irritating to wait for it to finish, especially when you are looking to load to a previous save.Overall, a fantastic turn-based strategy game. Certainly one of my favourite stratey games. If you are late to the game like I was and enjoying good strategy, I recommend buying this ASAP.			"

												The multiplayer is mostly garbage (Clearly was shoehorned in, you'll hear the sounds your opponent makes  through fog of war regularly. Not as a ""I hear something!"" unit alert, you'll just know exactly what's going on. You'll also see doors open through fog of war), the story is completely worthless, and it doesn't have as much randomization as the original X-com but it's still a pretty good game.Much more boardgame-like version of X-com with the 2 actions instead of time units, and the way soldiers largely improve through skill selections instead of improved stats, but it's still quite a good game. Biggest flaws are the over-reliance on scripted missions (Council missions where you're fighting the same alien type 99% of the time, no matter when you are in the game, and the few story missions) and complete lack of randomly generated maps. You'll quickly see repeats from the map pool, and even though enemy placement and composition are randomized you'll find yourself using the same tactics over and over again.Despite the flaws, gud gaem.

It is challenging too trying to keep other countries happy and deciding if the next bit of armor up for  research is gonna be more effective than researching new weapons but I'll stop there, well recommended.

I despise AAA titles, but WOW is this fun. The whole thing is just so well done. It manages to capture that purely addictive fun of the original X-COM, with adding crazy updated graphics and easy-to-navigate menus. This title skillfully eliminates some of the more tedious parts of the original game, and keeps only the good stuff. Team management has never been so fun.Pros:+Hours pass by and it seems like only minutes+Awesome modern graphics that pretty much can run on toaster (all things considered)+The best parts of the original series, with all the tedious parts scrapped+Lots of options all around: from soldier customization to how you view the battle (minus camera options, see Cons)+Lots of extra DLC to keep you busy forever, and not to mention a sequalCons:-Compared to how well everthing else is done, the camera is terrible. You can only view from 4 different sides (8 would be nice; analogue would better - I mean whats the holdup?)-You cannot change the angle of the camera, either. It feels too 'top-down' for me. Needs like a 15 degree shift.-Lots of DLC, but then again, this translates to lots of money. They have a great product, and they know it;)For my Steam friends: If you have not experienced the pure addictiveness of X-COM, you are missing out. At least grab this on a great sale (should be plenty considering the sequal is coming out). This game literally created its own genre. Side note: I recently also played and reviewed Xenonaughts, which is an awesome spiritual predecessor of X-COM. I would love to ultimately root for the indie underdog and say that title is the best, but unfortunately Enemy Unknown takes the cheese for best modern X-COM game.			"

 ""Good luck, commander."" Disclaimer: I'm not good at this game. So maybe you should keep this in mind.TL;DR:Pros: The game is very challenging, but that's what this game is all about. Managing your base is pretty easy if you get the hang of it, but still is very important. The variety between your troop's classes and the alien races are great, and you won't get bored by them. Overall, it does a exellent job at being a great turn-based strategy game.Cons: The ending is not satisfying. It could have been so much better. If you want to get the full experience, be sure to buy the XCOM: Complete pack, or else you will miss out on a lot of things.XCOM is a beloved franchise with a long long history. UFO: Enemy Unknown was the series' first game ever, and it has over 3 sequels. Then there was a long period of time, then XCOM was announced by 2K games, a FPS take on the series. After a stream of hate, Firaxis Games announced XCOM: Enemy Unknown, a remake of UFO: Enemy Unknown, and the FPS XCOM was renamed into The Bureau.When I first heard about this game, I didn't really care. After all, it was a strategy game. But after playing Sid Meier's Civilization V and a lot of other great strategy games, I thought I should give this a try as well. And oh boy, that was a right decision. The Civilization fanchise is known for its 'one more turn' tactic, and even though XCOM is not by Sid Meier(he did help with the project), XCOM also does that, and honestly, it's not a bad thing at all.In XCOM, you play as the Commander of XCOM, a paramilitary organazation who is being funded by the Council(basically UN) to stop the evil aliens from destroying the Earth. You must manage your resources to engineer new equipments for your troops, research new alien technology, and go out in the battlefield to control your mans and fight against the aliens.Each man has a 'class'. This class is randomly decided, and all of them has unique skills as well as unique perks and more skill that they can earn as they level up. These classes are Assualt, Support, Heavy and the Sniper. All of them are very important and unique, and some of them even has special weapons that only they can use.Managing your base isn't too hard. If you know some stuff before you started the game, you might know what kind of alien technology you should research first, but other then that, it's pretty standard.But the meat of the game takes place on the battlefield. This battles are turn-based strategy game, where your soldiers will go out and try to eliminate the opposing alien forces. Sometimes, depending on your situation, additional objectives will be added.These alien forces are not just one alien race. They are multiple races, and they are abducting humans and is destroing mankind with an unknown reason(pun intended). Each alien races have special powers and some of them even have powerful weapons, and most of them has their own role in the battle field.The Mutons for example, is the main infantry of the alien forces. Armed with heavy armor and deadly plasma rifles, they are trained for combat and is always ready to kill your troops.The Thin Mans are not really suited for combat. They are infiltration units, who looks just like humans. Even though they are very fragile, their eyes are very good, and unless you're behind some good cover, the Thin Mans will most likely kill you.As time passes, the plot will move along. You start to make the aliens desparate, uncover the aliens' unknown objectives, and in the late-game, you will finally meet the masterminds, the alien race who was plotting all of these plans.The game obviously gets even more challenging- oh yeah, I forgot to mention this, but this game is really really hard. Like, really really hard. And it gets even more hard! But that's the point of this game, and you can get better at it.After all this, you might ask: ""This sounds interesting, but is the game any good?"". And the answer is: Yes, this game is awesome. It does everything right. But there are some negative parts that I need to talk about.The ending is not satisfying. It really doesn't explain anything, and the impact wasn't that big either. I think explaining what happend after would have been much better, or just changing the ending entirely so it's more satisfying.This game has an expansion pack called XCOM: Enemy Within. It adds some new classes, new aliens, and tons of other stuff that will make the game a LOT more fun. I suggest buying the XCOM: Complete pack which has all the DLCs and Enemy Within to make the experience lot better. If you only buy Enemy Unknown, you will definitely regret it.XCOM: Enemy Unknown does everything right to be a great turn-based strategy video game, and I'm happy to say that this game's final verdict is 8/10. But here's the punch, if you bought the XCOM: Complete pack, it deserves an 9/10. You will definitely get a lot of hours sinked into this masterpiece, and you won't regret any of it.			"

												An AMAZING game. No seriously, if you're gonna buy this game, buy it. It's worth every penny and a great for strategic gamers out there! The developers has obviously taken a great amount of time to create this game. The mechanics are really good and the game itself is very addictive. You get so very attatched to your soldiers that when they die, you just have to load back to before, uh it, dies, which is annoying but also gives the game more tension (or insanity) and before you know it, you've gotten so paranoid and murder anything that touches your virtual friend. Just be careful not to play too much of this or you will be flanking your friends in real life. (That is if you have anymore friends after you play this) Enjoy!			"

												XCOM. The franchise that launched a thousand memes and probably ten times as many blood pressure problems. The game that it's said your soldiers are just as likely to shoot their own cover as they are the enemy you told them to hit. Well, let me tell you right now that's not true.They're much more likely to do that.So here's the deal. XCOM is (and always has been) a turn-based, squad-level, brutally tough tactical sim. If you're all about commanding massive armies in the defense of Earth, move on. We're going to ask you to protect the planet and we're going to give you four people to do it. Six if you pay us enough. When you get right down to it, XCOM is the antithesis of the tank philosophy. It demands surgical application of force, and done so that your limited forces are able to work together. Once you hit mid-game, that's the only way to survive. Players who bring a sledgehammer to this game are going to end up beaten senseless in short order. You need a scalpel. And lots of luck. On the positives side, it's a beautiful game. Everything from maps to UI is detailed and well-rendered. Everything you see makes sense (well, most of it, anyway), and it was put together with care. The tactical simulation is top notch and is essentially a game of chess where the pieces don't move one at a time. The level of forethought, planning, and tactical finesse the game requires of the player is a refreshing change from the ""shoot at everything, bulldoze the level"" approach many games take. And if you take the time to develop your tactical skills and fight smart, you'll be rewarded. Not richly, maybe, but rewarded.On the flip side, XCOM continues to be notoriously skewed against the player. The RNG hates you, and there are all kinds of invisible fetters that are tinkering with your die rolls, meaning that 80% chance to hit probably isn't. That whole ""90% chance to hit - miss three times in a row"" meme isn't joking; it'll happen. But that's part of the process; if your tactical plan is resilient enough to accomodate that kind of bad luck, then you'll come through. If not, well...time to recruit some new troops.As a particular bonus, customization is a big deal in XCOM. Building your base is entirely up to you, as is the equipment loadout carried by every one of your troopers. No automatic decision system is going to trip you up. You can even rename your soldiers and give them nicknames. And after your sniper misses his FIFTH 90+% shot, you'll get a certain amount of satisfaction in nicknaming him ""Elmer Fudd.""This is a game for the chess players of the world, not the CSGO crowd. If your idea of tactics is to Leeroy Jenkins it, the aliens are going to have you for lunch (possibly literally). But if you like thinking about your combat and applying complex tactics...welcome to the fight.			"

												Absolutely no regrets about dropping 60h of my life into this game - I'll probably be dropping 60h more into Enemy Within.The mix of base management and squad based missions balances your stress levels.  Some missions really are tough and you  need a bit of a breather after completing them - especially losing a favourite soldier.  It takes time and effort to develop a good soldier, so losing him really is a crushing defeat!  This attachement to your individual soldiers is perhaps the aspect I enjoyed most about the game.  They aren't just replaceable cannon fodder - so you're focused on winning the mission AND on making sure they all survive.  This gets especially interesting on the terror missions - how much are you prepared to risk to save civilians?			"

Still, they're merely tutorials for one of the biggest and most polished game mods ever made - Long War. My advice? Play the base game (with or without dlcs) once to understand mechanics, and then grab Long War. It's free and you'll find it on xcom nexus or ufopaedia. Believe me, you'll never look back.			"

												I've spent a lot of time on this game, and I keep coming back to it. It's a challenging, engaging game, no doubt about it. It's easy to get hyped up on XCOM 2 (ETA: less than a month as of review), but this game has charm. Sure, stuff like forced failure in the form of abductions and unusual glitches mean the game isn't perfect. But no game is. It's hard to describe the feeling I get from playing XCOM, because it is like no other game I've played. It's not forgiving. RNG will get in the way every day. Your soldiers will die. You will cry. But you will get up, and try again. You will get better, and try again. And you will strike at increasingly higher difficulties, hopefully achieving the venerable I/I run. The fact that this game pulls no punches means that every action, every death, and most of all, every victory, means something.They've digged up an old game from the grave. That means there's changes from the good old UFO days. People that liked the old UFO games may not like this one. It definitely changes a lot. There's no more TUs. Inventories are streamlined. You can only have one base. But I played the old UFO, and I loved it to bits. I played this reboot, and I loved it to bits. So it's not correct to say that nobody who played the UFO games will like this one, because I did. For old veterans of the franchise and newcomers alike, I must wholeheartedly recommend.			"

												I have played this title in PS3 before, and it had suck numerous worthy hours of my life.As soon as I got my new PC (only have laptops before) I decided that this going to be a must have game and, again, it sucks hours of my time now and for foreseeable future as I haven't got Enemy Within expansion pack yet.One part of the game is about management; you're running a base, funding research, building new weapons, managing a fleet of fighter craft and generally trying to keep a small number of rich and powerful funding nations happy enough to keep on funding you.The other half is tactical game. You're taking a small squad of soldiers out into the field for turn-based combat. There are several class of soldier with their own specialty.Both part equally weighted and well crafted to make you rush for more dose; a little game before you go to work, after you get home from work, and when having dinner as you can play it when having your meal.And oh.. I bought Elite Soldier Pack DLC just because its on sale, knowing that it wouldn't add anything essential. But boy.. I never knew that making the soldiers look like Power Rangers could be so fun!! The Slingshot DLC also add more customization to the look. Get the DLCs when they're on sale. When they're not, I think the price is a tad to much.			"

												Probably the best turn-based strategy game I've played. I bought XCOM during the autumn sale, thinking I might find some enjoyment in playing it, but now that I've invested almost 30 hours into it, I wouldn't have regretted buying it for the full $39.99 price.Personally, I think it's amazing. It's so in-depth - everything is thought through. For a turn-based strategy, a format that you wouldn't expect to have any depth, this game has a developing storyline that keeps you wondering, scientific research descriptions and interesting character interactions in cut-scenes, and I've personally found that I get so emotionally attached to the characters in the game. The soldiers in my squad aren't just units on the screen, they're people, with their own personalities and special abilities. They each contribute to the team in their special way, and even though the game doesn't GIVE them personalities, they are somehow still formed just by playing the game and using your imagination.The graphics are very nice, the interface is complex, but easy to learn and adapt to, and the turn-based battle field is multi-tiered and very fun to play in.I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND this game. 10/10.

												This is a really tight, well made squad based strategy game. Everything about it is well made. The graphics, the plot, the gear, the combat, the enemy progression, the difficulty scaling, it's all pretty much perfect. It's also easy to play how you want to play, with options that allow anything between an old school xcom 'half your squad dies from friendly fire after a rookie panics' game to some sort of action move where aliens die in their hundreds and nobody on the good guys side gets scratched.The early game is suitably hectic as you struggle to build gear and satellites and run missions but that trails off towards the endgame where you can pretty much slaughter any aliens that stick their heads up, and the heart thumping sense of 'oh god not more attacks not now oh god' pretty much vanishes and you can get to the end of the tech tree way before the final few missions. The missions themselves are pretty good, with a healthy amount of variety so it doesn't get stale. The only issue I had was with the expansion pack storyline and the main game storyline - the xp one kicks in late and lasted longer than the main game storyline did, so I was stuck twiddling my thumbs staring at the big red GO FIGHT THE END BOSS button while I waited for more of the expansion stuff to happen.The support cast are all pretty good, and honestly they are all much more fleshed out than I would have expected considering they are stuck in a few soundbites and cutscenes, but they do add a lot to the game, even if you never do quite shake the suspicion Vahlen is a little bit too into dissecting things alive.

												Having played both the original campaign and Enemy Unknown, I have to say that this is a very well done strategy game. I wholly recommend getting Enemy Unknown and passing on the base campaign, as it adds several new kinds of missions that help to give a lot more variety than the original set of missions. The objective of each mission is basically the same regardless (kill all the aliens to win the mission), but it's really a lot of fun.It's quite difficult to overcome the temptation to save scum, but going full ironman sounds downright terrifying. Expect to lose a lot of soldiers, especially good ones. I probably missed out on a lot of the experience the game has to offer with even the lightest of save scumming.			"

The player controls a squad of between one and six human soldiers or robotic units as they hunt the aliens on the map and attempt to complete other objectives dependent on the mission. It has few frustrations like the enemy AI gets a free-move everytime your units meets up with them Level Design Map layouts are not randomly generated, but enemy placement is has a wide open area to move around and explore, But at time enemies can shoot through walls, and sometimes your unit could not find the enemy behind the wall  Verdict Overall, it's a good game, but it's full of frustration in-terms of AI, but if you're the type that can handle it			"

I bought XCOM during the autumn sale, thinking I might find some enjoyment in playing it, but now that I've invested almost 30 hours into it, I wouldn't have regretted buying it for the full $39.99 price.Personally, I think it's amazing. It's so in-depth - everything is thought through. For a turn-based strategy, a format that you wouldn't expect to have any depth, this game has a developing storyline that keeps you wondering, scientific research descriptions and interesting character interactions in cut-scenes, and I've personally found that I get so emotionally attached to the characters in the game. The soldiers in my squad aren't just units on the screen, they're people, with their own personalities and special abilities. They each contribute to the team in their special way, and even though the game doesn't GIVE them personalities, they are somehow still formed just by playing the game and using your imagination.The graphics are very nice, the interface is complex, but easy to learn and adapt to, and the turn-based battle field is multi-tiered and very fun to play in.I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND this game. 10/10.

												For me,who have never tried any turn-based game before,this game instantly conquer my soul the second I played through the tutorial. Decision,yes,there are lots of them.Even more comparing to most rpg games. (I know they're in a whole different genre but I feel like I need to point that out.). From the matter like when are we going to manufacture a single armament,to the thing such as how to positioned every single soldier in combat to be ready for any kinds of ambush.Every mouse click counts. Literally.The AI in this game is a bunch of fearless dense b-tard.They just don't know when to stop. There have been many occasion when I'm in a tight situation and can't help but yell, ""Why can't we all get along together and be at peace!?!?"". The nearly unpredictable AI is what you'll love and hate about this game.This game is about how you deal with the different situation at the same time,learn from things that just happened,and most importantly, learn how to move on from it.

It takes a little while to get into, but once you're there it is incredibly immersive and surprisingly complex. One of the best games that I have played for years.Sure, it has a few TINY floors but if you like:Turn based strategyBattling against aliensSoldier levelling up and full customisation (aesthetic, equipment, skills, genetic or mechanical modification)Resource and base managementA good challengebuy this game.

												I feel sorry for the person who doesn't own this game.  It is the first tactical game I've ever played, and the game is nearly flawless.  You can fully immerse yourself in any aspect of the game and that effort and focus radiates to other parts of the game.  Buy this game and you will not be dissapointed. It is also very easy to learn the different aspects but hard to utilize them to the full potential.  With time your attention on this game will make it much more enjoyable than when you started.			"

												Having played both the original campaign and Enemy Unknown, I have to say that this is a very well done strategy game. I wholly recommend getting Enemy Unknown and passing on the base campaign, as it adds several new kinds of missions that help to give a lot more variety than the original set of missions. The objective of each mission is basically the same regardless (kill all the aliens to win the mission), but it's really a lot of fun.It's quite difficult to overcome the temptation to save scum, but going full ironman sounds downright terrifying. Expect to lose a lot of soldiers, especially good ones. I probably missed out on a lot of the experience the game has to offer with even the lightest of save scumming.			"

												XCOM EU is a Turn-Based Strategy, this is a sequel to the latest X-COM series, developed by Firaxis Games, the guys behind Sid Meier's Civilization This game has long campaign and a good one, even on the hardest difficulty, its fun at time Gameplay For gameplay, it's like CIV. but it focuses more on turn-based ground combat uses an isometric 3D perspective. The player controls a squad of between one and six human soldiers or robotic units as they hunt the aliens on the map and attempt to complete other objectives dependent on the mission. It has few frustrations like the enemy AI gets a free-move everytime your units meets up with them Level Design Map layouts are not randomly generated, but enemy placement is has a wide open area to move around and explore, But at time enemies can shoot through walls, and sometimes your unit could not find the enemy behind the wall  Verdict Overall, it's a good game, but it's full of frustration in-terms of AI, but if you're the type that can handle it			"

												awsome game: i have to say its hard if you (like me) never play a xcom game i mean i really like the grafics in this game and aliens you fight, i have to be fare about this game one of the problems i think they can upgrade in future games is that YOU DONT FREAKING MISS WHEN THE ALIEN IS IN FRONT OFF YOU WITH 100!!! but yea that something i dislike about the game , the fact that it is base most on luck for you the player to hit the enemy even if you have a 100% you can still miss your shot.i really like the story but its sad that is so short i really like it but if you use the easter egg soldiers then you go very quikly trow the story it takes a 13 missions to complete it at most i think, one's you have done all the recears and all foundry projects you are done there nothing more to do, sure you can get more soldiers with better armors but that♥♥♥♥♥far as it goes.with the ENEMY WITHIN you get a ton off new things to do and you will be busy with them plus it adds more options in foundry and the labs so you get a lot more to do in XCOM  when you download this DLC. However this does not change the fact that you will be done with it after you did all off projects and stuff.I love this game alot i had my eye on since i say the game for the first time i give it : 8 out off 10 alien heads! :)			"

												There is a specific reason why I write this review so sure of my opinion after only 2 hours of play. That reason, my cyber friends, is that I love you. And XCOM is on sale. And you should GET IT, like, RIGHT ABOUT THE ♥♥♥♥ NOW.When it first went on sale, it was way too pricey for me. When the price went down, I had other games to play. This summer sale, I didn't plan to get it, but when I saw it's on sale, alongside the The Bureau sequel (get both for 7 € or equivalent in dollars in the next 18 hours or choose XCOM: Enemy Unknown alonside DLC Enemy Within and DLC's for 9 € or equivalent in dollars), I said to myself - it's now or never, man. Now or never. And am I so glad it's now.XCOM slams you in the middle of galactical war - it's humanity VS traditional depiction of aliens - it makes you wanna watch ""Mars Attacks"" and ""X-Files"" marathon. Now, the game is pretty simple to get a hold on, yet impressive and pretty hard to be perfect at. The core of the game is tactical combat in the vein of turn-based strategies. You move your squad, turn after turn and you shoot if you have any action points left. You need to deal with objectives which are mainly - survive and kill the aliens, but also extractions, bomb defusals, tecnology capturing etc. Beside 70+ missions that you get in original game, you also gave a great deal of work to do in your base: you need to build and upgrade your facilities - your engineers stand to produce deadly weaponry for you, your scientific labs are exploring alien technology and making it useful for humans, you're hiring new soldiers, you're constructing new base options. You also need to get your soldiers in shape. Some of them panic. Some of them get wounded. You need to treat 'em right. Imagine your base building as something you've already seen in CIV games, in a way - your collagues are something like your advisors and your work with them is something like building and technology tree unlocking in Civilization games. No wonder, it's Firaxis game.You upgrade, you build, you train your squad, you make rookies learn to kill and you weep in pain and despair when your soldiers get killed because in this game, the war and death are eternal, and only thing you have is a memorial wall to remember the fallen.XCOM oozes in traditional SF atmosphere; it's an turn based strategy game of epic proportions and generic, although great story that will keep you hooked for many hours (I can already feel habit building up inside of me).And it has a multiplayer I haven't even tried yet.So, what to pick? I've picked XCOM + The Bureau. You may want to pick XCOM Complete with DLC's, but I couldn't resist The Bureau's setting.The bottom line is this: it's not only a great strategy game, it's A FANTASTIC GAME, whether you like strategies or not.GET IT. You'll thank me later.			"

You can have a lot of fun for some time but after lots of hours you will become tired of playing the same thing. The missions, except the Council missions, are very similar, but you can have some fun.Multiplayer:It's not very good, not the best, it's a thing that you will play one or two times for month and you will get tired, because is the same thing every time.Only a detail: I had only played the campaign in the Enemy Within, so I can't say too much of the base game, but in the overall it's a good strategy game.I recommend you (if you like strategy games) to buy this game plus it's DLC.

												Brutal and downright-diffuclt, XCOM: Enemy Unknown's isometric, turn-based strategy gameplay serves as a barometer not just for the sequel to match -- but also as a standard for other games. With frenetic sequences down a narrow aisle with four Mutons suppressing you down or having a Sectoid Commander mind-controlling your soldier without any retaliation, you'll find yourself knee-deep and swimming in pockets of endless fun and gratification as you go from calm to subdued within seconds. The skills and perks are a great way for the soldiers to level up, granting you various better equipments when you research weapons and armor. The game's core is very simplistic but yet engaging and compelling for those wanting that strategic itch. I decided to play for an hour but that escalated into something else. XCOM: Enemy Unknown is brilliant and challenging -- but that's what makes it fun and amazing.			"

												XCOM is one of those games that does a few things really, really right, and the rest of the game (problematic though it might be) never has a chance to get in the way.  I forgive its cartoony character models, lack of voice accents, and sometimes questionable hit detection and A.I.  Everything else is a blast and a half.Encountering and understanding the alien threat is a gradual progression and continuous improvement over the course of the game.  The way the story flowed seemed very logical, even-handed, and motivating.  Working with the military, engineering, and scientific wings of XCOM was unique and interesting.  Turning your band of merry warriors into legendary powerhouses, nicknames and all, was as anticipatory as unleashing them in the field.The scathing difficulty, even on Easy, is apparent throughout; if you're gung-ho, your soldiers will die.  Period.  I liked that, having a challenge requiring tact and discretion.Or, y'know, you could always just rush forward with an Assault, spot vision of every enemy, and have your Snipers Double-Tap everything, lol.Shouldn't be passed up.  9.5/10			"

												If you are into anything slow paced and like science fiction a bit, you should try this game. This game was a total surprise to me, got it free from a friend and when I tried it the first time, I totally got sunk into it. Now after bying the dlc packs and Enemy Within, I feel that this game is as complete as it can be. Sure some things could be better, but I don't think this needs anything added. This is the reason I think that there's no point for waiting a next installement.The game consist of two parts, base building and tactical turn-based shooter. The base building makes your team better in the field, and your team in the field makes your base better and clients happier. Both phases feel important and interesting, and failing on either will make you essentially fail in the other part. Although both parts forgive some failures, the difficulty curves during the game a lot, so if you don't keep up, you will most likely lose. Because the difficulty curves properly, the game feels constantly challenging and one cannot just stop caring about minor stuff, although the base building becomes less of a challenge while the game goes on.Best part for me was the games atmosphere. It shamelessly hangs between cheap science fiction and militaryhype, and makes a great combination. Graphics fit in and there are only few very minor bugs. Voice acting, music and sound effects are all great that just add to the atmosphere.			"

												STRIKE ONE, THIS IS CENTRALGreatly reccomended not only for its suspenseful gameplay but also huge replayability. Turn-based grid tactical battles, along with a more meta overview of your headquarter operations, provides rollercoaster campaigns where you will inevitably bond and part with your highly customizable squaddies.The reason I state high replayability is due to:- Varying difficulty levels, - ""Second Wave"" options which change mechanics for drastically different strategizing (e.g. lower health= lower dmg, higher crit chances, more random damage)- FANTASTIC DLC/Expansion: Enemy Within. - Popular mod titled ""The Long War"" which adds ridiculous amounts of brand new content for a longer and harder campaign when you've exhausted the base game+expansion.- Great community to discuss strategies and share modsA succesful campaign in the base game will likely take over 10 hours, but you will typically not succeed on your very first try. Even with the announcement of XCOM 2, this prequel is certainly worth it's pricepoint and can potentially give you dozens of hours of entertainment.			"

												Best turn-based strategy game I have played so far. Nice story, good graphics and atmosphere thanks to a good soundtrack mixed with nice voice actors. I expected more of a sidescroller feeling, but the base management, the decisionmaking and the high difficulty in the earlier to mid stages of game really made me enjoy this.Since I got the ""Enemy Within"" Addon I first played ""XCOM: Enemy Unknown"" as a single game, just to realise later, that the ""XCOM: Enemy Within"" campaign is the exact same one, just with more features. Many more features, it really was worth its while.For lovers of turn-based strategy an absolut must have in my opinion.			"

												There's a reason why this game is a top seller. game of the year, and on my favorites. I rate games on several factors: music, sound effects, graphics/art style, game play, difficulty options, learning, replayability, stakes, and story/dialogue. I then weigh that to the price of the game.The story is so compelling and something I absolutely love. Earth is under alien invasion. In order to face the threat, the forces of Earth ally. There's many places that need help, and you cannot pick all of them. Hopefully you can gather knowledge to further your tech to aid in the war. I love how the US works with China and Russia and other countries.The music of Mass Effect reminds me of the music from XCOM. That's one reason why I liked Mass Effect and why I LOVE XCOM. This ties into the stakes. The stakes are high! Alien invasion. There's only one planet. And the music expresses how this is a war for survival. And I felt it. No matter what there will be casualties.Stakes ties into the story and difficulty. The planet is under attack! And if you choose the ironman difficulty. If someone dies, they're dead. So every choice you make matters, and may or may not result in a injured or killed squadmate. Or a failed mission.There's a lot of learning in this game. I've played it on Ironman. And I have started the game over, a dozen or so times.The graphics didn't blow me away. But the art choices did. The lighted lines of the alien canisters to the look of a sectoid or muton. The color pallete of a soft blue with black and white gives a futuristic vibe. And the UI is quite intuitive. There's personality! The skyhawk has a no sectoid paint on it.Gameplay is where the game really shines! I love tactical strategy based games. Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, Shining Force, Shadowrun, etc. And this game has it. Combat will take a long time. Each movement will be calculated. Is there enough cover? Can I flank without getting flanked? How much will moving to this spot increase/decrase my to hit %?Replayability. The game has it. You can beat it one way, maybe following a specific strategy or losing a few council members. Or you can make an attempt at not losing any members or only using a specific class. I've played this game so much and everyone I've told about it has loved it. I'm sure you will too!			"

												I first encountered xcom as a demo on xbox360. I also used to be a person who did not like the idea of turn based strategy games. Then I tried xcom, and fell in love with this game so much that when I got a computer I bought it on Steam too. What makes this game so good in my opinion? This game takes time to learn. You will make mistakes and lose. When you do not allow yourself to make the same mistakes and learn from them, the more you play, the better you will get. What I like most about xcom is the fact that when I first started this game, I was clueless. This is my first turn based strategy game. As I continued to play xcom, I became better and was able to finally beat classic difficulty with ironman mode enabled. This game requires you to make hard choices that are not always clear. That is why I like this game so much. It requires you to think about every choice you make in the base management side, and in the turn based tactical combat side. Every choice you make in base management has an upside and downside. The combat layer also has hard choices as well, requiring you to adapt and have backup plans, should your initial plan fail. Trust me, you will learn to hate this game and love it at the same time. The tutorial does a nice job of teaching you the basics, but it does not teach you some of the more unorthodox strategies that you have to learn on your own, or learn it from other players. Even though this game does have some bug issues from time to time, the main reason you will learn to like this game is simple. It will never be exactly the same twice. EVER. My main advice to new players or first time players of xcom, is to take your time. Patience and planning ahead will always be your most deadly weapon in this game. I hope that anyone reading this can give this game a chance as I did. I can honestly say that I do not regret playing this game one bit. If you like turn based strategy games, this game will give you a run for your money.			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is one of the 10 best games I have ever played (that would be as far back as 1982:), and one of the top 5 PC games I've ever played.  If you like tense, turn-based strategy, this game is for you.I spent 9 months (I don't get so much game time any more) playing it (culminating in completing it on Ironman Impossible:) on XBOX, and bought a PC specifically so I could it play online versus other people (or currently, other person).I don't find many games that make me want to punch the screen when stuff goes wrong, or jump up and down when stuff goes right.  XCOM is great for that!It can be a little glitchy, but as it is turn based, you can and have to just suck it up - Enemy Within (which I have for XBOX) fixes some of the glitches.Check out the Zero Puntuation review: Yahtzee hates almost everything, and even he liked it.

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is still one of my favourite games of all time. Sure, it is turn-based combat and if you really tried, you can find a few faults with it, but the gameplay is tight, fun, brings across the combat from what I know of the original xcom very well and is very engaging and rewarding.You play as the commander of the XCOM project. An organisation built to defend earth from the encroaching threat of alien invasion. In the base you arrange for a whole host of things to happen; You sort out your soldiers (hiring, dismissing, equipping, promoting, skill selection, customisation etc), your research projects to get better stuff, interrogations of captives, your base expansions, building and improving of equipment, taking requests from other Countries, selling alien objects, sending up satelites etc etc. So basically, you do lots of stuff. It's deep, engaging and you honestly do end up getting absorbed in everything which all ties up nicely and affects your soldiers in the field.The field operations are turn based assaults, rescues, area securing and other various missions (depending on dlc or not) which take place in different areas which you do get to see a few times, but are infrequent enough and varied enough to still be interesting. The aliens you fight are nicely varied and gradually get more difficult as the game progresses and the whole thing has a nice tie-in with the base gameplay. You capture aliens, alloys, meld (dlc) and sometimes even soldier units in the field, then use those in the base to make more stuff, which then helps in the field next time. It's smooth, intuitive and really engaging.There are flaws, naturally. Sometimes some of the abilities seem a little abstracted from the map geometry and units can sometimes see or even shoot through walls at times. The randomness of the ways you can get resources can be a limitation if you're out of funds for this month and seriously need to start building more stuff, but it does not affect gameplay negatively to a huge extent.Overall, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a fantastic game, with a good story, immersive gameplay and great mechanics. It is fun and interesting, which in my book, is a big plus these days!			"

A Well Done Remake! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]I had high hopes on this remake because I had some great times with the original classic trilogy. After playing it to the end I must say that most of my hopes have been satisfied.They took all that made great the previous chapters and included into this new game: the graphic is very nice, the combat system is turn based, you can expand your HQ by building new facilities, you can upgrade your weapons and technologies, you intercept and board alien spaceships, your team skills advance as they level up and you can stun and vivisect the aliens! What could you ask more?Well, to be honest there are a couple of things I would liked to be addressed: the enemies spawn ""magically"" and adopt not so clever strategies; it is too easy to overpower your team with flying suits, plasma cannons and psy powers; you can only build 1 HQ and team members have their nationality random choosen (the last one is not a great deal, but won't you trust more a male american assault team than a female indian one...?).The things that really ruined my happiness are the ending coming after an average of 30 hours and not even a single HQ defense mission. Sadly the replay value is also quite low even if there are different levels of difficulty (there are no incentives in finishing the game twice if you fully completed the first run as I did).I guess this also means the Enemy Within DLC is a must buy.Best played with Keyboard and MouseRecommended Buy Price < 25$Score 8/10 "

												I was first exposed to XCOM when apocalypse was released back in the 90's. I actually bought it at Electronics Boutique while skipping school and proceeded to play it for an entire day without a break.  Similarly, XCOM:EU took hold of me and didn't let go. It's extremely well polished from a graphics POV and the music score does well at driving your emotions depending on what you're doing.  While at home base there's a pulse pounding track running to make you feel lke you're doing something important.  While on the battlefield the track switches to a more eerie, ethereal selection as you investigate a crash.Graphics wise it's not meant to look realistic. I read a developer interview and it was mentioned that they wanted the characters to look/feel like action figures and that is exactly what they achieved.  I did feel like the environments were still detailed enough for me to enjoy what I was looking at.Gameplay wise, without dragging this out too much further, you honestly do end up telling yourself ""Just one more turn"" or ""just one more battle"".  Before you know it it's 2am and you have to drag yourself to bed to dream about it.  I only had a few reservations about the game.  In apocalypse, base placement was a big part of your success.  You had a city to build bases in and determine your coverage area versus in EU, you just pick a country for your home base and then build satellites to cover the rest. It's a strategy element I did miss even after I stopped playing apoc over a decade ago.Second, when you get into the harder difficulty levels (e.g. Impossible), it can take a lot of attempts to get your game moving forward. Meaning, I felt like I needed a lot of luck to progress for my shots to hit when I needed them to and to be dealt a lucky random mission that provided me with the resources/soldiers I needed.  One disclaimer, I'm certainly not the most talented player and yes ""impossible"" does imply that it may well be for some people.  Overall, awesome game.  I really hope to see more XCOM in the future!			"

												Xcom enemy unknown/ Enemy withini had been searching for a game for the past 5 years  that had really good Team based Turn Strategy/Role play, coming from Riviera The Promised land, Yddgra union, Fire Emblem (pre-game Cube), Rebel Star, Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics, i knew from the first day Xcom came to steam, this would be my game!. A game that has Role play value through character creation and Story  is a real seller for me, along with tight Controls and minimal glitches and pretty much well thought out mechanics.The game has squad based Tactics, research to upgrade your units, recruitment drives, Science research to integrate alien tech into your Project, Increasing difficulty, random events, DLC that expands on all this, along side Alien variaton, a TON of maps, and Almost full customizability of each character you recruit, these options are  hair, Armour, faces,colors, helmets, and Voice nationality.Does it have replayability? yes sir, with features like Second wave and Classic/Ironman modes yes sir or madam it does!THese help vary your troops on how they grow, the abilities they get, and provide extra challenges and or advantages, along side to adding Handi caps to aliens and or making it so you cannot save or reload, what you get is what you get, you fail, you cannot reload.But thats all the good, how about the Bad?****1. Sometimes, (RARE) The camera gets stuck and it cannot be moved or no actions can be done, you must re-load your save (in ironman mode you cant do this)2. 1 or 2 enemies in a full play through will Teleport from beyond the map into the Dark (glitch) then respawn infront of you the next turn.3. I think its a current problem, but Bio electric skin should only be put onto 1 character for it to work fully, having more than 1 person in the squad with bio-electric skin will need you to have the whole squad to be within 2 squares of each other for the ability to work for 1 character.***** 1 and 2 only happend to me once in 3 play throughs of the game, its safe to say its really rareThis game is a must buy with the DLC if you are into Turn based Strategies, fully replayable, and into Alien Devastation, this game really does make you feel almost powerless against the aliens...but only you can make the diffrence between winning it for human kind, or loosing it...

												The aliens have invaded Earth and XCOM, a secret project created by the Council of Nations, becomes our planet's last line of defense. As its commander, you will have to manage everything, from research, recruitment, building projects and deciding where to intervene in the world against the invaders.I never played a previous XCOM before, so that shouldn't be a problem if you haven't either. On the other hand, I must warn you that this game is very hard and pretty unforgiving. Getting your team completely wiped out for a little tactical mistake is a common thing. There is also an ironman mode, where everything you do is irreversible, giving it a rogue-like experience, plus with the permanent death of your squad members and excellent soundtrack, the grid turn based battles can get pretty tense.In the end, XCOM is a serious candidate for game of the year! Everything in it is great, from the tactical and engaging battles, to the base management and world affairs and the difficult decisions it presents to you. A must buy!			"

												Before I even started playing XCOM: Enemy Unknown I was sceptical, as not many developers out there can produce a masterpiece when it comes to turn-based strategies... But when you put Firaxis behind the wheel, the geniuses behind Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, you're bound to have a success!! And XCOM: Enemy Unknown is so much more than that! What really gets you into the game is not the awesome and compelling storyline, or the brilliant combat and cover system, or the tons of upgrades and research, or the customizability of your entire squad, but the actual remake of a game that has been with me since my childhood days and they really nailed it perfectly! From brilliant kill cams to riveting action cut-scenes as your soldiers moves from cover or flanks an enemy to barely dodge an incoming plasma blast; this game is as perfect as you'll get to any other reboot. It is extremely forgiving to newcomers of the XCOM series and/or turn-based strategies so if this is your first time then look no further, you'll have one hell of a fun ride! I must admit though that near the end, 30 hours or so in, it did start to get a bit repetitive with the alien ships and panic missions, but the game happened to end not even an hour afterwards with the final mission so I must admit this was perfectly thought out. Not too long, nor too short, and definitely worth every cent and second spent on the game. A thoroughly and unforgettable experience!			"

												This game is a modernisation of the classical 'UFO : Enemy Unknown', and does rather well in re-inventing the theme. Some features have been re-designed, and the game has effectively been made less complicated, and more graphically enchanced. It is a shame to see the cap on trooper being 6, as on the previous version it was 12 with the skyranger and 24 wth the avenger. The game would be much easier with disposable troopers, and the game really needs a dlc to take the entire scale up, as until within, no maps were very big, and the game was limited in things to do. Having said this, Within adds the needed extras, but even with the scaled up maps, it still leaves a lot to be desired. In short, the previous game (1995) is £2.99 and this is £10-20. Take your pick, but the first is undeniabely more difficult, but at the same time very interesting. Basically, Xcom is a more basic version of what was once one of the most complicated, anticipating, and amazing games, but Xcom does hold a certain amount of dignity, but is not what it's older brother is.

												Jake Smith was a simple but powerful solider. He lived a normal life fighting aliens with his mate Roberto Sancheese, until, we began to take the aliens and research them. All of a sudden Jake's life was thrown into anarchy. Jake was given gene implants to his eyes and a sniper to make him super accurate, and Roberto's limbs were sliced off in order to make room for a MEC suit (mech). Together they killed hundreds, if not thousands, of aliens. That was, until, one fateful night the commander ordered Jake to rush onto a roof to provide cover. BAM. The roof was full of Muton alien super-soliders. They slaughtered Jake leaving his wife and child upset. Roberto promised to Jake on his deathbed that he would look after his only son, Jake mk2, like he was his own. Jake Mk2 joined XCOM only to be made quick work of by the aliens, as he was such a low level and the commander was so far through the game. Roberto promised to Jake mk2 on his deathbed that he would look after Jake mk2's only son; Jake mk3. This cycle repeated itself until Jake mk7 finally was promoted and became the best sniper XCOM had ever seen. It was like the older, more simple times, where Jake and Roberto would kill countless aliens. Together they shrekt the aliens.10/10 would kill generations of the same family again			"

Apa anda mau mencoba bermain catur dengan latar 3D Map dimana bidak nya adalah Pasukan Khusus dan Alien?This is your game.Kelebihan :Strategy yang menantang Grafik yang ciamikMembuat frustasiCustomisasi yang luasMap yang strategisAtmoshphere yang menghipnotisKekurangan :Story terlalu simpel dan sangat berpotensi untuk di perluasMap terkadang repetitive/berulang-ulangPlayer agak terbatas pada cerita------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------APA SIH XCOM ENEMY UNKNOWN?XCOM : EU adalah Turn-based Strategy game(Strategy dengan sistem permainan yang bergantian) yang di rilis 2KGames dimana kita mengambil peran sebagai Komandan organisasi gabungan antar negara yang bernama XCOM, dalam usaha untuk menangkal Invasi Alien ke bumi. Di sini selain memimpin pasukan khusus di setiap misi nya, player juga mengurus segala kepentingan di markas mulai dari Riset untuk peningkatan prajurit/Pesawat tempur sampai urusan pembangunan di dalam markas XCOM.GRAFIK DAN SOUNDXCOM Enemy Unknown berbasis Unreal Engine 3 yang mana untuk game genre strategy Engine semacam ini sangat memuaskan mata. Efek suara mulai dari Senjata, Voice-over, sampai backsound sangat memanjakan telinga. Atmosphere yang tercipta memberi sumbangan besar untuk game ini.Bahkan di awal cerita dan beberapa lokasi, atmoshpere nya bisa membuat player berfikir 2x untuk memainkan game ini malam hari.STORYPada dasarnya story di XCOM EU hanyalah moving timeline. Tapi disini kita akan terasa membangun cerita kita disini, melatih pasukan dan bertempur bersama mereka membuat sensasi tersendiri yang akan(secara pasif) berhubungan di akhir cerita GAMEPLAYDengan menjadi Komandan/Pemimpin dari Proyek XCOM ini player harus menjaga agar Teror Alien di bumi(10 Negara?) tidak berkembang. Player secara garis besar akan dapat/harus:- Memimpin Markas dan Pasukan khusus di tiap Misi - Melakukan Riset Teknologi- Melakukan Pembangunan MissionUntuk misi, player akan melakukan Scan di Ruang Control Utama untuk melacak lokasi UFO atau menunggu laporan Penculikan oleh Alien. Setelah menemukan atau mendapat laporan maka Player akan mengirim Skyranger ke lokasi yang bersangkutan. TETAPI, untuk misi penculikan player hanya boleh memilih 1 dari setiap 3 Laporan Penculikan yang ada yang berarti Player harus memilih dengan tepat agar Teror tetap terkendali karena kalau sampai Teror di suatu negara melewati batas maka Negara tersebut akan mengundurkan diri dari Proyek XCOM yang artinya akan mempersulit player karena pendapatan untuk kebutuhan XCOM akan berkurang. Riset/ResearchPlayer harus melakukan riset agar dapat menyamai atau bahkan menandingi Teknologi Alien. Mulai dari melakukan Autopsy mayat Alien, Menciptakan Senapan Plasma sampai membangun Jet berteknologi Alien sangat dibutuhkan demi menandingi kemampuan dan kemajuan teknologi Alien.PembangunanMembangun Markas XCOM menjadi Markas Organisasi paling maju sepanjang sejarah manusia adalah hal yang menyenangkan dan membuat frustasi. Dengan tampilan ""Rumah Semut"" yang dapat zoom-in/zoom-out player seakan melihat kehidupan kecil yang sedang berjuang melawan kehancuran mereka dari balik kaca. Selain pembangunan ruangan dan kebutuhan tenaga, player juga dapat(diharuskan) membangun Satelite agar dapat memantau tiap negara yang masih berdiri dan dalam perlindungan XCOM.CustomizationLagi, untuk game yang bergenre strategy XCOM EU mempunyai Customisasi yang sangat luas. player bisa mengubah nama, suara, ras, rambut, warna armor yang digunakan pasukan secara individual. In My Opinion ini sangat sangat membuat kita semakin masuk jauh ke dalam dunia XCOM EU. Bayangkan, membuat karakter seperti teman/pacar lalu di suatu misi mereka jadi makanan Alien? yup, Galau Confirmed~.Final Verdict8/10Untuk kamu yang suka tantangan dan khususnya strategy games cepet-cepet beli game ini. Worth every receh yang ada di celengan ayam kamu.Footnote: Ini adalah review pertama OP dengan bahasa Indonesia, maaf bila ada percampuran bahasa yang baku dan tidak baku. Segala masukan dan saran akan sangat di hargai bagi OP yang masih berkembang ini.Sebenernya gak ngerti juga kenapa ada yang mau baca sampe bawah sini, tapi terima kasih xDMau diskusi tentang game  atau Review ini? silahkan ketik REG (spasi) Libiral *plak*			"

												I am a big fan of the original UFO&XCOM. This was de facto first game I ever bought. The new one is unfortunately worse, however still worth recommending. The problem with the new XCOM is, it is too short. You're racing with aliens for techs and advancement and when you're finally there, able to release your full potential and enjoy it, it's done.			"

												A striking, fresh and faithful reboot of a classic game- made immersive and engrossing with elegant design, appealing graphics, and non-wonky interface. XCOM challenges you to do it all: make tough tactical choices with your squad, and strategic ones with panicky nations around the world. There's nothing like that primal scream you let out when your hand-picked assault element gets vaporized, or when your rooftop sniper picks off a Sectoid Commander like a bolt out of the blue. Sure, there are weaker elements, like the air intercepts, limited maps, or simple dig'n'build antfarm base, but they're ourweighed by the appeal and challenge of This fun, well-built game.			"

												If you like turn based strategy games, this game is for you. Even after I've played through this game, I continue to come back and play it, even months between playthroughs. It is kinda glitchy with a mouse and keyboard, I'm not sure if these get fixed with the controller or not. Its a hard game though, if you dont want to try, dont play XCOM. You have to try, you have to think you cant just rush a turn, the game will punish you for it. The one thing that is infuriating with the game, is the game is true with its percentages. 99% is NOT a garentee. You have a 1% chance to miss. Its possible. I cant tell you the amount of times iv'e had a 99% hit chance, and missed, leading me to lose the game or something. Of course, this happens about 1/100 times. So its not super common, but its definatly clear that just cause your percentage chance to hit is high, doesnt garentee the hit. This fact might ruin the game for some people.			"

												God DAYUM this game fun and addictive. This goes out as one the best games ever made. Gameplay revolves around turn-based strategic shooting with various classes to fight various aliens. After you kill or capture these aliens and loot them of their belongings, you can use them to unlock new weapons, armor, and other things to make your squad more badass. Mulitiplayer is great. Not only can you use soldiers but you can also use alien forces as part of your squad. My favorite part about the multiplayer is that when create a custom server and enable ""Infinite Skill Points,"" you can add 6 Cyber-Discs to your squad and listen to your opponet's derped reaction as he or she shouts ""OH MAH GAWD, YOU NOOB, I HATE YOU, SCREW THIS GAME I QUIT"" as he or she rage quitsGet this game A.S.A.P. or at least try the demo.Side effects may include: Becoming anti-social, loss of job, loss of girlfriend or boyfriend, massive drops in grades at school.

												Quite an engaging little game, this is.As a first-time XCOM player, I must say that Enemy Unknown is one of the better turn-based games I've played in a while. I spent a great deal of time hoarding my resources and hiding within my labs in order to obtain the most high-tech weapons, just because I tend to get rather attached to my troops; having to gun down your most powerful commando after he's been zombified by a Chryssalid is a disturbing prospect. Even with the game getting disappointingly simple and trivial once you've got your entire squad at maximum rank with the best skills, the biggest weapons and the highest psi (the only squad deaths coming from my own carelessness or from a completely unacceptable critical kill), XCOM: Enemy Unknown is definitely something I enjoy playing and supporting. Currently on my eighth game with no plans of stopping for good coming anytime soon. P.S: XCOM: Enemy Within makes the whole experience even better, by the way. Get it!			"

The only problem is a few bugs with the camera system. Either buy this at a store or when it's on sale, that way you don't waste as much as just buying it from a Target or Walmart.Ok, the story line is set with your computers current date. That is the day of the invasion, you send Delta-squad in to respond to a distress call. Then your whole squad dies and there is one survivor. You are given your first major choice.  Where to settle your base. Each with a minor boost early or late game. Then the game gives you a satalite and a location to send it to. Then the real game starts.Gameplay you ask? It runs like a RTS game, you go here and reload your gun. But you go there using a speical abillity and kill that Sectiod. Four classes your soilders can use, Sniper, Heavy, Support, and Assult. They each have a pro and con. You level up your selected crew that you brought on a mission, to the rank of Colonel.Multiplayer, gives you all of the units from the main game, with a point limit.

												In XCOM: Enemy Unknown, the earth is gradually coming under attack from extraterrestrials seeking to kill us all. As the head of the XCOM project, a secret organization funded by nations throughout the world to fight the aliens, you manage your squad of soldiers on the ground in turn based tactics, the direction of your research labs (better armor or better weapons?), and even general base-building (Should I go with more research labs or a power generator?). Decisions, decisons.As time goes by, the aliens will step up their offense, sending down a variety of aliens from the dreaded tank-like mutons to the spider-like zombie spawning Chryssalid. But shall you prioritize the correct research, you'll get better weapons to combat the ever-growing threat. The combat in the game as I mentioned, is turn-based tactical, as you control a squad of 4 (at the start) performing a search/destroy mission. You soldiers level up as they perform missions and kill aliens. They can be promoted into one of 4 classes namely Assault, Support, Heavy, and Sniper. Each with their special abilities. As your men level up, you'll begin to feel for your men, each with their own unique nicknames. You could even rename them in to your friends if you like! But be careful though, if you don't get your men into cover, they will die. Alot. XCOM is an unforgiving game where emphasis is based on being aware of your surroundings and efficiently using cover. The game is best played on Ironman mode where the game overwrites your save file with each turn you make, so if you lose your colonel, well, you can't go back in time to reverse that poor decision you made. The game is made by Firaxis, makers of Civilization series, so you can expect a top notch quality game. 5/5 GOTY 2012Edit: It's even better if you could get the expansion for the game, XCOM: Enemy Within. Just released a month ago, it features a whole new variety of maps (so you won't replay the same map for the upteenth time.), more enhancements for your men featuring the power-fist wielding mech suit (to punch those darn aliens!), genetic mods for your men to become something like Captain America! And a whole new enemy faction; Exalt. These buggers want to use alien tech for world domination, akin to an evil version of XCOM. They can sabotage your base, steal your credits etc. But you can take them out later in the game. XCOM Enemy Within also mixes it up with a whole new alien resource to collect when on the ground; meld. They can be used for gene mods and building mech suits for your men. But be careful though. These things self-destruct after a certain number of turns, thus mixing up the combat! RIsk = Reward baby!XCOM ENEMY WITHIN is highly recommended for enhancing your XCOM experience! It's easily one of the best DLCs out there this past year. 5/5As usual XCOM is not for the faint hearted. Missed that 95% chance shot with your sniper, and getting your men killed the next turn? That's XCOM BABY! Have fun Commander!			"

												In XCOM: Enemy Unknown players are tasked with running a military base who's sole purpose is to defend the Earth from alien attacks. The base view is presented in an ant farm style, which allows you to explore the structure of your base as though it is a living system. Unfortunately in this iteration of XCOM satellite uplinks/nexus are so vital to your success (especially on harder difficulties) that you are forced into a fairly standard base makeup. If you don't focus on getting your satellites up, you will almost certainly lose.The main focus of the game is the battles, which on the whole are interesting and tense. Cover is vital during tactical battles, and if you do not use appropriate cover on harder difficulties you will quickly lose your valuable soldiers as often times taking one hit means death. Forcing yourself to use Iron Man difficulty or otherwise not reloading your saves is almost certainly the most interesting to play the game and means that losing a soldier is permanent. But it's this chance of permanent loss that brings so much tension and excitement to the battles. There is nothing like the joy of nailing an alien on a 25% chance shot and save a squad member's life, or the sting that comes from missing a 97% shot you thought for sure was in the bag. Soldiers rank up from battles and learn more and more abilities as they do. Successfully completing missions and killing aliens you can recover their technology in order to research it and further improve your soldiers. The visual upgrades your soldiers get from new equipment is probably one of the most appealing aspects of the game. Seeing a loved soldier move up from standard gear to become a future soldier with glowing guns and sleek armor is fantastic.Unfortunately in the battles the AI opponents do not follow the same rules as the player units until they are 'activated' by coming into field of view of your soldiers. Until they activate they are essentailly one 'unit' and will teleport around the battlefield (outside of your view usually) into positions of varying believability. For instance one time I cleared a building by killing all the sectoids within, and then my soliders heard a sound coming from the neighbouring building. As I stacked my soldiers up on the doors and prepared to breach the building they suddenly heard sounds behind them. I sent them back to the first building only to find more sectoids had teleported onto the ones that I just killed, and were no longer in the building my soldiers heard them in only two turns ago. Another case of this is when my rookie soldiers began to panic and hunker down, I once had a group of sectoids teleport in the middle of my soliders! They quickly took cover on every side of my soldiers and were flanking from so many angles that there was no chance success at all. Another way in which the game 'cheats' is during some missions (usually 'council' missions like escorting VIPs or defusing bombs) aliens will simply drop in from the sky. They'll either drop in out of view, behind you, in perfect sniping positions, at your flank, at all of your flanks... in other words, pretty much anywhere. There is a pattern to when they drop in, but there is no warning, or rather the warning comes as they are dropping on top of you which kind of renders it useless.While there are certainly some problems and questionable decisions in this reboot, overall it is a very worthy successor to the original. XCOM: Enemy Unknown kind of screws up the base building by railroading you into satellite focus, and the tactical battles by cheating the rules your soldiers are forced to follow. On the other hand they enhance the experience by allowing your soldiers to learn interesting abilities when they rank up, including some interesting equipment and enemy types, and just making the game much shinier and easier to play.Overall it is clearly one of the most solid strategy games on Steam despite it's flaws. It is one of my favourites in my collection and I'm sure that will only be reinforced by Enemy Within.			"

												Being one of those people who played the original X-COM on the PC, four disks containing four megabytes of VGA glory, naturally I had already set a very high bar for this game in my mind.  Was Firaxis up to the challenge?  I saw the early reviews and was prepared for disappointment.  Only one base?  The ant-farm is just a cheap gimmick!  Where did managing my action points go?  A two-move turn system?  Gah, why did they have to dumb down another great game for all the clueless mouthbreathers that need to get off my lawn, dagburnit?!But then I played it and something unexpected happened: I liked it.  I liked enough to work past my initial skepticism and play more... and then I liked it even more.  The class system, which I originally thought would just be annoying, actually added to the game because I was no longer sitting around with a calculator & micromanaging my TUs.  Instead I was playing some kind of NeoTokyo chess game with giant bugs and lasers.  The pace was perfectly set to the ""action cam"" shots"" - which, again, I originally thought of as just a cheap gimmick but in the end really added a sense of immersion to the game once I got into it.Likewise, though I was down to a single base that single base had enough going on it to still keep me engrossed in what was happening there.  Soon I was glad that it was the only one I had to worry about, because I had my hands full and was loving it.  The graphics, while cartoonish at times, nonetheless gave my soldiers a real sense of personality.  Most of all, and this is something one rarely hears about a video game, the dialog and voice acting was excellent all around.Yes, it had a few minor flaws - limited maps and a few compeltely scripted missions - but they were far outweighed by the sheer number of things that were done right.  Just when I thought they had finally done real justice to the X-COM name they went around and topped it with Enemy Within.Let me put it this way: Enemy Within will make your inner nine-year old explode with joy.  The first time I had a mech-trooper power-punch a Chryssalid through guardrail and clear off the side of a highway I decided that one scene was worth every penny of that particular DLC right then and there.  It's like they took everything that UFO Aftershock did wrong with their failed attempt at making mutants and cyberaugmented soliders, ran it through some kind of genius machine and out popped the Right Way to Do It.So take it from a lifelong X-COM fan and certified skeptic: Don't let fears or hesitations about this incarnation hold you back.  This is a true X-COM game and you won't regret buying it.			"

												A Review Mostly for me so I know I’ve completed the story, as well as feedback on the game.My Thoughts:- What an amazing game WOW, been playing this for some time non-stop now, the graphics are good *can be improved* story’s not bad and marathon mode can make the game last longer then with the DLC makes the game even better.Achievements:-  83 of 85 (98%) achievements earnedGraphics:- Really nice graphics if you run it maxed out and use some of the graphic tweaks on the web makes it much more wow.Story:- As commander you lead a global team to fight the aliens that have invaded earth, you are the world’s last line of defence.Replayability:- If you liked this game as much as I do you will still be playing it for weeks or months still.What Could Be Added? :- TBARating:- 9 ½ / 10			"

												XCOM: EU was a refreshing game. To me, it went back to the roots of strategy and did not let me know. There had been a lack of decent tactial games in my opinion in recent years and when I first played it, I was blown away. The game, to me, does a decent job of faithfully reproducing the XCOM experience without the cumbersome navigation of the original games.			"

												One of the best strategy game I have every played, with the new dlc Enemy Within the game is double the fun and a lot more interesting, this game is enjoyable and lets you go at your own pace, however if on easy difficulty with a save option all the challenge goes out of the window, although it is a good way to start and complete the game then go over again to challenge yourself and trust me, this is a game that is easily replayable. I give it a Den oUTa Den!			"

												Having played the original XCOM with my father,  this new version has ironed out the annoying and unnecessary aspects of the original. Does anyone else remember how irritating and buggy the original was? The only things that really let me down were the absence of HQ invasions, the low variety of missions, and the level of creepiness and fear that an alien-themed game should have is lower than I would like, which the intro starts out strong in, but it quickly stops being creepy.  It was also heartwrenching when you name your squad after your  friends and loved ones, only for them to be killed by a chryssalid and turned into a zombie.9/10			"

												If you plan on buying this game, then do it. Its worth it, totally.The feeling that you get when playing it, is undescribeable.When you get to a UFO crash site in forest, in night, you are scared AF.When you get flanked, you are f**ked AF (its like F**kception). YOU NEED TO be economic and tactical, because this game is not so easy as you might think. Even on easiest difficulty, the game itsself is hard , escecially for new players.PLOT TWIST (?) :The ""Bad Ending"" is canon to XCOM 2, and its terrifying. What if The Council was controled by Sectoid Commander all the time? What if they were testing us? Full on invasion would be super evective and Earth would be conquered in about few weeks. So what do they want?XCOM 2 is supposed to be ""better"" than EU, but still, its not scary, not terrifying, and endings are not soo rewarding as you think.This is amazing, even tho its 3 years old.Unfortunately, the use of weapons is limited, but thats where Long War Mod can help.11/10 - Scros10/10 - IGN ( totally not fake )			"

												9/10If you're new to the franchise, give this a shot, get the demo, grab the game in a sale, you won't regret it.Look at that long list of awards?They didn't happen by accident, bub.If you're a die-hard fan of the original XCOM, or Terror From the Deep, this one will come as a surprise. Treat it as a new version, the first alien war never took place... Yeah, I hated when they did that to Star Trek, too.It's simple, and easy to get into. A LOT of decisions have been taken out of your hands, but there are new choices too. It's a lot shorter that the older version. But really the first one was pretty grindy in a ""I'm killing bugs while I wait for my new suits/ship"" kinda way and a lot of TFTD missions were just ""get out of the triton, see Lobster, RUN! Get to da choppa!"" (right? be honest, now) How many good soldiers did YOU lose on missions that were strategically low value? In this one they ALL count. Now, chryssalids look as scary as they should, terror missions are tense, R+D comes at a sensible rate. The move/action system is an interesting challenge. No more taking a step at a time until you see a bug, or a shot from one. you choose a destination and commit to it. If that location turns out to be unsafe, bug out or duck!			"

												XCOM: Enemy Within is not going to persuade anyone that didn’t enjoy Enemy Unknown, but for those that were looking to get more out of their XCOM, Enemy Within is a fantastic addition and highly recommendable. Ultimately, there are only tiny complaints. Graphical glitches do remain from Enemy Unknown and happen from time to time, EXALT is really not scary at all after the initial reveal, there aren’t a whole lot of extra maps for regular missions and although the new alien enemies are nice they don’t offer a whole lot extra and seeing even more types would then have been great. On the other hand, the simple addition of EXALT does nicely shake up the game and the extra council missions are incredibly fun to do. The MEC class is a fantastic addition that is definitely satisfying to use and offers new strategic options, the Meld resource is a good extra goal to chase after, and the numerous extra research, foundry and of course gene mods are certainly a welcome addition that only serve to make this already highly enjoyable game that much better.

												At a time where FPS, RPG and action games appear on the market everyday, the return of XCOM is welcomed with a great satisfaction. XCOM is back in full force between humans and aliens, though it's not the same game as its predecessor.In short, good game, BUT not great. You have to ignore the payed reviewers that think this game has nothing at all wrong with it. It is similar to the original in structure and gameplay, but in general it is highly simplified.Game: 7.5/10Graphic: 8.0/10100% Achievement : Easy | Medium | Hard | Very Hard			"

												I'm normally not that into strategy games, especially when they're turn based. Somehow they feel slow, and I just want to unwind without thinking about things too much. But Xcom managed to pull me right in. It succesfully mixes turn based strategy with a bit of management, and,... guess what ? It's great fun !Xcom uses a certain graphical style, which reminded me a bit of Team Fortress 2. It's not super detailed by any means, but I still liked the clean look of things.The combat is brilliant, with the camera zooming in when a certain action is taken. It makes the combat feel exciting. Completing missions and killing enemies will level up your soldiers. You'll learn to take care of them, because when they're a higher level some of their abilities might just save you and your squad.The story is nothing special, but the way the whole game is executed is just amazing. You'll have to make some difficult choices (concerning building certain items/facilities and the missions you choose to accept), none of which are right or wrong.The sounds and music also add to the atmosphere of the entire game.Also, for a single-player game it's surprisingly lenghty as well. It should take most players well over 20 hours to complete, especially if you mess up your first few games (like me). Highly recommended ![Rating: 90/100]			"

												As the player you control Xcom a superregional military force armed and funded with the purpose to eliminate extraterrestrials. The countries that fund Xcom each desire you’re services and as they get attacked it falls on you to resolve whatever situations arise. The aliens will attack three countries simultaneously and since you only own one transport ship (no matter what) you may only respond to one in every three attacks. When this occurs you will weigh the rewards and aid the wealthiest or most convenient country… the other two countries will “panic” and if neglected for long enough they will quit Xcom and withdraw a portion of your monthly funding… Heres the kicker… every time a country is left unaddressed in a crisis their panic level will rise by 2…. However every other country on the same continent will rise by one!  There are a few game mechanics that allow you to delay you’re inevitable defeat but nothing to out rightly stop it. You must beat the game before you lose eight nations.So to recap1. You will buy aircraft in sets of four at a time and you can have a hundred soldiers on standby but you can only own one transport ship and therefore can only respond to one third of all alien related crisis… Also the transport ship only seats six at a time… when upgraded….2. Countries will inevitably quit, when they quit you cannot provide any incentive to bring them back into the fold. You will lose when eight countries quit because no paramilitary group can perform efficiently without the support of Argintina, Nigeria, Cairo, South Africa, Brazil and three other second world (I’m feeling generous) nations.That’s the premise. What about the game play?When the aliens “attack” a city you usually get there after they have inflicted the maximum amount of damage they can given the ordinance at their disposal. You’ll walk through urban areas and note that despite a few corpses they are completely depopulated. The only sounds emanating from the city are non specific alien growling, I found it strongly nostalgic and reminiscent of Doom. Now the kicker is that the aliens aren’t engaged in any particular activity when you discover them, in fact they don’t actually exist on the level at all until a member of your squad reaches a predetermined point. Once you step on the games invisible red wire poof! a plethora of alien life appears. They promptly interrupt you’re turn and fan out and occupy the best defensive or offensive positions. Since the game is ostensibly a strategy game you will scramble for better cover or attempt to flank them… only to get counter flanked by a second or even third group of spawning aliens.Here’s the fun part. The aliens cover more ground then you, they have more support skills and offensive abilities then you, they have significantly better aim then you, Before long they get guys that are tougher than yours. They even “wallhack” and will target members of your squad that they haven’t rightfully seen. The first rule of Xcom is that the aliens outnumber you… on earth.The core gameplay of any turn based squad strategy game is ultimately going to be about cover and how well cover is integrated into the actual game play. Well heres the word. Most enemies are able to traverse great distances on ground. Some of them also have abilities that directly negate or ignore cover. “Thin men” can spit venom over obstacles to hit soldiers they haven’t seen. Floaters can fly off the map and reappear at its opposite end ext. In this game cover is over rated. You’re guys are going to be shot through walls, cars and hills. In turn You’re guys… earth’s last hope and the super elite of every nations military will consistently miss shots on enemies  in plain sight on level terrain with no hint of obstacles or cover in the way.  Recap1. You’re soldiers are all near sighted. They can see for maybe thirty yards on a clear day, not counting obstacles. This game mechanic is done to hide the fact that the aliens will spawn at designated locations just outside you’re field of vision. 2. The Alien AI is rudimentary at best. They will occupy defensive features… If they spawn right next to them3.. The strategic nature of the game is purely aesthetic. If you attempt to fan out and flank them you will only spawn more aliens and get caught in a cross fire.  In conclusion. Turn based strategy games are a niche genre and companies that cater to a niche get catered to by the niche. There is no logical need for improvement and their first priority is rightfully to keep their fans happy. An outsider will play this game and realize very quickly that while they thought they were taking home a strategy game they were actually getting a glorified version of Russian roulette, a random number generator. While it has great aesthetic value, strong writing and passable voice acting it brings very little to the table that wasn’t present in the 90s and relies very heavily on mechanics that have been defunct since the days of John Romero… There are a number of mods that seek to improve Xcom and fix many of the aforementioned quirks but it’ll be many years before I give Xcom a third chance. Until then if I get a strong urge to play a turn based strategy game I’ll return to 1997’s Final Fantasy Tactics which still stands at the top of the genre.PS: *SPOILERS* The enemy is the aliens.

												I want to recommend this game so badly. It is absolutely a fantastic game and there is a good reason why it is so widely recommended. HOWEVER, I encountered so many rage inducing bugs and glitches that I cannot, in good faith, recommend  XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Enemies appearing out of thin air and killing nearby squadmates, a bizarre glitch that happens when you try to perform an action and then reload your weapon causing you to have to reload the mission, because you then cannot perform any further actions, and finally percentage values for aiming that are inaccurate. (I missed three shots that were 100% back to back to back). The saddest part is that, according to fans, many of these issues are solved if you fork out the cash for the expansion. It's not worth my keyboard, mouse, or a hole in the wall from these rage inducing issues. Considering I purchased the game years after release there is no chance that these bugs will be fixed unless I want to pay for an expansion that supposedly fixes these issues.			"

												This game is brilliant, however if you wish to get the biggest bang for your buck buy XCOM: Enemy Within alongisde this for maximum enjoyment. The ending was interesting, but I will go into more detail in a spoiler tag. There is destructable terrain everywhere. The weapons are lovely and the classes slot together perfectly. Armour upgrades can all be specialised to the units (e.g. use armour 1 for the sniper, 2 for heavy, etc.) without much thought, but still with a lot of precision. I can't actually think of very many downsides. Everything is really good.The ending however; (Spoilers below. Mouse over for words, skip to ignore)Double-tap the end boss in the head with an elite sniper and the boss dies. Although there are all these aliens around the main device, you can just ignore them, kill the end boss guy, and win the game. That was kind of disapointing. However, I got one of the coolest deaths ever on my mecha guy. Had him punch one of those big robots to death, only followed by another peaking around and blowing him up. He died a heros deathBuy this and help me get the SHIV renamed the ""Armed Roomba with a box on it.""			"

												First off I'm not a fan of turn-based games but XCOM really blew my mind.The gameplay is just so well made with it's cover system, the weapons and what damage they do to the environment and how you feel connected to your soldiers.As each soldier has their own nationality, facial features and names (facial features and names can be changed) it makes every single one stand out and sometimes you'll do anything to keep them alive. There's also an option that prevents you to save during missions which will make you think twice about what move you're going to make as every single mistake can change everything during a mission.There's 5 classes (6 in enemy within) all with their own very important roles. Each time they level you get to choose a perk in their skill tree, normally each class has their set perks to choose from but there's an option that makes the perks random so you could end up with a soldier that has a perfect set of perks from different classes.XCOM also offers the ability to build up your own base, do research and create items and weapons and it's more or less up to you in what order you want to do things.The Enemy Within expansion gives you a new class, a heavy cyborg/mech kind of class aswell as implants for regular soldiers that will boost them quite alot.The missions in The Enemy Within are the same as in Enemy Unknown so if you think you'll only be playing the game once I would really recommend getting the expansion right away as it offers alot more options to your playthrough.Even if you're normally not a turn-based gamer I would recommend trying this game, you won't be disappointed.

													XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a Turn-Based Strategy game centering on squad-level tactics. You are in command of XCOM, an organization devoted to fighting off the threat of alien invaders. Your mission is to protect the Earth from this invasion, stopping alien abductions, terror attacks on population centers, and otherwise keeping everyone from panicking and defunding your project, gradually accumulating superior weapons and technology from the aliens so that you have a fighting chance.	Overall, the game is quite strong; the macro-level stuff is fairly addictive in its skinner-box techniques as there is always something new which is going to come just around the corner, and the combat-level stuff works well enough, though it is not perfect either. On the whole, it really makes you want to play through the whole game, though at the very end of the game it may end up feeling a bit strange; there comes a point at which you are really in control of the situation and the earlier desperation goes away, and about that same point the research starts really drying up, meaning that if you take too long to finish the game, it could potentially get a bit dry; the last couple missions before I beat the game were the weakest in the game simply because I had figured it out and there was little threat from the game at that point.	Still, I played through and beat the game in three or four sittings, which is always a sign that a game has you hooked. "

												First off I'm not a fan of turn-based games but XCOM really blew my mind.The gameplay is just so well made with it's cover system, the weapons and what damage they do to the environment and how you feel connected to your soldiers.As each soldier has their own nationality, facial features and names (facial features and names can be changed) it makes every single one stand out and sometimes you'll do anything to keep them alive. There's also an option that prevents you to save during missions which will make you think twice about what move you're going to make as every single mistake can change everything during a mission.There's 5 classes (6 in enemy within) all with their own very important roles. Each time they level you get to choose a perk in their skill tree, normally each class has their set perks to choose from but there's an option that makes the perks random so you could end up with a soldier that has a perfect set of perks from different classes.XCOM also offers the ability to build up your own base, do research and create items and weapons and it's more or less up to you in what order you want to do things.The Enemy Within expansion gives you a new class, a heavy cyborg/mech kind of class aswell as implants for regular soldiers that will boost them quite alot.The missions in The Enemy Within are the same as in Enemy Unknown so if you think you'll only be playing the game once I would really recommend getting the expansion right away as it offers alot more options to your playthrough.Even if you're normally not a turn-based gamer I would recommend trying this game, you won't be disappointed.

													XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a Turn-Based Strategy game centering on squad-level tactics. You are in command of XCOM, an organization devoted to fighting off the threat of alien invaders. Your mission is to protect the Earth from this invasion, stopping alien abductions, terror attacks on population centers, and otherwise keeping everyone from panicking and defunding your project, gradually accumulating superior weapons and technology from the aliens so that you have a fighting chance.	Overall, the game is quite strong; the macro-level stuff is fairly addictive in its skinner-box techniques as there is always something new which is going to come just around the corner, and the combat-level stuff works well enough, though it is not perfect either. On the whole, it really makes you want to play through the whole game, though at the very end of the game it may end up feeling a bit strange; there comes a point at which you are really in control of the situation and the earlier desperation goes away, and about that same point the research starts really drying up, meaning that if you take too long to finish the game, it could potentially get a bit dry; the last couple missions before I beat the game were the weakest in the game simply because I had figured it out and there was little threat from the game at that point.	Still, I played through and beat the game in three or four sittings, which is always a sign that a game has you hooked. "

												I've played the series since they first appeared and I'm an X-Com fan, you may take my recommendation with a grain of salt :)The first one (UFO Defense) was a blast. It is one of my most treasured games of all time. It involved a LOT of micromanagement, from the ""which kind of ammo"" for certain weapons (explosive, incendiary, armor piercing...) to buy (yes, you need to actually buy ammo), to the soldiers selection based on the stats (recruitment involved). You even have to hire scientists, engineers and so on. And then you have the ""proper"" game, the action. OMG, it was difficult, but really addictive.XCOM EU is a different game, not just the same one with better graphics, easier interface and ""dumbed down"" micromanagement. No. A different animal. A beautiful and different animal. Is more focused on the action (TBS)... and its really well executed.I like to play it on a slow pace, enjoying every bit of it. Right now, I'm around 30 hours, and maybe 50% complete... and I'm not tired of it AT ALL... can't stop playing it. You have to understand that 30 hours is a lot to me, because I can only play about an hour per day (if I'm lucky)... and add my backlog to that... 30 hours is really good, I really have to love the game to reach that.If you liked the original X-Com, trust me, you'll love this one. Maybe you'll miss some aspects, but you'll like all the new perspective. If you don't know the originals, don't worry, you'll love this one even moreFiraxis did it once again. Bravo!			"

												I have a love-hate relationship with Enemy Unknown. I Love tactical squad based games, and the story elements (Not that there is much of a story here)through the campaign your first time around feel pretty good. It gives off a good sense of progression. However, between the bugs, glitches, and percentage based attacks, I found myself wanting to strangle my monitor and many many occasions. If you can get passed the (game-breaking) bugs and don't mind the luck based attacking I definitely recommend iron will once you get a feel for the game. I think this type of game should be played that way, but I can't recommend the harder difficulty unless you need something to push you toward suicide.			"

												This is a remake of the popular XCOM game in the 90's. Although I was not able to actually play that game and was only able to watch videos of it over the internet, I still see how a good game it was before. Fast forward 2012 and we now have XCOM: Enemy Unknown, the remake of the original XCOM, Which I bought from this website. This game will give you different kinds of emotions while playing it. You will feel fearful of these aliens who tries to invade and kill your squad members. You will feel tension with the different member countries of the council due to the politics it entails as they ask for assistance with these invasions. You will feel stressed out on which upgrades you need to do first, but you will also feel satisfaction whenever you upgraded something and is extremely useful for your next missions.and lastly, you will feel a bond and attachment to your squad members which will be with you through thick and thin, from being a novice up to the time they really pack a punch. One wrong decision may spell the end for your squad member and you can never bring him back. This is the epitome of strategy. You will never be successful without thinking everything through. You will enjoy this game with all its rich content, so try it out and don't leave the enemy remain unknown.			"

												In short, this is a worthy successor to the throne, whilst creating its very own in the process.Being a veteran of the old X-Com series from Enemy Unknown (1994) to X-Com Apocalypse (1997) with a touch of the spinoffs like Interceptor, it would be humble of me to state that I'm a fan of the game, its universe, and the genre it resides in.Admittedly, the news of a new X-Com game was a mixed blessing to my eyes. We all wanted the original to be remade in next-gen glory. What we get now is an honest homage of the original, lovingly reimagined for today's audience complete with its focus vs aliens (with a majority returning with a reimagined and even cooler look), turn-based squad tactics with global defense strategy on top, and in my eyes, more than a worthy successor to the throne that X-Com sits on and moreso, becoming its own thing. This is why I refer it to XCOM, instead of X-Com of old.I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves strategy (SRPG/TRPG-style like FF Tactics would feel at home), loves emergent stories from your experiences (that favorite soldier making a valiant last-stand to save the rest of his squad will stick to you far longer than a ham-fisted voice-acted cutscene that many other AAA titles try to pass off as something important), and loves to play the odds, which are always stacked against you.

The down side's were the blackmarket you couldn't sell or buy stuff like X-COM UFO Defence, Why do WE have to pay for two more seat's on the Skyranger that should have been a given. The enemy spawn is ramdom, Then the enemy would get a free move so they can run and hide or take cover. I would save ever turn because of these down side's, But don't get me wrong the game is Great and Fun I just like to Save a lot too. I also have XCOM Enemy Unknown - Elite Soldier Pack DLC.

												Turn-based Strategy at it's best.If you intend to buy I'd suggest getting the complete version so you can have both XCOM Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within. XCOM: Enmey Within is the expansion and makes the game much better maybe dare I say twice as good. I did buy them separate and had a blast with just Xcom Enemy Unknown but now i have the expansion it's like a new game again.Lot's of replayability, you can customise your troopers how you wish. Missions can get a little tiring but they do have so many it'll never seem like a carbon copy of the last mission --- especially with the addition of the expansion Enemy Within.Highlyy recommend if you like the turn based strategy genre. If you've played the previous Xcom games this version does them them proud.			"

You can research technologies, build base, engineer new items and weapons, launch satelites to the orbit, shoot down ufos and the best thing of all you can kick some Aliens asses out of the Earth! 9/10 for me, DLC's and patchec will make it 10/10 I'm sure of it.

												Yes, this game was made by the same guys who made Civilization. Yes, you will say ""just one more turn/battle/other increment of play"" until you realize you've been playing longer than you meant to. But that's a good thing.XCOM is divided into two sorts of games. There's the management portion, where you manage your XCOM base, research new technologies, launch satelites, destroy UFOs, manage you (initially very small) budget and try not to let the worldwide panic go up too high. This portion of the game starts out fairly challenging, with multiple countries in states of panic depening on your choices and a limited budget that you must decide what to do with. However, this challenge soon becomes non-existent. Late in the game you end up no longer facing the choice of which of two countries to help, and panic seldom goes over a single bar. Though to be fair, this really only happens when you're completing all of your missions without fail.The other portion of the game is the tactical combat portion. In this part you send your squad of up to 6 soldiers into specific missions. This part remains engaging throughout. It plays like a turn-based, cover-based shooter. Which is an interesting mix. Later in the game you get more abilities for your soldiers, which creates some interesting choices. Facing a new type of enemy can be interesting as you don't know what kinds of things they are capable of (will they do heavy damage? Mind control your soldiers? Do damage to you if they die near you?) though that effect wears off when you've seen all there is to offer. Death for your soldiers is permanant, but in some cases you can save them by getting them a medikit when they fall.The two portions of the game are engaging on their own, and feed into one another nicely.I do have a few gripes with the game though. I wish when soldiers went down they would ALWAYS be able to be revived with a medikit, as it seems to be based on chance now, and can be frustrating. Late game can be a bit unchallenging as well, but that's really only an issue if you're just grinding to max out your levels before the final battle. (Which is easier than I thought it would be, so grinding isn't recommended anyway.) Even when doing that though, a wrong move can still mean death for your soldiers. The ending is also kind of... meh. Lots of questions left, few answers. It does leave things open for a sequel though. I highly recommend this game if you're into thinking-type games. If you're looking for another mindless shooter where you blow up aliens... look elsewhere. Great replay value as well, with multiple difficulty settings.			"

												I made a review of this game a while back and at the end of that i said something on the lines of ""the game in its current state is 6/10, 8/10 if patched properly.""And take a quess what i would give right now. 5/10, but numbering is subjective to the reviewers own personal scale, lets try something i know everyone remembers. The dreaded school-grade system.Before plastering the grade all over your faces, i might as well recap some of the main problems in this game.On the GAMEPLAY side, it is simplified greatly. Mostly for the console ports, this means little-to-no modification of squads inventory. Unless you count changing the off-hand items and body-armour, which i dont mind you..Movement and actions, are done by spending two (2) Action-Points. Now this sounded questionable to me the first time i played the game, but afterwards i came to the conclusion, that it is actually a good decision. It makes combat and strategic planning more questinable, knowing whether moving a soldier in that certain piece of cover (Il get to that point later), Protects him from any enemies that might appear behind the corner. And some of mote frantic combat bits are also made more tense with the finite number of actions you can do. Although, the game has a terrible tendency to CHEAT. Yes the AI cheats like a Free-to-player on mobile devices who got his hands on his moms credit-card.Multiple times, the AI takes an impossibly accurate shot. Through several walls and straight into the face of soldier who was in heavy cover and while in the tactical screen before going to combat, the AI decides to introduce three squads of baddies out of the blue, after you move one soldier just 5 meters (or the blue movement-indicator). This caused me a great pain when i decided to do the obligatory Ironman run. My poor assault specialist moved to a piece of cover i thought was safe at the time and suddenly 3 squads of Mutons appeared and pretty much circled the poor fellow. And as they circled the guy, the Mutons kept looking at eachother as asking ""Who brought the lube ?""And the vaguely-referencing to-intimacy situations didn't stop there, there were multiple other similiar happenings all the way throught. Argh.. i cannot talk about it, it gave me PTS.What else?... Graphics.Graphical quality is console-level. And by that i mean early Xbox360. Bland and boring, low-resolution and just overall... Meh.And while on the subject of graphics, i need to bring up the Unreal Engine. It does this game no favours. I'm trying to think game that came out at the same time as XCOM and used Unreal as its engine. But my brain draws blank. Unreal Engine has its quirks, and for some reason i always see glitches when playing XCOM, even today as i Rage-Quitted another Ironman session due to the AIs cheating ways.... The camera goes spaztic randomly, pointing in random directions getiing stuck in some places and generally being broken.And there is whole another bag of delightfull glitches always hiding somewhere. in case you didnt know im playing the base game, since Enemy Within cost a bit too much on release and when it actually was on sale i had no money. So im not entirely sure whether the bug-fixes were in the expansion, following the CapCom way of balancing with its fighting games, or do i just have an obsolete version or do i need to re-install the game again, for the umpthteenth time... Nope its up-to-date.Oh and another minor nitpick. The randomly forgets its set Graphics options. Out of the blue, just like that. b*llocks to that.Writing this is making me angry, not because of the game per-se. (Kinda funny that last word, it means A*SE [*R] in Finnish)Im angry because the game is just.... Just.... ADEQUATE.Alright you simpletons, better explain it properly:The game is a decent re-imagining of XCOM, but its buggy nature and other minor problems makes it lose its value as an XCOM game. The Original, which works just fine since it uses DosBox. Has more options and i just realised why i disliked this game, the forementioned lack of options on what to do and the finite resources thing.I cant go on about this, otherwise il be here the whole forthnight.. Suffice to say, XCOM lacks in all aspects that made the original good.But as a game on its own, i can recommend it.But, but, i would still ALSO recommed trying the original, i know its clunky as all hell and the AI blinsides your soldiers now and again, but after a while you learn how to deal with that and adapt accordingly. Something that the remake kinda lacks i might add.Alright, time for the obligatory grade thing.. lets see..Semi-solid remake, hell amount of bugs and glitches even after ""Patching"", AI cheats like a motherf*cker..Got it.C+When you think about it, you know why i gave it that grade.

												For those who criticise this game for not improving upon much except the visual presentation since the original series I have my own personal opinion on whether this game is worth getting or not. This game adds tons of entertainment with the ability to customise your own soldiers that start of as raw recruits until you eventually rank them up ot Colonel. You get such a close tie to your soldiers that loosing even one of them really hits you hard. You are able to customise their abilities upon them ranking up as well as customise their outfit appearance, general appearance, name, nickname, equipment etc. Although people criticise the price of the DLC's the Enemy Within DLC really adds a lot for the beginning and mid elements of the campaign with a new foe with it's own units, covert operations, base siege, two new aliens and some custom items with balances and changes to the game play itself. I am on my 9th game whiles writing this review and i finally have got satelite coverage over every continent with the only exception of having lost Africa to the alien invasion. If you like strategy, base related games, real time strategy along with alients AND EVEN ZOMBIES then definately check this game out as it has a lot of replay value. I can easily see myself getting up to 100 hours of game time when i have already played around 75 hours on this game. One of my best games ever! :)			"

												Forewarning: this review assumes you will be buying the Enemy Within DLC along with the base Enemy Unknown game. While it isn't required, you'll be missing out on some of the content described in this recommendation if you only grab the base game.XCOM, a game in which you lead a paramilitary extraterrestrial combat unit of the same name, is a hybrid of two different game types; on one hand, you have the tactical turn based combat pitting your squad of soldiers versus the invading alien force in various missions to counter their incursion onto Earth, with your troops often outnumbered and outgunned. On the other hand, you have the strategic research and development aspect that takes place at XCOM HQ in between missions, where you'll analyze and adapt alien technology for use by your soldiers, who will also gradually increase in combat effectiveness the more they're exposed to combat.While your soldiers will begin with simple conventional body armor and ballistic firearms, as the war and your arsenal of adapted alien technology stretches on into the later months of the year, you'll be presented with various options to further improve their equipment and skills, with access to tools such as flight enabled power armor and camouflage suits that blend your soldiers in with the environment, genetic enhancements that allow soldiers to leap onto buildings from ground level and emit bioelectric waves that detect invisible enemies, or even augment them into mech troopers equipped with miniguns and flamethrowers. All in all, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a very well crafted game that will test your skills and tactics in a variety of environments and situations, and can easily provide hundreds of hours of gameplay.

												Think strategically or die. That is the motto you live by in this awesome reboot of the long ignored but never faded title. After your first fight you get to head back to base and begin customizing soldiers the way you want, even so they are named after and resemble your friends and family, giving you just that much more investment in their continued survival. But soon the fights become more intense with choosing between moving your characters to better positions or taking the risk to stand your ground and fight. The enemies you face get progressively harder as you advance through the story (unless you're on a harder difficulty then then they get harder no matter how much you've progressed) and all of them have different ways of fighting you off. The tension is always up to 10 and goes to 11 on those times where you're outnumbered, outgunned and running low on medikits. Even if you make it back to base the tension does not let up. Different countries start to panic and threaten to leave the council that fund your operations. You live or die on the choices you make on a shoe-string budget. You even begin to sell off important assets just to make it a few more days. This game is concentrated intensity and it will have you biting your nails and praying for just one more well-placed shot/credit/day/less panic bar/engineer/scientist/mission/movement tile/round all the way into the wee hours of the morning. Buy this game and don't bother looking back.			"

												XCOM is quite simply one of, if not THE BEST, squad turn based strategy game I have ever played. Players take control of the commander of the XCOM project, a multi national funded organization formed to stop an extraterrestrial threat. Players have limited resources to prioritise over micro-managements in between missions.XCOM is great for a number of reasons, one of which is how well it makes the missions connect with the time back at base. Having to make the decision of whether or not I want to spend my last few credits on a satellite to then launch over a country before they pull out, or use them to fund for my whole team to have laser rifles to take on what I know is going to be a tough upcoming mission certainly does capture the pressure of being a commander in this world.What's more, the missions themselves are a ton of fun, and actually do require a lot of thinking and strategy - which is something I'm often dissapointed about in turn based games, squad based or not - especially later down the line when the bigger, tougher aliens are introduced and you've equipped your team with JETPACKS!Speaking of the team, I have almost formed a bond with them, something that only the Walking Dead games have been able to achieve. The stuff that you've gone through with them, watching comrades die and relieving yourself when you manage to rescue at least a few of your squad members from a tough mission, all adds together to create a friendship with completely fictional characters with no personality or backstory.Of course, no game is perfect, unless it's Portal. XCOM does have a few issues. For starters, Chryssalids are way too overpowered. The Chryssalid hive mission in the fishing village in the DLC, XCOM: Enemy Within, is just taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥ The Muton Beserkers being able to move when it isn't their turn is a little dumb and the panicked state doesn't make much sense to me.If I were to give two point of recommendatio for this game it would be this:1) Don't buy this game if you don't like difficult games. Admitedly we're not talking Dark Souls level of hard, but still pretty damn unforgiving.2) Play it on ironman. This means you cannot revert back to older saves if you have decided the mission's gone♥♥♥♥♥♥up. You HAVE to live with your decisions. I played the game for the first time on ironman and, while I did restart the whole game from scratch, I didn't regret it.And you know what else I didn't regret? Buying this amazing game.			"

												Slingshot is a pretty good and cheap addon. Dosn't have the scope of enemy within, but contains three nice but heavily scripted missions, a free (pretty nicely statted, but not customizable unless you use long war mod) unit for your barracks, and some other misc things. My only complaints are:1)  The story is kind of nebulous at places and makes heavy use of a macguffin you never really learn the identity of directly, though I think you get it to research as a reward at the end? I'm not really too clear at this point, so maybe I missed mention of it. The character you meet has neat dialogue and is a fresh face to add to your growing ranks of 7-eleven employees with guns, but his overal identity is kind of weak and relies heavily on mystery and viewer inference. 2)  It's less 'Slingshot' and more 'Aliens fall from the sky' DLC. You'll know what I'm talking about if you play it. Kind of pulls a 'doom 3 mid-end game' the entire time in nonsensical ways, at heavily scripted locations and triggers. Maybe the aliens are researching gigantic slingshots as a viable troop deployment option?3) The end mission of this DLC feels like it should have a lot more significance to the main story then what it actually ends up having, and the exterior design of the last level doesn't really.. match anything you've seen before in any xcom game and looks out of place. I can't clarify that without spoilers, but the interior design looks more xcom-y then the outside 'shape'.I guess it kind of vaguely resembles the dos xcom terror from the deep ones..?			"

												This game has taught me to not get too attached to your soldiers, as they can die at anytime, if you make the slightest wrong move. :)Its really challenging to complete, but once you get the hang of it, theres nothing more satisfying than killing those Alien scum ! :DThe replay value is great, and the difficulties are actually difficult !So, in some ways; This is a turn-based strategy games answer to ""Dark Souls"", except that this gives you no option to retrieve what is lost ! And I have only played vanilla so far, but there are also mods, so I guess the replay-value is even greater.But I have to say, as a final note here: Do get the ""Enemy Within"" expansion, and play that, as that adds alot more to the vanilla campaign, and it made my experience of the game better.Good luck, Commander!

 “Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.” An Excellent turn based strategy game.Managing your base is fun and intuitive, leading your soldier  to their death  to battle, even more so. At first, the game will beat you mercilessly, but, as you will research new technology, you will be able to give the aliens a nice face to face with their own plasma weapons. The difficulty curve is well dosed so you won't feel overpowered often unless you play on easier difficulty (Wuss). randomly generated missions keep thing interessting and the scripted ones up the stakes!You will get attached to your little squads, you will buy nice gear for them, choose a nice color for their power armors.  Then you will have to watch the game send the hulk smash them into pieces, or get transformed into zombies that their comrades will have to put out of their misery.A good filler while waiting for the 2 :)9.5/10 "

												Even if you dont like turn-based games, this is not like the others.This is a really fantastic strategy game, where decisions not only come from your head but also from your heart. Losing a very experienced soldier who was under your command since the beginning makes you feel bad and sad, since you didn't only lose a good ""piece in chess"" but also a very unique personality who you will not see again.In the beginning, your technology is only about traditional rifles, shotguns and grenades while aliens have more advanced weaponry and seem to have better troops than you do. But you will catch the aliens in technology by doing autopsies, capturing and interrogating them and studying the UFOs you shot down, which leads to better technology and weaponry... etc for you.The game has exciting visuals, great voice-acting, fitting music and magnificent gameplay. It's a real shame if you never get to play this game because it's a must get for all who prefer strategy games.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Only bad thing: FIX YOUR MULTIPLAYER DAMMIT!

												I played this game on release day without any background of the previous iterations. It quickly became one of my favorite games. It is so addicting that I kept telling myself that I’ll just play 1 more mission but end up playing 5 hours straight. On my initial playthrough, I lost several soldiers and a few countries but managed to beat the final boss handily. When the expansion came out, I played the game again but it felt so good like I was just playing it for the first time. I recommend that you play the game with the expansion as it adds a lot of options that makes the game so much better. A few years later, I saw the game was on sale on steam so I bought the entire package, played the game again and felt awesome even though it was my 3rd time. This is one of the best turn-based strategy game I played in a while. It is so addictive that you will lose hours of sleep in exchange for awesomeness. The only drawback is its easier late game.9/10			"

												X-Com: Enemy Unknown is an excellent tactical/strategy game by 2K Games. The basic story surrounds the idea that aliens are invading earth and you are the last, best defense. A spiritual re-imagining of a classic, X-Com takes squad-based combat and mixes it with resource management. While in the base view, you play the role of the Base Commander that must manage research, base construction, and troops. When aliens attack, the game switches to an excellent turn-based combat mode.Both the base management and the combat are excellent and offer enough challenge for even the hardest core strategist. The expansion X-Com: Enemy Within deepens the original game by adding genetic modification, Mec’s, and another opposing faction. The highlight of these new additions is easily the Mec’s, which made me smile for an hour the first time I deployed one of these monsters.X-Com: Enemy Unknown is a wonderful game that is well worth a purchase and I recommend it completely.

If you want a challenge and brain straining game here it is truly great.Enemy Within: Take a superb game with few flaws, and almost in a seamless and proper transition dip it in gold with beautiful implementation of new and expansive mechanics. From mechs, to gene mods and several intuitive missions adding more onto the strong missions currently existing. A dlc that makes this game even more ingenuitive and special.			"

												Slingshot is a pretty good and cheap addon. Dosn't have the scope of enemy within, but contains three nice but heavily scripted missions, a free (pretty nicely statted, but not customizable unless you use long war mod) unit for your barracks, and some other misc things. My only complaints are:1)  The story is kind of nebulous at places and makes heavy use of a macguffin you never really learn the identity of directly, though I think you get it to research as a reward at the end? I'm not really too clear at this point, so maybe I missed mention of it. The character you meet has neat dialogue and is a fresh face to add to your growing ranks of 7-eleven employees with guns, but his overal identity is kind of weak and relies heavily on mystery and viewer inference. 2)  It's less 'Slingshot' and more 'Aliens fall from the sky' DLC. You'll know what I'm talking about if you play it. Kind of pulls a 'doom 3 mid-end game' the entire time in nonsensical ways, at heavily scripted locations and triggers. Maybe the aliens are researching gigantic slingshots as a viable troop deployment option?3) The end mission of this DLC feels like it should have a lot more significance to the main story then what it actually ends up having, and the exterior design of the last level doesn't really.. match anything you've seen before in any xcom game and looks out of place. I can't clarify that without spoilers, but the interior design looks more xcom-y then the outside 'shape'.I guess it kind of vaguely resembles the dos xcom terror from the deep ones..?			"

												Go buy this game.Oh wait, you're here to read an actual review. So here it is:This game is incredible and you should go buy it.Okay, okay, I'm just messing around.XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a game that caught many by surprise much like the aliens that invade Earth in this remake of a little game called UFO: Enemy Unknown, or XCOM: UFO Defense, depending on where you've played it. But instead of being a total disaster and the end of all of humanity as we know it, this game instead makes you feel empowered and makes more meaningful choices than games that would use the word ""choice"" as one of their bullet points. Not only that, it manages to stand out in a world dominated by First-Person Shooters.XCOM is a Turn-Based Strategy game. While to anybody with a short attention span might find that idea utterly slow and boring, the game is anything but. The game gives you unprecedented control of how to defend the Earth from the alien menace ranging from prioritizing appealing to the Council that funds your project, to devoting your resources to supporting your soldiers on the ground. There's an addicting cycle to the game when you get new resources from a mission to put into researching some new gadget or weapon, then testing it out on the field and getting more resources to make even better equipment, and even better, the game's difficulty curves beautifully to your progress. There's also a great sense of satisfaction when you make a tactical or strategic error, then learn from it to improve your tactics in the long run and be a much better commander. You'll feel a lot smarter and a lot more bad♥♥♥♥♥when you turn your defeats into victories.There's also something novel this day and age about a game you can ""lose,"" and not just get a ""game over"" screen and load back a checkpoint to keep playing to some predetermined end point.Now hopefully by this point, you're convinced, but if you're still unsure, check out the demo and see what the game is like for yourself.

												Turn-based Strategy at it's best.If you intend to buy I'd suggest getting the complete version so you can have both XCOM Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within. XCOM: Enmey Within is the expansion and makes the game much better maybe dare I say twice as good. I did buy them separate and had a blast with just Xcom Enemy Unknown but now i have the expansion it's like a new game again.Lot's of replayability, you can customise your troopers how you wish. Missions can get a little tiring but they do have so many it'll never seem like a carbon copy of the last mission --- especially with the addition of the expansion Enemy Within.Highlyy recommend if you like the turn based strategy genre. If you've played the previous Xcom games this version does them them proud.			"

												This could be a fantastic game. So many of the elements are done really well. Research and base management are cool. The upgrade options and squad management are interesting mechanics. The pacing is really well done and everything feels like part of its own universe that's dynamic and lived in.Unfortunately the game has two major shortcomings in my opinion. First, in a game full of choices, nothing seems particularly meaningful and you're never really introduced to the consequences of say, selling a bunch of alien corpses instead of keeping them for research. A lot of things just feel like extra buttons to press for more fluff. A lot of it is quite enjoyable and rewarding fluff, but fluff nonetheless.The second, and much worse issue, is the tactical combat. There are a number of issues I find personally annoying and a couple that I feel really break the game to the point of unplayability. RNG plays far too big of a role in combat. Hit and miss chances don't feel at all intuitive and seem like the product of really lazy math and coding work on the part of the developers. Unloading an LMG clip at a hovering drone out of cover 5 ft away and totally missing not only seems unrealistic, but spraying all the bullets 2 ft to the left in a perfectly straight line seems really clunky in a modern game. For a game that seems to want to reward flanking, coordination, and aggressive play, the way that enemy aliens spawn and interact with the squad seems unnecessary and often bizarre. Making a good positioning decision might activate one of two alien squads and leave you totally outnumbered. The incredibly limiting 2 actions/turn instead of an action point system often means your soldiers seem totally incapable of doing anything significant during their turn. A completel overhaul of the tactical combat is what is needed to make this a truly modern, functional game.			"

												Xcom is a very divisive title just because it wears the title and legacy of the original. I fully approve of this makeover, it's in many ways streamlined in a good way. Kind of what Mass Effect (2) did. You can even play comfortably with a controller except that the game can be still as brutal and gripping as the ´94 one, especially in Ironman mode. Turn-based tactics that don't feel like micromanaging a sidejob, while the situations and tension can still make you crap bricks. Permanent death for your favorite soldier still hurts. The expansion Enemy Within has an excellent pile of extra choices and content on top, but I'd recommend getting that only for later playthroughs, the game's beginning is hassle enough in vanilla already if you're playing first time. If you want to obsessively control every single bullet that goes in every marine's clip, there's always the original or Xenonauts for you. I'm enjoying making just the larger decisions here.			"

The down side's were the blackmarket you couldn't sell or buy stuff like X-COM UFO Defence, Why do WE have to pay for two more seat's on the Skyranger that should have been a given. The enemy spawn is ramdom, Then the enemy would get a free move so they can run and hide or take cover. I would save ever turn because of these down side's, But don't get me wrong the game is Great and Fun I just like to Save a lot too. I also have XCOM Enemy Unknown - Elite Soldier Pack DLC.

												XCOM is quite simply one of, if not THE BEST, squad turn based strategy game I have ever played. Players take control of the commander of the XCOM project, a multi national funded organization formed to stop an extraterrestrial threat. Players have limited resources to prioritise over micro-managements in between missions.XCOM is great for a number of reasons, one of which is how well it makes the missions connect with the time back at base. Having to make the decision of whether or not I want to spend my last few credits on a satellite to then launch over a country before they pull out, or use them to fund for my whole team to have laser rifles to take on what I know is going to be a tough upcoming mission certainly does capture the pressure of being a commander in this world.What's more, the missions themselves are a ton of fun, and actually do require a lot of thinking and strategy - which is something I'm often dissapointed about in turn based games, squad based or not - especially later down the line when the bigger, tougher aliens are introduced and you've equipped your team with JETPACKS!Speaking of the team, I have almost formed a bond with them, something that only the Walking Dead games have been able to achieve. The stuff that you've gone through with them, watching comrades die and relieving yourself when you manage to rescue at least a few of your squad members from a tough mission, all adds together to create a friendship with completely fictional characters with no personality or backstory.Of course, no game is perfect, unless it's Portal. XCOM does have a few issues. For starters, Chryssalids are way too overpowered. The Chryssalid hive mission in the fishing village in the DLC, XCOM: Enemy Within, is just taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥ The Muton Beserkers being able to move when it isn't their turn is a little dumb and the panicked state doesn't make much sense to me.If I were to give two point of recommendatio for this game it would be this:1) Don't buy this game if you don't like difficult games. Admitedly we're not talking Dark Souls level of hard, but still pretty damn unforgiving.2) Play it on ironman. This means you cannot revert back to older saves if you have decided the mission's gone♥♥♥♥♥♥up. You HAVE to live with your decisions. I played the game for the first time on ironman and, while I did restart the whole game from scratch, I didn't regret it.And you know what else I didn't regret? Buying this amazing game.			"

												This is an interesting take on the standard tactics game. I like that the difficulty curve follows time rather than your skill; that way, your decisions have an impact on how hard the game is. Story is there, although it's a tad weak. Mostly revolves around ""Aliens are invading Earth, so shoot 'em!"" Followed swiftly by ""We've gone too far! We're no longer human because we looked into alien technology, apparently!"" Gameplay is nice, with a lot of options for each character. That said, if you don't turn on random stat growths, each class turns out characters that are exactly the same.			"

												First off I'm not a fan of turn-based games but XCOM really blew my mind.The gameplay is just so well made with it's cover system, the weapons and what damage they do to the environment and how you feel connected to your soldiers.As each soldier has their own nationality, facial features and names (facial features and names can be changed) it makes every single one stand out and sometimes you'll do anything to keep them alive. There's also an option that prevents you to save during missions which will make you think twice about what move you're going to make as every single mistake can change everything during a mission.There's 5 classes (6 in enemy within) all with their own very important roles. Each time they level you get to choose a perk in their skill tree, normally each class has their set perks to choose from but there's an option that makes the perks random so you could end up with a soldier that has a perfect set of perks from different classes.XCOM also offers the ability to build up your own base, do research and create items and weapons and it's more or less up to you in what order you want to do things.The Enemy Within expansion gives you a new class, a heavy cyborg/mech kind of class aswell as implants for regular soldiers that will boost them quite alot.The missions in The Enemy Within are the same as in Enemy Unknown so if you think you'll only be playing the game once I would really recommend getting the expansion right away as it offers alot more options to your playthrough.Even if you're normally not a turn-based gamer I would recommend trying this game, you won't be disappointed.

												10/10. I didn't think I'd like it, but as it turns out this game is a masterpiece. It'll have you screaming at the screen more often than not, but it's still worth it. You'll never look at percentages the same way.Just a hint: Try not to start playing during the holidays. This game will suck your hours away, trust me.97% of chance you'll like it, 3% it'll be a miss. I'd say go for it. Good luck, commander!			"

												For those who criticise this game for not improving upon much except the visual presentation since the original series I have my own personal opinion on whether this game is worth getting or not. This game adds tons of entertainment with the ability to customise your own soldiers that start of as raw recruits until you eventually rank them up ot Colonel. You get such a close tie to your soldiers that loosing even one of them really hits you hard. You are able to customise their abilities upon them ranking up as well as customise their outfit appearance, general appearance, name, nickname, equipment etc. Although people criticise the price of the DLC's the Enemy Within DLC really adds a lot for the beginning and mid elements of the campaign with a new foe with it's own units, covert operations, base siege, two new aliens and some custom items with balances and changes to the game play itself. I am on my 9th game whiles writing this review and i finally have got satelite coverage over every continent with the only exception of having lost Africa to the alien invasion. If you like strategy, base related games, real time strategy along with alients AND EVEN ZOMBIES then definately check this game out as it has a lot of replay value. I can easily see myself getting up to 100 hours of game time when i have already played around 75 hours on this game. One of my best games ever! :)			"

												Just finished my first play through on classic difficulty. A big fan of the original game this version had a lot to live up to. Good news is I really enjoyed it, they did a far better job of remaking the game than I expected. It's difficult to compare games that have so many years between them. Okay it doesn't get some things right but it does others better. Overall a brilliant game and other than the original there really is nothing else quite like it. Customising, naming and upgrading your troops. Building your base and facilities. Managing the different countries needs and going into battle in visually lovely and destructible environments. All the little details, like seeing your solders in the bar, in the drop ship and on the memorial. It all added up to lots and lots of fun.   I know I'll go back to it after a break. Play it on harder difficulty with ironman mode on.9/10			"

												A game with real consequences, permanent death and no save scumming. Seriously, the game determines all outcomes for a turn before you make it to prevent you reloading a save to try to hit again, so you will always miss. The numbers are randomized each move you make though and there is an option before starting a game to turn save scumming on to randomize every time you reload but I don't recommend that.If you turn on Ironman mode then the game also saves periodically and prevents you from doing so so all your choices matter and will be carefully reflected upon, this I also recommend!Don't let my hours fool you, I've spent at least 200 hours on this game but on disc before I had the chance to get it on steam. Definitely absolutely one of my favourite games and game types, not enough games like this that are as well and expertly made. Very keen and optimistic for Xcom 2 which comes out very very soon!			"

												An overall qualifier for this recommendation: Squad and base-building games are something I adore, and this rather skews my predisposition to XCOM towards the positive.That said, it's one of the finest examples of these genres and turn-based combat and tactics games in general that's out there, in my opinion.  Your squad is deep and varied, tech and research provides gear that changes up your options and approaches, and the presentation and story are done in a compelling and involving way; it's not hard for me to develop attachments to my individual soldiers, especially with campaign options that allow each to have a unique skill tree.All of the things I like about this game are further enhanced by the Long War mod for it-- more equipment, more challenge, more character builds with more compelling and balanced options, and more varied technology to uncover.  If you're a fan of base building strategy and turn-based tactics, this one deserves a look-- buy it with Enemy Within, its fully featured expansion pack that greatly improves the campaign experience and lets you train psychic humans using alien tech, among other things.  Defend Earth.  Purge xenos.  Good times.			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a turn based strategy game. In March of 2015, aliens invade Earth. The only thing that can stop them is XCOM, a paramilitary organization that can only deploy one 6 man squad at a time. This game serves as a reboot to the XCOM series. Bear in mind that I have not played the older XCOM games. Pros: +Deep and tactical gameplay. Flanking and methodically taking out the aliens is very satisfying. +The engineering/science system. These allow you to upgrade your soldiers and give them a fighting chance against the aliens. +Some truly memorable missions. The fishing village and the dam missions in particular are great.+Good variety of missions.+Good variety of aliens. Some of them are truly terrifying (as in they can oneshot your soldiers).+Multiplayer mode.+High replay value. There may only be 4 classes, but each class has a variety of different skills you can utilize. +Live by the RNG, die by the RNG. It feels great when one of your soldiers hits a clutch 35% shot.+Enemy Within (expansion) makes the game so much better. More enemies, more missions, and the cybernetic/genetic upgrades are awesome. Cons:-Trying to navigate elevations (such as in buildings) can be a serious pain. It feels like every little movement of the mouse will send your camera up or down a floor.-Lag when berzerkers charge and after certain moves in multiplayer.-The free aiming system for rockets/grenades is terrible. -Live by the RNG, die by the RNG. One time, I had a sniper miss a 99% chance to hit. -Not a fan of how aliens get a ""free move"" when they first see you. I feel like this punishes flanking. This especially sucks when this happens at the end of your turn. A way to circumvent this is to never extend your front line at the end of your turn.Despite my complaints, I had a ton of fun with XCOM: Enemy Unknown. It is a truly great game.			"

												Turn based strategy gaming at its best. If you're a fan of the genre and SciFi in general, you'll like this game.I played on the easiest mode and still found it interesting and challenging. The story is well written with cutscenes/text for upgrades and research which further enhances the plot. The graphics are also great, with lots of immersion and variation to make it not feel repetitive. However, my only criticism would be that the use of cover and general tactics (high-ground, etc) slowly become repetitive despite the variations in environment and tilesets.			"

												A brilliant re-boot of a classic franchise, XCOM: Enemy Unknown puts players in charge of a shadowy mulit-national task force charged with defending Earth from alien invasion. There are essentially two games here; the first layer tasks players with strategic base management. From here, they will research technology, diplomacy, base and equipment construction, and personnel. The second layer of the game is the tactical turn-based squad battles. Some battles give the player certain assignments, such as escorting a VIP or capturing rather than killiing a hostile. Each shot counts, and failure could mean the permanent loss of agents. Each decision made, whether in the strategic map or the tactical battle map feels genuinely compelling. If you are a strategy fan, you don't want to miss out on XCOM.:EU!			"

												Even if you dont like turn-based games, this is not like the others.This is a really fantastic strategy game, where decisions not only come from your head but also from your heart. Losing a very experienced soldier who was under your command since the beginning makes you feel bad and sad, since you didn't only lose a good ""piece in chess"" but also a very unique personality who you will not see again.In the beginning, your technology is only about traditional rifles, shotguns and grenades while aliens have more advanced weaponry and seem to have better troops than you do. But you will catch the aliens in technology by doing autopsies, capturing and interrogating them and studying the UFOs you shot down, which leads to better technology and weaponry... etc for you.The game has exciting visuals, great voice-acting, fitting music and magnificent gameplay. It's a real shame if you never get to play this game because it's a must get for all who prefer strategy games.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Only bad thing: FIX YOUR MULTIPLAYER DAMMIT! I feel like the game developers haven't done enough to develop their multiplayer. Like: Why you can't do co-op missions with your friends?			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a 2012, turn-based tactical strategy game released by Firaxis Games (the company that is responsible for the well-famous Civilization franchise) and published by 2K. Enemy Unknown is a remake of the classic 1994 game of the same title. Enemy Unknown takes you into a long and brutal journey to fend off the alien invaders and the hefty responsibility to command your troops to victory. The game was a huge success to Firaxis Games. This review will also extend to the expansion pack, Enemy Within. Is Firaxis Games’ vision of XCOM a true successor to the original franchise?The story is very simple. The aliens invade Earth and you play as the Commander, who leads the XCOM organization to fight off the aliens via commanding your troops and facilitate limited resources to your advantage. One of the main features for the game is character customization that brings in strong, “emotional” investment to your created characters. Admittedly, I found the character customization limited but it did little to prevent me from caring about the created characters. A few reasons why a person would be invested in fictional characters. Field promotions and experiences in combat will put you in intense situations. The feeling of victory and triumph or the tragedy of mission failure and a character’s (or characters’) sudden death will put you in an emotional ride. Such emotions makes this game very addicting. The game brings a good challenge to the player and the difficulty levels are appropriate for any player who have some experience on understanding basic tactics or “complex” strategies to win over the enemy. The best features for the game are the unpredictable nature and improvisation to withdrawal from battle or fight to the bitter end. Even with “common sense”, aliens can hit you based upon chance and random critical hits. The commander’s (or your) decision will determine if your soldier will fight another day or take a huge risk to kill the biggest threat to your squad. The game certainly has some of the best features, but there are some minor annoyances and criticisms that needs to be addressed to potential buyers. First, I find Dr. Moira Vahlen a tad annoying due to her “accent” or the voice acting for the character. Second, the game’s unpredictability can be a turn-off for some players who felt “cheated” by sudden critical hits on your soldiers. Essentially, the outcome of each mission is based on a “gamble”, hoping that the enemy won’t hit you or at least won’t “cheat” on getting a sudden kill shot on someone who has full health. Honestly, I like this unpredictability but not for some players. The map designs are “limited”, meaning that there is a chance that you will play the same map design more than one mission. Since the missions can take place in anywhere on the world, there are no “cultural distinction” on any maps. For example, if the mission takes place in Egypt, China, Germany (and elsewhere) there are no cultural icons or specific cultural features in the maps that take place (besides the introductory mission in the Slingshot Pack)Lastly, the spoken languages are very limited and disappointing. The game only offers English and various European languages (like Spanish, French, Polish, Russian, etc). Ironically, the addition for European languages comes from the expansion pack, Enemy Within. Worse, the European languages pack comes from the base game (for European players who played in his or her native language) only to be packaged to the expansion pack for American audiences. Since XCOM is an international military and scientific organization, the lack of more languages (Arabic, various African languages, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese, and various others) in the game was a bitter disappointment to me. XCOM: Enemy Unknown and its expansion pack, Enemy Within, is worth your money and your investment. An excellent mod, The Long War, raise the replay value into new heights and is a worthy addition for any XCOM player to have (depending if you want a very brutal and a marathon campaign). The game’s optimization is very good mainly because the system requirements is very affordable for any PC player at this point of time. However, this game might not be everyone’s favorite cup of tea if the person does not like turn-based combat. Regardless, the high replay value, intense firefights, and emotional attachments to your created character makes this game unique. A must buy for any PC gamer even with the minor issues at hand. This game has my highest recommendation. "

 “Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.” An Excellent turn based strategy game.Managing your base is fun and intuitive, leading your soldier  to their death  to battle, even more so. At first, the game will beat you mercilessly, but, as you will research new technology, you will be able to give the aliens a nice face to face with their own plasma weapons. The difficulty curve is well dosed so you won't feel overpowered often unless you play on easier difficulty (Wuss). randomly generated missions keep thing interessting and the scripted ones up the stakes!You will get attached to your little squads, you will buy nice gear for them, choose a nice color for their power armors.  Then you will have to watch the game send the hulk smash them into pieces, or get transformed into zombies that their comrades will have to put out of their misery.A good filler while waiting for the 2 :)9.5/10 "

												Having just finished XCOM: Enemy Within, i felt i should write a quick review.First of all, i think UNKOWN and WITHIN are brilliant games. Fun and challenging with great content.Specifically, to discuss the ""expansion"", Enemy Within... There is significant additional content. I loved the new council missions, the side quests, the new options to upgrade / alter your own soldiers - they all added a lot of depth to an already fun game.However... crucially *minor spoiler to reduce chance of disappointment for others* -> it is the same overall story arc. It is NOT a new game. It is an enhancement to the original. As long as a player is ready for this, and focusses on the differences, the set piece missions, the new upgrades, then great. anyone expecting more will not be so happy.All in all, though, I would still recommend it!cheers,Potatoheed.

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a great turn-based strategy game that is well worth the time you invest into it. Though not a perfect game, it manages to deliver wonderful tactical turn-based combat, combined with base building and resource management, as well as a pretty well made soundtrack. Cannot say that the plot is anything special though. Oh, and in case you don't feel like there is enough content in the game, there is also the lovely expansion pack known as Enemy Within that adds new maps, a rival faction, genetic implants and a mecha-cyborg class.

												One of the best turn based strategy games in existence, hands down. If turned based is your thing and you haven't played this, you are missing out.It's got a story that keeps you interested and really wanting to push forward. In depth turn based combat that while on harder difficulties will completely change how you approach a fight. Unit, squad, and base advancement that will not only improve its capabilities to push your tech further, but your soldier as well.. physically, genetically, and mentally.This ""World Army"" created by corporations, governments, and private investors has its own interesting aspects, especially in the grand scheme of the story. And by far my favorite part is turning on the languages for the different countries for your soldiers, makes the depth of it even better, though I do wish there were more languages.On the downside, the AI can seemingly get some pretty insane RNG crits on your soldiers even on the easiest difficulties, and the end game is determined pretty heavily on how you play your hand early on. But this is also a good thing if you really like making that choice and sticking to it.All in all, get it, you wont regret it unless you hate turned based strategy games. And for those who get it and beat it, try downloading and installing ""The Long War"" mod for the game, it will pretty much triple the amount of play time you get with the game and add a ton of fun new things to it.

												A must buy re-imagining of the classic XCOM: UFO Defense (US) and UFO: Enemy Unknown (UK/EU) from the 90s; this edition has the unusual distinction of taking a classic, reimagining it and possibly making it a better game.Run the worldwide anti-alien response team by building bases, shooting down UFOs and command gun battles on the ground. The game has a strong story with a good research tree that keeps the challenge real. The DLC is worth having with the Enemy Within adding a bundle of interesting content.The only flaw with the game is that the 'on the ground' battle sections can get a bit repetitive if you aren't testing new toys your scientists have dreamed up in the field, but overall the combat is much more enjoyable than previous incarnations by seriously reducing the amount of micromanagement.I wouldn't recommend buying it with The Bureau which was a more poorly received console shooter which is only worth buying with 90% off.

												By the first 5 minutes of this the Story, I knew tragedy.By the first 20 minutes, I saw hope.By the first hour, I cared for my squad.Playing a game where anything can happen and you actually treasure leveling up your team, and not only can the frequent unexpected turn of events in a battle take them from you,  they can just lose their will to fight altogethor with the horrors seen on the battlefield.  An outstanding feature I have yet to see in anywhere, and that statement is only a sentence on the book I can write on why this game is so outstanding.  This is actually my first Turn-Based Shooter game, but I honestly can't imagine anything better in it's category.I have yet to play MP, and for the first time ever in a game that has the multiplayer feature; not only am I not in a rush to play it, I have absolutely no desire to do so.  Story mode is fantastic and challenging.Thumbs up.  Game has surpassed my expectactions at every turn, and I know will continue to do so.			"

												I rate XCOM: Enemy Unknown a 9.5 out of 10. When combined with the XCOM: Enemy Within pack, I give it a 10 out of 10. If you like turn-based sci fi strategy games, you NEED This game and it's brother ""Enemy Within"" because they're simply the best game in the Sci-Fi Alien Invasion Turn Based Strategy category.I would really love a new Xcom that lets you choose to defend Earth with humans OR play as the aliens and try to take over Earth, that would be even more amazing!

												Game is worth trying if you have never played the series. It is a tactics style where you move your troops into ideal positions and kill aliens. Gets very repetitive over time while you try to upgrade and fight harder monsters. Maps get recycled later on in the game. 7/10 overall. The only replay value is if you want to beat it at a higher difficulty. There is no storyline - just defending against aliens.			"

												Best game I've played since Civ V or Deus EX: HR! They got the tone spot on from the original. The combat is spot on with a new cover/flanking mechanic and the double move system feels just right. The base ""ant farm"" is a little bit sterile but the heart of the game is combat anyway. There were a few minor bugs at launch but they have been aggressive in squashing them. This game is a love letter to fans of the original. If you love squad turn based games this is a MUST BUY!			"

												For me as an X-Com: Enemy Unknown/UFO Defense veteran, this game is comparably easy to manage and the combat system is easier to learn. However, even if tactical parts are stripped down to a certain extent, this remake isn't anymore a simple remake. It's a remaster or a reboot; it has a rather good story line, it adds tons of gameplay features to consider being really good design choices, it got rid of bothering features like the air combat system (which had an awesome music track in the original nonetheless) and of course it has considerable visual/audio overhauls. This game stays true to its root(s) in a degree that it indeed is comparable to the original game (which is a really rare achievement for reboots) but, in my opinion, blows it away with so many additions that it beats the classic masterpiece. This game sets a new standard for this genre.Veterans, if you think it's too easy for you and I'd see where you'd be coming from; it offers many options to increase it's difficulty. If it's just to set the difficulty higher as a whole or to enable the Iron Man mode, where you play it a lot more like a rogue-lite (permadeath, auto-saving-only) or maybe enabling more randomness. You pay a bit freedom in this game (freedom of base locations i.e.), but you get so much more.I highly recommend this game to anyone slightly interested in TB-Combat.			"

You need a combination of management to build your Base and tactics to succsessfully end the missions.If you like turnbased strategy I really recomend this game and the dlc XCOM:Enemy Within, slingschot is just a bundle of 3 side-missions which give you a bit of a boost during the storymode			"

												X-COM:Enemy Unknown is one of those really good turn based strategy. Half of the game is spent planning, researching and building in the X-COM HQ and the rest is spent out on the field. However neither fells like a gimmick on the other. In the base you'll feel either excited to use your new tech, or terrified that you could lose more soldiers. In the field you'll long for the time when you can get back to base hopefully with a full squad. Since mission are, for the most part randomly generated it has a huge replay value. While the story is a little lack luster there are some good moral moments and the gameplay makes up for it.			"

												A faithful and competent update of one of my all-time favorite games.   Sure, some elements of game play are inferior, but most are improved.When recommending a game, I always consider these three factors.  1.  You're not playing a hairless quasi-male floppy-eared freak.    2.  It's a sensible story based in western-thinking logic with no poor translations into English from some other language.  3.  You get at least one chance to shoot something in the face with a shotgun.In XCOM: Enemy Unknown, aliens are discovered and the people of the world band together to kill the s#it out of them.  What's not to like?Turn-based strategy game.  Good AI.  Buy it.  Play it.  Make sure you restart your game after the tutorial.			"

												Keeping this short and sweet, I think that XCOM: Enemy Unknown (with OR without Enemy Within) is one of the best strategy games in years. As good as games like Total War and StarCraft are, turn-based strategy with a small squad was always my preference, because what actions you take feel like personal choices, making every single decision you make on and off the battlefield a tough one. And BOY, do they get tough. If you have paitence to loose time and time again, then an experience on the rewarding levels of Dark Souls awaits you. XCOM reminds me a lot of games like Fire Emblem, Advance Wars, or Tactics Orge, but it sprinkles some western elements into it as well as some sci-fi giving it a unique identity of its own. Overall, this game ends up culminating into a big pile of difficult, stratigec, rewarding fun. And honestly? I wouldn't have it any other way.			"

												I was hooked on the original X-COM: UFO Defense when it first came out way back in the day, and since then I've put in a rediculous amount of time into it. When I heard about XCOM: Enemy Within.. I was excited, but extremely worried it would suck. However, after putting in over 20 hours into Enemy Within, I can safely say it's far from a disappointment. For the most part, it stays true to the UFO Defense formula, with more modern features added and the like. The whole game is less complicated than the original for the most part, which isn't really a bad thing, especially for people who're new to the series and want to give the game a shot without having to spend hours reading and figuring out how everything works. I can't even think of anything bad in this game. The only ""complaint"" I'd say I have is I wish the campaign was a bit longer.. however, it's still decently long. Not to mention, as long as you're not doing poorly, you can ignore the final mission and keep playing for a good while. It doesn't force you to finish the game right away. All and all, I could go on about how awesome this game is. If you liked the original X-COM games, then I can almost guarentee you'll love this one. And even if you've never played any of the X-COM games.. this is a fantastic choice to start out with. Heck, I've never even been a big fan of strategy games.. but this series is just so amazingly well done and addictive. Honestly, I think as long as you don't hate strategy games, then most likely you'll enjoy and appreciate just how great this game really is, along with the rest of the series. At the very least, give the free demo a shot!			"

												This game feels very rewarding when you manage to win out in some sticky situations.  There's a steep difficulty curve at the start of each new game (steeper at higher difficulties) but once you've researched some technologies the tables turn quickly.  Early game is frustrating, mid game is challenging, and end game is typically a cake walk.  With the Enemy Within DLC it gets a lot more interesting with some of the balancing and added tech/unit options.			"

												Fun game, I really enjoyed the squad tactics and the way things have a 'real' feel to them in a science fiction game.  My only gripe with this game is that snipers seem to be extremely accurate, but until the late game, anyone with a rifle can't hit the ground by dropping the damn thing.  Moral of the story:  Bring at least two snipers on your fireteam.Final verdict, awesome game.  Worth the money without a doubt, and getting it for free with Bioshock Infinite just made it all the better.EDIT:I had to change my opinion of this game with Enemy Within.  While I greatly enjoyed the vanilla game, getting half my squad killed off by freakin sectoids in the second ground mission while they were in cover made me rage quit.  I started a new game, lost 4 guys to critical hits (all four shots) from SECTOIDS (the lowest enemy) while they were in low cover on HIGH GROUND.I really do enjoy the vanilla game, but the expansion diffuclty on flipping EASY ramps up so hard and so fast that it isn't even fun.  It's like the game wants you to quit, uninstall, and then kill yourself.EDIT 2:I really want you all to know that I really did want to enjoy this game.  I tried so HARD to enjoy it.  After writing the preceeding I decided that maybe it was a chance of fate and so I decided to not only fire up another game, but install a mod that takes away the ""Alpha Strike"" that the AI gives itself by allowing the aliens to move to cover after you encounter them.  Even with this advantage, on mission freaking ONE the opening mission of the campaign after the tutorial they killed two guys on my squad from INSANE ranges with ♥♥♥♥ing pistols (Sectoids) on turn freakin THREE.  Know what?  Done.  I wish I could get my money back for this xpac.  It's really giving me that old feeling I'd get when I would play Starcraft back in the day and I would just.. know.. that I was playing a cheater with a multiplayer trainer.			"

												It's not classic X-COM and you might be disappointed if you are looking for a graphically updated carbon copy of the original--- one of the best games ever known to man.This game is far simpler and faster-paced. It makes good use of cover, flanking, and suppression mechanics that weren't part of the original series. The actual tactical gameplay is more of a mix between X-Com, tabletop DnD4e, and every FPS that involves a lot of cover. The devs said they wanted it to feel like a tabletop while still being a fun single-player experience. That's more or less what we got.So yeah, XCOM is not X-Com.On the other hand, this is probably the best TBS title in the past ten years. It is beautiful, fast-paced, and fun. Ironman on ""impossible"" difficulty was terrible for my nerves and I loved it.9/10			"

												I like this game. It tells a story on its own. It is hard - given the right options. When you know how to play, I recommend Iron Man and difficult. It is intense to lose a soldier, you are already very familiar with, but it gives you the right kicks to think and protect and plan properly. Without the load option, you will always commence and never retry the same difficult situation over and over again. Sometimes evacuation becomes a valuable option, to save what is left of your team. And there is the uphill fight, when your experienced soldiers are gone and you need to rely on s.h.i.v.s to get at least some resources for consolidation.Well balanced strategy-game, easy to learn, fun to master.10/10 will fight with s.h.i.v.s again.

												Great game. XCOM will keep any tactical seeker thrilled for days. Custom strike forces made of mercs with perma death... Costly political compromises based on your strategy and choices, will keep your plans on edge.			"

												One of the best turn-based games I´ve ever played. Great story, nice graphics, well driven game mechanics, this game has it all.  The base building is a bit tricky sometimes, since you have no idea what to build at the beginning, but after you do, you won´t quit playing this game before you´ll finish it. 10/10.			"

												XCOM is a grid-based tactical game with some fun unit management.  A grid is a two dimensional field in which everything is partitioned off into tiles which all take up the exact same amount of space and have the same shape.  Each tile is arranged on the grid such that it's position in relation to all other tiles is exactly the same as any other tile's position in relation to the tiles that surround it.  Grids can continue on in any direction for as long as they need to.  You can think of grids as a sort of pattern that can be extended or cut short (made shorter or longer), but the pattern will stay the same.  Grids do not need to have a consistent shape, but the patterning of the tiles does need to remain consistent.  If you are still having trouble grasping the idea of grid I can suggest some additional reading:Metric Spaces by Thomas Wieting (2013) [people.reed.edu/~wieting/essays/MetricSpaces.pdf]The Amazing World of Grids by Harold Svenberg (1957)Grids and Lowest Level Computational Methods by Paul Moore (1989)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gridhttp://etc.usf.edu/clipart/42600/42677/grid_42677_lg.gifIf you are still having trouble grasping the concept of grids I suggest you go back and re-read my introductory paragraph with the knowledge that you now have from your additional readings.  Yeah, I realize that that's a bit of a cop-out but I'm kind of at a loss for how to explain this any more clearly to you.  I really thing that you must be overthinking this, a grid is not something that you normally have to explain to people at all.  Even with children who do not know what a grid is you can show them some examples and they'll get the basic idea.  I mean you certainly don't need to be some sort of grid guru just to understand what I'm going to be saying in this review.  You really just need a basic understanding and some common knowledge.Sorry, I think I came off a bit condescending there.  Let's try this again.  I know you can get this if you just take it slow and try to think critically.  Grids are made up of tiles, tiles are arranged inside of the grid in a constant pattern.  Really the tiles are just subdivisions of the area that the grid covers, a way of splitting up the space into many different parts that all have the same size and shape.Now come on, don't be so hard on yourself, I KNOW you can do this!  You've come this far and I can't let you give up.  I want you to think about grids for an hour each day until you finally have a firm grasp on the matter.  All I ask is one hour.  Return once you've completed that for me, and good luck!Well congratulations, you did it!  I know this road must have been long and hard for you but I think that you've achieved something truly remarkable.  I'm proud of you and I encourage you to be proud of yourself.  You've worked hard enough, go ahead and take the rest of the day off, as a present to yourself.  You've earned it!  Then once you've rested up get out there and seize the day with your newfound familiarity with grids!			"

												I can say that this is a very fun and stressing game, My best squad got wiped out trying to rescue civilians from Japan which was overrun with the parasitic things that we call our enemy. I can tell you this: Expect things to go wrong. If it can go wrong it will go wrong. After playing this game and giving up after 20 of my soldiers were murdered with no mercy. I am now a true believer of Murphy's Law...9.8/10 - A game that I regret un-installing. God bless the men and woman who were killed working for X-COM.			"

												I like this game. It tells a story on its own. It is hard - given the right options. When you know how to play, I recommend Iron Man and difficult. It is intense to lose a soldier, you are already very familiar with, but it gives you the right kicks to think and protect and plan properly. Without the load option, you will always commence and never retry the same difficult situation over and over again. Sometimes evacuation becomes a valuable option, to save what is left of your team. And there is the uphill fight, when your experienced soldiers are gone and you need to rely on s.h.i.v.s to get at least some resources for consolidation.Well balanced strategy-game, easy to learn, fun to master.10/10 will fight with s.h.i.v.s again.

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown...pfff...more adecuate name is  FRUSTRATION and SUFFER simulatorPOSSIBLE SPOILERSLet's take a look on some aspects of this game.Just my conclusions.A.   I've been customizing my entire squad for at least 30min, given them most advanced tech so far. They were just like the expendables even mustache was there. But 2 rounds later half of them was gone, some fuc.... fagg... with a few crapy friends took them out like they were nothing.        Lesson learned....no emotional relationships=no customization B.  If you think everything is going according to plan.....you are absolutely wrong. I'm still suffering psychic breakdown when my entire New Team was turned into a zombie horde.        Lesson learned...never ever help Washington...C.  In the moment you encounter new enemy game changes from strategic shooter to awful slaughterhouse of elite soldiers .    Lesson learned...magnesium is a mineral that helps stabilizing blood pressure in your vains and prevents from heartattackThese are just few of Pros within this glorious gameThere is just one big problem i'm still thinking about...you can't nuke the mothership like in INDEPENDENCE DAY...ahh...i wish i could nuke'em allTotal conclusion...if you find joy in ever lasting trauma and psychic torture this game will suits you. If not ...you may find joy in slaughtering invading aliens and protecting our motherland. Post trauma included, lousy troopers as well. And never name your precious sniper Taylor Swift ....i've achieved some painful scars when she left me ...stupid floater...    10/10 IGN aprove's    : never felt like this before happy and frustrated in the same moment ....must have9-10/10 D.

This XCOM is a good strategy game, combined with an engaging atmosphere well achieved.I bought this game in a bundle, and no doubt it was worth. Good work from Firaxis producer.			"

												(8 out of 10)Remake of the old XCOM: Enemy Unkown from the early 90's which was one of my favorite tactical strategy games on the Commodore Amiga.This remake is surprisingly good. Once you learn how to play you always want to finish a mission to gather enough items for resarch from shot down UFO's or just to know how the story unfolds. The graphic is mostly below current standards, the last mission is a drag and the once randomized levels from the old one is replaced with premade maps, but aside from that it a very enjoyable game.

												(8 out of 10)Remake of the old XCOM: Enemy Unkown from the early 90's which was one of my favorite tactical strategy games on the Commodore Amiga.This remake is surprisingly good. Once you learn how to play you always want to finish a mission to gather enough items for resarch from shot down UFO's or just to know how the story unfolds. The graphic is mostly below current standards, the last mission is a drag and the once randomized levels from the old one is replaced with premade maps, but aside from that it a very enjoyable game.

												This game is a must ownPro:Few games scratch the surface of what this game is able to do. It is incrediably addictive, and has many great elements. For one the perma-death system is great. It is something that gives you the sence of nervousness as one of your best soliders is put into the frey of battle. The thought that you could lose him/her at any minute puts you one edge in evey battle. The base building system is extremely addictive as well, because chosing between the right research options could be life or death for your soliders and xcom its-self. Enemy variety is wonderful, few games are able to do what this one can each enemy acts/ behavies differently and the huge extent makes knowing your a top priority and giving veterins of the game a advantage.neg:There are some graphical glithes, and the enemy can sometimes not make a desions, and require a restart, BUT most of it has been fixed and is something that can be looked past.Conclusion: This game is incrediably acchomplished in all feilds from enemy variety to gameplay. While it does contain some graphical and technical glithces this is a MUST OWN, a 9.5/10			"

												Once, I was playing on Normal Difficulty on Vanilla Enemy Unknown. I was on my fifth-or-so mission, and had two star snipers, Sergeants Boris Smirnov and Irina Sokolova. Both were Russian, and both were total BADASSES.Then, lots of hours later, I was invading an Alien Supply Barge. I had Colonel ""Ice"" Smirnov and Colonel ""The Black Widow"" Sokolova tagging along. I sent Sokolova out to cover our backs, as her sniper rifle could kill stuff from​ afar. After an initial firefight, Sokolova was reconning a bit behind my main five squad. She heard a sound a bit to her left, and guess what-About three Mutons were waiting for her. She was incapacitated within a minute.I went into total panic mode. I called the entire squad to rescue her. Smirnov used his grappling hook to provide sniper support and pick off the mutons. I had Colonel Park, my support guy and designated medic rush to her aid. I had my assault guys be the spearhead for the entire rescue operation. I had my heavy close behind.Sokolova was gonna die in two turns. By that time, 3 of the 5 mutons were dead.Sokolova was gonna die in one turn. All of the mutons were now dead. Park rushed to Sokolova to revive her.But alas, even when he dashed, he couldn't​ reach her in time.Ms. Irina ""Black Widow"" Sokolova, 46 kills, 24 missions bled out the very next turn.I stared at the screen in disbelief.Then I shouted Sokolova's name. I had grown attached​ to her throughout the game. It pained me to see her dead.This is the kind of thing the game will do to you. Indulge yourself and play it.			"

												If you came here looking for a classic x-com game, you came to the wrong place. The aliens may be the same, and in fact I'd say they did a good job of updating all the aliens to be something new and unique, but this has almost none of the traditional x-com charm and difficulty. Everything is based on a very simple cover system... either you're in cover, or you're not. You don't shoot in the direction of enemies, like you do in the original games, but rather you shoot at a single enemy, and either you hit, or you miss. If you miss, you might get lucky and blow up their cover.The game operates on a mob group system. Aliens are in groups, and if they spot you, they get a cinematic in which they run in to cover. This means that if a group of aliens has not seen you this turn, they will not shoot you during their turn, so the threat is minimal. Even at the start of the game, you're fielding a squad of 4 guys vs. many aliens. Later on you go up to a whopping 6, making the aliens feel very weak... how are we even losing this war?All that said, if you take away the xcom, the game is a functional TBT. It's fairly decent, and can be quite enjoyable. If you're looking for x-com, skip it and go buy xenonauts, or go help out with any of the open source fan projects out there. Sadly, the game is also riddled with bugs. Sometimes you will be unable to shoot an enemy, even though they can shoot you. Sometimes your troops will end up walking somewhere they can't go, resulting in them being stuck for the mission if they can't fly. There's many others, especially in multiplayer, so only get it if you're interested in TBT. It's a good introduction of the genre to those who wouldn't normally play such.			"

												This is a review for the XCOM along with all the dlc's, so that means XCOM: Enemy Within.So far, this game is fantastic, very unique gameplay compare to basic turn based strategy games. Variety of options included for those who wants a challenge or simply prefer the game easier. This game does have a multiplayer as well, but I have not yet tested that out, the singleplayer however, is simply amazing.The game involves you controlling a squad of members, taking cover and strategic positions on the battlefield while attempting to make tactical decisions focusing on objective as well as keeping your squad alive. There are several classes as well, base classes are Assault, Support, Heavy, and Sniper. You can genetically modify those classes or even machin-nize your soldiers to make them exceed farther. As game progresses, the game also requires you to research and construct facilities in order to advance in both tech and more of overall diplomatic control. One of the game's biggest element are countries under the council, as aliens attack, you would be force to make decisions that pro's one of the countries but con's the other countries, ultimately influencing the panic level. When a panic level hits 5 bars, a country would likely to leave the XCOM project, making it so they no longer can fund you. When a certain number of countries leave XCOM, the game is over.Graphic: 8/10Explanation: The performance is very well done, and I do enjoy the action-figure type of graphic, the FPS caps at 62 for smooth, that isn't a problem for me. However, I believe there's space for graphic improvement, overall a 8 which is pretty godo.Plot: 7/10Explanation: The game does have pretty good plot overall, however, XCOM in my opinion is one of those games where you play for the gameplay and the research, spending time trying to find out why aliens are attacking. So plot is less reliant when it comes to overall feel.Gameplay: 10/10Explanation: The gameplay is absolutely amazing, first of all it's pretty unique compare to modern day's games, it combines RTS aspects with turn based TRPG. Really polished, always neat stuff to look forward to, and overall if you enjoy strategy games, I would say you would like this as well. The sci-fi theme is a plus for me.Replayability: 8/10Explanation: This is more sort of my current feel with the game, with Second Wave (Additional Game Options) I would certainly not mind replaying a game maybe twice for a different route and a different result, as for others I can certainly see less replay value for them. I would not rely however, on multiplayer for replayability over singleplayer.Overall: 9/10Conclusion: Great game, if you are considering or wondering rather or not to get this game, don't think about it, add it to your cart right now. I got it during the steam sale from around $25 along with all the dlc's, which was a steal, at full price it is very well worth every penny. One thing I would say is, don't get too attach to your squad, they will most likely die hehe.			"

												An excellent tactical strategy game that controls great with a controller or keyboard and mouse. This is like a modernized version of the original XCOM from the early - mid 1990's. This game is a combination of ""Men in Black"" with the space marines from ""Aliens"". It can be fun for unexperienced gamers and if you want a real challenge you can turn up the difficulty to match the original game's difficulty. Also, if you want to unlock everything, you can spend many hours of gameplay just to do so. I also recommend getting the expansion ""XCOM: Enemy Within"" because it adds more enemies, more technology, mechs, bio-engineered soldiers, and  a few other surprises. It also adds an enemy human faction, but they seem to be very easy to beat most of the time. If you find the gameplay fun from the ""XCOM: Enemy Unknown"" then the expansion will be enjoyable too.You are the only line of defense against the alien invaders. Be prepared for the onslaught.			"

												This is one of the best games I've played in a number of years :D While lacking the intense tactical micro of ME3 it is none the less an enthralling game to play. The principle of taking a group of rookies and nurturing them up to the highest level is fun and makes u think about what options to choose for which rookies of which initial values and how they work with each other to kill the bad guys, right from beginning to end, that can be pretty key.I would recomend this game to anyone, its epic and the AI is pretty solid too, it wont be a push over like it can be in other games, that is for sure!

												XCOM is an incredibly addictive turn-based strategy game which will turn you into the mastermining strategist you never knew you wanted to be. With a moderate amount of replayability, this game will leave you surprisingly attached to the soldiers under your command, especially when you see them blasted away by a thin man's light plasma rifle! In terms of difficulty, XCOM definitely offers difficulty if desired, although at times I did rage when the RND ♥♥♥♥ed me over in fights, along with a very strange spawn with every single group of enemy spawning in the same spot... Overall I very much enjoy Enemy Unknown. So what're you waiting for? Buy the game damnit!			"

												This game is an absolute masterpiece. While not a direct update of the original, and lacking some of the strategic depth (base building for defense, multiple bases, etc.) the meta game is addictive and satisfying - giving you that ""just one more turn"" feeling.The tactical combat is the best I've ever seen (and I play a lot of strategy games!). With all the classes and equipment, multiple levelling up paths, and particularly the Enemy Within content (genetic modification and cyborgs - hells yes!), you always feel like you are getting more powerful - and the enemies difficulty scales up with you!My only complaint for Xcom original harcores is that the line of site and mind control mechanics are a bit rough around the edges (if you try to storm entrenched aliens from above, you're going to have a bad time!). And one final thought - even though I am a PC-first gamer - you have to play this one with a controller. UI is so much slicker and more precise (especially when moving in tactical battles) - and you have to try zooming in on your base and see your soldiers hanging out and training - never even figured out how to do it with keyboard and mouse!Both main game and Enemy Within are must buys for any strategy gamer!

												XCOM is a serious game that takes itself seriously. Between trying to manage a base and trying to win battles out on the field of combat, the entire experience comes together beautifully. Its not the type of game I can play day, as its actually quite stressing at times, yet its the game I find myself picking up again and again. Its challenging, bordering on needlessly brutal, but its the type of game that inspires you to get better and play on harder difficulties in order to overcome even worse odds.If you find yourself wishing that strategy games were less about who could click the fastest and spam the hardest, and offered a more tactical, thoughtful approach, then this is the type of game for you. They don't make too many like this anymore, and I wish they did.I am impatiently waiting for news of a second full game in this reboot series. Firaxis, you hit gold with this one - do it again!			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown offers a lot of fun for fans of turn based, tactical game play. It has good level design, interesting game mechanics, with smart(ish) AI that can offer you a challenge. You will get emotionally attached to your squad of heroes as you level them up and unlock new technologies. You will weep and want to through yourself from the highest building when they get slaughtered by Mutons or mind-controlled only to be turn on your own guys.My only real critique of this game is that the maps aren't procedurally generated, thus you're sure to see the same maps over and over, with various permutations in terms of enemies encountered - but this isn't enough to develop the one-size-fits-all strategy you can develop for each map.Graphics: 6/10. Offers some visually pleasing graphics, but won't blow you away like games running on the latest Unreal engines.Story: 5/10. It's a generic story of ""Aliens invade Earth and we need to stop them. ZOMG HOW DO WE DO THAT? I know, let's form an elite team of heroes to take on the entire invasion.""AI: 8/10. If you make a mistake, the game WILL punish you - severely. Though once you get your squad to higher levels with better equipment the game does get dumbed down a bit.Game Mechanics: 7/10. Interesting game mechanics, from the turn based strategy to the macro management of your base to the micro management of your squad.Overall: 7.5/10. Fun game, with a multitude of different modes, but the same maps over and over gets old, fast.			"

												XCOM integrates a lot of interesting features and systems into its gameplay. I was looking forward to playing it for its tactical turn-based combat system, but found myself having more fun with the base management, research and engineering system. However, it does not come without any faults, I encountered numerous bugs, ranging from the non-saving options menu (that I have to re-configure each time I play) to buggy in-game user interface. The meat of the game, tactical turn-based combat, was an OK experience (Line of sight system isn't perfect, sometimes an alien is right in front of you and your soldier can't see them, I didn't enjoy the Overwatch mechanic, and randomly activating 3 alien camps with one movement is not fun). The best part of this game is the squad system, you get to customize and outfit all your soldiers;  there being different classes, abilities trees, weapons and equipment.Sidenote: I do criticize Firaxis for releasing XCOM: Enemy Within as a standalone game on consoles, but on PC you have to buy the $32 base game XCOM: Enemy Unknown before you can play the $32 Enemy Within, which is just the same campaign as XCOM:EU with some extra missions and updates. I would recommend XCOM: EU, but buy Enemy Within only if you like the base game and if it goes on sale.			"

												Edited as of 30/9/2016 - Those who are reading these are probably people that haven't played XCOM 2 yet. I for once did not play it yet.And so let us talk what is XCOM : Enemy Unknown. This game is somehow a ""reboot"" version of the classic XCOM. The game offer a turn based ""strategy"" in which you move your soldiers in a manner of turn.The story in itself is pretty much explanatory, nothing out of the ordinary. It's the usual ""Earth has been invaded by extraterrestrial life and a newly group of Elite Alien Killing soldiers have been formed by an alliance of Nation.Overall the gameplay including it's Expansion XCOM : Enemy Within offer a great amount of replay value and a good amount of satisfaction.This is one of the game that will make you suffer HARD if you done♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Literally.So if you're playing Hardcore Iron Man mode, oh well say goodbye to your F5 and F6 or be a man and suffer the losses.This is my opinion of the game. It's overall a pretty nice and standard game for both ""casual"" and ""hardcore"" as it offer some level of customization for stats.			"

												This is an absolutely wonderful game. Great mechanics, fun gameplay, beautiful graphics, interesting story, what else could you possibly ask for? Now, I have to be honest, I haven't played multiplayer yet. But the singleplayer mode is absolutely superb. However, it can get quite difficult at times.Since I started playing, I got quite attatched to my squad of soldiers. Then a terror mission came up. All my regular squad died but one (because he was injured he wasnt even deployed on the mission). Funny enough it was the soldier I made to look like me haha. That was actually sad, and I think the game does a wonderful job at making you care about your soldiers.Overall I would absolutely recommend this game to ANYONE, even if you've never played a game like it before.

												A wonderful scifi turnbased tactical game. The stradegy of base building, classes, and researching tech takes the game to another level of fun. Give it a shot and you'll love it, good story as well. I would highly suggest getting XCOM: Enemy Within. The expansion adds MECs, genetic manipulation, extra missions, and much more.			"

												Aside from just being an excellent revamp of the original, the new expansion includes the ability to mechanize your troops.  Flame throwers, EMP modules, they all make a single solider into a walking one man army!  The anti X-com faction addition is also fun with its little consipiracy story lines and change up in mission objectives.			"

												Possibly the most organic dual-mode game that has come out in the past few years.  The strategic mode leaves you researching and contructing a bunch of toys to use and looking forward to the missions where you'll get new resources and things to research, and the tactical missions leave you with new enemy after new enemy and all sorts of items to bring back.  It evokes the feel of the original very well.  I'm not the biggest fan of the change to a much more colourful and Fisher-Price type look of the tech and in particular the weapons, which all look like childrens toys, but otherwise the visual look and feel is implemented very well and perhaps just as importantly consistently.  The game just gels very well together in terms of gameplay, visual design, and sound design.  The production values are high and so is the fun.  The only real thing I felt was a misstep other than some elements of the visual design is the difficulty.  While the original could be tortuous sometimes and some scaling back was probably neccesary in today's gaming market, the game is actually pretty easy on all but the highest difficulty, as long as you stick with troops with good stats and stay on top of research and production of new weapons.  One of the disappointing things for me in that regards was the chrysallids.  In the original they were Aliens-inspired creatures that would zombify your men or civillians, and when you killed the zombie a new chrysallid would emerge.  It made things very frantic when you saw one.  Comparatively, the new chrysallids look and feel very different.  While they do have an instant-kill melee attack (the originals actually didnt, except insofar as they hit like a brick s**thouse), the zombies are mostly unthreatening enemies and there's no extra chrysallid when you kill them.  It effective neuters what was one of the original games greatest threats, because of how quickly a chrysallid could ambush and spawn more chrysallids.Those gripes aside, its an engaging and well-done game which remains a time sink for me to this day.  The only turn-based strategy game in the last decade which has had me going ""just one more turn""			"

												There's a stereotype that games make you turn OFF your brain, and are a mindless slug through mundane, disengaging setpieces, This game is a living, breathing, tangible contradiction to that claim. In this part turn-based startegy part base management game, you protect Earth from an invading alien force. Sound familiar? Just another alien game? Rest assured, this game is much more than it appears to be, and is a rare treat for tose looking for a game that pushes you cognitive abilities. I have never felt my brain go into strategic-overdrive as it did when I played this game. Fair-warning, this game does NOT hold your hand, and to avoid losing (that's right, you can LOSE a 20 hour game) you'll have to be both quick-witted and an effective  base manager. Only those who conduct the proper research, manage resources and money efficiently, smartly equip their soldiers, and maintain their relationships with the countries in the XCOM council will succeed in their turn-based skirmishes, where players control up to six marines to eliminate the alien threat.The duality of this game is one of its strengths, as the ground battles and the base management go hand-in-hand. Didn't invest in the titan armor research? Well I guess your soldiers are going to perish an unnatural death down on the ground. Failed to protect a member of the council on an important mission? Well I guess Nigeria is pulling out of the XCOM project and thus cutting its funding. Speaking of failure, that is also another one of the game's strengths, and something you'll be deeply terrified of. You can name and customize your soldiers, and eventually you become attached to them (think pokemon), arming your favorite guy to the teeth and giving him a badass nickname. And these soldiers will go through Hell, facing a mulitude of different alien classes, each with completely distinct looks and effective strategies to use againts. However, your precious characters can die permenantly in these missions if you don't do everything with clockwork effiency. That same urgency extends to the diplomatic side of the game. If you screw up to many times, enough nations will leave the council and you LOSE. This sort of challenge is rare in modern games and is a welcome revival.All in all, if you're looking for a exhilerating game that engages your brain, tis one's for you.			"

												Pros:- Mechanics- Varied strategic possibilities- RPG elements and upgrade paths- Variety of maps- Combat & variety of enemies/weapons- Base management- Overall gameplay- Replay value- Balanced difficulty and Iron man modeCons:- No sneaking up on enemies (without specific armor)- Some starting location bonuses are quite trivial- On higher difficulties, the small margin of error will be forcing you to be VERY careful and keep  stalling behind cover, which may become a bit tediousReally, a great game: if you like turn-based strategy games, upgrading your squad, managing your base and progressing through a game with ramping up challenge level towards the endgame, you're gonna love this game. Additionally, this game actually has a quite good replay value being a single player game, due the fun, tactical gameplay and randomly-generated missions and different maps. "

												This game is amazing and is probably one of the best games to have been released recently. Though it is still a tad buggy, it is a solidly made game and a faithful recreation of the old 1994 game, but streamlined with all of the unnecessary parts sifted out. It is also one of the few games that I have played that will actually try to challenge you and beat you. Even if you are not into the whole Turn Based Tactics genre, you should still check this out; it is one of those rare wonders that only comes once and a while.			"

												XCOM is a serious game that takes itself seriously. Between trying to manage a base and trying to win battles out on the field of combat, the entire experience comes together beautifully. Its not the type of game I can play day, as its actually quite stressing at times, yet its the game I find myself picking up again and again. Its challenging, bordering on needlessly brutal, but its the type of game that inspires you to get better and play on harder difficulties in order to overcome even worse odds.If you find yourself wishing that strategy games were less about who could click the fastest and spam the hardest, and offered a more tactical, thoughtful approach, then this is the type of game for you. They don't make too many like this anymore, and I wish they did.I am impatiently waiting for news of a second full game in this reboot series. Firaxis, you hit gold with this one - do it again!			"

												XCOM is an incredibly addictive turn-based strategy game which will turn you into the mastermining strategist you never knew you wanted to be. With a moderate amount of replayability, this game will leave you surprisingly attached to the soldiers under your command, especially when you see them blasted away by a thin man's light plasma rifle! In terms of difficulty, XCOM definitely offers difficulty if desired, although at times I did rage when the RND ♥♥♥♥ed me over in fights, along with a very strange spawn with every single group of enemy spawning in the same spot... Overall I very much enjoy Enemy Unknown. So what're you waiting for? Buy the game damnit!			"

												This game is an absolute masterpiece. While not a direct update of the original, and lacking some of the strategic depth (base building for defense, multiple bases, etc.) the meta game is addictive and satisfying - giving you that ""just one more turn"" feeling.The tactical combat is the best I've ever seen (and I play a lot of strategy games!). With all the classes and equipment, multiple levelling up paths, and particularly the Enemy Within content (genetic modification and cyborgs - hells yes!), you always feel like you are getting more powerful - and the enemies difficulty scales up with you!My only complaint for Xcom original harcores is that the line of site and mind control mechanics are a bit rough around the edges (if you try to storm entrenched aliens from above, you're going to have a bad time!). And one final thought - even though I am a PC-first gamer - you have to play this one with a controller. UI is so much slicker and more precise (especially when moving in tactical battles) - and you have to try zooming in on your base and see your soldiers hanging out and training - never even figured out how to do it with keyboard and mouse!Both main game and Enemy Within are must buys for any strategy gamer!

												A priceless gem. In this day and age, finding a modern tactical game that feels really smooth yet holds the best old games have to offer and doesn't hold any hands, is something really noteworthy.In addition to tactical gunplay and overlying mechanics that feel really live and authentic (including that your soldiers *will* die, no matter how high they've levelled up), there's cool ""hub"" management going on, where you build different facilities that benefit differently, R&D weapons, aircrafts and other equipment. And all resources actually have huge worth here, no inflation like in other games.Cool game if you're ok with games actually giving you something to decide, not hold hands through a magical journey.And the alien-xenophobic setting is pretty cool, haven't seen that much after the x-files.

												X-Com: Enemy Unknown is not quite the easiest game to get into and not as self-explanatory as it could be, but the four things it is should be more than enough to warrant a recommendation. It's unique, it's intuitive, it's absorbing and it's a hell of a lot of fun. The game is essentially a strategy RPG where you have to plan every move you make meticulously and with attention to military squad and cover tactics, but you have to manage the back end as well. Engaging in a bit of building and management simulation akin to a 4x game to make sure that your troops are able to keep up with the enemy's technology levels. It's incredibly engaging to pull off a perfect mission, or have to make difficult decisions where one side of the game has to make sacrifices for the other. The game can be very unfair or even luck-based at times, but it's easy to get back into and it can make hopeless battles if not fun then still engaging and rewarding on a more personal level (in an emergent storytelling sort of way). Consider this one a strong general recommendation, walking a perfect line between accessibility and compexity.			"

												XCOM is more than just a turn-based strategy game. You begin as a mostly weak military organization set to keep alien invasions at bay. As you complete missions and capture and examine aliens, you can research and acquire their technology to make yourself even more powerful. Begin with a group of rookies shooting with cheap assault rifles and end with a team of elite soldiers with plasma weaponry, advanced armor that lets you climb up walls, and psionic abilities to decimate alien opponents.Investments and time management are a necessity in normal mode and absolutely critical in the game's famous ""Classic"" mode, which requires several difficult decisions and sacrifices to complete the game successfully. XCOM is a fun and challenging time on its own in this respect apart from the already excellent combat system.XCOM: Enemy Within is also a great ""true"" expansion to the game that adds lots of great weapons and story content. It's a hell of a lot more relevant than today's cheap DLC injections into every video game. Try Ironman Mode for an extra challenge. Every decision you make sticks to one auto save, so you can't reload if you make a mistake.			"

I would reccomend it anytime as long as you keep with playing on ""classic"" difficulty with ironman on. Any other  difficulty just plain and simple handicaps the AI, reduces amount of enemies and basicly cuts the game down. There's another issue I have with it : It badly needs a sequel...soon. As even with mods it gets boring after some 200 hours in.			"

												An amazing game. A must own for anybody with a brain, although a problem i have with this game is that its not that much about strategy, but alot more about luck, i mean what's the chance your heavy will hit that 3% shot , or that muton will insta-kill your best assault that is hiding in full cover...Recommend to anybody who hasn't played the original, if you are a long fan, please looks for another review, as i have never played older xcoms so i can't tell if its better or not.

												Games have changed tremendously since I was a child in the early 90s. Then was a time of experimentation, freshness, and a lack of corporate handlers ready to strangle the life out of anyone who dared to be a rogue. I could chalk these recollections up to nostalgia and my young age at the time, but I don't think so. It was really different.Today we've settled into a stale rut of standard genres: RPG, FPS, Sim, etc, and they all rehash the same principles, the same ideas, over and over. It's a stinking pile of zero innovation, a soulless churning out of reskin after reskin where gamers are forced to eat up the latest iteration of crap distributed by *insert mega publisher here.*But X-Com is different. It feels new. Unique. And above all, it feels fun. After sinking a few hours into the game and becoming absorbed in its intricacies, I realized how I had almost forgotten that word in gaming. There hasn't been a game like it since the originals on floppy disk. And chances are if you're reading this than you're too young to have played them back when they were a big deal. So pick this one up. Sure, it would be unfair to say that games never attempt to innovate anymore, but the vast majority of those that do just aren't GOOD. This isn't a bad thing- anything that deviates from the status quo will be met failure more often than success. But X-Com is the outlier. In recent years (read: the last 15 or so), the only games that have accomplished similar sentiments on my insides are gems like Eternal Darkness or Total War or MechWarrior when they were first released. Games that felt entirely different and had never before seen mechanics that just worked. Take note, that is some good company to be in.X-Com's one drawback is the cheesiness. It runs so rampant throughout the game that I not only smell it, but taste it. But we all enjoy a little bit of cheese every now and then, and like a good Frenchman, the game manages to erase its stench with the cologne of absorbing gameplay.I won't get in to the nuts and bolts of the game. I don't want to ruin it for you. Especially if you were too young to play the first. In a world of jaded gamers, sometimes the best route is to hear a game is awesome and then play it yourself. That way, you can be surprised once again. Take it. It's an experience rare enough in gaming these days.			"

												An excellent tactical strategy game that controls great with a controller or keyboard and mouse. This is like a modernized version of the original XCOM from the early - mid 1990's. This game is a combination of ""Men in Black"" with the space marines from ""Aliens"". It can be fun for unexperienced gamers and if you want a real challenge you can turn up the difficulty to match the original game's difficulty. Also, if you want to unlock everything, you can spend many hours of gameplay just to do so. I also recommend getting the expansion ""XCOM: Enemy Within"" because it adds more enemies, more technology, mechs, bio-engineered soldiers, and  a few other surprises. It also adds an enemy human faction, but they seem to be very easy to beat most of the time. If you find the gameplay fun from the ""XCOM: Enemy Unknown"" then the expansion will be enjoyable too.You are the only line of defense against the alien invaders. Be prepared for the onslaught.			"

												XCOM is a solid if frustrating strategy game that makes you really squeeze every last drop out of every available resource to win the missions it keeps throwing at you.But the real strength of XCOM is when you name the generic soldiers you recruit as your units. Naming them makes them stand out as individuals rather than drones and makes you genuinely invested in them.I high recommend it because it's so well designed to draw out those moments where your best team is getting slaughtered and you're on edge every single time it's the alien's turn, wondering who you might lose next.

-Quick Review-XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a Turn based strategy game, which prioritizes on micromanagement skills, coupled with sound field decisions and employ's many rogue type elements. In short: it's a Sci-fi strategy game.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You're the worlds primary defense against Alien Invasion, you are the leader of the XCOM Project. Your job is simple: beat the aliens. But accomplishing that task isn't so simple, you need t keep the world nations calm, research technology, and then have your engineers create whatever the scientists have cooked up.Game Play: Game play is where this game really shines, the graphics are fun to see, it's easy to implement many unorthodox strategies, you get to customize your base, but the most important investment of your resources will be in weapons and armor.It is very important to emphases the difficulty of this game; unless you happen to be some military genius or a natural at this game (either could be true, and you still need to save before and after each battle) you will need to save your progress and reload from that save state. On the easiest difficulty the aliens will have no problem blowing up the poor S.O.B. you left out of cover because you misclicked... Trust me, he/she will be dead or in uselessly low health.By the end of this game I had recovered a terrible habit/condition... called ""Save before you do anything"". I developed this habit while playing Pokemon and Knights of the Old Republic. Upon playing this game I was saving before and after every battle.Achievements: There are the standard achievement type: Beat the game, beat the game on the hardest difficulty, do this unique thing while playing the game. There are also DLC achievements, so you will need to own the DLC if you want to get 100% completion.Conclusion: All in all, I have really enjoyed this game, and will definitely be spending more time working on the harder difficulties. This game can easily be put in the top Tiers of Strategy games that were developed in 2010-2015.To recap: Story - Interesting, not really the selling point, but doesn't take away from it. Gameplay, very good - much micromanaging. Achievements, 50-60% easily obtainable just from playing, the rest are rough or DLC.			"

												define: ambiguousXCOM is a good game. And it could be soooo much better. Enter: a mod for the rescue.The game offers a strategical management-layer with a time-compression feature and turn-based tactical missions in which you have to fight aliens with your squads. This combination works well and keeps you coming back. It starts great: there is a lot to do (research, building equipment, managing your soldiers...), the slick interface is doing its magic, you get your first valuable veterans, your abilities increase and everything is new and shiny. Nice pace and a good sense of progression.And then you notice the first oddities: the line-of-sight system is a joke. This game creates its very own reality and logic, but it's easy enough to adapt to this. You will get a feeling for this weird reality. The cover system works despite being laughable at times and being far from realistic.This game has countless little weaknesses. The strategic layer suffers a bit from being extremely streamlined. The game is keeping you busy with artificial difficulty and urgency. The panic system is erratic and a big cluster♥♥♥♥ of frustrating randomness. I did not feel threatened by aliens assaulting Earth but screwed by the developers. The late-game is lacking in content, as if they made the game and then cut away the ""Enemy Within"" expansion. It's disappointing and left me behind unsatisfied.Still I highly recommend the game despite all its weaknesses. It's a flawed gem and it can really suck you in. The tactical missions are exciting and reward bold moves just as much as they have a tendency to punish you for not being careful. Here eliminating the randomness becomes a satisfying challenge (destroy the cover first, finish off the enemy AFTER). It gives you perks and equipment to react to new threats and keeps things interesting. On the strategical layer the rigid schedule of scripted events makes for a more beginner-friendly experience. Many people will appreciate the ease that comes with a somewhat predictable course of events. Like it always is: the strengths of the game really highlight the weaknesses. And at the end of the day it is among the limited number of games i have finished more than once without ever being bored. Just don't expect a faithful recreation of the old XCOM games.The expansion addresses the lack of content, but most problems persist. All that being said: I highly recommend the mod ""Long War"" (EW required!). It overhauls the game in many aspects. It will give you a much deeper experience. It turns XCOM from an ""Invasion Simulator Light"" into a well thought out strategy game with a great sense of consequence. It forces you to think and actually punishes you for messing up. But it also gives you the chance to undo your mistakes. And suddenly you really feel like you are defending Earth against terrifying aliens. It's what veterans crave!			"

												XCOM's focus is on single-player and in this day and age is a good thing! The long campaign is challenging enough on Normal, with a big leap in enemy threat and movement on Classic - both of which are enhanced immeasurably by Ironman mode, which removes the temptation to save-cheat. The last difficulty level, Impossible, rightly so, your soldiers will die, a lot! This game is a winner. So much craft has gone into its atmosphere, into small details that together add enormous depth and flavour to the world: the occasional conversations overheard while fiddling around in the base; the mission loading screen, which gives you a view of the troops inside the carrier, fidgeting and tapping their feet in transit; soldiers acquiring nicknames after a few missions; the memorial room for fallen warriors, with a cork board of photos on the wall, which records their names. Near the campaign's end, there's a direct tribute to the original game's designers, the Gollop brothers, accompanied by an achievement called 'On the Shoulders of Giants'. It's a beautiful touch, a nod from one development team to another across the generations. They have something in common now. In their own time and place, each made a fantastic game called XCOM.			"

												I've never played the XCOM franchise before this game so I cannot compare this one to it's predecesors and neither can I judge the franchise as a whole, but I WILL tell you that this is an amazingly fun strategy game. As you can see from the store page; you are the leader of a worldwide anti-alien organisation and it's up to YOU to keep your troops alive and save the planet from their invasion.IN SHORT:GOOD+ The gameplay starts of quite simple but get's more complex and incredibly hard later on, especially on higher difficulties! Great game to just step into without any prior information. No manual needed.+ First playthrough took me over 40 hours to beat.+ Simple but engaging story. Aliens invade earth and you're going to stop them. Characters are a bit stereotypical, but the voice acting and music make it all very endearing and fun.+ Atmosphere is incredible for a top-down turn based game. You really feel the pressure of surviving and trying to complete your objective with little to no casualties. Every decision feels heavy and important; they really nailed that feeling here.+ Mission variation. There is not a whole lot of it, but the many different maps, scenario's and objectives make it a fun experience for most of the playthrough. Might get a bit repetitive later on if you're trying to max out everything in your base though, expect to do some grinding for that.+ Overal Quality. It's a very polished game with good graphics and great interface. The tutorial is short but sufficient and the rest speaks for itself.+ Creating and customizing your own team is SUPER FUN. There arent a billion options to choose from but it's fleshed out enough to make you spend some time trying to recreate you best friends as supersoldiers! + The Enemy Within DLC is actually worth buying. It's not as great of an expension as say the Elder Scrolls games. But still a bunch of extra content worthy to give the game another playthrough or two.+ The aliens are cool and unique. They all have their own strengths and weaknesses and figuring out how to deal with them best while doing scientific research about their bioligy feels as if you're really fighting an unknown enemy that you're slowly starting to understand better.+ Quite long. Quite hard. Expect to spend a lot of time on this one.NOT SO GOOD- Since this is a turn-based strategy game where your chance to hit is a roll of the dice, expect to get frustrated sometimes when your sniper with 95% accuracy misses 2 shots in a row. Can feel unfair, especially on higher difficulties.- After all aliens and weapons are introduced the game goes on for quite a while. More unlocks or enemies would make it feel less bland and repetitive near the end.- Though there's quite a lot of dialogue in the game, expect your collegues to repeat themselves a bit too much through the course of the game.- Though there is some variation in the missions, there are basically only 3 kinds: Exterminate all forces, save civilians or disarm the bomb. It's enough variation for the beginning of the game but can get really bland if you're playing too long in one sitting. I suggest taking breaks from this game so it feels more stimulating.- Story begins and ends rather abrubtly with little to no explenation to motives or origin of the aliens. - Even though I said earlier that the Enemy Within DLC is fun, it's also kinda bland without it. All the most awesome stuff like Mechs and and Geneticly-Enhanced soldiers are within the DLC so buying this game without it seems like a waste and you'll never want to replay the vanilla game again without it.- Even though Multiplayer let's you take control of aliens as well, there's not much reason to stick around after you've finished the single player campaign. I know some people LOVE the multiplayer though, so this is just my personal opinion.And that's it for XCOM, I hope this review helped you out! If you have any questions be sure to leave a comment!

												XCOM is a solid if frustrating strategy game that makes you really squeeze every last drop out of every available resource to win the missions it keeps throwing at you.But the real strength of XCOM is when you name the generic soldiers you recruit as your units. Naming them makes them stand out as individuals rather than drones and makes you genuinely invested in them.I high recommend it because it's so well designed to draw out those moments where your best team is getting slaughtered and you're on edge every single time it's the alien's turn, wondering who you might lose next.

-Quick Review-XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a Turn based strategy game, which prioritizes on micromanagement skills, coupled with sound field decisions and employ's many rogue type elements. In short: it's a Sci-fi strategy game.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You're the worlds primary defense against Alien Invasion, you are the leader of the XCOM Project. Your job is simple: beat the aliens. But accomplishing that task isn't so simple, you need t keep the world nations calm, research technology, and then have your engineers create whatever the scientists have cooked up.Game Play: Game play is where this game really shines, the graphics are fun to see, it's easy to implement many unorthodox strategies, you get to customize your base, but the most important investment of your resources will be in weapons and armor.It is very important to emphases the difficulty of this game; unless you happen to be some military genius or a natural at this game (either could be true, and you still need to save before and after each battle) you will need to save your progress and reload from that save state. On the easiest difficulty the aliens will have no problem blowing up the poor S.O.B. you left out of cover because you misclicked... Trust me, he/she will be dead or in uselessly low health.By the end of this game I had recovered a terrible habit/condition... called ""Save before you do anything"". I developed this habit while playing Pokemon and Knights of the Old Republic. Upon playing this game I was saving before and after every battle.Achievements: There are the standard achievement type: Beat the game, beat the game on the hardest difficulty, do this unique thing while playing the game. There are also DLC achievements, so you will need to own the DLC if you want to get 100% completion.Conclusion: All in all, I have really enjoyed this game, and will definitely be spending more time working on the harder difficulties. This game can easily be put in the top Tiers of Strategy games that were developed in 2010-2015.To recap: Story - Interesting, not really the selling point, but doesn't take away from it. Gameplay, very good - much micromanaging. Achievements, 50-60% easily obtainable just from playing, the rest are rough or DLC.			"

												I'm a huge fan of the original XCOM and I consider it to be possibly the best game of all time. The mix of tactics and strategy, the ability to scare the daylights out of you, with tough missions and excellent rewards meant it still has a place on my hard drive ven today.So when they decided to change up the formula for the new XCOM, I was apprehensive. When I first played it, I thought it was good but not great. It just felt like it was missing too many tactical options. So while the game was certainly well done and a fresh new take on the series - while still remaining true to the turn based roots and source material - I felt it was missing something. I simply felt constrained by the tactical combat options. But it still is a solid game on its own. Just not a great one.But with the expansion, this game feels complete. It's still not as good as the original, but it stands on its own two feet and is a great gaming experience. The combat is the central part of the game and it's generally well done. There are irritants of course, but it's good - and once you get deeper into the game with the meld options it becomes fantastic. You can build your squad of soldiers and really shape your approach to combat.Plus, the production values in research, manufacturing and the overall story are pretty darn good too. These ""add on"" components aren't very deep, but you are forced to make difficult choices. Do you use that meld to boost your sniper or create a walking tank? Which nation do you sacrifice and who gets coverage from the alien invasion? Which mission do you go on? Do you try to save that soldier in a bad position or do you let him die? Meaningful choices are in every part of the game.Now you might ask what's the expansion versus the base game and why did it make it so much better? I'll leave it to you to get the feature list from the store page. But in my opinion it wasn't so much the quantity of what they added but what was added gives players enough options to really approach the tactical battles the way they'd like. Do you want super-soldiers? Or do you prefer tough guys enhanced by Aliens-style exoskelletons that can punch an alien through a wall? There are two big flaws in this game to me:1. The missions aren't always interesting enough. There's an early one involving a ship (that floats, not flies) that's incredibly well done. It's tight, tough and gripping. But that's the only real memorable mission in the game which is too bad. They could have done so much more with crafting some more interesting missions.2. I hate that when you find a group of enemies they call get to run for cover before the fighting starts. It's a ""gamey"" decision that detracts from proper planning by the player. Still, these are fairly minor warts given the fun I had with it. In my book the base game is solid and good. The expansion takes it to another level. It's still not as good as the original, but it's worthy of the name of the title and the best game of this style since the original.  This title - with the expansion - belongs in any gamer's library. Highly recommened.			"

												I cannot recommend this game. This is after having beaten Classic Ironman, too.As much as I'd like to enjoy it - and my god with the way everything is presented and the theoretical fun that you could have, I sure want to... but I simply cannot.Play through the game on normal difficulty, and you'll find that the game is way too easy. Step it up to classic, and throw in ironman too to make this game into somewhat of a challenge (and arguably the way it should be - with ironman) and you'll find yourself consistently fighting against AI which it feels like is constantly cheating.LoS is garbage in this game, your units behind even full cover will regularly get devastated by the aim bonus given to aliens on higher difficulties (I must reiterate that anything below classic is easy as♥♥♥♥♥♥ while you find yourself unable to land a single shot, and the way enemies spawn in packs is probably one of the most idiotic things I've ever seen.The enemy gets free bonuses to make up for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI and adds what could actually be called artifical difficulty, LoS is broken as all hell, and the way in which enemies spawn FORCES a playstyle in which you take a half step forward and then proceed to try and bait aliens backwards into your overwatched squad - which is not only stupid and repetitive, it's down right bad game design.I'm rather disgusted I paid full price for this piece of trash. Buy Xenonauts instead for a much better experience in which the AI beats you through smart play, not cheating. Alternatively, Frozen Synapse if you're looking for turn based multiplayer.			"

												XCOM: Enemy Within does not fail to deliver another dose of your favorite edge-of-your-seat alien killing franchise. The technology expansions for the human race fuel tremendous replay-ability, that will drive endless hours of entertainment. The new technologies still need some tweaking with respect to utilization by the alien species, the human use patterns are very well developed and will greatly enhance your ability to construct strategies, squads, etc. The addition of the human enemy faction is also enjoyable, but also needs some development with respect to additional missions. Ultimately, the game is entirely worth playing, but the price to value ratio is much better if you keep your eyes peeled for a sale.			"

												While I could write about how it feels like the best XCOM due to being actually reasonably balanced while still being hard, simplified while still having tactical depth, and basically trimming some really annoying and pointless fat the other games had, I am instead going to compliment it on being the most realistic alien apocalypse simulator ever if you play on Impossible Ironman. See, most games are about humanity triumphing against all odds. That difficulty is just about humanity cowering and cutting as many losses as possible and most likely dying in the process.So basically it's a better and more tragic story than Mass Effect 10/10			"

												Plunging me right into the action the game opens up with a mission, being plunged into somthing you're not expecting and especially when you're unprepared is XCOM's specialty. Through my playthrough of this game I was absolutely never bored as it constantly presented me with choices, including where to put my money into, should I research lasers or autopsy an alien, but some of the most important decisions are presented at missions where you have to decide which countries to save from the alien threat. I found the game very enjoyable and it definetly leaves a lot of room for it's players to improve making the easy difficulty a challenge for anyone unfamiliar with Turn-Based Strategy, and increases up to the impossible difficulty where it takes the brainpower of Einstein to get through a single mission. Any looking at this game for mechanics will not be dissapointed, you're always faced with decisions during battle, should I risk the overwatch shot and get a better position, take a low-percentage shot, or grenade and not recover any artifacts. In all XCOM is an incredible game with great mechanics, fantastic graphics, and an unforgettable soundtrack I would recommend this to anyone and also encourage you to pick up the Enemy Within DLC.

												Ever played Final Fantasy Tactics? This is waaay better! Manage your soldiers, assign new abilities as they increase in rank, build their weapons and shoot some aliens! No two matches feel the same, as the AI offers new challenges every time: as soon as you begin to feel comfortable there comes along a new species, forcing you to rethink your approach. What's better is that there is no single way to play the game, but you have to adapt to your base layout and to your soldiers' classes. Immersive game world, very detailed but not hard on your computer specs, so it's always very smooth. Beyond base management, research and engineering the battlefield is the game's strong point, and I guarantee you'll think the AI cheats when your colonel misses a 95% shot, and you'll swear and shout at the screen whenever your squad faces unforeseen annihilation; you will cry like a baby girl when you meet the Sectopod! Yeah, it's that immersive.Also consider getting the Enemy Within DLC, it expands the game adding maps and features like genetic mods and freakin' MECHS! Worth having but pricey, maybe wait for a sale as the base game is fine as it is, and that's saying A LOT in these days.			"

												Before I had played XCOM, I always thought it was a rogue-lite that lasts 10+ hours before you fail. The difficulty of XCOM had always dissuaded me from trying, which I think more people would love the game if they knew the challenge can be manageable.However, and this is said after I've finished a 19-hr Normal game and tried 15-hr of Classic Mode (with modifiers like ironman), I don't always think the game is fair with its difficulty. It can be very unfair with broken mechanics,  UI/camera problems and a steep difficulty spike from Normal to Classic. I won't say the unfairness ruins the game because I want the challenge, but they are all issues. My ideal solution of a difficulty is one that has the AI behavior of Classic but the leeway you have in Normal mode. (Something I've heard is possible with the Long War mod.)An Important NoteI do own the complete edition of XCOM, so while I have Enemy Within I have not played it.  I wanted to evaluate the merits of Enemy Unknown (around 30 hrs) before I evaluated what EW adds to EU.Also, one note about the cosmetics'/council-missions DLC: Buy them ONLY if you care for customizing your characters but do not buy them individually (either buy the base-game or complete pack).What the Game Does RightWhat Firaxis does considerably well is provide a more streamlined, accessible game for a hardcore niche title. I have tried XCOM: UFO Defense long ago, so I have experienced what the old games demanded of the player. So while I see how the base management, item-inventory and squad-sizes are less demanding, I think the game's focus on squad-tactics, resource-management and the action of XCOM makes for a fun game in its own right.The best way I can describe the game is that it's a Civilization's take on XCOM. (Barren on plot, heavy on gameplay and the personal-stories you can have from the gameplay.) To my surprise, there is a considerable variety of missions--though you'll mostly get three: Exterminate, Extract and Escort--when you include the randomized council missions to keep the game refressing even after 15+ hours.Normal (Recommended) vs. ClassicIf you are new to XCOM, I would suggest you begin at nothing lower than Normal (with saves). After your first win, you should enable no saves to keep yourself from reloading every turn. (i.e. Reloading for maximizing probabilities.) The only worry you have in Normal is of overpowering yourself if you prioritize the base-management/squad-upgrades. You can easily take away the tension. The early-game difficulty returns after the alien base-assault when the game brings its heavier units.Easing yourself into EU is not the only reason to start at Normal. You should have no problem managing finances for the base and squad-upgrades, so you'll also learn what to prioritize. You'll also learn which autopsies and interrogations give you bonus ""research points"" for other research. (The research is very similar to Civ 5, except with required materials for study.)Basically, the normal mode is to familiarize yourself with the mechanics and the game's glossary of enemies, the armory, and bonuses. Classic Mode is where most would say the true game is found. Enemy behaviors are greatly improved--Thin Men spit acid, Floaters actually fly up to flank you, etc.--and the early enemies are more threatening rather than being forgotten. (Like the Outsider.)You will fail if you start in Classic, and even after familiarizing yourself on Normal you probably won't reach the Alien Base assault for a while. Even with many of the Second Wave modifiers for difficulty, the Normal setting never gets as interesting as Classic.   In order to get that far, you also have to learn the shortcomings of EU.More Trigger Warnings than Tumblr All jokes aside, the best tactic is to let the enemy spot you, not to trigger their location. It's also the first example of how EU breaks its rules for a consistent challenge.For whatever reason, every time you spot an enemy they get to scatter freely and then attack you at the end of your turn. (Sometimes the enemy will sit still and you must trigger them.) The best solution is to either scout ahead with someone ghosted or use trackers to spot them from afar and hunker down.I don't have an issue with constant the two-second cinematic. What I do have a problem is how your units do not react similarly to spotting an enemy.Another related issue is Overwatch. Because of the isometric camera, you have to hope that when the alien is spotted that they'll be within range. This could easily be fixed with a range-setting to make it more useful than a prayer on a battlefield.The battlefields themselves also have issues. Sometimes the free-aiming system can be misleading when it comes to altitude. The transitioning of floors can make some encounters hard to distinguish what you can and cannot hit. And aliens can sometimes hide in the one corner in the map with one entrance.The most obvious broken system is the aiming system of XCOM. It never feels fair for me or the aliens for how simple it is. I think the aiming calculation could be less infuriating with its hit-or-miss system. For whatever reason, a sniper-rifle is treated the same as a shotgun or assault rifle. Hit or miss with some critical chance for hits.Here's one suggestion: Instead of all guns acting the same, we personalized guns to have a certain tactic. For example, the shotgun could have a wider spread (3 tiles) with the central line-of-sight (1 tile) that does the most damage. Too far away, it'll miss completely; up close, it will do some damage which is better than missing. (Snipers could stay the same. Assault rifles, with a burst fire, could have some medium spread while heavies would have the most spread.)Lastly, and a real big issue for Classic, the Recruits.  I consider them broken because if you lose your classed units, then you've lost. Recruits all start out with poor stats/equipment (aside from one Squaddie perk). They are randomly given a one of three classes AFTER they get one kill (which restricts them from using any weapon). It just adds needless padding; worse, it can end the game there.An XCOMplimishment Despite its FlawsWhat I think EU succeeds in is providing a unique experience where you develop a love-hate honeymoon. It begins all tender and carefree until those damning issues make you want to quit or to give up. In spite of those issues, they never keep you from trying over and over again. thinking, ""Some day I can look over all failures by accomplishing this one thing. It will be the one thing I've done right."" Then, nine-months later you find that there's a Sectoid baby. You  dispose of it, and you are left pondering where did you go wrong and what to do about it now.Then you start it all over again. (Just like Cpt. Kirk would want to be remembered.)Enemy Within review: Steam Review "

												First off, this is a good game, it has solid mechanics and it is fun to play but there are problems (Disclaimer: I am a complete fan of the original)Having said that, it is a pale shadow of the mighty first game from which it takes its name (And even X-COM: Apocalypse) and it appears to be a syndrome that a lot of remakes suffer. The problem could be called ""Streamlining"" (Total War Rome 2 has this problem as well).1st is the research tree which is significantly smaller than the original. There is only one advanced Interceptor and very few weapons for it to research. The squad sizes are also very small (4-6) compared to the original so when you lose someone experienced it hurts a lot! (Losing 1 or 2 people in a mission early on can cripple your chances of completing it.) The maps are smaller and the mechanics of engaging enemies (Small groups that get their own ""!"" animation when you come across them) is disappointing.Base building has been made much less interesting since in the original your base could be invaded (and you could have multiple bases). The X-COM: Enemy Within expansion does actually have a base defense mission but it is scripted, happens once, and how you built your base does not come into it.Which brings me to my main problem with the new X-COM. I do not feel like the Commander of X-COM. In the original there were no scripted events, it was all organic gameplay. I made the decisions, I hired the scientists, bought the ammo, kitted out the soldiers in details and planned ahead and I was fighting for the Earth. This may sound dull but it added to the immersion.In the new X-COM the game plays out with 3 main characters and I feel incidental to the whole thing. I could just go put some slippers on and let them do it. You are hand-held and guided through every part of the game, constantly being told what to do, what you should do and what to expect by the ""main"" characters. This game is also much shorter in terms of the time taken to complete it. I just finished a game having shot down a mere 6 UFOs. In the original I would barely be seeing more than their initial scouts at this point. The ending is also very abrupt and jarring.So yes, this is a good game overall, it has some of the hallmarks of the original but overall it is a hollow shell compared to it, even with the expansion (Which I HIGHLY recommend). I am hoping that some of the X-COM indie games like Xenonauts ( http://www.xenonauts.com/ and early access on Steam ) can give me my real X-COM old-school fix.			"

												XCOM:EU is what changed my opinion on turn-based strategy games. I usually hate those games and find them annoying/boring. This game completely made me change my mind. The Earth is under siege... not by one kind of E.T.'s.. but by several, so that is a new addition to most alien based games/movies. You don't forcefully start in the US, like most Alien Abductions happen. You control a party of 5(then more) soldiers and fight against the alien hordes in turn-based combat. Each soldier can then level up after each mission they finished and gain ranks and classes. Be careful, your soldiers WILL die sooner or later. Use your Saves/Loads.>I'd give it a 10/10(pretty subjective but whatever)>Pros: New approach to Alien Invasions, interesting RPG elements, fun combat, challenging but not impossible, ability to build and progress your base.>Cons: Movement of some soldiers is visually tedious and ugly sometimes(cinematics as well), sometimes repetitive alien cinematics(always follow the same formula)			"

												Pros: It has some great strategic depth to it with turn-based squad battles, and customization of your troops is more fun than it should be.  The game does a good job of putting a lot of weight into each choice you make, because you really feel it when you lose one of your soldiers, and it sucks.  Other than the occasional RNG bs crit damaging one of your guys, or causing a pointblank shot to miss, the difficulty is spot on.  You can't just rush your guys around the map and hope for the best, you actually have to think about your moves and how to win.Cons: Story isn't much to tell, and is definitely not the center of the game.  There are a few minor bugs such as camera angles freaking out with the action cam, but nothing game breaking.  There is supposedly a bug in the last mission where the game will just hang up on the enemy turn (I haven't run into this myself, but I saw it happen on a livestream), but with the autosave happening every turn its more just a minor hassle to restart the game and reload the last save.Overall:  Excellent game, if you like turn-based strategy this is a must have.  While I have not played the original I have heard that it is NOT the same game, but that being said its worth it to pick up, especially on sale.8/10			"

												Defending the Earth from alien invasion one day at a time.  Seems relatively easy, except when a rocket goes awry and kills everyone, but its all worth it for those brave souls will be remembered on your memeorial wall, all of them, and there will be many.For those of you who declare this all to be too easy, check out the Long War mod for making a fiendishly challenging, well rounded expansion to the game.http://www.nexusmods.com/xcom/mods/88/?Good Luck Commander.

												Ever played Final Fantasy Tactics? This is waaay better! Manage your soldiers, assign new abilities as they increase in rank, build their weapons and shoot some aliens! No two matches feel the same, as the AI offers new challenges every time: as soon as you begin to feel comfortable there comes along a new species, forcing you to rethink your approach. What's better is that there is no single way to play the game, but you have to adapt to your base layout and to your soldiers' classes. Immersive game world, very detailed but not hard on your computer specs, so it's always very smooth. Beyond base management, research and engineering the battlefield is the game's strong point, and I guarantee you'll think the AI cheats when your colonel misses a 95% shot, and you'll swear and shout at the screen whenever your squad faces unforeseen annihilation; you will cry like a baby girl when you meet the Sectopod! Yeah, it's that immersive.Also consider getting the Enemy Within DLC, it expands the game adding maps and features like genetic mods and freakin' MECHS! Worth having but pricey, maybe wait for a sale as the base game is fine as it is, and that's saying A LOT in these days.			"

												This Game is amazing. Worth every penny. Good turn-based tactics game. If you want a feel for the actual turn-based fighting you can play a free game on steam called ""Frontline: Tactics"". But Xcom has it far more refined and flashy. Not to mention the base, R&D, story line, and every everything else Xcom has to offer.I also recommend getting ""Xcom: Enemy Within"" at the same time. Enemy Unknown is pretty buggy and many of deal-breaker bugs are fixed with the expansion/DLC.			"

												I was gifted this game and I guess I let it sit unplayed for too long! It's a fun strategy game that I found myself pretty invested in after only about an hour. While a lot of people knew what they were getting into because of the original game, I was unfamiliar with it. The game is a fairly straightforward strategy game along with a base building element. You receive periodic funds and materials from missions to either upgrade gear for your soldiers, research technologies, and keep the world at peace with satellite coverage and UFO interception. The game does a pretty good job of making sure you aren't able (at least not easily) to do everything, so you have to somewhat plan out what you want to do in order to make sure things go smoothly.The way the campaign progresses in pretty neat. At least, I hadn't seen it before. The game will tell you a specific thing to research, or item to build, or facility to construct, but the game doesn't seem to give you a deadline to do it. If you wanted, you could just kept the game going forever. But at the same time, going for too long without being able to protect the council/countries means that you have to keep progression in mind. It almost seems a little like Persona, of all things.The core gameplay was pretty great, there is a ton on emphasis on positioning. Cover is basically the determinant of whether your unit will live or die. I lost 3 units pretty fast before I started being more careful. It's always really neat in these types of games to watch as units fall into roles and favorites become clear over the course the of the missions. I ended up with 2 snipers (which are fairly over powered, as everyone has probably heard) 2 supports, a heavy, and an assault. Each one ended up being used in a way that felt organic. I didn't need to meticulously plan, I just tried things to see what worked and what didn't and it all flowed so well.I wished class changes could be decided. Unsure why it had to be random. I had other issues with manual saves and weird locks up that happened if a certain outcome was forced (say, attacking two of the elites with a grenade, they normally have a reaction cutscene but didn't work with 2 of them). I also wished there were a few more things fixed in place instead of just random missions on procudural maps. The few that were there were pretty nice. Some more enemy variety would have been good too, couple annoying recolors with are just boring.On normal, the base game got a bit easy but the last mission certainly upped the difficulty. Once you know what works, you simply just repeat it every mission while spending your money at the base. For me that meant keeping snipers back, having a shotgun running around, and a tank absorbing blows while some medics pranced about. So the game loses a little magic at this point, but luckily this is right as the campaign was ending so it didn't overstay its welcome.  I am also hopeful that the expansion content will help some of these issues. I am certainly interested in trying it at some point down the road.			"

												I played the original X-COM very little, partially because I was so bad at it and partially because I didn't have it myself. But I did like it and sort of was planning to get it and learn more about it to get better at it. But, that never happened. So anyway I was kind of excited about this remake or what you wanna call it. I wasn't 45 euros excited so I didn't buy it until I got it for a really good price at a steam sale. And I am glad I did. It is a good game. The gameplay is really fun and brings back a lot of memories from old turn-based games I used to play and enjoy. But at the same time it is hotted up and the graphics and style is really nice and adds to the enjoyment.I also like how the scientists and engineers talk to you about whats going and the way they are telling the story. But, there isn't really much of a story there. I really like the gameplay and the mechanics and the way the story is being told, I just wish it was more of it. If I would've paid full price for it I would've been dissapointed, I expect a lot more from a game if I pay over 40 euros. But it is a good game and if you see it on sale, go get it! 3/5			"

												What could I possibly say that hasn't already been said already.Well... let's tell my story.When I was a kid, I fell in love with a game called 'Shining Force,' which some may have heard of, and others not so much. Anyway, it was a top down ""tactics"" game: you controlled a rag-tag bunch of Medieval fantasy-style characters on a quest to purge the darkness that had been unsealed. One of the main draws of this game (and one of the main reasons I'd still return to it in the present day) was its simplicity; you had options, but you mostly had to rely on formation and non-fog-of-war tactics to really succeed.While I did, as I aged, fall in love with other (console) tactics games for various reasons - Final Fantasy Tactics, Disgaea, Front Mission, Advance Wars - none of them retained the complexity of those of the earlier games in the Shining Force series (especially Shining Force II) by way of simplicity, but rather by way of introducing complex or quirky mechanics that, while amusing for the first few implementations, grew steadily into automotonic repetition... or by quasi-forcing you to grind your way to the top (You technically could grind in Shining Force, but you didn't often NEED to as much as you might in, say, Disgaea).Which brings me to XCOM. I'd been introduced to it indirectly by a number of YouTube LPers, and fell in love with the crazy antics and frustrations they experienced... especially the ones they inflicted on themselves by hacking into the game and ramping up the difficulty beyond even that of present-day Impossible mode, just for the challenge of it. When I later saw that there was to be a new edition (and even later, saw the amazing graphics of said edition), I jumped on the bandwagon as soon as I had the time and money to do so, and I have not been disappointed. XCOM will always keep you on your toes; unless you're a master at the game playing on Easy or Normal perhaps. I myself have not yet mastered this system (years of fuddled implementations of ""flanking"" rules are still wreaking havoc in my brain), but success in the game relies more on simple squad tactics than it does on any sort of weird crafting, class, or combat, or other system. You need to think ahead practically all the time on the field (and off), carefully cross terrain and explore the map, and hopefully only ever uncover a group of aliens when you can actually handle them in one or two turns. Every battle challenges you to choose the right strategies every turn, whether the best option is to play more defensive or more offensive, play economically or in more of a rushdown style (either of which can backfire horribly). And because dead characters are dead... not resurrectable as they might be in the more lightweight tactics games of modern day (save Fire Emblem), I actually tend to really ""care"" about them. Any alien that blows up my main avatar is going to die in the most gruesome way I can manage.Coupled with an amazing combat engine, XCOM also challenges you with managing the actual base of your operation (in a much simpler and streamlined fashion than in the original), which again challenges you to think about how you ultimately want to build your base, and when to build which structure, and when to do which research, and which items or weaponry or armor or accessories to purchase or upgrade... all on a budgeted income. Perhaps it's an odd thing to say, but the limitations imposed upon you actually help to drive the game, and help to make the game an enjoyable one. While I did enjoy the slight period in time that I could relatively ROFLstomp the enemy due to overpowered weaponry, I find I still have the ability to so long as I size up the enemy first and plan intelligently my assault... it just takes a bit longer to do so.I have not played Enemy Within... but I look forward to a purchase in the near future. Still, even without the expansion, XCOM: Enemy Unknown delivers... alien heads on a platter. Mmmmm. Juicy.			"

												""Ran out of Video Memory, Exiting!""Bug still breaks the game when I get to the alien base invasion mission.  This alone gives it a thumbs down.As for actual gameplay:1. They removed the ability to shoot wherever you want.  You used to be able to blow out walls and doors with regular weapons, not just rocket launchers.  You could shoot out a wall and allow another soldier to then shoot an enemy, or remove that enemy's cover.  Now you can't unless you want to level an entire house with a grenade or rocket.2. After getting to the broken alien base invasion that crashes to desktop, I still have no idea how cover works.  You get the little icons showing half and full cover, but half the time the aliens are shooting my people in the face through walls while I miss 95% to hit shots.3.  The aliens get to literally drop into maps where ever they want.  You could be going through a map perfectly fine and dandy, and then the game will drop random thin men and other aliens directly onto your positions, even sharing the same exact squares your players are on.  This has nothing to do with tactics, it's cheap RNG designed to punch your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in.4.  You never get the drop on aliens.  They get a free turn when your soldiers ""discover"" them.  So, halfway through a movement your soldier will spot an alien, and then your soldier pauses while the aliens get to scramble out of the way and take cover.  It's a free move they get each and every time, so instead of rewarding you for close quarters tactics like the old games, it's like you're discovering and pulling aggro on random enemies that always see you first.  I understand that moving soldier A who spots two aliens frozen in place (because it's not their turn yet) can set up soldier B (who hasn't taken a turn yet) to blow them up with a grenade or rocket (without the ability to see the aliens directly) could be seen as ""cheap"" but this used to be accounted to soldier A informing soldier B where the aliens are upon discovery.  Now it's just another facet of RNG that leaves you at a disadvantage to make the game more difficult than it needs to be.5.  The little ""Blizzard"" style World of Warcraft animations get annoying after awhile.  Every soldier and alien and robot is always dancing around doing some huge grandiose awkward animation that's so over the top it ends up silly and falling flat on the humor scale.  It pulls the wind out of any horror and despair the old games had.  Honestly these cornball dancing animations and the UI that looks like it was designed for an iPad seem to be something people either love or hate.  Well, I kinda hate it.  It's Diablo 3 vs Diablo 1.  It's PG vs Rated R.  I could go on and on but I'd rather track down a god damned solution to this idiotic video memory crash bug.  I can't stand devs that abandon stuff when it's still broken and they ♥♥♥♥ing know it's broken.			"

												First of all XCOM: Enemy Unknown is not like the classic XCOM. Is this bad ? In my opinion not. XCOM: Enemy Unknown is faster and action pumped as his ancestors. Most important for myself is, that the new XCOM has not so many Horror or shocking moments like for example when your solider is shot from the unknown. Now its only about strategy and action and I love it. Sure things like the old inventory or AP System are missing but after some time you wont miss it anymore.Let's get to facts like Gameplay, Music and Graphic.The gameplay for itself is very good and easy to understand. The tutorial will also show you the most important moves and strategies.The Music, especially ""Deployment"" is one of the best gaming music tracks. But not only  this one, the whole music is very good and matches to the individual situation.For such a game like XCOM, graphic is not the most important thing and sure it isnt but this doesnt matter. It is still good and supports the action.In fact it is safe to say that XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a very good game which every strategy fan should buy :-)			"

												I have blaspheme a bit here by saying that I never actually played any of the original X-Com games which I realize are canon in the world of PC strategy , but if they are anywhere near as good as this game then I may go back and play them as well. THIS GAME IS BRILLIANT!! Totally innovative take on turn based strategy. With smooth swat style movement of your team across the field of battle, you really feel the impact of getting a kill when you need to and the pain of sacrificing someone when the mission comes first. Amazing gameplay mechanics for the strategy aspect and a great base building/management system for leveling up. You really feel the global urgency in the whole story flow, and the soldier customization allows you to start thinking about backstories for them. I almost cried when the Li-Lee brothers Bruce and Jet sacrificed themselves to save a fleeing V.I.P being escorted by Sarah Conner and Snake-eyes. This game is an equal contender with Dishonored for GOTY as far as I'm concerned. 9.75/10			"

												Extremely challenging and addictive game. Suitable for X-COM veterans and new-comers alike, even though some might say it's more accessible than it once was.Strongly advise any starting players to start in a lower difficulty to get the feeling of the game; However, don't let the difficulty wall stop you from pushing forward and challenge yourself with an higher Difficulty Option - Your game style and strategies will only improve and gain from it.Good luck, Commander.

You won't regret the Purchase if you like Tatical turntable game. Also very very addictive, be warned i stopped playing to ease myself form the addiction.With the new expansion the game just got even better+ Randomized map and events+Includes multiplayer+ Fun gameplay+ Great voices and items+ Ability to customize your troops and name them after your friends and then watch them die+ Game difficulty easily adjustable for those that aren't good at this game+ Good combat mechanic can be easily misunderstood if you don't take cover+ The game story is quite decent+ Cameras angles are great on the attack+ Easy to understand, Hard to master- Losing units sucks, if you lose them late game you'll have almost no chance of recovery. ITS A FAIL RESTART OVER!- Though great story, I found the ending lacking- Sometimes the mechanic of the game confuses the hell outta me- Could get addicted			"

												I really wanted to like this game, especially because I enjoyed the previous installments a lot. But as much as I'd like to, I can't recommend the game, simply because it's littered with bugs.PositiveThe core concept is really appealing and the story progression and visuals are nice and fitting. I also enjoyed the soundtrack by composer Michael McCann. These aspects might make the game at least somewhat interesting for extremely frustration-resistant players and/or fans.NegativeWhat I absolutely hated was the overall ""wonkiness"" of the turn-based system. My squads frequently got spawned mid-air, allies and enemies got bugged on ladders and floated above them, hit-chances felt completely random at times (in front of enemy with shotgun, 100% hit chance - does not hit), and I regularly had to quit and restart the game for various reasons.Sometimes I was unable to heal anybody (Medkit spray animation played but recipient didn't receive any HP) and other times I tabbed out of the game - don't tab out of the game. There's a high chance for graphical glitches to appear and a reload or even a full restart is necessary.And one of the worst issues I have with the game: Half of the time you can't open the menu, mostly during alien activity. You see the aliens move to positions you didn't anticipate or your squad just got fu**ed and you want to load your save and try a different tactic? First you have to wait a minute until all aliens are done with their turns. That's annoying and has no benefit.ConclusionAll of these problems add up and playing the game got really frustrating. I still want to finish it, however I'm disappointed with what I've seen so far. The concept in itself is great but the execution is just horrible. Thus I can't recommend this game, at least not in its current state.			"

												TL;DR: This game is 7/10.  But! old original game that this is ramake of, was 10/10 because it had much much richer tactics. Why?! This game compared to original:- lack of inventory screen of unit during battle (and also at all)- related: can not freely have any loadout, e.g. 3, 5, even 20 grenades, or 3 nades and 7 indenciary nades, and 3 pistols, or riffle and pistol and rocket launcher... it's all dumbed down to few classes plus few ""buffs""- less weapons/items in the entire game- can not pick/drop/throw/pass to other teammate things in battle- can not do any combination of actions in turn, it's dumbed down to 2 actions usually walk, then shoot (sometimes 3 with some buffs)- I prefereed grid map more, in isometirc view, it's less cool maybe, but better for tactics- less advanced stats of each unit- less advanced shooting: usually just shoot, instead of aimed/snapshot/auto fire (some units can have buffs to do cover fire or snipe, but not all)- less advanced management of items in base- especially: there is just ONE BASE, so no way to have several bases, move squads between them, move items, aliens- can not destroy all map terrain !! :(- can not so nicelly set thing on fire and watch the fire spread- can not mine the terrain (put down trap mines at places where you expect enemy to come through)- line of sight of units is not shown, this is a very serious tactical problem! Does the guy cover this door with his sight or not? (In original it was more of fog-of-war thing, but it usually got that job done, because aliens are in undiscovered terrain - and also isometric map, and top-down map helped)- movement is done in 1, at most 2 steps. Instead of walking the say 15 meters step by step and seeing with each one what parts of map do you exactly see- missing map of entire battle (with marked units)- game chooses classes of your teammates, they are a bit random (e.g. small girl -> Heavy, bad aim guy -> Sniper, etc) and you can not change them or ""multiclass""- aliens are spawned when you trigger a waypoint. it's a bit lame.But there is good too, just not in the areas that I wanted the most from this game:+ it is not Dos pixelart game (like original) + cool 3d graphical effects and♥♥♥♥♥♥br>+ another xcom based game, yey+ the dumbed down version will appeal to some players that are a bit more casual and would not play the game otherwise+ the ""I hear noice from this direction"" idea is good... but it replaces the missing ""motion scanner"" and longer range spotting enemies+ maybe seeing this game will convince you to look for the old game (and it's modern free open source re-write OpenXcom) and you will get to see the best game ever :)Quite good modern version of best game of all time [for me] the UFO: Enemy Unknown game from 1994 year (also known as ""X-COM: UFO Defense"" on USA market).But the original game from 1994 was much better, and it's modern free version OpenXcom is even better and free to download (I highly recommend)....So if you have a friend who must have neat 3d effects in his tactical/strategical game, or if you want to see modern take on same story with 30% of original gameplay capture - play this game.In origianl - you could destroy all terrain in any way, build base in any way, arm units in ANY WAY (inventory screen), do any kind of actions on teammates in any order, there was only action points per turn limit. You could e.g.: prime a grenede, walk 3 steps, throw it to teammate, step back, drop pistol on ground, arm rifle, kneel down and take aim and guard the door.Or you could fire 3 random shots to set a barn on fire, deploy smoke, go in, pick up your unconcious teammate, and carry him outside.All in one action turn.You could there build any layout, usually a team unit had 5-10 items on him plus armor.How ever, it's still a game more interesting then other modern tactical squad shooters... 30% of experience of best game ever [imo] is still fun. You could buy it, but I can not honstly recommend it seeing the lost potential to be excellent.If you prefer deep tactical games and want all the options, or if you come here because you played the original 1994 game - well then you will notice how this game is dumbed-down in comparsion. But you can always get the free remake ""openxcom"" game, and buy this one here too.			"

												The design of this game is laughably bad. The ""spotted enemies get a free turn so often they can just move to flank/surround your squad and murder them freely in their turn"" rule is enough for it to be shown in a circus to be poked with sticks and laughed at. The classic difficulty is not classic at all, it's just a losing game against rng roulette where aliens get instakill crits from maximum distance while your guize have 40% hit while standing two meters away, because ""hardocre yo!"". Due to the above the game can randomly just lose itself for you. Example: one of these mind-numbingly boring VIP search and rescue council missions. I spot the VIP. I have to approach him for him to notice me. I cannot approach him without triggering two thin men spawns (that get a free turn). After I approach him, I cannot move him to a place where he won't be hit with a poisoning attack. After he gets poisoned, he panics. After he panics, he gets one-shot by one of the thin men that literally fall from the sky behind my line in automatic overwatch. Mission failed. 8/10, would rage again.The tactical battle mechanics have literally nothing to do with classic UFO games bar the ""secret organization fights aliens in turns"" premise. Even the most basic stuff like being able to shoot whenever and at whatever you want is not there. Instead, the game carbon copies the core mechanics (one move-one attack instead of ap, no free movement, 4 slot ""inventory"", attacking through skills with ""action camera"" animations and so on) from the so-called tactical jrpgs. Which is not surprising, considering this is a console game after all.The strategic layer is more akin to EU, but of course horribly castrated with things like one base, one skyranger, one (scripted) alien base etc., because that's apparently what 20 years of advancements in gaming brings us.

												This game is beautiful.  It has a dramatic soundtrack and solid voice acting.  The base design and combat mechanics are wonderful ... with a few soul-crushing game-killing flaws.tl;dr, I'm glad this game was gifted to me.  I can't force myself to finish it or buy the expansions.--The two action points are a grand improvement over the original x-com ... but restricting their use in any way was a mistake.  What if I want to fire first and then move or reload?--The AI mobs should NOT get a free movement the moment you spot them.--Why the hell can't I build more than one actual base and/or develop enough teams to respond to more than one terror attack at a time?  You're pitting me against arbitrary mechanics, not my ability to fight aliens.--All equipment held by an alien explodes if the wielder of that equipment dies ... are you kidding?  You know, you could've just adjusted the economy to account for me picking apart all the stuff the AI's drop and it wouldn't have felt like you were intentionally screwing me here.-- Why can't I specify what class of trooper I'd like to recruit?  The class system is cool, but it's crippling to have to fight a few battles with a guy only to find out he randomly rolled a class I do not need at the moment and be forced to give him the boot.			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a must for anyone. It's is both difficult, fun, and easy to get sucked in. I'd say the best reason why I like it is the fact that it's not a FPS (2011 and 2012 was nothing but shooters) and it was keeping me glued to my chair. The good is that it's easy to understand how to play, no 2 games play the same (so it's got high replay value), and it's challenging. The ailens will use the same stradegy as you. Use cover, flank you, and take you out as quick as possible. But with every play comes interesting results. You can fight to gather resources for weapons and armor for your troops along with building your base and Earth's defences.The cons are that at times it can be glitchy on occasions. I've seen a few that were odd but nothing bad. But while XCOM is challenging it's also unforgiving. One screw up on a battle will basically force you to restart your game. I've had to restart 6 times so far but I personally can deal with that.If you are a XCOM fan or a tactical game fan I highly recommend XCOM: Enemy Unknown. It gets a 4.5/5 in my book. And with that, good luck Commander!			"

Well, i'd strongly recommend you look up ""The long war"" addon for the game as it puts in a butt-load of more content, new weapons, new tech levels, new modifications for weaponry aswell as characters.It took Xcom: Enemy unknown/Enemy within to a whole new level of epic warfare.11/10			"

												I'm new to the series but still, I don't feel alien at all. You probably read about all the details about the game before reading my review so I'll keep it short;Sci-fi hardcore turnbased strategy game with deep customization, tons of different enemy types, different locations and deep strategic elements. The story is good but not that strong. Haven't tried multiplayer but I'm sure I'll get my♥♥♥♥♥kicked.Awesome game, definitely recommended.			"

												I loved this game.Played 90 hrs on it. It's not just a simple ""remake"" of the old classic but it adds new elements on its own to provide a great experience for fans of the old game and newcomers that never experience this franchise.If I had to criticise something it would be that the game feels a bit short, even with the ""Enemy Within"" expansion.

												Absolute genious work of art. One of my favourite games of all time. I liked the blend of tactical action and getting up close and personal with my squad. Yet underpinned by a realtime storymode which is arguably more difficult than the missions themselves. Classic and Impossible difficulties are relatively unenjoyable given the random and unfair disadvantage you are put at, but easy and normal are the most fun you can have with your pants on. Would play again 11/10, looking forward to XCOM 2.			"

												As a fan of the original X-Com games (UFO Defense & Terror From the Deep), I am very happy that the people at Firaxis and 2K Games have put the time, effort and canon into XCom: Enemy Unknown.  It is very much an honest tribute to the orginial game and I really do hope that the next XCom game will be just as good, or even better!			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown achieves a perfect balance between resources and choices.  At almost every level you have a difficult decision to make.  You want it all, but have to prioritize.  Offensive or Defensive technologies?  Research doesn't do any good without Engineering, but how do you balance which type of facility to spend your money on?  You get more requests to help than you can respond to - which countries support (in the form of money, research and/or engineering) can you afford to lose?  Do you build a well-balanced squad comprised of one of each type and manage their unique benefits in the fight or build smaller fire teams that can break up and bring more direct pressure on the enemy?  Don't forget about air force.  You need satellites to know what is going on in a country, but that doesn't do much good without the interceptors to bring down the enemy aircraft.  No time to cope with the buyer's remorse from whatever decision(s) you just made because it's another alien attack.  Loading out your squad, again, is a delicious balancing act - your options a direct result of your earlier decisions.  The turn-based squad warfare is the core of the game and where you really feel the weight of your decisions.   You can tell the environments are hand-crafted and a work of beauty to dissect for the best opportunities to get position on the enemy.   The destructible environments, somewhat randomized enemy spawns and the occasional soldier with low willpower panicking and losing control keeps the combat experience fresh.  The ""action cam"", music and voiced soldier responses are implemented well and keep you immersed.Really enjoy the promotion of soldiers and the consequence of them getting wounded in battle, or even permanently killed.  As they experience combat they increase in ability and have more options for you to augment their capabilities.  It is a sad moment when a character you brought up from rookie, and over the course of 7 or 10 missions, promoted to Captain is killed in action (especially when you have customized the names of your soldiers to match you friends).It is probably the greatest compliment to a game when the only critic is that you want more.  As is with this game.  On one hand, I wouldn't mind a deeper tech tree, more facilities to construct, more countries to protect, more varied weapons, an extra soldier or two in my squad, larger maps, more soldier customization, etc.  On the other hand, I don't want any of that because I don't want to risk the perfect balance they have achieved.The most satisfying aspect of the game is the ultimate result of being so well-crafted.  I really feel all my decisions have weight and consequences.  From being on the ground ordering a veteran Assault soldier to move to a flanking position - hopefully safely drawing enemy fire so other units can move up, but possibly getting wounded and being unavailable for the next fight - to making the high-level decision on which country to favor over another.  In my opinion, one of the greatest games ever made.			"

												So maybe you're not a fan of strategy games. Those weird kids are always talking about how they formed a trading agreement with Queen Elizabeth for sugar and rum while sanctioning Ghandi only to find out he researched nukes before you and they lost 1000 hours of precious planning...Forget them for a moment and realize XCOM:EU is very personal. There are no nations or sanctions or embargos...There's Earth and the little green (grey) men who decided to mess with us. You will start with a small group of soldiers and they will do as they're told. And they will succeed. But you will be detached until you reach a mission where you just barely scrape by because your wonderful French sniper who was surrounded and alone for three turns managed to not get hit once but crit'd every assaulting enemy. You are just glad they survived because they are one tough cookie and you couldn't image what you'd do if they fell and were lost...This kind of attachment grows out of XCOM and it quite honestly shows why the game is so great. It's smaller unit tactics grow on you faster and makes you care more.			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a really deep turn-based strategy game in which you have to defend the whole world against an alien invasion as the commander of the XCOM project which has been initiated to stand against the extra-terrestial threat.Sounds easy but the core gameplay in combination with the unforgivable Ironman mode makes this game truly one of the best experiences in its genre.The graphics are solid with a bit stereotypical yet not less amazing enemy alien and spaceship design, the score by Michael McCann is one of the things which makes this game what it is - always providing the best musical support on the battlefield and the gameplay is deep with the combat part and the base part where you have to manage the XCOM base with ressources, income and satellite support for member countries - so they can give you money and staff for further projects.The value is amazing and even after the second and third playthrough there is a lot to see!Don't miss out this gem of strategy gaming and my personal Game of The Year 2012!9.5/10			"

												Great game, it is intensly satisfying to build up your technology and your troops. Hopefully a start of more high budget strategy games (and strat games with plot, since I'm a narratively oriented gamer).Playing the game on classic difficulty at least once is recommended, it is a completely different game when you have to constantly look for good cover and not being flanked. You do a lot less run and gun then and have to come up with new strategies to survive - blowing up cover when retreating, alternate advancing groups and so on.Currently rather buggy though, avoid having too many save files for instance, but this will hopefully get fixed in time.

												X-COM: Enemy Unknown is an amazing turn based strategy game you will come across. I have never played any turn based startegy game in my life and X-COM: E U was the first because of its history. Most revived games normally turn down both new comers and its fan base. But this game welcomes the newcomers to the series with great comfort. The learning curve for this game would about nearly one hour give or take. With just a few hours of gameplay, i have just come to get very attached with the soldiers i recieve for battle as the game has perma death. The story does a great job making you feel immersed and you will quickly form attachements with some NPC's.Overall, i must say its a great game for any type of gamer to get introduced into turn based strategy games.

												This is a supremely well designed game. Its difficulty curve and gradual introduction of many new gameplay mechanics is damn near perfect. I've never played the original, but people complaining that you can't change your soldiers' underwear and upgrade their wristwatch before sending them over to your base in Uzbekhistan with 9 meticulously designed rooms courtesy of the Israeli architect presently fiddling with the top pixel of the bolt of the custom designed Uzi in your 82nd armory, are massive dongs.

												I'm not an action game player be nature, and this is a little different than most action games.  I bought this game cause you guessed it, it was on sale.  Wow, it's amazing, the game place takes you from the battlefield where you fight some wicked aliens to the resistance underground base of which you are the head.  Fully immersive game play, exciting, interesting and this next part comes with a warning, ADDICTIVE.  At 39.99 I don't recommend many games but I'm about to put my 40th hour into it with not signs of slowing.  Great job.			"

												Why did I just recently get into this game?  I got it because it was on sale and got the DLC for it.I've been missing out all this time.  This game is addicting.  Wish there were more just like this.Planned out well, graphics are great, gameplay has no issues. If you want to be addicted to another game for a bit, I highly recommend this.  Can't wait til I finish XCOM before I start the DLC.Wish there was a workshop for it though and the ability to sell weapons/gear you don't use anymore though.Game gets a 9/10 from me.			"

												Have you ever wanted to manage a government program whose funding is both lacking and revoked for irrational reasons? If so, XCOM is the game for you. Basically, this is two games in one a strategy game and a ridiculously frustrating turn based mechanic. I say that it is frustrating because every xcom player has lost a valued squaddie becuase of a shot witha  99% chance of hitting, missing. This wouldn't be so bad, if the consequences were not permanent. Ironman mode is the only real way to play, since otherwise you can just savescum and reverse undesirable outcomes. The strategy aspect of the game is not terribly deep, but still presents a fairly nuanced economy, that becomes much more difficult to manage at higher difficulties. It is worth noting that on ironman mode completely failed attempts are common. This game is unique in that you can lose and simply have to restart. This is no linear shooter with checkpoints, decisions have real consequences, and you can lose your entire program with nothing more than a string of bad luck. I know that I haven't made this game sound too fun, but I promise it is wickedly addicting. Permanent consequences and the ability to lose are sorely missed game mechanics in this day and age, at least to me. If you can accept that, this game will suck you in keep you on the edge of your seat, despite the gameplay amounting to nothing more than pointing and clicking.			"

												XCOM: EU is a fantastic reimagining of the original game, it takes many elements from other games within the genres and expands upon them in unique and personal ways.It is essentially a turn based strategy game similar to the C&C series (well I suppose they are more like XCOM than the other way round). You play as the commander, control a team of your choosing and full customisation tasked with defending the Earth.Many other people have gone into brilliant detail about the inner workings of the game and why you should buy it so i'll keep it short, if you like strategy games; buy this one.

												Had me hooked from the moment I saw someone else play it on Youtube. This game is hard on normal setting and best suited for people who like to think strategically, not just mindlessly blow stuff up. My only criticism is that the multiplayer could have been improved a bit - the game seems buggy when networked and the team editor is not exactly intuitive and completely different to the single player version you use before a mission. I really hope they release some sort of expansion pack for single player because I whipped through the game in about a couple of weeks (I don't play that often) and thoroughly enjoyed it. The aliens are sinister and cunning and very, very lucky with their dice rolls. Buy it.			"

The combination of Second Wave options, intense difficulty and the randomness of missions plus enemy movements make the replay value extrememly high. I have played it many times and right now am trying to beat the Impossible difficulty, which is very much impossible. I plan to get the Enemy Within DLC as I believe it will heavily improve my gameplay experience. I highly reccomend this game for anyone intrested in strategy as I find very few games to compare in quality.			"

												Arguably the best game I have ever played on any format.  XCOM is the first chapter in a series of turn based strategy games which later branched out into the not so successful space combat and first person arena before sensibly realising what it did best.  With an awesome polish and reboot for its Steam release it can't possibly disappoint any true sci-fi, role-playing, intravenous coffee drinking geek like myself.When you begin, you can play the game with its original Easy, Normal, Classic and Impossible settings, or you can initiate The Second Wave, which makes life a little more exciting by introducing variable damage, funding and troop abilities.With dramatic cut scenes and stirring sound track you take the lead as Commander of a mysterious and secret, yet government funded initiative to defend our wonderful ball of mud from the terrifying alien menace.  You are immediately thrown into the front line of an alien incursion and must fight off a Sectoid landing party which seems bent on human abduction and inevitable probing!Whether you are an XCOM Veteran or not, it is advisable to play the tutorial, as the Heads Up Display is very different from the original release and the attention to real world physics let's you do more exciting and dramatic things .After the first mission, you then decide what continent you will build your first base on and each area gives you a different bonus, like a higher percentage of money, cheaper building costs or instant autopsy.  So it's worth thinking about what boost may suit your gaming style.Ok, so it's not the most original concept and yes, at times, the complete stupidity of missing a giant monster with a machine gun at point blank range will make you scream; but no-one said running the Earth's last line of defence was going to be an easy job.  For me, these are issues easily glossed over and soon forgotten when you drool over the incredible detail, depth and playability of XCOM Enemy Unknown.  This is truly a game you can invest time in and feel a sense of achievement from, as you research life-forms, materials and strategies while developing new bases, air craft  and let's not be shy... kicking some alien butt.You can customise your team's physical appearance, uniforms and weaponry and with the fantastic A.I. you can develop your own style of combat as you immerse yourself in the incredibly dynamic maps.For a re-booted game that was originally released in 1994 by Microprose, this franchise has stayed true to its original form and not lost any of its addictive qualities.  I will take my time and savour the nostalgia that kept me awake for hours and look forward to playing the sequels: Terror From The Deep and XCOM Apocalypse.I can happily rate this game 9 out of 10, so If turn based strategy, tension-filled exploration, aliens and cool weapons are your thing, then get XCOM Enemy Unknown onto your machine now!

												Pros:-Very challenging (IRONMAN!)-Guaranteed to get you hooked-Easy & Normal mode are not too punishing for beginners (although you're still almost guaranteed to lose a few soldiers and council members)-Involves a lot of strategy and decision-making-High replay value, especially with those Second Wave options-Each playthrough is randomized-Troops' appearance, names, colors, equpment, etc. are highly customizable (this is one of my favorite things about this game)-Has room for emergent stories and will get you emotionally involved-MECs, gene mods and psionic powers, amirite?Cons:-Limited modding support-Occasionally has some game-breaking bugs that require you to force-close the game in order to fix-Maps, dialogues and some missions are repetitive-Lousy camera controls-Mid- to late-game becomes too easy (I hope they add more Second Wave options to make it more challenging)			"

												Brilliant Game!! Has a unique strategy move to it. Everything from managing the base, shooting down UFOs, picking apart aliens with assault rifles, snipers, heavy and shotguns. Played a total of 140'ish hours, and still enjoying every second of the game! It is a must but, and worth every penny. XCOM Enemy Unknown is a brilliant game.! And the DLC Which is almost an standalone pack, a proper DLC bringing in tons of new stuff, new maps, new enemies, new tech and soldiers. And it Enemy Within really makes the Game shine like the splendid game it is! A must buy, and a must play. Brilliant, truly brilliant9,5\10 !!			"

												Do you hate aliens as much as I? When you see an alien do you just want to shoot him/her/it in the face? Do aliens make you want to puke? Does the thought of taking a jerk alien's life and just stick it into a containment chamber until it is DEAD? And, do you love alien technology? Then this game is for you. Ok so I havn't really gotten into any turn based strategy games but this one, is the one to go for. Is it brutely hard? Yes it is. Will you have to experiment by trying different things? Yes you will. Does every decision you make impact the outcome in the game? Yes it does. Will I be able to stop playing this game? No you will not.  "

												Damn, I love this game. Within the first 15 minutes I've slayed, interrogated, and autopsied aliens for upgrades. Had my squad finish a Terror mission without any casualties... only to have them all wiped in the next UFO landing (damned Cyberdiscs). Then create a trap using an ""Assault"" class unit and 5 heavies (ever see 5 people light up a group of over eager aliens? it's pretty satisfying).Pretty faithful update of the original (though not as hard). Great gameplay if you like turn based strategy, multiple tactics, quite a fun multiplayer, and pretty good replayability.Been having fun so far, and I must say ... I may enjoy it more than the original...			"

												Had me hooked from the moment I saw someone else play it on Youtube. This game is hard on normal setting and best suited for people who like to think strategically, not just mindlessly blow stuff up. My only criticism is that the multiplayer could have been improved a bit - the game seems buggy when networked and the team editor is not exactly intuitive and completely different to the single player version you use before a mission. I really hope they release some sort of expansion pack for single player because I whipped through the game in about a couple of weeks (I don't play that often) and thoroughly enjoyed it. The aliens are sinister and cunning and very, very lucky with their dice rolls. Buy it.			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a turn based strategy game.As far as many of you know this game is a remake of the original X-Com games, and therefore there are two possibilities. One is that the game is bad and the second that the game is great, so the question is on which side is XCOM: Enemy Unknown.The story : well what can be said about the story ? you take role as the commander of the XCOM project that it is the last line of defense of the earth against the unknown ( Aliens )  enemy, your role is to lead you soldiers to victory, expand your base, make difficult choices, and of course to defend earth by any cost. The story itself is just a side bonus I guess. You won't really follow it and to be truthfully the game could be without storyline.Gameplay : This is where the fun begins, the gameplay is all about : researching the aliens, creating new technology and weapons, lead soldiers to victory by turn based tactics mechanics, carefully making decisions and the most important thing the difficulty of the game can be changed by the player, but it is recommend to play Ironman mode which doesn't allow you to load you last saves in order to experience the real meaning of making decisions.Bugs : There are a few ""bugs"" that will make the game to be a little awkward, the camera angle will make you see a wall when in reality you should see you soldier fire at an enemy, there will be sometimes a problem when trying to lead the soldier to the second or third floor. Other than that everything is okay.Sound : There isn't too much to say about the sound except that it is exactly how it should beGraphcis : What can be said about the graphics ? especially of a game that came out in 2012, I can only think of one word ""Good""AI\Difficulty : This is one of the strong points that XCOM has, The AI is far from being stupid ( like in most FPS games nowadays ) and there are times when you will be utterly destroyed by them ( If you play at the more higher difficulty when you have no experience, like me ). The difficulty of the game is impressive, you may be asking yourself ""what can be so impressive by the difficulty level ?"" well let me answer you to that, the game accepts both casual\biggener or new to the franchise and accepts to the hardcore and experienced gamers to the X-com game. You can add some ""mods"" in order to make the game more challenging or easier it only depends on youSummary : XCOM Enemy Unknown is one of the best 2012 games, its challenging, fun, interesting and has infinite replayability. The game accepts both casual and hardcore gamers and is my personal recommendation to people who want to try strategy game ( when they didn't played even one ).  Overall I give this game a 9\10. "

												Insanely addictive. There's no way else to describe it.When you first start XCOM Enemy Unknown everything feels slightly clunky. Your troops are very restricted and no one seems to be able to hit anything. What you will rapidly realise is that you are about to take a journey with your soldiers to upgrade them and battle ever more challenging enemies. Towards the end of the game you will be doing everything you can to keep Colonel Sanchez alive and kicking and will be genuinely devastated when a grenade knocks out Major Moreno.There is some repetition in the levels you will play on but overall this is a worthy game for anyone interested in science fiction or strategy.

This means that there is no powergaming strategy, at least for your first few playthoughs. The variety of viable tactics keep this game fun and challenging.  Even though the story is reminiscent of a generic action movie, the gameplay is fully capable of keeping you playing for far more hours than you can imagine.			"

												XCOM is a nail-biting turn-based strategy that is chock full of nail-biting battles, wonderful visuals, and challenging gameplay.  My biggest gripe is that you have to take a passive role with combating the terror caused from the alien invasion.  It also lacks the feel of a large-scale invasion;  the size of the battles feels like a tactical contribution to an otherwise strategic war for the planet.  Still, I heartily recommend this game to fans of TBS's, or sci-fi games  in general. 8/10			"

												This is a streamlined version of the original X-Com games but I absolutely love it. One of the few games I've had any interest in beating more than once. This is TBS done right though it's very hard to lose people if you play carefully. The ending is a bit of a letdown and the maps can get repetitive. The expansion is more of an addin. It adds a short campaign within the game and lots of new research/equipment as well as Mechs (which are just awesome) and the ability to augment other soldiers. Overall, if you don't have XCOM yet I recommend buying the expansion too. If you've already bought XCOM, you can probably pass unless you enjoy the game enough to beat it multiple times.			"

												A reboot of the old X-COM franchise, Firaxis succesfully brought the turn based tactical game back into the spotlight on the PC. By making the game more open to everyone, it makes it a fun experience for many who are interested in turn based games. The theme of fighting against an alien invasion force feels fun however the story isn't that great beyond that. The good news about the story is that XCOM 2 starts off whenever you lose so that's good.  Now as for the game itself. the only issue I can think about the game besides its story is the repetitive usage of maps. After a while, you know exactly where the aliens are going to spawn and what to expect. I recommend getting XCOM with Enemy Within as that adds a whole lot of content for cheap.			"

												Like squad based strategy? Like kicking alien♥♥♥♥♥♥all over the earth? THEN PLAY THIS GAME!No, seriously, it's a good game. That said (and since the topic was raised), the only problem I had with it was a tiny oversight that somewhat negatively impacted the feeling of realism, it's missing that one thing, that tiny titbit of detail, that would make it seem as real as any ol' alien encounter today is (and y'all know it is). I am, of course, talking about the lowly Anal probe. Yes, indeed, the extra-terrestrial past time of cavity exploration, by way of some very novel and creative implements. Even though we all know it as the stock trade of those little baldheaded grey perv... visitors, it seemingly doesn't even have a proper cameo anywhere in the game.Tsk tsk... I'm sure they'll fix it with another expansion. Thought it was going to be ""Enemy Within"", alas it was not. Lack of bum probes aside, don't let a tiny oversight like that dissuade you from buying,this game is money well spent, and with the current sale it would literally be half the money(I paid) well spent.

If you've played the original back in the day, you will fall in love all over again in this awesome science fiction turn-based action game.Build up your base & equipment, recruit & train your soldiers, do missions for the council and go up against aliens.

It plays very well and is very immersive. you get attached to certain squad mates and if they die, you just wanna reload and save them. you get this feeling when someone makes a clutch shot and saves the entire team, feels amazing. I definetly recommend this game to anyone who likes turn  based strategy.			"

												Brief history of my ownership of this game:1. Install game. Almost immediately encounter a game-breaking UI bug which forces me to terminate it. This resets all progress on the very long tutorial, almost none of which is skippable in any way. This pisses me off to such an extent that I uninstall the game (yes, I can be testy).2. A friend who is a huge fan of the game goes out of his way to notify me that a lot of bug fixes and other tweaks have been applied. Still curious enough about the game to be hopeful, reinstall.3. Long period of disinterest.4. Attempt again to pick up the game. Get stuck in a run-crash-restart loop that can only be stopped by terminating Steam. Give the game the benefit of the doubt this time; don't yet uninstall, hoping there's some sensible fix.5. Update graphic card driver, grit teeth, try again. Game now seems to work without any greivous errors or catastrophic failures....And, well, it's a hell of a thing. It has an excellent balance of depth and intuitiveness and is overall just very engaging, badass and exciting. Pretty much just as good as I was led to expect, which is to say, very. Glad I gave it that third or fourth chance.			"

You have to choose between EU and EW which is great as you will be able to play the less challenging EU at any given time. They keep their individual savegames in seperate folders, too.

												A reboot of the old X-COM franchise, Firaxis succesfully brought the turn based tactical game back into the spotlight on the PC. By making the game more open to everyone, it makes it a fun experience for many who are interested in turn based games. The theme of fighting against an alien invasion force feels fun however the story isn't that great beyond that. The good news about the story is that XCOM 2 starts off whenever you lose so that's good.  Now as for the game itself. the only issue I can think about the game besides its story is the repetitive usage of maps. After a while, you know exactly where the aliens are going to spawn and what to expect. I recommend getting XCOM with Enemy Within as that adds a whole lot of content for cheap.			"

												Prepare to tighten the seatbelt on your car, because this game gives you a wildride, each and every decision in this game can put you one step from losing the game, ♥♥♥♥ing your soldiers up, losing countries (and losing), leave you unprepared for consequences, and totally regret why you didn't see a few things out before hand. This game is brutal and has a big learning curve, and you know what?I love it.You're the Commander of the Xtraterrestrial COMbat Unit, other wise known as X-COM for short, a multinational organization which composes itself of the finest soldiers, pilots, tacticians, scientists, and engineers that money can buy. You must mange your resources like in an actual war, and make decisions on what to do, whether to keep your countries and funding on your side, or to have your soldiers survive. My first playthrough ultimately ended up in losing Canada and caused me to go about at a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ standstill wondering what I should do because I'm too low on funds at the moment to ultimately gather anyone their satellites.As I said, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing brutal, and if you want a challenge on a play-by-play basis for turn-based combat and frustrating 90% hit misses?

												A few caveats first: I am a casual gamer - I have played a moderate number of games, and most of them have not been completed.  I have played a few MMOs but mostly play non-MMO games in either single player or co-op modes.  Some of my fav games have been Lost Planet, Halo, Mass Effect, Need for Speed, Burnout, etc.  I like using a gamepad controller.  I don't generally like heavily detalied games and favor sci-fi and some balance between story / action.  So now you have some idea of my ""GP"" (gaming perspective).I LOVE THIS GAME. Not surprising b/c of sci-fi element. Story, voice acting, etc won't win academy awards - but is good enough to be enjoyable, if not a bit redundant at times.  Nothing is perfect - but I thought it was pretty well done.  I actually read most of the research conclusions, etc.  If not your cup of tea, just skip it. The thing is, this game has something for everyone.  Play it your way! And adjust difficulty to your liking.  Hate the story, skip it and turn off dialogue.  I am not a huge fan of turn-based strategy games, but I love this one.  I actually liked controlling the save system so I could play with different stratedgies.  And base management - IMO fine balance between resource management but not over-bearingly so.  Well done. Simple enough to understand quickly, but involved enough to give a certain sense of reality (well, to some degree - use your imagination :) to the game: You are the commander, after all.The game becomes easier to play the farther you progress - not that the alien waves don't become a little harder (sometimes)... which I like.  After all, the alien's didn't ask how leved'ed up you were when they arrived, did they? They were what they were - and you had to learn, adapt, research, build, get better !  So be careful early on and pay attention to resource allocation.Graphics: Good to better-than-good.  Fine for what the game is.Music:  Very well done - I thought it set the mood well. Voice:  Repetitive but ok - filled out the story ok.Controls:  I am biased - I like controllers - and they implemented gamepad control (xbox mode) very well.  Fairly intuitive.  Cannot comment on keyboard/mouse control.  Issues: Yep. Its a game.  Written by humans with limited budgets sold to a lot of people with no limit of preferences and opinions.  1.  Its a numbers game, with shot percentages adjusted randomly.  90% hit chance means you will miss 10% of the time (at least, by definition) - so don't think b/c you are 20 ft from the alien with a ranked-up soilder ensures you'll hit the stationairy target - you might miss.  But, sometimes you should then die, and it will miss also.  It evens out.  I guess. Didn't always feel like it. 2.  Repetitive dialogue.  Get used to it - or turn it off.3.  Reverse challenge model. Takes some getting used to. I actually agree with this model, just took some getting used to. Not really a bug ,,, just aggravating at first.  4. The tutorial portion is ok, but doesn't tell you everything. Some nuances of resource management will either need to be experimented with (might use save points first) , or read a guide or whatever.Note: I have not played the first XCOM game yet (plan to) so I cannot compare it to the original.  I also have not purchased the Enemy Within extension yet - so cannot comment on that either: I am looking forward to it. Last comment: Some games drive me nuts with save system and reply value on episode defeats, etc.  I screwed up a few times and had to replay long sections of the game.  I not only didn't care, I kinda enjoyed it again!  The only sad part of the game for me was the last mission - b/c I knew it was about over.  And then it was.  Sigh. Great game. "

												It honestly seems like it is probably a good game. However, I'm not sure if this is just happening to me or maybe others are experiencing the same problem that I am, a problem that makes the game useless. Every time I try to play the game (single player) I wind up with first wonky camera sliding around the screen and then excessive camera shake. I can tell the game is obviously not supposed to function this way, though I have no idea of how to fix it. Anyway, I would still recommend this game as I'm sure that my issue is probably something I need to do to fix it.			"

												Pros:-Very challenging (IRONMAN!)-Guaranteed to get you hooked-Easy & Normal mode are not too punishing for beginners (although you're still almost guaranteed to lose a few soldiers and council members)-Involves a lot of strategy and decision-making-High replay value, especially with those Second Wave options-Each playthrough is randomized-Troops' appearance, names, colors, equpment, etc. are highly customizable (this is one of my favorite things about this game)-Has room for emergent stories and will get you emotionally involved-MECs, gene mods and psionic powers, amirite?Cons:-Limited modding support-Occasionally has some game-breaking bugs that require you to force-close the game in order to fix-Maps, dialogues and some missions are repetitive-Lousy camera controls-Mid- to late-game becomes too easy (I hope they add more Second Wave options to make it more challenging)			"

												This game pulls no punches at all so don't even bother getting attached to any team members.XCOM Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within are both great games with brilliant strategic elemants incorparated into them, however this strategy is also tagged with a lot of realism. Realism is by no means bad at all but frustrating? It is. In XCOM your soldiers are like actual human beings, they're tough but extremely squishy and can't take damage all to much. If you don't plan ahead of a mission... YOU. ARE. SCREWED. Here's an example one of my men run forward I've had a great winning streak for the past 5 missions. I move one guy forward and what do I see? 2 Floaters and one of those close combat aliens... Crysillids? But he dies instantly no help Everything critsAll around though it is really well made and the realism adds to the difficulty which is great for this game			"

												Xcom is a game about strategy, good tactics and for those who really like a challenge with consequences to their gaming. It’s a reboot of a old franchise in new guise, where it's streamlined and modern without dumbing down on what made the original so good.You care and feel for the soldiers under your command, and cry as they get killed (by something you did or just bad luck). All while following a storyline that got a distinct feel of old Sci Fi Horror B movies, something i think really work in the game's favor. That said, for those that are not into the “classic” mode and every decision is final and no take backs, there is modes where you can save and play less punishing to your gameplay.As far as multiplayer goes it is a bit bare bones, if you have friends into it and want to take some turn based action there is some stuff to work with here. Issue is mostly the fact that it is point based, it has little customization value and overall it is kind of weak compared to other titles of this type. I would get it for its single player and then do MP if you feel like friends are up for it or just pretend it is not there.So, does it hold up to the old game? I think it is better, as I said earlier they streamlined the game to make it more accessible, easy to understand, a clear understandable UI and a good story to go with the attacks. You feel like you are fighting the good fight, you feel like every step could be fatal and you take your time to think through your actions to keep your men and the human race safe.You owe it to yourself to own this game and have it in your collection, so show the alien filth that this is our planet, and they are getting an eviction.

												A nearly perfect reboot of the original XCOM: UFO Defense.  The few mechanical changes they did make to the game all seem to be for the better.  For example removing the inventory system and replacing it with loadouts and classes.  The game does suffer from a couple very minor user interface bugs,  terrible voice acting, and some animation sync issues.  None of this really gets in the way of a great tactical turn based strategy game that solidly relives the greatness of one of the best ever in the genre.			"

												    10/10     Completed the agme after about 37 hours. I went in to the game mostly blind, only having seen a few videos. I decided to play just the original XCOM: Enemy Unkown on my first play through to see what I was getting into. I had played about 11 hours of that when things started to go downhill. My whole squad of high level sodiers was mercilessly slaughtered. I hadn't trained any other troops so I was left with nothing. Luckily my morale was high enough that I could restart the game, this time playing XCOM: Enemy Within. After my painful first run, I had the knowledge and the strength that I needed in order to face the alien's assult. XCOM: Enemy Within added many new amazing features that were tons of fun to try out. Even while wrighting this I have an almost irresistable urge to start up a new game, with some of the customs settings I unlocked.     Highly recommended to anyone interested in startegy games.			"

												I've had so much fun with XCOM over the time I've played it, and no matter what else comes out this is one of the game I always return to. I can't recommend this game highly enough to anyone who enjoys strategy games. Keep in mind that this game can be very hard, especially on higher difficulties, but this is a benefit, not a downside. While there are occasional bugs or quirks with game mechanics there are few that can cause serious trouble, and it's well worth putting up with them for the fun this game offers. Even once you're tired of the vanilla game it has more to offer in the form of the Long War mod, which adds far more depth to the game. If you're looking for a challenging and fun strategy game, XCOM is for you.			"

Unfortunately, it takes an expansion pack and handful of DLC's...But, when you finally have all of them, what you have in front of you is almost perfect. In-genius atmosphere of imminent UFO threat, great combat system and ton of tactical opportunities. But what is most important - the sandbox element and power, that you are given over how whole game is going to be shaped, according to your choices and often sheer randomness, that doesn't feel forced and pushed onto you. If you like turn-based strategy games with strong atmosphere. You just found your god. But please, buy it whole - without Enemy Unknown your experience is going to be ... simply in-complete.			"

												One of the best and most addicting games ever made in my opinion. I have never grown so attached to characters in a game, yet the characters have absolutely zero personality. I am ridiculously happy I preordered the game so I can personalize them a bit, but the game basically lets you write your own story for the characters using your imagination. Want to cause your boss to get eviscerated by a six-foot tall bug with spikes for hands, causing him to turn into a zombie before giving birth to yet another six-foot tall bug with spikes for hands?

												Very good game, I'm a big fan of turn based strategy games and this feels like a nice follow on from Apocalypse that I played years ago.I'd image anyone looking to buy this probably has an idea of what they will be getting, so I though I would mention some of the negative sides of the game instead.Loadouts: The way your squad is balanced is a bit odd, essentially once you reach plasma rifles and better levels of armour the game becomes notably easier. It basically means you go from feeling too weak to arguably too strong for a large portion of the game.Hit Chance: Ok this one actually makes me really angry and is the reason I will never play on Iron Man. For whatever reason the devs decided that if your squad has anything below 75% chance to hit it basically means they have 75% chance to miss. However all levels of alien can more or less hit you flawlessly from 2 screens away. It makes me wonder if the developers don't understand how probability works but it happens consistently through missions and I have spoken to other people who confirmed they had the same problem.Cover: Yeah... I'm not sure why there are varying levels of cover. Either the devs didn't understand how cover works or couldn't be bothered implementing it properly. Basically full cover acts as cover, anything else is basically your squad closing their eyes thinking that means the enemy can't see them.I mainly wrote this to highlight the flaws with the game(and for a little rant lol), because they aren't mentioned much outside of the bugs for some reason. This is a great game and challenging as it is but I never like part of the challenge in a game coming from either the AI effectively cheating or from incorrectly implemented mechanics.			"

												Percentages mean nothing in this game:  99% to hit can (and will frequently) result in misses, so expect fury at how this game handles probability on too frequent of a basis for it to be just bad luck.  Its seeding mechanic also makes suggested ""randomness"" not really random since it is all predetermined when the map loads, where procedures occur based off of your actions instead of random response as it should be--it reduces the strategy and urgency in this strategy game with urgency in its story, imho, by forcing the random number generator to be more static.  Even when set to ""random"" it still is procedural, and by no means actually randomised.  I understand the devs' position on wanting to prevent players from reloading saves to make the same choice for better results, but I do not agree with it since the game's probability is so broken to begin with.  If they wanted to take a hard stance on development choices without protest, they needed to iron out the flaws tied to the decision.Still, I sunk time into it, albeit swearing all of the while.  Good game, it needs work which will never come, and it needs Steam workshop for mods made specifically to fix bugs and other problems that the devs will continue to ignore (these mods exist online already, but they are not integrated with Steam).  This game's problems are too outstanding for me to ignore despite what is good, and the shortcomings are too numerous to like this game more than it allows me to.  Buy it when it is on sale, because with no support and no Workshop, I do not feel that it is worth $30 USD, but it is absolutely worth $10 ish.			"

												XCOM Enemy Unknown was my introduction to the Team Tactics format, following a recommendation from a friend who played the originals.Highly addictive, challenging and rewarding. The graphics and animations are excellent (minus a couple of odd close ups), the gameplay is fluid. The action is intense at times, and in a way you can become quite attached to your soldiers, sometimes favouring some over others. In some situations, you may even have to make that near impossible decision of sacrificing one or two men so that the others can escape, or to save those last one or two civilians, which is never easy if the soldier in question is one of your best.There's base building, researching, soldier classes (snipers, assaults, heavy and support), using alien tech to make cool new guns and armour, shooting down enemy UFOs, rescue missions, keeping countries happy by protecting them, making them not so happy when you fail, everything to keep you busy and coming back for more.As for the Enemy Within expansion pack, that just makes a great game even better. It's pricey for what it is, it's usual price a lot more than what I would normally pay for expansion. But it does add a lot of new missions, maps, and even a new enemy so you do (almost) get what you pay for if you pay for it at top price (I bought it when the price came down in the sale).Highly recommended.

												XCom: Enemy Unknown isn't just a pretty remake of an older game but a throwback to games that presented you just enough information to enter the cycle of attempts, failures, learning, and finally succeeding. By not holding your hand and letting you fail, even during the course of a pitched campaign, it really sweetens your successes and gives you a sense of personal ownership over them that most modern games lack. From its tough yet fair challenge to the way that all of the systems interconnect XCom: Enemy Unknown is an absolutely fantastic game, and somehow balances what could have easily been an overwhelming palette of gameplay elements into one ridiculously engaging package.

												If you have ever played the original XCOM then you already have this in your library. And you should, because it's the best adaptation of the original since Terror From the Deep.If you've never played an XCOM game before, here's a brief description:The world is getting invaded by aliens and you're the commander of the team of soldiers from around the world sent to stop them.  This is a turn based strategy game, meaning that you'll take a turn and then the computer will take a turn.  You'll control a squad of up to six varied soldiers taking on a variety of mission types, all with the eventual goal of stopping the alien threat. Each soldier has one of several classes (like a Sniper or Support medic) with special skills for that class that make your job easier the more you level up.This is one of those games that you'll come back to time and again.  Since its release several years ago I STILL find myself playing XCOM.  In fact, I like this game so much I own it on my Xbox 360 as well.  XCOM is a ton of fun with great replayability.  I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys turn based gameplay with RPG elements.  It's a great strategy experience.			"

												When I first played XCOM, I reloaded savegames when missions went badly.  Having come back to the game and finished it playing self-imposed ""ironman"" (no reloading), I've discovered that was a huge mistake.  This game is brilliant when there is real danger and losing a soldier could result in disaster.  Carefully advancing your squad while aliens lurk just out of sight is incredibly intense.  The expansion pack really adds to the experience as it forces you to take risks and advance more quickly.  Unfortunately, by the end of the game my soldiers and technology had advanced to the point that nothing was a threat anymore, though crushing everything in my path was still quite entertaining.			"

												If you're into turn-based strategy games, go for it: this game is awesome and epic.If you liked the old XCOM, don't worry; they've changed some things, yes, but it still stays quite true to the original elements, and is occasionally hard as nails (as it should be). My only complaint would be that the currency is in § (simoleons??) instead of, say, dollars or whatever else. It's much more epic to take a glance at your funds and see that you have a 56 million dollars to spend, instead of looking at 56 §. (I'm not sure if there's a mod for this, at least I haven't found one yet.)And yes, this game has mod support on the XCOM Nexus. I highly recommend the Long War mod when you've played the game at least once, it adds a lot more replayability value to the game (as if it didn't have enough already :P). I'm now on my second game and I plan to play the campaign a few more times at least.I highly recommend!			"

												I remember the old X-Com. The thrill of taking down the alien menace. The horror of a reaction shot out of the dark killing a soldier. The frustration of finding that last damn alien hiding in a dark room somewhere on the map. Those chuckles you got when you sent a soldier named after that bully from school marching to his doom in front of an alien firing squad.This takes the old X-Com we know and love and turns it into something...Well, new. The old aliens are back, with shiny new outfits and abilities, plus some new odds and ends to spruce things up. Take heed, though. This is a game where Chaos Theory comes into play. The smallest screw-up could lead to a Code Black. That said, for those of you who love nothing more than to see your alien brothers splattered across the ground, this game will be a real hoot.			"

												XCOM: EU is a throwback to an era of hardcore turnbased strategy games. While XCOM: EU maintains the IP of it's predecessor, the mechancis are vastly different. My favourite part of this game is naming the characters after friends and family, watching them gain experience, grow and equipping them with bigger more powerful weapons. There are times when you will become emotionally attached to them. Try stop yourself from reloading if they die on you in a mission.Where this game falls short is the lack of weaponry and upgrades. There are only 3 tiers of weapons and 4 different types of weapons, (rifle, shotgun, sniper, machine gun). Although this simplifies the game, it would be realy neat if there were more weapons with slightly differences that allow players to customize their squad even more.While the game is stream lined and simplified, it still achieves the feeling that you're running a secret programme to save the world, there are many choices in the game and you can't save everyone, ""You can't eat your cake and have it"".

Then create a trap using an ""Assault"" class unit and 5 heavies (ever see 5 people light up a group of over eager aliens? it's pretty satisfying).Pretty faithful update of the original (though not as hard). Great gameplay if you like turn based strategy, multiple tactics, quite a fun multiplayer, and pretty good replayability.Been having fun so far, and I must say ...

												I love XCOM and I think this is a worthy continuation of the series. The first thing I want to mention is the change in control scheme and how some people say its more casual. This game is WAY too hard to be considered casual. While there are some elements that I really hate (abduction missions come in threes and it is impossible to handle all three of them at once thus increasing panic. In the originals if you tried really hard you could go to every mission, it was hard, but possible. This game makes it flat out impossible. It's complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and I hate it) there are a lot of functions I really like. The soldier upgrades, satellites, council funding, skyranger bases, and the new options in second wave are all much improved. But the game eliminates action points and limits the player to two actions, vastly limits the soldiers inventory, and restricts the player to a maximum of six soldiers (the original had like, 16 or something crazy big).The game difficulty is about on par with the originals. I just played it and the game threw three different missions at me in one day. Half my squad is still recovering from wounds and the day before I took out an alien base which should have stopped more missions from happening for a while. This game will push you down and kick you until you stop moving.I still love it.			"

												Great reboot of the series. I strongly recommend playing in Ironman mode (no scum saving) to get the right feeling from the game. It also has a great mod called Long War that adds a ton to the game and changes it a lot.Typically to Firaxis, tha game is a bit ""gamey"" (unnatural  mechanics thrown in for the sake of complexity or because they couldn't do it better). For exemple you have 2 actions in place of the old Action Points system, only one base, and a pretty limited squad (both in number and items). I guess it's pretty hard to make a game balanced and not (too) gamey. Pros: big improvement(s) over the old ones. Cons: gamey , only one base, pretty limited squad Pretty good!

												I'm experienced with strategy games (hundreds of hours in Fire Emblem games), but I was brand new to XCOM. I had never played any of the prequels. I decided to give XCOM: Enemy Unknown and its full-fledged expansion, Enemy Within, a chance and I was not disappointed. Far from it. I am very impressed with the complex tactics that require one to combine aggression with caution in order to get the best results.I'm not going to lie - when I first started I was getting my butt handed to me on a platter even on Easy. But with some practice I acquired a feel for the cover system. Combined with the various tech upgrades, gene mods, psionic abilities, and MEC builds, the gameplay is incredibly deep and well thought out. Customizing the soldiers was an amusing pasttime between difficult missions as well.The thing I like most about the game is how it's uncompromisingly difficult at anything above Easy (thus providing tons of replayability in its challenges), but is rarely unfair. Sometimes you do have instances where your soldier misses what should have been an easy shot, but for the majority any punishment you take is due to tactical mistakes or overextension of vulnerable troops. My main gripe is that it's just a tad too easy to break the game with MECs. A team of 3 MECs, an Assault, a Support, and a Sniper can destroy anything and everything in their path (even the crazy-tough Sectopods) with little difficulty.I HIGHLY recommend this game for anyone that likes strategy games. It's a perfect combination of strategy (planning your weapon upgrades and modifications), tactics (in battles, like getting to Meld containers without getting ambushed), and management (loadouts and general customization). It's streamlined so it's relatively easy to pick up for a newcomer like myself, but at the same time is very challenging. Nothing in a strategy game is more satisfying than completing a really hard mission with no casualties.I wish I had picked this game up sooner.			"

												Only bad part about this game, is that once aliens or ""humans"" are detected, they get a free move to get to cover.But that only occurs once, per unit.This game is very close to the original game, although you can't pick up individual weapons from the battlefield, nor can you have more than eight people out on the ground at once.In X-COM: Apocalypse, You could have as many squards you wanted. With a max of seven or eight squards per mission. If I remember right, each squard could have six or eight soldiers each.However, I still hightly recommend XCOM: Enemy Uknown, with XCOM: Enemy Within added ontop of it.It's a great and unique experience.8.9/10If you want to have a quick look at the game before you spend money on it you can see gameplay of the game at the following link:

												Just enough shooter knowledge to get myself in trouble.  But in ""Easy"" mode 2:1 and Alien scum have the good stuff !?  Be ready to balance your resources and build the good stuff fast.  Your soldiers will start dieing in lots if you don't.  Normal is when the AI pulls out the 3:1 and 4:1 odds and pity if you don't have the weaponary to defend the planet.			"

												XCOM:UFo Defence.Now that name should strike fear into even veteran RTS gamers,if you are as old as me.This franchise was the staple of horror and fear and nightmarish scenarios for many people when it first came out in 1994.It was a brutally hard game,really unforgiving,and extremely likely to absolutely murder you the moment you made a small mistake.You felt like you were always behind in that game,until you finally got the technology from your hardworking scientists and engineers to stand toe-to-toe with the alien invaders.Horror and tension ran the game and you always were afraid of what would happen afterwards.And now.We have this.XCOM:Enemy Unknown. This game often seems to be overlooked for some reason,and i am unable to decipher why.But to the point.Enemy Unknown is a turn-based RTS game,You are tasked with the role of Commander for humanity's first and last defence against the alien invaders,the XCOM project. Your  job is to defeat your otherwordly invaders at any cost.Now,for the game itself.This game feaures 2 kinds of modes.Geoscape mode,which allows you to customize soldiers at the barracks, research alien technologies in the Labratories, and then build these items in the ENgineering Bay.This is also from where you will monitor the situation of the world and take mission requests from a group of united nations known as The Council.The other mode is the Battlefield.When an UFO lands,ALien Abductions are spotted,or aliens terrorize cities,your soldier are fielded onto whereveer the current situation demands.You will then control them with a Turn-based system to find aliens,neutralize them(be it lethally or non-lethally(Lethally,i prefer,curse those damn Berserkers)),rescuse civillians,,escort VIP's,disarm Bombs,or sequre important cargo.The game offers a good amount of different types of weapons,amrour and items to equip your soldiers with.Equip your squads with the best that humanity has to offer in conventional weapons,from shotguns,rifles,LMG's,SNiper rifles,and rocket launchers,add grenade sinto thee mix and with a pistol for a sidearm,and you are good to go..right?Not really.You will not last llong in the world if you rely on human weaponry.WHich also makes it important to capture or build alien weapons of your own.through the research systems,you will be able to research new technology for the engineers to later build in the form of  amrour that turns your soldier invisible, laser rifles,or the almighty Fusion Launcher,an auto-targeting(Presumably) plasma-fuelded warhead which will destroy everything within many blocks,be it cover,enemies,or your own damn team!But weaponry alone is not going to cut it for humanity's finest.You will have to rely on the world to aid you in keeping your soldiers alive.Aka you must find suitable cover for your soldiers to hide behind.Everything form boulders,trees,cars,walls, PLANT POTS!Pillars,and even UFO flight computers can provide you with cover which willl be your squad's main survival tactic. Aliens will utilize the same amount of cover as you do,with the exepction of more..feral aliens like the Muton Berserker and the infamous Chryssalid.However,all those things will have no say in the matter if you are not allowed to go a bit off the rails in terms of'realism'. Enhance your soldiers with 'Psionic Power'if they,in the game's terms'Gifted'.These powers will allow soldiers to damage,defend,de-rail enemy fire(Like Fortune's *Luck* in metal GEar Solid 2:SOns of Liberty)induce panic and disorder,or take contorl of an enemy's mind and use him against his fellow aliens-in-arms.As the game progresses,you will want to prioritize squad survival with better armour and weapons.Armours come in many forms,form what i said before,turning you inviisble,hhave grappeling hooks for height scaling,a jetpack,Psi-armour,which enhances Psychic soldier's already face-melting powers,or the almighty Titan amrour,which provides the best amount of health,and also Immunity to fire and poisons(Noteably from Thin Men)However,once you have reached the staple of technology in the game,you should never construct things like Carapace armour or Laser weaponry,as it becomes obselete in the long run.But the war cannot be won solely on our own soil. The sky is filled with bogeys,and it is X-Com's job to shoot these UFO's down with their Interceptors.Initially equipped with the traditional missiles at first,you must shoot these things down before they can reach their objectives.Then you get on the ground and assault them.But the enemy has no shortage of tech of their own. Creatures like the Psionic Sectoid Commander,Notiroius Cryssalid,or the devestating Sectopod tell you that the alien invaders mean buisness on a worldwide scale.Aliens are very likely to always outman and outgun you at every turn,yurning a potential mission sucess into a desperate scramble to get the hell back to your Skyranger,X-Coms aerial transport craft in order to save your soldiers(Or soldier,depending on how badly the escape goes).The enemies show absolutely no mercy on normal mode,and classic mode induces the same level of terror as the Original game from 1994 did.The game is more action-packed and cinematic then its predeseccor,allowing for immersion and the joy of being in a firefight(Although you only select what abilities a soldier can do).The Expansion pack,called Enemy Within,improves on a lot of these features.it also adds new feaures to the game.genetically modify soldiers to jump 2 stories,regenerate wounds,or allow electric detection through the skin,letting you find aliens without looking directly at them,or enhance the eyes to allow for etter shots after each miss.You also have the option of making a new soldier class,of which i will explain in a moment.You cna augument soldiers with the'Squaddie'rank by amputating their arms and legs to allow them to be fit into cybernetic suits known as MEC's.The MEC is a new soldier type in the game who is what it sounds like,its a mech,but with a living perosn insade.The operator has acess to a lot of abilities which cna be built upon with a new resource known as Meld(WHich is also used for genetic modification)to mount a flamethrower on the arm,allow for a high-powered Falcoon punch,prximity mines,grenedad elaunchers,and electromagnetic shockfields to shut down robotics or fry organics alive.Now,for the classic soldiers.Assault,which can be equipped with a normal rifle or a shotgun for CQC,and with traits to evade enemy fire or allow for an automatic'Reaction shot'when an enemy comes close.They are your team's main frontline comba tunit,alongside the mEC trooper.SNipers are your long-range attackers,able to fire from exxtreme range,and can often be the doom of even the toughest alien if left alone.Support does what supports do.they should carry medpacks with them to heal your squad,or provide smoke-grenades or combat drugs to enhance defence and attack.The heavy class carries the LMG and a rocket launcher to devestate enemy installations and ruin cover,exposing them to more accurate shots.They can also be outfitted with traits that can turn them into'tankbusters'or lock-down enemy personel with supressing fire,and are the general demoilition's expert of the team.The game has Multiplayer,as well.Jump into the role of humans or aliens,or just mix them togheter.But the Multiplayer has a lot of issues.Bugs,lag,and glitches seem to be offputting for several people,me included.As for how the general game feels,is it good?Without question!This is a must.buy for everyone who loves RTS games.I still enjoy it to this day!

												A great game, period. Although it has it's moments of buginess and weird design choices, the feeling is INCREDIBLE. Each soldier matters with the deep customization system and each one is an indisposable part of the operation. Each soldier has a unique playstyle and purpose in the game. All in all, they matter, and when they die you feel horrible. I can't count how many times I fell back in my chair in disbelief after my best soldier was slaughtered without mercy. The only complaint I have is the science tree. Although there is a lot to do, it just feels too small. There are only three tiers of weapons and a few more of armor. I wish there were more variety to weapons and more types, maybe that had better accuracy and suffered a damage penalty or vice versa. Although this is by no means game breaking or anything like that, it is still something that I wish was just slightly better. However, that is my main complaint and the rest are very minor. Overall, this game is a great experience and you need to play it. Now.			"

This game will get you emotionally invested in every aspect of it (from the soldiers you deploy on the battlefield to the management of the base). Given the fact that Enemy Within just came out and added to the experience exponentially, This game is a must-have for gamers that love strategy or a good game...			"

												This game is fairly addicting. I wish i had more time to play it. It is my first attempt at an XCOM game, and I'm quite impressed. I like the different aspects of controlling base build-out, global panic levels, team makeup, and equipment upgrades. and each of those is OUTSIDE of the actual tactical combat missions. This game certainly has multiple elements that will keep your interest.Controls are a bit frustrating at times. When on the battlefields, it can be a trick to get the view to display exactly what you need to make a good decision. I have accidentally placed a unit in harms way due to a poor camera angle or height. SAVE OFTEN!Early in game (maybe just during tutorials), you may REALLY want to perform a task in engineering, but the system will take control away and send you to some other part of your base if the game has another task it wants you to perform. A bit less freedom than I would prefer. A queuing system for important tasks would have been a better solution than just stealing control away from the user. This is a minor inconvenience though. All in all, this game is the shiz-nittle-bam-snip-snap-snoop!			"

												This is a streamlined version of the original X-Com games but I absolutely love it. One of the few games I've had any interest in beating more than once. This is TBS done right though it's very hard to lose people if you play carefully. The ending is a bit of a letdown and the maps can get repetitive. The expansion is more of an addin. It adds a short campaign within the game and lots of new research/equipment as well as Mechs (which are just awesome) and the ability to augment other soldiers. Overall, if you don't have XCOM yet I recommend buying the expansion too. If you've already bought XCOM, you can probably pass unless you enjoy the game enough to beat it multiple times.			"

Controlling no more than six men per mission, Xcom provides a fresh and concentrated view of strategy versus the broad battlefields of the majority of combat strategy games.  Every move matters, as the xcom squad is frequently outmanned and outgunned by the extraterrestrial invaders.  Xcom also grows with every alien killed, allowing for new research projects and the materials to come one step closer to leveling the playing field against the aliens.  8.5/10			"

												This scintillating adventure of Mankind vs. Aliens beautifully combines careful base management with tense turn-based combat in a concoction that always has you craving the next sip. With a pinch of randomisation, a few fully fledged DLC packs and some interesting difficulty modifiers up its sleeves, the single player alone has the potential to offer near limitless hours of gameplay. Despite being given nothing but a name and some stats, you’ll soon find yourself getting attached to the soldiers you recruit, train and command on the front line. The plot isn’t anything revolutionary for a game about fighting the threat of aliens invading earth. Gratifyingly though, the game doesn’t waste any of your time explaining or embellishing that which could be ascertained through gameplay instead.Before closing, I should mention these views come without any contextual experience of earlier games in the XCOM series. But regardless of how it compares to its predecessors, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a masterpiece that has me entranced.			"

												best turn-based strategy game ever. remake of the former best turn-based strategy game ever.command an elite supranational paramilitary organization to counter an alien invasion.combat plays like an isometric turn-based tactical strategy game... the management between battles it what really sets it apart though. manage finances & base construction, reverse-engineer captured alien technology (including alien autopsies), upgrade & customize your troops, and then decide which missions to accept (sometimes at the expense of others.)  the difficulty curve is also rather unique in how you start out at a distinct disadvantage to the enemy.  the game rewards you for playing smart & punishes you for your mistakes.  this forces you to plan ahead to try and gain enough momentum to keep up with the game's scaling difficulty.  every decision makes you weigh the consequences of your actions.overall, a worthy successor to the original, both being among my all-time favorite games.

												I have played the game on PS3 and title was great success - mostly bacause it was one of the games you could see action happening on screen - while you hold pad in one hand and hot tea in other. Steering on controller was simply amazing. I'm yet to hook up controller to pc version as I have bought this to enjoy Xcom: Enemy within  on pc instead. Game is great fun. Despite little simplistic approach, it becomes very tactical very quickly. After one playthrough game become simply to understand, but maintain the challenging levels at all time. It is very cinematic at times, ad you will be telling stories to your friends.PROSGreat graphics tactical challengeunit customisationrandomised levels and second wave optionsController supportCONSRepetetive location setsBase managing could be more complicatedmore mission typesDLC seem to address some issues giving you more options and more sutable locations, therefore game is on my list to complete it again.

												Overall I like the game, but it is not the most histocially accurate game out there. If you are a history buff like me you would be annoyed by some of the details they got wrong. I just feel like they didn't put much effort into their research. I didn't get an authentic vibe from the game like I am replaying the greatest war in the history of man kind. However, like many red blooded Americans, I get a raging boner from shooting things in the face, especially illegal aliens. I wouldn't buy it at the $40 price tag, but if it is on sale for like $10 you are defintately getting your money's worth. Unless you need that $10 for crack cocaine than definately get the crack.

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a must for anyone. It's is both difficult, fun, and easy to get sucked in. I'd say the best reason why I like it is the fact that it's not a FPS (2011 and 2012 was nothing but shooters) and it was keeping me glued to my chair. The good is that it's easy to understand how to play, no 2 games play the same (so it's got high replay value), and it's challenging. The ailens will use the same stradegy as you. Use cover, flank you, and take you out as quick as possible. But with every play comes interesting results. You can fight to gather resources for weapons and armor for your troops along with building your base and Earth's defences.The cons are that at times it can be glitchy on occasions. I've seen a few that were odd but nothing bad. But while XCOM is challenging it's also unforgiving. One screw up on a battle will basically force you to restart your game. I've had to restart 6 times so far but I personally can deal with that.If you are a XCOM fan or a tactical game fan I highly recommend XCOM: Enemy Unknown. It gets a 4.5/5 in my book. And with that, good luck Commander!			"

You should play this game because of the great gameplay mechanics, it's like a really complex game of chess that is visually appealing and it is so fun that you will think ""I'll just do another mission and that's it"" then its 4AM and you are still playing. and when you finish the game (which takes a while even on easy), just start a a new game on a harder dificulty, and you will have many, many hours of fun.

I gave up.     2)Some video problems, tearing ect.. I think its mostly my video card, but then again, I can play War Thunder with no probs, World of Tanks, Ships, Planes, I have no video problems.  Which tells me it might not be my video card.  Meh...  If I cant find the solution with this current problem of getting kicked back to desktop, and if its not my video card, ect..  then its gotta be the game.  In which I cant recommend it to ANYONE, cuz why would I want to put them through what im goin through??!!  Yea.... NOT! lol			"

												Plays a lot like Invisibe, Inc from Klei Entertainment, with combat taking the spotlight. Stealth? Nah, not really. Some little perks and abilities that make you harder to hit, even limited invisibility, but stealth just isn't a part of this game. Then again, that hasn't impacted my enjoyment in the least.I normally worry about a game's plot, believability, human connection, etc. Enemy Unknown has been a nice change from CoD's hollow characters and linear story. Imagine Halo 4, but your total empathy hovering around 3/5ths of what you felt when Cortana died.Going into a tough mission and bringing all your guys back out gives you an honest feeling of accomplishment. Just for one second, imagine you did something worthwhile with your life, no pressure, no excectations, and it took you a good day to do it. That's how I feel at the end of a battle.TL;DR I vaguely disliked Final Fantasy-ish combat, but this game has renewed my interest. Just when you think you have the world under control, some jerk with weird anatomy walks in and messes everything up. Buy it!			"

												3D humans-versus-aliens turn-based tactics game.In missions, you control a squad of 4-6 soldiers and engage in shootouts with a wide variety of aliens. Combat cleverly draws from the mechanics of some modern first-person shooters. Most units die very quickly - sometimes in a single shot - but you can greatly improve your soldiers' odds of survival by keeping them behind cover relative to the aliens' positions. The other combat mechanics are a nice mixed bag that will have you managing cooldowns, conserving ammo, and carefully aiming grenades and rockets. The game does have its flaws, though: it suffers from some annoying bugs, the interface design is poor, and some random events can feel rather unfair.Between missions, you assign abilities and equipment to your surviving soldiers, build facilities at your base, research upgrades, and send interceptors out to shoot down UFOs. The base-building mechanics aren't particularly deep, but they  do provide plenty of opportunity for customization.Very solid game: simple yet tactically challenging.			"

												Only bad part about this game, is that once aliens or ""humans"" are detected, they get a free move to get to cover.But that only occurs once, per unit.This game is very close to the original game, although you can't pick up individual weapons from the battlefield, nor can you have more than eight people out on the ground at once.In X-COM: Apocalypse, You could have as many squards you wanted. With a max of seven or eight squards per mission. If I remember right, each squard could have six or eight soldiers each.However, I still hightly recommend XCOM: Enemy Uknown, with XCOM: Enemy Within added ontop of it.It's a great and unique experience.8.9/10If you want to have a quick look at the game before you spend money on it you can see gameplay of the game at the following link:

												I'm experienced with strategy games (hundreds of hours in Fire Emblem games), but I was brand new to XCOM. I had never played any of the prequels. I decided to give XCOM: Enemy Unknown and its full-fledged expansion, Enemy Within, a chance and I was not disappointed. Far from it. I am very impressed with the complex tactics that require one to combine aggression with caution in order to get the best results.I'm not going to lie - when I first started I was getting my butt handed to me on a platter even on Easy. But with some practice I acquired a feel for the cover system. Combined with the various tech upgrades, gene mods, psionic abilities, and MEC builds, the gameplay is incredibly deep and well thought out. Customizing the soldiers was an amusing pasttime between difficult missions as well.The thing I like most about the game is how it's uncompromisingly difficult at anything above Easy (thus providing tons of replayability in its challenges), but is rarely unfair. Sometimes you do have instances where your soldier misses what should have been an easy shot, but for the majority any punishment you take is due to tactical mistakes or overextension of vulnerable troops. My main gripe is that it's just a tad too easy to break the game with MECs. A team of 3 MECs, an Assault, a Support, and a Sniper can destroy anything and everything in their path (even the crazy-tough Sectopods) with little difficulty.I HIGHLY recommend this game for anyone that likes strategy games. It's a perfect combination of strategy (planning your weapon upgrades and modifications), tactics (in battles, like getting to Meld containers without getting ambushed), and management (loadouts and general customization). It's streamlined so it's relatively easy to pick up for a newcomer like myself, but at the same time is very challenging. Nothing in a strategy game is more satisfying than completing a really hard mission with no casualties.I wish I had picked this game up sooner.			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within...The main reason I bought this game was it sat between RTS (Real Time Strategy) and FPS (First Person Shooter).It can either be frantic and quick or slow and tactical dependent on your play style more than anything else. It’s one of the only game I have found where your choices early on in the game impact you later on.  EG not building Satellite relays early may mean playing catch up later on.Is this a hard game?No not really, I know a lot of people that use the auto saves to undo a previously bad turn of play,Will I get a challenge?Yes! there are numerous difficulty levels which don’t just ramp health and damage but actually adjust the AI of the game, allowing the AI units more tactical freedom than rush and shoot(normal). There are also further unlocks once completed which make the game crazily hard ( similar to the games of its heritage)What’s the Multiplayer like?Not so good, it’s often difficult to get a good game online. Plagued with drop out bugs and glitches which respawn your soldiers, online is best done after the campaign. It’s also very difficult to find a good game! In my experience I rarely met any ""decent"" players online, often most players will leave the game as soon as they know they are beat and if they don’t leave they will make you aware they don’t like been beaten. Add this to the low number of players online and you come to an uncomfortable situation of playing a smack talking player repeatedly because no one else is online. One further positive/Negative is the pre-defined classes, each solider can use 5 or 6 further modifications once you have selected each class. Then you have guns, armour and accessories. The level of customisation is quite high which is also a negative, as mentioned above with it been so hard to get good games or games at all for that matter.... it’s difficult to find a squad of units that works for you. Graphics/GlitchesI rarely notice anything which slows down the frame rate of the game but graphical glitches are quite common, for example when some units die there ragdoll often stretches beyond what it should do creating elastically stretched units which bounce back again after it is quite comical unless it was one of your units then it’s a big bug bare! Often the cut scenes form from funny angles, this means that awesome sniper shot of you taking out an enemy Sectoid is actually a close up of your units head or a nearby wall... doesn’t ruin the game but doesn’t add much eitherImprovements?Better multiplayer, time penalty’s for leaving, 2v2,3v3 (Lack of MULTI-player), online AI 2vAI, Skirmish( Can’t play simple fights against AI), Survival Mode (how great would it be to have your units of say 3 players outlast entire armies of AI)Would I recommend this game?At the current steam price of £19.99 I would recommend purely for the length of the campaign. With a few play through its easy to clock up a 100 hours on this game without breaking a sweat. I would say Wish list this game, it’s always in Steam sales for next to nothing and if you get this and the expansion pack (Other DLC is alright (Slingshot) not sure it’s worth full price) then you will not regret playing this game.Further Update 24/09/2015Ive been replaying this with the LONG WAR MOD ( GOOGLE IT)LWM adds in similiar functions to Xenonaughts, massivley expands the game meaning one campaign can take over 100 hours to complete. LWM really sets a standard for what Firaxis need to achive in X:COM 2 . Do not the LWM is a mod, its not supported by Firaxis, noting this I had longer saves(seems to freeze but its jsut taking its time) but other than that its pretty good.  It also dosent update your Steam ""Hours Played"" thing sometimes.			"

												The original xcom was one of the best turn based stategies of the past decade, the remake is the same of this decade. Great tactical combat, easy to get into, but hard to master (even easy to get into for people who aren't familiar with, or who don't particulary like turn based stategy). Decent story though, it feels a bit artificial and confusing at times, you don't play xcom for the story as much for the great gameplay, though meant to be played on classic or harder, the game can be a bit too easy if played on normal even compared to other games. Though on Classic or harder or Ironman settings, this makes a beautiful earth defense force sim.			"

												Rebirth of a popular back in the day tactical action game, involving Alien invasions on earth. Great looking top down, turn based, Alien repellent. Earth is once again invaded by Aliens, and you are given the chance to fight and eliminate them. Research different technologies from killed Aliens, construct weapons, tools and armor to aid your troops in combat. Level your troops and equip them with gear, build and expand your underground base, and stop the invasion. Take part in missions all over the globe to combat Alien invaders, in challenging turn based tactical combat. Great quantity of Alien enemy, weapons, armor and maps available. Game has good visuals, story, voice acting and animations, is a challenging experience even on easy. A bit of a downside that you can't co-op it with your friends vs. the Aliens.			"

												I love XCOM and I think this is a worthy continuation of the series. The first thing I want to mention is the change in control scheme and how some people say its more casual. This game is WAY too hard to be considered casual. While there are some elements that I really hate (abduction missions come in threes and it is impossible to handle all three of them at once thus increasing panic. In the originals if you tried really hard you could go to every mission, it was hard, but possible. This game makes it flat out impossible. It's complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and I hate it) there are a lot of functions I really like. The soldier upgrades, satellites, council funding, skyranger bases, and the new options in second wave are all much improved. But the game eliminates action points and limits the player to two actions, vastly limits the soldiers inventory, and restricts the player to a maximum of six soldiers (the original had like, 16 or something crazy big).The game difficulty is about on par with the originals. I just played it and the game threw three different missions at me in one day. Half my squad is still recovering from wounds and the day before I took out an alien base which should have stopped more missions from happening for a while. This game will push you down and kick you until you stop moving.I still love it.			"

												Enemy Unknown has its flaws and suffers from a tiny bit of ""consolization"" in terms of scope, depth, and interface, but it's still quite an accomplishment. After years and years of disasterous attempts to bring the X-com game style back into the limelight, this is most definitely the most successful. Though I personally don't think all of the changes to the original formula were good ones, XCOM stands on its own as a great game on its own merits.Enemy Within gets an even higher recommendation from me! It's a glorious example of Fraxis' ability to make ""classic"" expansion packs, while everyone else is lost in a sea of DLC. Instead of adding another world or story or anything, Enemy Within just makes the game more... everything. The additional game mechanics serve to further set it apart from any pre-established formula, while the rest is simply hundreds of little details that desperately needed a boost, such as map variety (the maps are numerous enough now that their presculpted nature is actually a joy), equipment variety (the game puts more ""toys"" in to give a better feeling of choice and playstyle), and soldier personalization (both in terms of abilities and appearance). My favorite thing of all, though, is a simple option (that I highly recommend!) at the beginning of the game which allows you to randomize the available abilities characters get to choose from. This is AWESOME and they clearly put a lot of thought into making it balanced, allowing interesting combinations without giving game-breaking overpowered situations or taking away vital skills that define the class types. It really gives each character more personality as you begin to use them for what you know they can do, not just their class types, and you don't need to rank a soldier up very far to begin defining a unique role. A few example of this that I've done, all with characters with only four or five abilities:- A sniper who gets massive bonuses if she's on a rooftop and has supressive fire abilites- A heavy weapons guy who acts as my team's best medic (usually a support role)- A grenadier support character who can carry multiple, more powerful grenades in addition to extra smoke grenadesSo, overall, I'd recommend the game! But now that Enemy Within is out, I can't imagine wanting to play without it.			"

Perfectly mixes Tactical play and action, and I've put more consecutive hours into it than I have into any game in the past year.

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is an almost best case scenario of a modern, mainstream reimagining of the fantastic XCOM series from the 1990s. While some hardcore nostalgia fetishists might not like many of the changes and updates, I found the new XCOM to be incredibly fun, and stand on it's own as a new, yet familiar experience.You take on the role of the Commander of XCOM, a secret internationally funded organization that exists to combat a growing alien threat to planet Earth. You have control of many aspects of XCOM, including base-management, scientific research, some basic politicing, UFO interception, and most importantly, directing your squads in combat.While some elements that added complexity (and often frustration) in the original game, have been removed or simplified, the overall feel and depth of has been retained. There's a palatable sense of fear and being outmatched by your extraterrestrial enemy, in both the global geoscape, and the turn-based tactical combat. The game also doesn't avoid difficulty, and I recommend playing the game on Classic with Ironman mode on for a legitimate XCOM experience. I cannot stress the awesome atmopshere that game has, that seems to draw inspiration upon some of best elements of last generation's sci-fi (X-Files, Star Trek: TNG, Independence Day), while remaining entirely a creature of its own.There's certainly a few bugs, the little cinematic whenever you run into an enemy squad gets annoying quickly, and some of the criticisms about ""dumbing down"" for the modern console audience have a little bit of creedence on a few points, but overall this game feels like a great homage to the original, while being innovative and streamlined enough, to bring in new fans. And hell, any game that makes turn based tactical games sexy again is worth my support. Highly recommended to all strategy and sci-fi fans.			"

												As someone who is very fond of the likes of Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre, I picked this up with little trepidation.In short, this is a turn-based strategy game in which you control a team of up to 6 soldiers in battles against alien invaders. It's quite easy to pick up while the aliens are ruthlessly efficient at murdering your poor soldiers. It's not a resource intense game to run (score if, like myself you rely on a laptop for your PC gaming fix) thankfully. Due to the small amount of soldiers you command compared to previous titles, you really have to think strategically in order to outsmart your extra-terrestrial foes. Using less important members of your squad as bait just isn't an option. I've sank quite a few hours into this as I feared I might. The aliens are nicely varied and require different strategies in order to be vanquished. The level and mission design is less so but this isn't a big problem. There are issues, however. These range from slightly irritating such as the frame rate dropping to single figures when a beserker moves to aliens spontaneously appearing behind your squad. There's also a high number of bugs, reportedly though I've only had to reload a level once. Overall, I'd consider this to be one of the best games I own. With the expansion out, there's no reason whatsoever not to pick this up if you enjoyed the older games, or have even a vague interest in using your noggin instead of the usual run-and-gun approach.

												Strategy is key in this game where every move matters.  You can customize your base and each of your soldiers to fit your exact needs while at the same time defend the planet from alien invaders.  I recommend making the game personal by naming your soldiers as friends and family.  The deaths and victories can be so personal and so rewarding.  You have so many options, especially with the new Enemy Within DLC and you won't regret this game as something that can be played over and over with different maps and scenarios every mission.Multiplayer is like a digital chess match where you have to outsmart all of your friends and a surprise attack from any direction can alter the battle completely.This game is a must have for any strategy game fan.

												This is one of the first games that I actually have the privilege of owning in my steam library. I originally got this from a Humble Bundle Sale Tier last year. I've never heard about this game before or the fact that earlier games of this practically made the pc gaming scene back then. Well to my happy surprise I have enjoyed this game immensely since deciding to try it out. I will admit, I wasn't too interested in this or the gameplay at the start, It seemed kinda hard and tedious. Fortunately this game has that magical touch that once you finally get into it, you start to enjoy it. Especially when you choose harder difficulties. (losing troops from brutal A.I, and learning and winning never felt so good). This game doesnt seem very long once you learn the core mechanics and beat it once but it has a huge replay factor when you decide to add other options like the various ""2nd Wave"" options and other advanced options available. In my opinion this game is still worth full price even though it is more than 2 years old. My advice is to make sure you get the complete edition though for a better experience when killing those pesky Xenos and saving the earth. Also this game has a mod called Long War that makes this game really hard (but fun). The graphics and sound are still quite nice, the gameplay has a few Line of sight bugs and random things that are less than desirable but it's minor and does very little to dent the fun factor this fantastic game has to offer. I do recommend this game to anyone. Thanks for reading. ~Commander Oreas			"

												This game is about taking risks.On the strategy layer the player manages the base building, research, soldiers and much more. There are a lot of things to keep track of and the game does a wonderful job by presenting the base in an ingenious “ant-farm” view. The complexity of the base and amount of things to manage increase each simulated month and the player is forced to make hard decisions what to prioritize. The game excellently builds up tension leading to a great finale.Core of the game is the tactical layer. The turn-based ground combat has a superb presentation and feels just right. Here the game really shines. Every misstep can mean death for a soldier and the failure of the mission and in turn more death and failures in following missions. But time is of the essence to collect the resource “meld” or disarming bombs, etc.  The best way to play this game is with iron man mode enabled (= no reloads), which means all decisions are final.  Never did I experience so much tension, drama and relief in any other game.			"

												Right so XCOM:EU, overall it is a great game and it's fun but by no means is it perfect.First off the Hit chance percentages are pretty much cosmetic and unless it's 100% you will in all honesty miss with even 95% and close range XCOM:EU logic.Difficulty advances exponentially so unless you know how to start the game, the early stages will be bending you over the table and possibly applying some lube if you play on difficulties below classic. But once you get past the first month then you will be bending the game over the table.Camera is quite buggy especially during certain mission maps but you get used to it although sometimes you do wish that it did what you want despite you knowing you can't see from that angle.When trying to use thrown and launchers the aiming is sometimes very temperamental and will seem as though it's ""nope""Only playing on Classic/Ironman difficulty cause Impossible is ""No Thank You""Overall I like this game despite the bugs and flawshttp://steamcommunity.com/id/noumi_kud/recommended/200510?tscn=1363793770 "

But as I kept playing it, eventually getting my hands on the full version, I was frankly amazed by Firaxis maintaining and even refining the old games’ feel while replacing most of the original mechanics.More at http://www.obscuregamers.com/blogs/?p=19 "

												XCOM enemy unknown is the best modern turn based strategy game. It has an excellent blend of base management and gritty tactical combat. It's a lethal game, where a tactical blunder means a dead squad member or a mismangement of resources leads to the loss of a country's support. XCOM starts off brutally difficult, with your soldiers clearly mismatched. However, as the game goes on, your soldier's training and equipment clearly outpaces the alien army. The disparity between your progression and the enemies makes the endgame start to drag, and the final battle is anticlimatic. XCOM enemy unknown (and I daresay it's essential expansion, enemy within) is a fantastic game that captivated me. It took me 3  days to complete the game the first time in 25 hours. If you're looking for a challenge, XCOM is the game to get			"

												If you like strategy games and/or enjoy watching things you love die, then XCOM: Enemy Unknown is the game for you. Despite the wicked difficulty curve hitting you in the face somewhat early on, the end result is well worth the losses you suffer. Especially once the curve sets in, you start feeling a sense of accomplishment for a mission success. And if you don't want to watch things you love die, you can make other people's soldiers die in multiplayer. As they say, ""War is a drug"" and this game is a clear example. The addicting gameplay calls you back for more, even though you don't want to. If you like shooting aliens in a turn based combat system and have a lot of time to waste, get XCOM.			"

												for all those who are unfamiliar with the Xcom franchise, xcom is unlike your traditional strategy game experiencefor starters it is turn based, instead of real time, and second of all the live of your men (of which you have few) are extremely valuablethe game starts out extremely challenging (especially on higher difficulties) and you will find yourself losing men and money everywhere, but as you progress in technology and experience (both your own and your troops) the game rapidly becomes more managable this is unfortunately one of the games largest downsides however, the game struggles to maintain its punishing level of difficulty, and by the end of the game you will literally roll over the now pitiful alien menacethe graphics and gameplay are solid, though there are the occasional bug (and missed shot) which can be frustrating, but will rarely ruin the game for youthe game is very replayable, but suffers from a short variety of maps, so after just 1 playthrough you will easily have memorised every mapthe xcom enemy within dlc helps fix this, but ultimately furthers the difficutly curve, as mech suits and gene mods only make it easier to destroy enemy resistance, and go as far as to make the early game a bit less challenging tooall in all however this is a great game easily worth your time			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a great, modern version of a cult-classic from the '90s. The earth is getting attacked by an alien invasion. The nations of the world found the XCOM to deal with the invaders - and you are the commander.The gameplay is divided into two parts - the strategic base building game, were you deal with developing new weapons, deciding what countries to protect with satelite surveillance or shooting down UFOs. The other part is the tactic mode - you send a squad of 4-6 elite soldiers to deal with the invaders. Turn based you move carefully, kill some invaders and try to take prisoners for further interrogation. Your soldiers progress in an RPG like manner in four classes: Storm, Heavy, Support and Snipers. Be carefull who you move first - one wrong move can kill a soldier you invested hours in.XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a game of decissions - do you buy a laser weapon or the better armor? When multiple cities get attacked at once - you have to decide which to defend, risking the other city and nation to get lost on you forever. You are the only chance for earth to repel the invasion. Use it - and have fun in a game I already spend 50 hours in.			"

												SO GOOD!...SO TERRIBLE! SO FRUSTRATING! The thing about Xcom is that the mechanics themselves are fantastic, they really are. The turn based squad strategy is fun, the overall research/building strategy is fine. The problem lies only in two elements: 1. Difficulty settings. 2. Random Number Generators. Let it be said, if you're fairly casual with strategy and you play this game casually on ""normal"" setting, the game is absolutely fine. No problems there. This review is not for you then, just ignore. That's just not for me. I recommend the game on this basis, that it works fine on normal and that the basic mechanics are well done. If you're very serious about strategy, you'll almost certainly find ""Normal"" difficulty too easy and ""Classic"" fitting in general (at least if you're only planning one playthrough). Sounds great, right? Could have been except for one thing: the variance on Classic. Everything is a roll of the dice, which is fine, but the variance is insane. You can do everything right and still lose the game in one brief moment of bad luck. I'll illustrate the problem with this one scenario that actually took place for me: Turn 1. Your squad arrives in the woods. You move them into defensive positions just in case you're being charged right off the bat. They're all in cover, they're all in Overwatch (guarding). Three aliens attack, the squad takes down the first one. The second one uses a skill that automatically deals 1 damage, it hits one guy. *BREAK* Let me here say that one damage is nothing, it really is nothing. So, the guy who got hit with the whopping 1 damage rolls a dice and panics. He panics by turning to his right and trying to execute his friend standing right next to him because... well, who knows. It's the standard panic reaction in this game. He rolls another dice and misses from point blank range. Just can't hit. Well, fine you think, but alas. Behind him is a seasoned veteran, a captain who has seen many battles. He rolls a dice too, he also panics. Now, he has taken 0 damage, he has merely seen one dude take one damage. Well, he handles panic in the same way and decides to execute one of his friends. He chooses your best solider (and medic) and nails her right in the back of the head with a critical hit, killing her instantly. End turn one. Turn 2. Bring up menu, quit game. Things like this just happen, they just do. You can restart the mission whenever they do, but it wears you out. Or it did with me. Worst thing is, they could fix everything wrong with this game so easily. 1. rebalance panic. 2. remove critical hits. Just those two things would limit the variance to a degree where the game would feel hard but fair. It's really all they needed to do and then the game would probably be a 10.			"

												This is not your dad's XCOM. A typically slick Firaxis entry, this is a re-imagining of the original that takes the bulk of the source and transports it into a sleek, cruel, narrative-led shell. The principles of XCOM are all here with some additions, subtractions and lot of careful streamlining. While some stand-out elements are missing (goodbye fully destructible environments), a lot of the things you would expect to miss are shown up as unpleasant memories that make the forefathers difficult to return to (weight-based equipment management, I'm looking at you!). It's a polished, shiny, occasionally eerie version of an old treasure that does everything it can to entice newcomers while somehow keeping the vast majority of the grognards happy as well. Only a few games genuinely earn a $30+ price tag, but I would not hesitate to recommend this at any time, let alone during a sale.			"

												Nice Remake of Ufo Enemy Uknown, which i had on disks ;)Seems to me like the game was a bit short, but maybe I´am wrong.Difficulty impossible starts first a bit hard, but after some technology advances, it´s getting easier, like playing on normal difficult. Hope there will be a remake of Xcom Terror from the Deep :) which was also good.			"

												XCOM: EU is a fantastic reimagining of the original game, it takes many elements from other games within the genres and expands upon them in unique and personal ways.It is essentially a turn based strategy game similar to the C&C series (well I suppose they are more like XCOM than the other way round). You play as the commander, control a team of your choosing and full customisation tasked with defending the Earth.Many other people have gone into brilliant detail about the inner workings of the game and why you should buy it so i'll keep it short, if you like strategy games; buy this one.

												So, this is my first time playing an XCOM game. I thought I'd give myself a challenge and try an Iron Man game on Classic difficulty. And a challenge I got! This game is brutal!Enjoying it thoroughly though. I think at 24 hours I've already got my money's worth, and I'm sure I'll be spending a lot more time with it in the future.*EDIT after 150 hours*Finally completed the game on Classic mode. After over a dozen of restarts and letting go of the Ironman requirement I'd set for myself...My overall opinion of the game hasn't changed much. Both the tactical- and strategy-layers are engaging and play very well.I do have some criticism as well though: I don't like the difficulty progression in this game. It starts out extremely hard. Your soldiers have paper-armour and pee-shooters for weapons. While the aliens you face use highly accurate plasma weapons. But you can catch up with the aliens fairly quickly and the game gets easier from there on out.In the last few missions my squad was completely overpowered. Most aliens didn't even get a shot off before I killed them...Still, I am looking forward to playing the game again. And this time I WILL beat Ironman!			"

There is only one thing that could be improved about htis game as far as i can tell and that is  the graphics, whitch are kind of out dated however that is just because the game is a few years old, and the graphics are still pritty good consitering the age of the game.

												I played and loved the original X-COM back in the 90s.  Since then, I've seen many earnest attempts to capture the same lightning in a bottle; IMO, they all failed.  Now, at last, there's a true successor.  Firaxis has done it right, remaking the classic with all of the skill and style of the earlier Pirates! update.  Many details are different, but the flavor's the same:  tough decisions on the strategic level, tense moments and cautious (or reckless) movements at the tactical, awesome shots and narrow escapes or another unlucky rookie fed into the grinder.

												Excellent round-based tactical combat game. Had a lot of fun with it.Graphics are good, but not stunning, same goes for the music and sound effects. You have a lot of freedom in tackling the campaign, as I discovered at the end, because you can compare some of your stats (ingame days played, UFOs shot down, aliens killed, squad members lost, days to event X, etc.) to world-wide averages. I found this to be very neat, because if you want to you can analyse your own playstyle. I for instance discovered that I had very few ingame days played, but I took my sweet time within the missions.Nuisance 1: The interface of the game appears to be made for consoles, I would have liked a better adaptation for PC. It isn't terrible, but could have been smoother. More apparent outside of combat missions than within.Nuisance 2: The hotkey system is a bit annoying. There are (customizable) hotkeys for standard actions, but every time you use them the characters ingame reply with the same sentence every single time. Want to put the whole squad in overwatch? Get ready to hear the same words six times in a row. The alternative is using the character specific actions menu, where they don't reply to your commands and simply do as you ask. But they get swapped around all the time. Want to have a sniper moving to another cover, switch to pistol and go into overwatch? If you make the mistake of looking at his menu before switching the weapon you'll end up doing nothing when hitting 4, which is 'overwatch' in many cases. Now it's 2. Switch to a Heavy and now it's 3.			"

The delivery of smooth texturing while threading the huge amount of graphics memory needed for a gaming arena of this size speaks well of the engine and software engineers.  ALL the wonderful people involved with making the XCOM franchise are the epitomy of turn-based tactical strategy gaming staff.  I truly enjoy not looking at a ""honeycomb"" floorboard that detracts from the environmental ambience of the game.  It is through dedication of people like this that will make the future of gaming a frigging BALLYHOO!

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is an almost best case scenario of a modern, mainstream reimagining of the fantastic XCOM series from the 1990s. While some hardcore nostalgia fetishists might not like many of the changes and updates, I found the new XCOM to be incredibly fun, and stand on it's own as a new, yet familiar experience.You take on the role of the Commander of XCOM, a secret internationally funded organization that exists to combat a growing alien threat to planet Earth. You have control of many aspects of XCOM, including base-management, scientific research, some basic politicing, UFO interception, and most importantly, directing your squads in combat.While some elements that added complexity (and often frustration) in the original game, have been removed or simplified, the overall feel and depth of has been retained. There's a palatable sense of fear and being outmatched by your extraterrestrial enemy, in both the global geoscape, and the turn-based tactical combat. The game also doesn't avoid difficulty, and I recommend playing the game on Classic with Ironman mode on for a legitimate XCOM experience. I cannot stress the awesome atmopshere that game has, that seems to draw inspiration upon some of best elements of last generation's sci-fi (X-Files, Star Trek: TNG, Independence Day), while remaining entirely a creature of its own.There's certainly a few bugs, the little cinematic whenever you run into an enemy squad gets annoying quickly, and some of the criticisms about ""dumbing down"" for the modern console audience have a little bit of creedence on a few points, but overall this game feels like a great homage to the original, while being innovative and streamlined enough, to bring in new fans. And hell, any game that makes turn based tactical games sexy again is worth my support. Highly recommended to all strategy and sci-fi fans.			"

												Do you hate aliens as much as I? When you see an alien do you just want to shoot him/her/it in the face? Do aliens make you want to puke? Does the thought of taking a jerk alien's life and just stick it into a containment chamber until it is DEAD? And, do you love alien technology? Then this game is for you. Ok so I havn't really gotten into any turn based strategy games but this one, is the one to go for. Is it brutely hard? Yes it is. Will you have to experiment by trying different things? Yes you will. Does every decision you make impact the outcome in the game? Yes it does. Will I be able to stop playing this game? No you will not.  "

But still it stands out in its own brilliant way with many new things to contribute like the 2-step movement, the specialization of each agent, the incredible good looking and in-depth strategic importance of facilities-building base, satellites coverage for world monitoring, the well made cut-scenes, the action camera close-up and many more.Definetely a must have, together with the oldies and a promising new start for the whole franchise.

												If ever a game has been deserving of a remake / spiritual successor, it has to be X-COM: UFO Defense. It's a classic turn-based strategy game with a great sense of mystery and dread, regarded by many to be one of the best strategy games ever made.XCOM: Enemy Unknown (what happened to the hyphen?) is an excellent modern interpretation of that fantastic game, featuring great turn-based tactical combat, fun character progression, a beautiful musical score and above all, that same sense of wonder, dread and emotional attachment to your troops. XCOM: Enemy Within further expands on this amazing game with a bigger tech tree, a new soldier class and plenty of new enemies to fight, as well as a multitude of new maps to fight them on.. if the XCOM-project isn't destroyed from within. A must-play for any strategy gamer!			"

												Um excelente jogo de estratégia que faz uma justa homenagem ao original dos anos 90 e atualiza a franquia com maestria.O jogo articula momentos de administração de recursos, pesquisa e construção com as missões, onde a ação estratégica se dá por turnos no combate a invasão alienígena. A mecânica é bem semelhante ao jogo original.Como pontos positivos da nova versão temos melhores gráficos e uma linha narrativa cinemática mais detalhada. Além disso a interface é um pouco mais fácil e auxilia o jogador iniciante.O jogo tem momentos bem difíceis, obrigando a fazer uso recorrente do save/load. Mas não chega a uma dificuldade impossível e frustrante da série original, que praticamente impede de chegar ao fim.Para os fãs de estratégia, recomendo!			"

												Modernized version of the classic UFO Defense with some substantial added elements (counting in Enemy Within). 'Modernized' not only meaning Unreal Engine 3, but also some simplified mechanics both in and out of combat to make the game more appealing to the current audience and to make the game flow more nicely. It works, though I do for example miss having multiple bases and an action point/time system rather than just having two actions per turn.I originally got this game right at launch, but was immediately turned off by the simplicity of the combat (I was expecting something along the lines of Jagged Aliance 2 if not the orignial X-Com) and it seemed very unbalanced. Picked up the Complete version in the last sale and somehow I loved it straight away. No idea what changed, it just grabbed me.This game with the DLC is in my opinion a worthy reboot. I hope it's reboot... please, let there be more!			"

												In XCOM: Enemy Unknown, you are waging war against an Alien Force invading Earth. You have to utilize limited resources to manage base construction, as well as scientific research and engineering projects to advance your team of soldiers into what is eventually a sophisticated military unit using hyper advanced technology.From time to time you are called upon to defend Earth from the invading Aliens, whether it be alien abductions in a major city or a UFO sighting. This is where the meat of the game is. You pick and choose soldiers who level up over time and assume roles like Sniper, Rocketeer or Medic, with permadeath mechanics involved.The game is really fantastic if you like turn based strategy games. There's a certain tense anxiety that comes from being pinned down by incredibly advanced, extremely dangerous aliens and hoping that one of your soldiers can pull of a shot that will shake up the situation and turn it into your favor. If you like the game, pick up the Enemy Within expansion as well, which is a comprehensive expansion pack that adds Mechs, Augmentations for soldiers and a new enemy faction.Shoutout to the Long War mod. If you feel like you've mastered the game, try Long War. It is a VERY expansive mod for XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM: Enemy Within. It adds enormous amounts of content as well as makes an already difficult game relentlessly and extremely difficult. In my opinion, the Long War mod completes this already very fantastic game.			"

												Quick review: super fun modern day, turn based strategy game with some strong RPG elements. Highly recommend.Long review: This game is awesome. Just about every day for 3 months now, I have been opening my steam library and saying, “I’m going to play something new today” and then I start up X-Com again. I just can’t stop playing. Planning ambushes and assaulting Alien mother ships has just never been so satisfying.X-Com is essentially a turn based RPG set in modern day warfare. It utilizes a top down view to control a squad of customizable soldiers. Your team, equipped with the fanciest new gear, is tasked with meeting the alien invasion on the battlefield and pushing them back.  It goes beyond combat though. You have to manage your resources to keep the countries funding you happy and at the same time construct your own facility and research new technology so you can construct new equipment.  As with most games, there are scaling difficulties; in the case of X-com these settings truly range from very forgiving to extremely harsh, including an optional “ironman” mode in which you cannot revert to previous saves, making all decisions permanent when that mode is selected.I have to be honest, there are some definite low points for this game:  it has a boring and overly generic story with some downright bad voice acting to go along with it. The graphics were nothing impressive, and sometimes the animations glitch out and you end up shooting backwards, completely not facing your target.  Without the expansion, it was at times annoying to target aoe moves, as the ground target would bounce you screen around erratically.  However, for me, none of that was enough to detract from the pure enjoyment of the gameplay. I have logged like 100 hours at this point and I can’t bring myself to stop playing this game. The replay value is insanely high. There are tons of customizable options for subsequent play throughs, but even if you left all the options the same your game experience would be completely different. Not to mention all the additions the expansion brings to the table.I can understand that this type of game may not be for everyone, but if you have any interest in strategy gaming, this would be at the top of my list of recommendations. Also I won’t be writing a full review of the expansion, but if you enjoy the game, do not hesitate to get the expansion. It makes the game even more awesomer..er. "

												Very good game, I'm a big fan of turn based strategy games and this feels like a nice follow on from Apocalypse that I played years ago.I'd image anyone looking to buy this probably has an idea of what they will be getting, so I though I would mention some of the negative sides of the game instead.Loadouts: The way your squad is balanced is a bit odd, essentially once you reach plasma rifles and better levels of armour the game becomes notably easier. It basically means you go from feeling too weak to arguably too strong for a large portion of the game.Hit Chance: Ok this one actually makes me really angry and is the reason I will never play on Iron Man. For whatever reason the devs decided that if your squad has anything below 75% chance to hit it basically means they have 75% chance to miss. However all levels of alien can more or less hit you flawlessly from 2 screens away. It makes me wonder if the developers don't understand how probability works but it happens consistently through missions and I have spoken to other people who confirmed they had the same problem.Cover: Yeah... I'm not sure why there are varying levels of cover. Either the devs didn't understand how cover works or couldn't be bothered implementing it properly. Basically full cover acts as cover, anything else is basically your squad closing their eyes thinking that means the enemy can't see them.I mainly wrote this to highlight the flaws with the game(and for a little rant lol), because they aren't mentioned much outside of the bugs for some reason. This is a great game and challenging as it is but I never like part of the challenge in a game coming from either the AI effectively cheating or from incorrectly implemented mechanics.			"

												Percentages mean nothing in this game:  99% to hit can (and will frequently) result in misses, so expect fury at how this game handles probability on too frequent of a basis for it to be just bad luck.  Its seeding mechanic also makes suggested ""randomness"" not really random since it is all predetermined when the map loads, where procedures occur based off of your actions instead of random response as it should be--it reduces the strategy and urgency in this strategy game with urgency in its story, imho, by forcing the random number generator to be more static.  Even when set to ""random"" it still is procedural, and by no means actually randomised.  I understand the devs' position on wanting to prevent players from reloading saves to make the same choice for better results, but I do not agree with it since the game's probability is so broken to begin with.  If they wanted to take a hard stance on development choices without protest, they needed to iron out the flaws tied to the decision.Still, I sunk time into it, albeit swearing all of the while.  Good game, it needs work which will never come, and it needs Steam workshop for mods made specifically to fix bugs and other problems that the devs will continue to ignore (these mods exist online already, but they are not integrated with Steam).  This game's problems are too outstanding for me to ignore despite what is good, and the shortcomings are too numerous to like this game more than it allows me to.  Buy it when it is on sale, because with no support and no Workshop, I do not feel that it is worth $30 USD, but it is absolutely worth $10 ish.			"

												XCOM Enemy Unknown was my introduction to the Team Tactics format, following a recommendation from a friend who played the originals.Highly addictive, challenging and rewarding. The graphics and animations are excellent (minus a couple of odd close ups), the gameplay is fluid. The action is intense at times, and in a way you can become quite attached to your soldiers, sometimes favouring some over others. In some situations, you may even have to make that near impossible decision of sacrificing one or two men so that the others can escape, or to save those last one or two civilians, which is never easy if the soldier in question is one of your best.There's base building, researching, soldier classes (snipers, assaults, heavy and support), using alien tech to make cool new guns and armour, shooting down enemy UFOs, rescue missions, keeping countries happy by protecting them, making them not so happy when you fail, everything to keep you busy and coming back for more.As for the Enemy Within expansion pack, that just makes a great game even better. It's pricey for what it is, it's usual price a lot more than what I would normally pay for expansion. But it does add a lot of new missions, maps, and even a new enemy so you do (almost) get what you pay for if you pay for it at top price (I bought it when the price came down in the sale).Highly recommended.

Posted: March 3, 2014
												The two main aspects of game play in Xcom: Enemy Unknown are tactical turn based shooting and resource and base management. Ok, not the most exciting sounding game play but both complement each other beautifully. Neither feels like a gimmick; both are well designed and thought out, actually require skill and foresight to be used strategically.You spend your time in the field, stopping aliens from destroy cities, abducting people and other unpleasant alien pastimes. Then take the resources you gained back to base, sort your squad, chose research, build equipment and facilities.However, the alien attacks, and other missions, happen at random; but are the only way to gain resources. Randomness in a core gameplay mechanic is annoying, but at the same time it gives the game an almost endless replay value.There aren’t really any main characters in Xcom: Enemy Unknown, there are only three characters in the entire game with names and faces. Yet, with the ability to name and customise the appearance of your soldiers you can make your own drama. I opted to name my soldiers after friends, watching them die on mass becomes a lot more absorbing.Xcom: Enemy Unknown is hard, and not for those who are new to the strategy genre. With the reliance on resources being spent well and your experienced soldiers not dying, one wrong move will rip out the foundations of everything you’ve built.The graphics aren’t mind blowing; they’re cartoony, but it gives the aliens a rich visual style. Combined with the sci-fi soundtrack it gives Xcom: Enemy Unknown a unique feel.If you like strategy, you’ll love Xcom: Enemy Unknown. If not, I wouldn’t recommend this is where you start, as the game can be unforgiving. It’s still one of the best games of 2012, it’s a classic game, from a classic genre, that’s been streamlined for the current generation.			"

												THE BEST turn-based squad strategy game of this generation. Almost perfect in every way. At times actually difficult (that's a rare gem), you'll feel like a great tactician when you overcome the odds, and mourn the loss of your dear soldiers when you don't. All in all a majestic experience.			"

												Having been a long time fan of the Xcom range, and played through and completed every game before this, I am happ to say I LOVE this installment of the series.There are a few things here and there that could do with improving, or more thought, but for the most part it is brilliant.**EDIT**Having now put a lot more time in from my original review, I still love the game, however I hate it too.Some of the bugs are infuriating, like when you have a floater stuck in a wall, that you can not target, but can crit you and wipe you out.A bug which causes me to lose a lot of mission and campaigns, is when your troops are moved 1 or 2 squares over, thus out of cover during switch over form your turn, to aliens turn. I have lost a lot of troops to this, and it doesn't seem to have been fixed yet.I wish Firaxis would work on these bugs, but there is so many, I doubt they will.Yet the game still has a huge amount of replayability, especially with the second wave options, which means every campaign is totaly different from the last, even if you do get the same few scripted ,missions, at the same time, and the random missions you will come to learn exactly where everything is, and breeze through, unless second wave options are being played, then even if you know the map off by heart, you may still get a suprise.I recommend this game, but only if you like to love and hate a game with a fiery passion, as sooner or later, you will come to view this game in that manner.

												This is a supremely well designed game. Its difficulty curve and gradual introduction of many new gameplay mechanics is damn near perfect. I've never played the original, but people complaining that you can't change your soldiers' underwear and upgrade their wristwatch before sending them over to your base in Uzbekhistan with 9 meticulously designed rooms courtesy of the Israeli architect presently fiddling with the top pixel of the bolt of the custom designed Uzi in your 82nd armory, are massive dongs.

												Xcom is widely known to be an exceptional game.I would agree absolutely with that general concensus that this is a really decent tactical strategy game.  I can almost see what this is based on and where it has come from.  This version too exhibits some really nice additions which allows me to say with absolute confidence that technology made this game better.  In saying that there are issues with this game's quality and its design, and irronically Firaxis are getting no better at making games that are flawless... and that is worth saying as these are integral parts of the game I can  see that don't work/don't give enough feedback/ or just are buggy as hell, and it doesn't feel like it will get fixed at all.The beauty of Xcom Enemy Unknown is that is has so many sides to it.  It is in everyway, like Divinity : Dragon Commander, where you manage your ship, build stuff, get reserach, monitor stuff, build more stuff  in between tactical battle mode.  This design is brilliant can offer so much depth I think, and Dragon Commander went a step further in many cases.  I will add that Xcom's implementation of that is no different and allows you to do all sorts, though from what I can see, if you dont get this stuff by a certain time in the game, the game seems to suffocate your operation... not sure about that exactly,  but it felt like I 'nearly' did and it cost me at some point throughout the game.  Whats more, as Dragon Commander's Political exploits are generally not required in your 10th game, alot of the stuff on here is not time draining and does NOT keep you from getting into what XCom is all about.  Combat.Combat is decent and has reasonable depth and certainly does not get overloaded with stuff.  Its seamless, nice to do and leaves you little to worry about in your decisions.  improvements of weapons are worth it, improvement of the skills of each soldier is worth it , and when you get to a stage in the game where some of you soldiers get 'extra skillls'?  It's definately worth it.  However when its late game and your waiting to 'get paid', battle mode does feel like a chore sometimes, it restricts progress.Each of the classes to some extent feel like they are worth using, though the best ones at the start feel weak at the end, and the weak classes at the start feel OP at the end.What adds to this is the camera system, when an order is made, the camera follows your soldier, or some cinematic view is taken.  This is not something I would comment as being essential, but as it doesn't break anything and it looks good, gives  the game a nicer feel, it defeintely is good overall and gives the game a nice sheen.Now what I don't like about Xcom: Firaxis, have had a few gmes I have played with certain bugs and broken functionality, Xcom is no different.  As amazing as Xcom looks, and runs, Firaxis clearly didn't get the engine right.. There is a serious issue with the selection of parts of the map that you are not looking at ... for example, I can be looking at the interior of a ship and then click inside to move, and the system will think I the roof tile (above)or lower floor(below), potentially screwing up tactics(yes which is the difference between something going horribly wrong!)and the game (Diablo Hardcore characters and poor connection come to mind, and yes you can play hardcore on this - no saves!). I guess there is a cure, if you are pretentous enough to challenge that assertion, as you will need to look carefully where the point is and where the path fidning trail is.  This generally means, you have to zoom out, rotate the view blah blah... all in all its a bit of BS.. waste of time and does takes from the game. This should not happen if you are not zoomed to another 'layer' in my oppinion, and I think that is just logical.  I think if Firaxis thought about this issue, then they could have included an undo move button function, but they didn't... There are other issues with seeing the range of your units and what they can attack as it is not clear at all what you can attack and what you can until you move that unit...Also as far as i can see, you cannot pick your squad, i.e. if I want to train up a bunch of noob soldiers instead of using vets , then I can't, it's simple... Well, I could of course make sure (the vets) all take mortal wounds last match so they are off in the infirmary nursing wounds, but nothing more from looks of it.  Then in addition to that, when they are removed from the squad without wounds, the equipment stays on the soldier... Sometimes those soldiers dont show up in the team for the next mission, so you have 1 soldier with no gear (perhaps returning from the infirmary)and another one in the barracks that you have to track down and strip of their gear, and you CAN'T switch them... makes for boring cheese and bad design if you ask me... and yes, some equiptment mid game is damn expensive, so it is important that this works!Science is a let down, like supcom2, once you researched everything, you have wasted money on labs and scientists are in-effect worthless, it is very dis-empowering, and as much as your squad is powerful enough and the rest is justifiably left up to you to be a good strategist, it still makes for something of an empty concept... Civ and Alpha Centurai had post science qualifications.. I think they could have added those in to make an intersting endgame of sorts, making science a worth while endeavour.The story was alright I guess and the game flows much like Unreal 3, so its not complicated, but its good, and the art design definately complements that with the idea of who the alien race really is and where your going.There are some bad parts to this game , and as many people will rave blindly with the 'horde', I feel its nesscessary to point out Xcom is NOT perfect.  However, as a game, I spent 50+ hours  on this and I could play it again.  It was generally fun to play, so I would say most of the hype is infact justified.I will add, that I would definately consider gettin Xcom 2 at near full price as I liked this one so much.			"

												I absolutely love this game. I could spend way more than a hundred hours on it and I probably will eventually.  The strategy feels real, the player is in complete control of his forces in the battlefield during intense battles. Throughout the game the player has the ability to choose his own preferred methods of upgrading his units. The more you play the easier it gets because you can use your research to jump past certain technologies allowing you to progress at your own speed. Making the game absolutely feel like the player has gotten his full moneysworth. The DLC Enemy Within is also worth buying because of the new mechanics and care added to the game. It's a little odd that the characters have their entire bodies replaced, but that is the way it works in this universe.			"

												Never did play any of the orginal XCOM games. This was the first. I love this game. I'm not the biggest fan of RTS games, but when you throw in some solid turn based combat then i'm all over it.For you first timers, prepare for a challenge. This game doesn't pull any punches. I would recommend getting those satellite uplinks up ASAP before all else. As for combat, there is a helpful tutorial to teach you the basics. This game will make you think and plan accordingly to defeat the alien threat. Good luck to you.I highly recommend picking up XCOM: Enemy Within as well for the full XCOM experience. Enemy Within is the base game with a ton of new content shoved in. More customization for your soldiers, new abilities, new maps, a feature that lets you make mech soldiers, a new enemy besides aliens, and so much more...Final Verdict: (5 out of 5) "

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Enemy WithinRelease Date: October 9, 2012Strengths:-Originality-Good graphics-Good level design and gameplay-Nice ambience and atmosphere-Great replayability because of random generation of maps each time-Great story and characters-Excellent sound and voice acting-Character and team customizations-Resource management and economy based-Research technologies and build new weaponsLimitations:-Turn based so takes a lot of play time so RTS lovers may not like it-Limited DLC Conclusion:XCOM is truely one of the best turn based strategy games out there. The series originated back in 1994 and resurected in 2012. What I particularly liked about this game is the story and the atmosphere. You command a small but highly capable unit called XCOM to counter an Alien invasion. You can select, customize different classes of soldiers in your unit and also add genetic enhncements or cybernetic upgrages to them. The game tests your calibre in management of resources and combat strategy. Mission scenarios are randomly generated so replaybility is good.  Highly recommended for strategy lovers.Level Design: 9/10Music and Sound: 10/10Gameplay: 10/10Story: 10/10Graphics: 8/10Replayability: 8/10My rating is 9.2. "

												I don't often get hooked on games like I did this time. I bingeplayed this and dreamt about it for a week until I came through in the other end. Perhaps the whole turn-based ""group of soldiers"" strategy genre is still new to me..but I thought the game mechanics were really well made and intuitive. Cool to have everything in 3D too, makes everything look SO much more realistic than just having an above-view like in the original XCOM game (which was great for its time BTW).Good graphics, cool abilities for soldiers, fun and easy to manage the facility in between missions (and a suitable challenge keeping the money coming in), smooth gameplay mechanics, works natively in Linux, good music and atmosphere. If I have to think of anything negative it is perhaps a certain lack of character depth which perhaps also takes away from getting into the story. The main story line (battling the aliens) takes most of the space, there's not much time for chit chat and as commander you manage the whole operation proffessionally, instead of getting up and personal with the soldiers or, well mostly, with the facility bosses. Also..in the end, when all is supposed to become clear, the alien voice talking is sometimes hard to hear due to the combat noises.I'd give this 4/5. Addictive game! Perhaps even more so if you're into multiplayer?			"

I have never played a better turn based strategy game than xcom, having the ability to level up your soldiers makes for many exciting/ interesting battles down the line.Very easy to learn, very fun to play, and incredible graphics (including the ability to demolish buildings with explosives).I recommend this game to anyone and everyone, a new remake of an old classic.10/10			"

												One of the greatest, most addictive and most fun games I've played in the last years. This is the kind of game that gives you a set of rules, a list of resources and a series of tech trees and let's you play with them, always forcing you to prioritize something, never being able to being good at everything and constantly elevating the level of challenges as you progress. It creates a constant panic environment where you are pressed to make compromises and you swear everytime you suffer any loss. Just DON'T play anything under ""classic"" difficulty.Problems: stupid teleporting bug still present which can ruin your perfect ironman game, the game story is not horrible but it is a bit underwhelming, at high difficulties losing a substantial number of squad members late in the game effectively means game over.Nor better nor worse than the original, just different (and incredibly good).

												Humanity's first contact with extraterrestrials is mediated via bullets and plasma.I never played the original game - I discovered I was a fan of isometric squad-based tactical shooters when I saw a preview for this and said '♥♥♥♥ /yes/, sign me up to defend the world from alien invasion'. Which is exactly what you do.The interface is practically seamless - there's a few issues with multilevel terrain at the moment (a week after release) but nothing insurmountable - and most missions alternate between tense, paranoid advances from cover to cover and nerve-wracking gunfights. Except for terror missions, where the aliens don't consider it unsporting to go after civilians before you've even discovered them. ♥♥♥♥ terror missions.Combat is nasty, brutal, and even with the very best equipment torn from the enemy's cold, dead hands and repurposed for your troops it can be very fatal very quickly.If only it wasn't so much fun...

												Fight off an alien incursion in this turn based strategy with quite tactical, squad based battles, in the meantime doing some base management where you build facilities to research new technologies, interrogate captured aliens and perform autopsies, and build better equipment.Great game and can be quite challenging with higher difficulty settings and iron man mode that makes it kinda roguelike.Don't count on nostalgia trip though, it is a different game than the original! For one, it is kind of dumbed down for broader appeal / console peasant crowd ;) Also bit less random, more structured.. there is a clear campaign / story to tell, with epic cinematics marking milestones in the story progression (bit underwhelming ending though). It does take a lot from the original and preserves the general spirit, plays very differently though.Aaand there's multiplayer if you fancy creating your own squad based off points assigned to units and facing another human being with their own set up.

												This is an awesome game if you like challenging critical thinking games. This game is NOT so much about defending earth by killing all aliens as it IS about  proper placements of soldiers on the battlefield and learning more about your enemy. I have played 20 hours of the game and I have only owned it for 4 days :P			"

												If you are a kid this game will make you a man.Every decision you make in the battlefield will have consequences and most of the time deadly.You may start with a full equiped squad and seconds later find yourself left with only one alive,because you were flanked or mispotitioned and now you have to fight with what is left like a real soldier you have to readjust your strategy constantly.Tension is amazing in this game and consider that i never liked squad based games.Pros -Battles with real tension-Maybe the best artificial inteligence i have seen in any video game-If you don't use tactics you are dead-Great visuals and sounds accompanied with amazing physics-Even though story is almost non existent you will be quite eager to learn more about this unknown enemy as the game progresses-Gameplay is solid and addicting-Very nice set of upgrades and base management-Very challenging and unforgiving but never frustrative-Lots of maps and each one is well designed-One mistake in the battlefield and the odds can turn against you which makes every encounter awesomeCons-Camera issues-Poor soldier progresion system-Repetitive objectives-<90% missed> shots happen way too frequently-Poor tutorialOverall 9.5/10 a true masterpiece!

												My game of the year in 2012.  XCOM Enemy Unknown is a turn based strategy game that you will become so invested in throughout each playthrough (roughly 30 hours).  This game is hard and will strain your mind because of the tough decisions you'll have to make since not everyone will live and you won't have enough resources to build everything you want.  Seeing your soldiers grow (and die) is something you need to experience.  XCOM is a great buy for any strategy or sci-fi fan.Now with the new expansion, Enemy Within, there's yet another reason to play XCOM.  Enemy Within adds a lot of interesting features such as an enemy human faction as well as new ways to strengthen your soldiers.  Nothing beats a genetically enchanced sniper or a cybernetic soldier running around in a mech suit with a flamethrower and grenade launcher.  Buy both the base game and the expansion if you can!			"

This is one of the best turn based strategy games that I have ever played. If you don't think the base game, or the Enemy Within DLC, is hard enough for you, then you need to download a mod called ""The Long War"". It effectivly makes the games so much harder and more indepth than the base game.			"

												This is one of the best games I have ever played, if not the best. XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a fantastic strategy game that is extremely fun to play. It also is very emotionally draining because you build a strong bond with your team, and it is heartwrenching to watch them die. The plot of this game is very cool, with aliens invading, leaving you to defend Earth. The graphics are amazing, especially when it's your last team member and the camera follows them up close when they move or shoot. It is really quite releaving when your soldier takes a shot and it goes to a cut scene, then you know you got the alien for sure. Overall this game is spectacular and I recommend getting it immediately!			"

												A crowning achievement of strategy, one of the best if not THE BEST strategy game I've ever played. Seriously, it even made me change my mind about turn based combat. It is unfourtunately not without it's flaws.As tense as it makes the game, the difficulty does get kind of silly, especially when the Aliens are able to turn your guys into zombies and throw floating machine gun things at you. This is happening just as you figured out you can research something other than second hand nerf guns.Speaking of weapons, everything other than the before-mentioned nerf guns both look and sound really cool. The laser sniper even does the Mass Effect folding gun thing. The aliens however start with plasma weapons and eventually go all the way up to the floating machine gun things I mentioned earlier.The alien types are all nicely varied, different strategies and weapons have to be employed to beat each one, even if they do get a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t later on in the game.And now you can play it with giant robots and super soldiers I honestly don't know what could make this game better, maybe some way of rewarding soldiers who actually hit somet- oh wait, you can. The medals system is a cool way to provide passive buffs to soldiers without the need for gene therapy and can be transferred on to the Super Soldiers and Giant robots.I do have a few complaints with this new DLC though, Normal has been ""balanced"" I didn't even finish the base game, partly because it was so hard and partly because there were only like five maps in total that got really boring after a while. But now I'm about a quarter of the way into the game and I still haven't suffered a single loss, granted I am playing on normal whereas in the base game my manorexia wouldn't let me play on anything other than classic, which I've heard has been made harder, well the balances are probably for the best then.On the subject of harder difficulties, there's a new alien type that cloaks and strangles your soldiers, at this point they aren't anything other than a nuisance, because if you have everyone close together then you can just get him on overwatch as he goes to strangle the soldier. Unless he's gone for a sniper or someone that is for some reason completely isolated from the rest of the squad.The DLC also fixes a ridiculous amount of bugs and adds general polish to the game, soldiers can now speak in the language of their country, so we don't get Russians speaking fluent English in an American accent anymore, there are more customization options for the troops and soldiers on overwatch tend not to shoot through walls anymore.Overall, the base game and the DLC are absolutely brilliant, I would reccomend buying them both together and starting with the DLC though as that brings so many balances and fixes to the table it's not really worth it to play the base game anymore.

												For those that don't like to mudfling in multiplayer, XCOM: EU is a refreshing take on the turn-based strategy genre and proves that faster =/= better. Even though there are graphical bugs (ponytails wigging out, ragdoll gone mad) 10% of the time as well as gameplay bugs (no targets within firing range) on rare occasions, this game really shows how cruel the battlefield becomes moreso than any deconstructive shooter to date.

												Overwhelmingly fun strategy game. Difficulty levels are adjusted nicely to include ai changes aswell as the usual hp + dmg increase. The multiplayer part is bugged/nonexisting. (matchmaking rarely produces an opponent (I've been trying for two days, only getting one opponent that i could actually play with), and cross-platform multiplayer doesn't work anymore i.e. pc/mac/consoles) multiplayer is clearly not a priority for the game developer. That being said, the singleplayer is challenging, fun and replayable as hell.-DO buy it for the singleplayer campaign-DO buy it for the challenge-Don't buy it for playing multiplayer against your friends, cause you probably wont be able to play against them -until they fix it again			"

												Enemy Unknown is the latest release to bring back the classic X-Com series. This time aliens have invaded Earth and are generally up to no good, and it's your job as Commander to stop them.The game is turn based strategy through and through, although you do have to manage your base and your finances. You do this by keeping countries happy, which reduces panic, which in turn earns you cash. As you defeat the aliens you gain access to their technology which you can study and adapt to you own needs.Most of the game-play elements from the classic series make a return, meaning that you will have to manage your base, keep an eye out for alien craft, build whatever you need and control any research whilst keeping a tight grip on your finances. As you progress your soldiers will become more skilled and generally more powerful, and as your study continues and gain access to more powerful equipment.The game has multi-player too, so you can fight against human players as well as the computer controlled opponents. When you do send you soldiers to fight each player is given a “turn” in which to move or shoot. The the general rule is that you have to find cover, and then shoot back. Your squad has other skills which you can use to adapt to the enemy's strategy. There are a lot of different aliens to blast, some of which are quite tough, especially in groups.The game can be easily played with a controller or the more traditional keyboard and mouse. The game has a sort of way-point system which snaps to a grid. This works well for the most part, but the cursor can sometimes sort of “twitch” which means that your soldiers don't quite go where you want them to and crucially are not in cover. If you take you time and make sure it's where you want it before you click then it's OK.Graphically the game is quite attractive although a little simple looking. Having said that most of the action takes place from an overhead perspective, and there can be a lot of enemies on screen – especially in the later missions. The maps are not overly large, but are well designed and have many different features to take advantage of, giving you a lot of options during combat. Having said that there aren't really that many and you will fight in the same areas over and over – even if they are supposed to be different countries.The game should keep you busy for a while as there is plenty to do and an alien plot to uncover, but the small control problem and the limited locations can make it a little frustrating.

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a HIGHLY recommended game for strategy players especially from the RTS genre. XCOM EU is based from the classic XCOM game and was remade especially for the modern players. Gameplay wise, this is more of a turn based strategy playing and planning for a good executions. This game is also very similar to the old Rainbow Six games such as Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear because of the squad based planning and customization like changing your squad's faces, body, helmet, armor, etc.If you love playing mind games like Chess or Games of the General, this game is highly recommended for you. Of course, you'll end up enjoying it so much that thinking is never been so hard to do. Your head will NEVER hurt in playing this game. 100% guarantee (unless you're frustrated in losing your ""best friend"").I really highly recommend it to you all especially for those who are NOT an RTS fan and turn based gaming. Storyline wise, it is a top notch but the ending is quite ""predictable"". Nevertheless, overall the game is worth to buy and worth the weight!Verdict: 8.9/10			"

												This is a very good game that is faithful to the original in terms of the original's positive aspects and aspirations, but actually manages to change a lot more than initially meets the eye. This is also a hard game, and you may want to tone down the difficulty until you get the hang of things. Replay value is better than one might think, but it is not the game's strong suit.

												So great, it's easy to love from the get go and keeps being intresting into infinity and beyond! Get it with the expansion since mechs always makes stuff better, and so does the many other strategic choices that the expansion brings to the game. Minor inconsistancy bugs excists, which could ruin a session if you only keep one save, but it's not anything that should keep one from playing the gem. 10/10 toasters!			"

												This is one of the only games that I have played that I can be having the best time of my life one moment, then the next be raging like crazy the next. This is one of the best turn based strategy games that I have ever played. If you don't think the base game, or the Enemy Within DLC, is hard enough for you, then you need to download a mod called ""The Long War"". It effectivly makes the games so much harder and more indepth than the base game.			"

												A positively excellent game;You have your base to upgrade - Simulation (A big plus in my books)You have a force to deploy and use efficiently as possible - Turn based strategy.Combine these two things with aliens, robots and ufos, you get XCOM. I have never played a better turn based strategy game than xcom, having the ability to level up your soldiers makes for many exciting/ interesting battles down the line.Very easy to learn, very fun to play, and incredible graphics (including the ability to demolish buildings with explosives).I recommend this game to anyone and everyone, a new remake of an old classic.10/10			"

												A go to game when you want to just sit back and relax. I love turned based games as the pacing is slow, no need to rush and with a good strategy everything comes together in the end. XCOM is basically a special unit that has been set up to counter an alien invasion. The soldiers that are recruited/involved are of both genders and of a vast international variety. You take the role of the 'commander' a faceless entity who issues orders on the battlefield to your 5 man unit while also juggling research/engineering/training back at home base. Starting off you have limited options but the game does well in introducing new features, the interface is user friendly and everything is well explained.As you get further in the game you have lots of options; Do you build a satelitte nexus? - So you can have full coverage over Asia/Africa?, Do you invest all your monthly earnings in Research&Development? You have to be careful as some countries might leave the XCOM program if the panic lvl stays in the red, diplomatic missions and satellitte coverage can help reduce this. Very enjoyable and i havent even looked at multiplayer yet. Thumbs up.			"

												A great strategy game overall, with a fine difficulty setting, too, giving players of all calibers a chance to compete in the race versus the Aliens for the fate of humanity. When you think to yourself ""The game is getting quite repetative now""... There's always the 2nd Wave which grants funny, challenging and other tweaks which can lead to a variation of ways to play the game.Even when you think you've seen it all in XCOM:EU and XCOM:EW, there is the modding community and the ever so popular Long War mod. If you seek variation, a thrilling battle to fight, and decision between victory and defeat, go grab it as quick as you can. With all the possibilities XCOM will offer its gamers, it's no wonder it has gained a lot of praise from curators - which is totally justified. I will also be looking forward to XCOM 2 and wheither it will retain its predecessor's immense experience.			"

												A nearly perfect reboot of the original XCOM: UFO Defense.  The few mechanical changes they did make to the game all seem to be for the better.  For example removing the inventory system and replacing it with loadouts and classes.  The game does suffer from a couple very minor user interface bugs,  terrible voice acting, and some animation sync issues.  None of this really gets in the way of a great tactical turn based strategy game that solidly relives the greatness of one of the best ever in the genre.			"

I decided to play just the original XCOM: Enemy Unkown on my first play through to see what I was getting into. I had played about 11 hours of that when things started to go downhill. My whole squad of high level sodiers was mercilessly slaughtered. I hadn't trained any other troops so I was left with nothing. Luckily my morale was high enough that I could restart the game, this time playing XCOM: Enemy Within. After my painful first run, I had the knowledge and the strength that I needed in order to face the alien's assult. XCOM: Enemy Within added many new amazing features that were tons of fun to try out. Even while wrighting this I have an almost irresistable urge to start up a new game, with some of the customs settings I unlocked.     Highly recommended to anyone interested in startegy games.			"

												This game is epic, fun, but unforgiving. It's hard and interesting, and the story makes sense, I would buy it all over every day. The story has a odd design, you start with a squad and you turn it into a massive army (6 at most in squad). The game  has ironman mode witch means you can play but when you loose a soldier, you can't go back and restart the mission. Last, if you want the game get the expansions, it makes you look boss, Mecs, Superhumans, and EXALT oh my!! Enjoy the game, but every move you make is win or loose.			"

Although it can be terribly (almost unfairly, no wait, sorry, Mutons, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s they are, make it unfair) challenging at times it comes with a sense of reward when you complete a mission and evac the hell out of the area.9/10, would lose my entire squad to strateigically placed tank units again. ♥♥♥♥ign Mutons.

The game features a very similar combat system to the original with many exquisite tweaks to character progression and abilities.  I feel this game to be the American equivalent of Final Fantasy Tactics mixed with saving the planet from aliens.  The game is challenging, but it allows you to mitigate your risks effectively. The game also feels thoroughly tested, with myself only experiencing a minor bug within about 20 hours of gameplay.  Well done Firaxis, well done - A+.			"

The inclusion of MEC and Gene Mod soldiers breaks things up to make things more interesting, and the skill tree changes made all classes more powerful in general.While the Exalt campaign was a bit underwhelming, it escalated into something greater after defeating them and the ending of the game felt all the more satisfying with the new named character Annette. Enemy Within adds a lot of great content that made it more satisfying to play through, and I recommend it warmly to anyone who haven't had a chance to play it yet. Buy both main game and expansion for the best experience.			"

												This game makes me rage.. But I love it!Firaxis studios' remaking of the older XCOM franchise is a great game all around without a shadow of a doubt. It has aliens, guns, global terror and addictive tactical play that I just can't leave alone. The premise is simple enough, you're an operative for the XCOM organisation, and it's your job to direct the forces at your disposal to best serve the interests of humanity in fighting off the alien menace (more on them in a mkinute). You do this through turn based tactical combat scenarios and a metagame of base management and decision making that overarches the main gameplay by forcing you to choose which options you want to research, what facilities you want to construct to better your force or gear, and which missions you want to send your recruits on to shoot the aliens to bits. At the basic level, that's what the game is all about really - decision making. It's why it works so wonderfully, and also why it will make you rage but keep coming back for more. The turn based nature of the gameplay means you can weigh the odds of different approaches as you go and take your time to figure out the various angles and opportunities you have at each point. Squad cohesion is important in mission gameplay, and a poor choice of action or missed opportunity could see you paying for it down the line with your squad members, when alien plasma fries them. It forces you to adapt and overcome your enemies, predict the outcome of your options and make the best choices, whether that involves a squad wide attack to wipe out the enemy or (occasionally) sacrificing one member to allow the others to move to a safer position or escape (though you'll find that this is a painful lesson when it's a high level unit with helpful abilities that you lose however). There's plenty to keep track of and experiment with too. Your different units have classes that affect their weaponry loadout (heavy units being armed with an LMG and Rocket launcher at the first level for example) and abilities that go along with them (in the case of the aforementioned heavy, suppression fire and usage of the launcher etc), so making sure that the different specialisations are utilised well is wise to be keep in mind while on a mission. You are free to choose who you want to field however, so if you find you don't really enjoy using a particular class or would rather take another sniper than a support unit for example, it's your choice. Outside of mission play the decision making is just as important if not more so. You'll create a base layout with facilities to upgrade or improve your arsenal and construct your gear between missions, and keeping appropriate facilities close gives benefits so juggling everything or putting one plan on hold to get a different module placed first can provide bigger bonuses down the line. The different research tiers as the game progresses ramp up in power quite nicely and are satisfying to play with when you finally get to top tier weaponry and armor (higher tier armors especially offering some interesting options in terms of gameplay, IMO). All important research unlocks all these goodies so taking advantage of your time at the base to figure out which projects you want to take next is the other main aspect between mission play to keep in mind - neglecting any one aspect ofyour squad's equipment can leave you underequipped for some missions but researching the alien tech and recovered corpses etc is also important so as to discover their weak points, making it a fine balancing act. So yeah, as the title said, it'll make you rage. When Corporal Bloggs pops his head round a blind corner only to get it melted by alien plasma fire unexpectedly you might want to shout, or swear, whatever floats your boat. But it's so satisfying to play that you'll just want to keep coming back to try again. Maybe Corporal Bloggs' brother will have better luck on point instead..			"

												XCom is simply put an amazing game. I thought I would not be able to get into it since i normally don't enjoy strategy/turn based games but it blew me away.the game looks great, plays great, feels great, etc etc etc.Also being able to build rocket punching robots (via the enemy within expansion pack) might just be the coolest thing one can do in a game, ever.

												I love this game. One of my all time favs. I dont like stratagry (well its more like they dispise me, i personaly dont mind them) but this game is so good. the campain feels like your vsing an other player. You and the enemy start off weak, but get stronger, but if you hit by a mighty blow, the enemy will not tone down, they will not wait, they will not hold back. If you ♥♥♥♥ up, it will tap you on the shoulder... then beat you over the head with your fav person that just died becuase you didnt think about things, but it is turn based so you have time to think about your stupid♥♥♥♥♥move you about to make.

												Writing this right after I played XCOM 2 I find that this game holds a special place in my heart that can't be replaced.The base game is pretty good and can last you a while but may get dull after a few playthroughs with all the bugs that you may encounter. 8/10Enemy Within steps up the game so much with balancing, a new MEC class, and a great gene mod system that allows you to make your school mates into genetic super heros. Still a few bugs and quircks from the base game. 9/10Once you get Enemy Within and Long war, you find that this is the best traditional XCOM expirience out there. It's tough, mind boggling, diverse, and will make you rethink your strategy every month of the game. 10/10If you want some good old fashioned XCOM but don't want to go through the old system of OG XCOM then XCOM: Enemy Within along with the Long War mod is the way to go.

												XCOM is a hard game to describe to anyone without previous knowledge of the games.  It is turn-based Tactical-strategy-combat with some elements of RPGs, city management, and maybe just a bit of horror game thrown in, probably not that last one though.  This game is best described by comparison to other Turn based strategy games. It's like Final Fantasy Tactics with rocket launchers, Civilization with aliens, and Fire emblem with high powered assault and sniper weapons.The Enemy Within expansion is basically the same but with MORE, if you don't think your assault troops can take or dish out enough damage, you can take any old soldier and with some amputations, some meld, and bit of resources turn them into a walking mechanized powerhouse of destruction.  On the downside, the difficulty curve is all over the place, and there are some rather annoying bugs(especially in regard to some of the new enemies), most of which can be avoided by saving whenever you finish a mission and reloading if they occur.

												XCOM isnt your typical turn based game. It takes the turn based fighting of final fantasy-like games and adds an entire dimension of gamplay by including cover tactics, movement, and even a perma-death system. This game has the same hulky looking heros seen in gears of war but in a slightly less macho way. The gameplay forces you to pay attention to your every move and truly think if you plan on keeping your favorite soldiers alive. The only drawback to this game (and its a HUUUGE pain) is that the game only offers an auto-save feature if you play in a seperate game mode. This mode features gameplay which cannot be undone by loading a previous save. I have played XCOM for hours and forgotten to save, only to have my whole crew blown up by a vehicle or to have simply gone to sleep. This one downside reallllly takes away from the game. Otherwise, this is one title you do not want to miss!			"

												Wow, just finished my first full playthrough and loved this.Technically it is just a isometic, turn based strategy game with a rather cliche story and a random number generator (for chance to hit, enemy spawns, random enecounters/missions, etc.). What it feels like is you are risking a squad of your best, most skilled, and most cherished team mates. You don't know what's around the next corner (ha, seriously, not kidding on that one), but they believe in you. They trust to make the tough choices, the right choices, so they can help make the world a better, safer place from those alien scum that will stop at nothing to wipe out humanity. Oh and you also throw in a rookie with them cause you need him to skill up. (And why did my random 'class type' rolls mean I only got 2 support class but like 10 heavy's?!!!)Really enjoyed the tactic stuff (quickly learned that rushing into the fog of war is a BIG no-no). Growing attached to a few of my best. Killing the bad guy and saving my team with the last shot from the last person on the last move of my turn. Also, when you get the best weapons and gear and are taking the battle to enemy (thank you lab guys).Really no a fan of the way the random enemy spawn means occasionally you move the first guy like 1 step forward and suddenly every enemy on the map appears - aaarrrgggh! Or Missing with the last shot from the 3 person in a row. That's the random number generator for you.Also, it looks kinda nice, and you can whittle quite a bit time customising the look of your people.Overall, totally enjoyed. "

												A crowning achievement of strategy, one of the best if not THE BEST strategy game I've ever played. Seriously, it even made me change my mind about turn based combat. It is unfourtunately not without it's flaws.As tense as it makes the game, the difficulty does get kind of silly, especially when the Aliens are able to turn your guys into zombies and throw floating machine gun things at you. This is happening just as you figured out you can research something other than second hand nerf guns.Speaking of weapons, everything other than the before-mentioned nerf guns both look and sound really cool. The laser sniper even does the Mass Effect folding gun thing. The aliens however start with plasma weapons and eventually go all the way up to the floating machine gun things I mentioned earlier.The alien types are all nicely varied, different strategies and weapons have to be employed to beat each one, even if they do get a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t later on in the game.And now you can play it with giant robots and super soldiers I honestly don't know what could make this game better, maybe some way of rewarding soldiers who actually hit somet- oh wait, you can. The medals system is a cool way to provide passive buffs to soldiers without the need for gene therapy and can be transferred on to the Super Soldiers and Giant robots.I do have a few complaints with this new DLC though, Normal has been ""balanced"" I didn't even finish the base game, partly because it was so hard and partly because there were only like five maps in total that got really boring after a while. But now I'm about a quarter of the way into the game and I still haven't suffered a single loss, granted I am playing on normal whereas in the base game my manorexia wouldn't let me play on anything other than classic, which I've heard has been made harder, well the balances are probably for the best then.On the subject of harder difficulties, there's a new alien type that cloaks and strangles your soldiers, at this point they aren't anything other than a nuisance, because if you have everyone close together then you can just get him on overwatch as he goes to strangle the soldier. Unless he's gone for a sniper or someone that is for some reason completely isolated from the rest of the squad.The DLC also fixes a ridiculous amount of bugs and adds general polish to the game, soldiers can now speak in the language of their country, so we don't get Russians speaking fluent English in an American accent anymore, there are more customization options for the troops and soldiers on overwatch tend not to shoot through walls anymore.Overall, the base game and the DLC are absolutely brilliant, I would reccomend buying them both together and starting with the DLC though as that brings so many balances and fixes to the table it's not really worth it to play the base game anymore.

												Game was good. Not gonna say the game was great. It was just on the under side of great. Like... if Good was... 80%, and Great was 90%, and Perfect was 100%, this game is a solid 89%.THE GOOD: The game uses modern ideas regarding user interface to simplify a lot of the unnecessarily complex portions of the original game system *without significantly reducing quality*. That last bit is important. Dumbing down a system for the sake of making it simple is usually a disastrous move, but X-Com still feels pretty complex and strategy-minded despite simplifying the way in which your squads move and interact with the world. The added skill-driven leveling system is a welcome addition, and I found soldier and squad management to be a very enjoyable part of the game. Had a lot of fun.THE BAD: The simplification process removed a lot of the technical things you could do to improve your chances of survival. It is now much more difficult to remove cover from an enemy because free-targetting on most weapons was removed. Also, the removal of time units seriously limits the amount of off-turn defensive fire you can provide. Finally, the method by which you discover aliens was a nice effort but in my opinion, was very poorly designed. Aliens you discover immediately use free actions to get into cover, and then act on their next turn, but aliens will rarely, if ever, discover your squad if you are in a fortified position. This means that exploration is a very dangerous activity, and it discourages a player from using his squad tactically to flank enemies for fear of discovering squads of additional ones. In the end, the safest way to proceed is to simply have one of your squad run as far as he can at normal speed, then retreat back to a full squad on overwatch if anything is discovered. It feels a bit tedious and cheap♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and i felt like the tactical element of the game suffered somewhat as a result of the need to cheat the game to cope with the unbalanced discovery system. The maps also felt really small and linear in comparison to the original Xcom, so some of the suspense of exploring an open map is lost.THE UGLY: The random number generator is a vicious and implaccable foe in this game. There are some truly frustrating moments when it feels like cover has no effect and your soldiers are totally defenseless. As someone who has beaten this game on the harder difficulties and also Ironman mode, the best advice I can give you is: research and produce the highest level of armor you can as soon as you can. It will save the lives of your soldiers. Having the highest level officers possible at any given time is important.TL;DR: Game's recommended. Some of the facets of the old game are lost in the translation but I feel like Xcom gained more than it lost in the most recent incarnation. Looking forward to DLC/Sequels.			"

												Definitely recommend. Although turn-based, the game is fast-paced and immensely intense. Every decision you make is crucial in progressing, and any mistake is costly. If you turn up the difficulty, each match is exhausting yet very rewarding when you've won against the aliens. There're a lot of different modes too so it's not always just plain-kill aliens on site. You can also customize your soldiers to your liking, which is nice since you sort-of create an emotional attachment to the soldiers who survive, and you can make them all pink. When you're immersed in the matches, time flies by without you knowing it, and you can't wait to start another one. There's a little bit of a storyline which does get the game flowing well, but there can be more aliens. Graphics and animations are also very nice and detailed. PLAY IT			"

While I haven't played the previous XCOM games before this, the tutorial gets you to know the game easily, and this is probably the best turn-based strategy game I've done so far, possibly better than Civ V for the fun.

												Firaxis has their turn-based strategy gameplay down to a science.  After years of honing their skills with the broad strokes of the Civilization series, the team has now scaled down to focus on the intricacies of battle   The core experience is divided into two parts: the turn-based squad level tactical game; and the metagame of equipment upgrades, skill trees, scientific research, and managing panic levels around the world.First, let's talk about the story.  It is standard videogame science fiction.  Creepy aliens abduct people, secret government ops fight back while upgrading their equipment with alien technology.  It does just fine and, most importantly, stays out of your way and allows you to ""create your own stories"" with the squad members you train.  I have never played the classic XCOM game, but brutal difficulty is a mechanic here.  Ideally, you play Ironman mode(where the game autosaves every decision, so soldier death is permanent).  I have yet to make it all the way through an Ironman game myself!  Regardless, name your squadmates after your friends or characters from movies and you end up caring when your maxed-out Colonel Starbuck gets their face ripped off by some fast moving critter with spikes for legs.Now the metagame.  You'll spend roughly a 1/3 of your time in the headquarters menus.  Everything is presented with a fairly clean interface and it gives you a number of options on how you might want to proceed.  Do I research alien armor alloys so my soldiers last longer?  Or do I focus on weapon technology and build laser shotguns?  Don't forget about saving some of that hard earned cash to increase satellite coverage!  It all feels compelling and definitely is rewarding to step onto the battlefield with that newly engineered plasma sniper rifle.  That being said, the game does demand that you prioritize certain research and building tasks in order to advance the story missions.  It also becomes apparent after a couple playthroughs how essential some of the upgrades are, breaking just a bit of that illusion that you can play absolutely any way you want.  The Second Wave options menu and Enemy Within DLC do expand on this area quite a bit though and provide some wonderful extra options.Finally, the tactics game.  Superb!  There is a fantastic balance between depth and accessibility.  Engagements play out like intricate, four dimensional games of Rock-Paper-Scissors; constantly balancing unit cover, sight lines, suppressing fire, and reloading becomes imperative.  Remember, it's turn-based.  So a lot of the fun is in anticipating enemy attack patterns, taking the time to think, and methodically moving your squad to maintain support for each other.  All the information you need is readily available and the different skill sets of each squad member are easy to apply to battlefield conditions.  It's wonderful...until it seems to defy itself.  The AI in this game will occasionally make you RAGE.  Untimely misses, logic defying lines of site, and inability to modify which tiles are enroute to a location will drive even the most sedate players nuts.  That, and the camera control can be utterly obnoxious.None of the issues with this game have ever made me not want to pick it back up again.  The strategy is engaging and you feel a direct influence from your research and engineering decisions.  It is an absolute keeper and would be of special interest to any thinking man's game collection.			"

												Just, amazing. To be honest, it was more fun naming the soldiers after people you knew (liked or hated) and treated them the same way I would IRL. For example, i was starting a new run, and a friend had just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. Created a new soldier, named him ******* (I want to hide the real name in case he reads this), and just had him essentially dance as fodder in front of a few a sectoids. The game had, of course, the biggest replayability factor in the world, since there was always that lust for a better run. Also, there is no such thing as a perfect run in this game. Unless you are able to protect every soldier, make the most efficient use of all your base, not lose a single country, human during a terror mission (which I think actually is impossible), all while not dying yourself due to starvation, you have officially become a gaming god, and please, notice me senpai. All in all, an amazing strategy game which can draw the player in without the use of too immersive a story line. SIDENOTE: At the end of the Mothership Mission, I don't actually know exactly what the developers were thinking... were they trying to make the game end in a tragic way? Personally, I felt no attachment to the soldiers, which i guess would be one area they could have improved on. The soldiers themselves (being hand-crafted by you, usually) have no integrated storyline, so you will usually never feel any attachment unless you name them after people you know.			"

												I love the concept of this game, managing and upgrading your own base, tech and small army, and fighting in reaonably nice looking scenes. However, like the game Endless Space, the game is just too difficult to make it enjoyable. Yes for those who like a challenge and are incredibly good at this type of game, it will be enjoyable, but for me no. The key issue is that by the time a casual player has just got to a decent place in terms of base, army and tech, all hell happens. Every country seems to be under attack, the aliens are insanely hard to kill, your money is bugger all and then frustration takes over enjoyment.So, yeah, i love the concept and the first hour of play, but hate it after that.UPDATED: Now I played Enemy Within, I find the game much better, but again with high difficulty.

												The greatest turn based tactical game of all time, loved the original games and love this even more. Quitessential, challenging and featuring a highly customiseable experience from insanely challenging to as easy as you want, but easy is not the point of Xcom. I recommend classic ironman difficulty for a well rounded rewarding experience, if you are good enough there's always The Long War mod. Amazing. Enemy Within expansion just makes it even better, can' wait for Xcom 2 this year. Kudos.			"

												Simple answer: Yes. XCOM is a game that is worth the money.Key features:. Command, customise, and control squads of troops on highly tactical mission’s vs aliens.. Build your base up with various different facilities such as research labs and engineering labs.. Take equipment from aliens and use it to research more advanced weapons, armour, and equipment for your squads. (Energy weapons). Missions are generated based on the actions you take.. Enables you to play through several times with several different difficulty settings and modifiers (random stats for each squad member)XCOM is one of the few games I have actually bought because I felt the developers deserved the money for such a fun and interesting game. If you’re looking for a turn based strategy game where squad members have different classes and abilities this is the game for you. The soldier’s accuracy is based on what weapon he/she has, the range of the target, and what cover the target it is in. This comes down to giving the player a percentage chance (55% chance of hitting target and doing this amount of damage). Also, XCOM 2 is coming out in November and it is going to be even better.			"

												This game is about taking risks.On the strategy layer the player manages the base building, research, soldiers and much more. There are a lot of things to keep track of and the game does a wonderful job by presenting the base in an ingenious “ant-farm” view. The complexity of the base and amount of things to manage increase each simulated month and the player is forced to make hard decisions what to prioritize. The game excellently builds up tension leading to a great finale.Core of the game is the tactical layer. The turn-based ground combat has a superb presentation and feels just right. Here the game really shines. Every misstep can mean death for a soldier and the failure of the mission and in turn more death and failures in following missions. But time is of the essence to collect the resource “meld” or disarming bombs, etc.  The best way to play this game is with iron man mode enabled (= no reloads), which means all decisions are final.  Never did I experience so much tension, drama and relief in any other game.			"

												What's not to love about this game?You play as a squad of men (and women) who are brave enough to face the alien menace.This game deserves multiple playthroughs because of the large amount of different ways it could be played and the story seems to never get boring... also you can change your troops names to your friends names so you can make your friends fight the aliens and maybe even die to them!

												As someone who is very fond of the likes of Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre, I picked this up with little trepidation.In short, this is a turn-based strategy game in which you control a team of up to 6 soldiers in battles against alien invaders. It's quite easy to pick up while the aliens are ruthlessly efficient at murdering your poor soldiers. It's not a resource intense game to run (score if, like myself you rely on a laptop for your PC gaming fix) thankfully. Due to the small amount of soldiers you command compared to previous titles, you really have to think strategically in order to outsmart your extra-terrestrial foes. Using less important members of your squad as bait just isn't an option. I've sank quite a few hours into this as I feared I might. The aliens are nicely varied and require different strategies in order to be vanquished. The level and mission design is less so but this isn't a big problem. There are issues, however. These range from slightly irritating such as the frame rate dropping to single figures when a beserker moves to aliens spontaneously appearing behind your squad. There's also a high number of bugs, reportedly though I've only had to reload a level once. Overall, I'd consider this to be one of the best games I own. With the expansion out, there's no reason whatsoever not to pick this up if you enjoyed the older games, or have even a vague interest in using your noggin instead of the usual run-and-gun approach.

												PSA: I will often use XCOM and X-COM in the same sentence. Just for those unfamiliar....        XCOM = Enemy Unknown & X-Com = UFO Defense / TftDX-COM: UFO Defense. A strategy title that, to this day, is still hailed as one of the best - if not the best - strategy games of all time. Firaxis certainly had some big shoes to fill when they announced that they would be rolling out a remake of this classic. Does it live up to the hype? Why, yes actually.XCOM: Enemy Unknown gives an impressive updated look to X-Com. The graphics are fantastic and I enjoy the art style they went with. Many of the enemies of old are still here, Sectoids, Chryssalids, Ethereals, Mutons, the Cyberdisc and even Snakemen (reimagined into the covert unit Thin Men). All the units look great and play as you might expect them too from previous games. There does come a time to nitpick unfortunately in a review and this is it. With a series as complex and enjoyable as X-Com it must be done.Base BuildingThis has been completely streamlined in XCOM from how it used to be in X-COM. Instead of having a topdown view as we are used to from X-Com we have a side shot of an underground honeycomb styled base. This isn't as big as a blow as many might be thinking as multiple bases no longer exist in XCOM as well as base defense. That's right folks, one base and no longer needing to defend it from the alien invaders.Funding & Research I chose a broad term to cover a few things here, mainly country funding, manufacturing and research. Funding used to primarily be based on performance in X-COM. Missed a ship/landing site/terror mission/failed?Well - too bad Sir - the aliens are winning. In XCOM: EU they have added the addition of satellites into the game to give you a more hands on approach to dealing with countries and their 'panic' level in the situation room. Should a country's bars fill completely into the red they will withdraw funding and side with the alien invaders. Satellites bring that bar back down but require time, funds and the building of satellite arrays in your base. Satellites can be shot down, but even playing on the highest difficulty I have never had it happen.Manufacturing and selling produced materials, equipment and alien tech was a huge part of X-COM and it has now been removed. Research also feels much more easy, the tech tree less elaborate and not requiring near as much risk in high ranking alien captures to reach end game.Soldiers, Combat & InventoryMany people have a large number of gripes with how these particular topics are handled. While I do enjoy the streamlined process of combat, I do miss the solider management, more complex combat and inventory management. Gone are the days of having a set number of 'Time Units' (TUs), now we have a two-action system for soldier combat. Usually comprised of moving a short distance then firing/item use or one action abilities (firing first, item use first, sprinting a longer distance, special skill use in some instances).Soldiers come in four flavours: Assault, Support, Heavies and Snipers. There is a reason for this....FOUR MAN SQUADS! Yup, that's right, you start with a four man squad and work your way up to six (with Officer Training). No more fifteen+ man squads of rookie cannon fodder. This can pose a number of problems if a certain class is in the infirmary or K.I.A: 1) Assault: This is your front line trooper. Able to dodge enemy reaction shots, auto fire in close proximity in the enemy turn and has excellent mobility and health. If this trooper goes down capturing aliens does get slightly more difficult.2) Support: No longer will you have revives, smoke grenades or any decent heals. This is the medic class.3) Heavies: Suppressing fire and of course, the one use only Rocket Launcher. This makes dealing with the packs that enemies now travel in incredibly easier with AoE damage and cover destruction.4) Snipers: Well, sniping. An incredibly powerful unit that can use team member's forward spotting to shoot aliens from across the map (with Line of Sight).The aliens themselves now travel in packs and seem to have smaller numbers. If you should happen to find an alien 'unit' a cinematic will play giving that unit a free chance at movement. Usually this means the unit will move into cover, but at the end of a turn this can give the aliens a free advantage to rush or flank your troops, essentially decimating them. No longer will you spend hours combing a map hunting for that one alien hiding in a corner somewhere at least....right? Finally we come to the inventory and to be honest it doesn't look good. No longer can soldiers interact with alien/friendly corpses, weapons or items on the battlefield.Why? Because the inventory system no longer exists. Ammunition is now unlimited, grenades/rockets are one use (without a specific +1 perk), medkits have a limited amount of charges, many of the accessory items such as flares (No more night fighting!) and grenade types are now gone, alien weapons/equipment/tech can only be acquired from a successful mission and ONLY if the alien has been stunned for capture. This means if a mission is going badly you can't pack up your stunned alien with it's equipment, hop in the skyranger and take off. This goes the same for soldier salvage.Mind ControlAny fan of the original X-COM understands and dreads that which is mind control. Many a time has the hapless soldier been immediately mind controlled out of the carrier only to fire a rocket/lob a grenade into the skyranger on the next turn to kill his defenceless teammates. Not so in XCOM. Mind control is a much more short range affair and seems to really require much more obvious Line of Sight to the player. Due to these shorter map distances it's incredibly easy now to take out the offending psionic and free your unit on the next turn in most circumstances.All-in-all XCOM: Enemy Unknown is watered down slightly and streamlined for the modern crowd of gamers. Part of this is most likely due to it being ported onto consoles (or ported from consoles to PC, I don't recall which at the moment), the generally low complexity of most modern AAA titles and the lack of difficulty which helped make the original so memorable.Is it worth the money? Certainly! Especially now that it has been out for a bit and tends to go on sale every Steam Sale.Is it as good as the original? No, but it stands proud and the developers have done an amazing job modernizing what is surely one of the greatest games ever made. "

												I highly Recommend this game for the following people:-Fans of Turn-Based, Grid-Based Strategy games-People who Like Strategy/Tactical games-People who like the retro ""roswell"" aliens stylizationI Have Never played the original games, and will not be comparing it to the games from the 90'sPros:-It's a turn-based, Grid-based Strategy game, which is a rare beast nowadays, and it's a good one at that-Lot's of Soldier Customization-- 4 Classes (+ a 5th class with Enemy Within Expansion) that each have their own Skill/ability tree--- classes are: Sniper (Long range, uses sniper rifle), Heavy (Demo and area control expert, uses LMG and Rocket launcher), Assault ( High Crit/Short range/Multi-shot unit, uses shotgun or Assault rifle), and Support (Healer/cover unit, uses Assault rifle)-- Lots of ways to customize the look of the soldiers-- Many Armor Types, 3 weapon tech levels, 5 base weapon types (6 with EW expansion), and lots of items that can be carried- Interesting, varied enemies, many of which can be captured -> Interrogated -> autopsy for new technology- Customizable base, which makes up the ""Strategic Layer""-- Interesting facilities which you can build in the base, including:--- The Foundry, where you can build cool things, invent new tools, and improve existing weapons (better crit rate, more ammo space, etc...), though it is a little bland compared to the amount the Enemy WIthin expansion adds--- The Officer Training school, which betters your troops in various ways--- the Labratories (Where you research cool things)- Good Tactical Gameplay --Well Designed cover system, with destroyable cover of varying durablity-- Accuracy System and Flanking system (The names are kind of self-explainatory) where height, distance, and line of sight matter; and can effect damage, crit rate, and accuracyCon's:-Story is very predictable-No Steam Workshop/Mod Tools, though there is a sadistic mod called the ""Long War""-While the game does have a large amount of maps, which have decent variety, you will still end up going thru most of them in a playthrough, and will definitly start feeling repetative by the second playthrough- Overwatch action wasn't implemented in the best way, and everyone will fire on the first alien that comes into view instead of taking turns (In case there are more aliens, which there always are)- Once you get good at the game, you'll realize that there is one strategy which is signifigantly better than all the others, which makes the game start to feel bland after awhile.

												Two things can be said about the X-COM universe: the aliens are always evil and it’s grand daddy to turn-based tactical strategy games.For many older players, the mere whisper of X-COM: UFO Defense is enough for them to wet their pants without a shred of embarrassment. Well, XCOM: Enemy Unknown has changed the series besides losing the hyphen in X-COM. Graphical enhancement comes to mind. And a bit of gameplay freedom lost in favor of streamlined design, as fans of the original would probably point out. Be prepared for little grey men, psionics, UFOs, and pretty much every beloved sci-fi staple in existence.Let’s be realistic: compared to most strategy games, XCOM: EU has a flexible, dynamic campaign that is a wonder to the genre. When compared to the original, maybe not so much, but today we aren’t reviewing that game. So this game works primarily by a milestone campaign. You must reach certain milestones to progress, but in-between you are free to play as you see fit. You can choose to help certain nations out, or not. Take a pick of missions for a choice of reward. Spend your cash on soldiers or ships. Still, those milestones must be reached or you are unable to go on. You race to stay one step of the alien invasion and falling behind means a slow death by lack of funding. No funding means you can’t keep fighting the good fight. So the ability to make plenty of choices is there, but the game isn’t completely freeform.Developer Firaxis Games spared no expense on bringing XCOM to the modern era. The graphics are as good as can be expected for a squad tactical game. Aliens burst into viscera with a satisfying punch. Lasers (of course there are lasers!) and explosions feel as good as any action game. The animation prowess going into the Thin Man give him an exceptional amount of character. Slow motion camera work often captures the action in grisly detail. However, the responsiveness of the controls are questionable, most notably with the jetpack and grapple. Soldiers are also known to fire off in a different direction and still hit their target. The game isn’t perfect, but being turn-based does tone down many of the problems into mere annoyances. Except certain areas are not as random as they should be (looking at you, UFO assaults); that’s a problem that doesn’t go away.Let’s talk about the most important part of all tactical games — the combat. XCOM is fairly action-packed, as far as turn-based gaming goes. Your soldiers can move in leaps and bounds across the map, relying on each using two actions per turn. The selection of gadgets are interesting and diverse, ranging from grappling hooks to alien grenades. There’s even a mechanized unit that can replace a squad member. The class system by itself is a bit shallow and constricting. However when combining various equipment, psionics, gadgets, and other squad members, XCOM’s freedom gives you room to exercise your tactical genius. Just not too much room, especially since most weapons are class restrictive.Surprisingly, XCOM: EU has a ranked multiplayer mode. While co-op might have been a better direction, the competitive (1v1) system is well-designed and doesn’t feel like just a tacked on bullet point. And the multiplayer aspect is much needed, as the game has slim DLC options and a lack of modding tools. Ouch.Overall, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a worthy addition to both the series and the strategy genre. Make no mistake (if you do, a rampaging Muton will surely cut you down), XCOM’s limited, streamlined strategy is a cornerstone of its design and it shows.Side note: If you’re playing the game for the first time, I don’t recommend choosing any difficulty higher than Normal. Trust me!			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a great, modern version of a cult-classic from the '90s. The earth is getting attacked by an alien invasion. The nations of the world found the XCOM to deal with the invaders - and you are the commander.The gameplay is divided into two parts - the strategic base building game, were you deal with developing new weapons, deciding what countries to protect with satelite surveillance or shooting down UFOs. The other part is the tactic mode - you send a squad of 4-6 elite soldiers to deal with the invaders. Turn based you move carefully, kill some invaders and try to take prisoners for further interrogation. Your soldiers progress in an RPG like manner in four classes: Storm, Heavy, Support and Snipers. Be carefull who you move first - one wrong move can kill a soldier you invested hours in.XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a game of decissions - do you buy a laser weapon or the better armor? When multiple cities get attacked at once - you have to decide which to defend, risking the other city and nation to get lost on you forever. You are the only chance for earth to repel the invasion. Use it - and have fun in a game I already spend 50 hours in.			"

												The Legacy of U.F.O: Enemy Unknown is legendary. Released in 1994 with harsh difficulty, unsettling atmosphere, scary missions and a constant pressure from the daunting economics and management mechanics, this was ahead of its time.Against odds it is back, and against all logic it is as good as it was, maybe even better.Take on an international task-force with alien counter-terrorism as main objective. Build an underground base complex, hire soldiers, scramble and take down alien aircrafts, research their technology, equip your forces and ready yourself for an epic and daunting battle for the future of man-kind. See how far your mission will get you as you expose the twisted minds of your unknown enemy. In XCOM: Enemy Unknown.			"

												Bringing in tactical gameplay mixed with the micromanagemant of a base, this game manages to give a real feel that you are an elite force, and the only hope left for Earth. Deep research, a main quest that takes you out of your comfort zone and aliens that will test how flexible you can be. Although it can be a bit glitchy and I wish there was more larger decisions, this game packs an almighty punch. Unless you want a bigger punch in which your going ot have to capture a live beserker muton -_-..........			"

												This game has returned... and it has wrought itself upon my schedule.  The classic XCOM hath returned, bringing all the glory of the original, with a more well constructed story.  The game features a very similar combat system to the original with many exquisite tweaks to character progression and abilities.  I feel this game to be the American equivalent of Final Fantasy Tactics mixed with saving the planet from aliens.  The game is challenging, but it allows you to mitigate your risks effectively. The game also feels thoroughly tested, with myself only experiencing a minor bug within about 20 hours of gameplay.  Well done Firaxis, well done - A+.			"

												As a fan of the original games I found Enemy Unknown and the expansion Enemy Withing very fun and enjoyable. There are a few similarities with the games such as both being turn based and the aliens being the same for the most part but that is where the similarities end. Unlike the original there is not as easy to keep all the nations happy and you are bound to lose a nation or two before you can think about ending the alien threat. Also unlike the original you can only make one base, meaning you have to pick and chose what you research and manufacture more carefully. In combat you start off with a small group of four and can upgrade to six and though that number seems small it forces you to play smarter and using the skills for your units more than in the orignal. With all games with RNG you can get into some critical situations and either hit an enemy when you only had a 10% or feel you heart sink as your best sniper misses the life saving shot though he had a 95% chance to hit. Those who think this game is too easy are also in luck as there is a mod called the Long War mod which makes the game that much harder and more fun. If you like strategy games then I recommend you give this game a shot.			"

												Okay, so I gave the remake a good, honest try that extended past the hour of bull hooey on Danny's computer....I won't bother going over an exhaustive list of the differences between the two games because honestly, the remake is different enough to warrant being its own game *inspired* by the original. The premise is the same, the missions are nice, but I don't think that it's either fair (or possible) for the remake to 'stand up' against the original-- simply put, I don't think that a younger audience would be able to deal with the old interface, graphics, and flat-out-butt-kickin'-nonsense that was XCOM: UFO Defense.A couple of key notes here: 1) The class base system is nice but almost completely random. You'll find yourself particularly attracted to some, not liking others, and winding up with a mixed bag of both. The game does absolutely nothing to help here, making you purchase rookies like they're going out of style to find the right grab bag of combinations that you want. A mixed squad of the base classes *can* be nice, but only if you play a certain way.2) This is no longer the nuanced 'laser or plasma' debate: flat out, plasma wins because laser needs to be reloaded. Don't ask, don't tell-- the younger generation is going to miss out on all of that. Maybe even for the best.3) The tutorial will run you on rails so hard you'll check for scorch marks in your crotch. You have been warned.4) Stats? What stats? The class base system overrides stats so completely you'll never notice them, randomized or no.5) The game is trying to tell a story, a sequential story which can be exploited. Unless you're playing the tutorial, in which case, enjoy hell.6) The game has limited the strategic elements of the game and has narrowed it down to a tactical level. Nice, if you like that kind of game. Far less grand strategy (if you could even say that of the original) because all of your things are in a single base with a well-thought out, fairly streamlined interface.7) For those of you who want to complain about ammo management: they did it, it's done, it's not bad. You have to reload WAY more often than in the original but it adds a tactical dimension not otherwise noticed (except for those who played small-squad games).8) For those who want to complain about reaction skill removal: overwatch is a great mechanic and actually makes sense to those who couldn't/didn't/wouldn't do the math from the original. Dumbed-down isn't always stupid, it's functional.9) For those who want to complain about the interceptions: no person in their right mind played a game that deliberately required them to send up multiple Interceptors who didn't lose before the first year. Yeah, it's not as hardcore as the original, see 8.10) For those who want to complain about the inability to purchase certain items, *cough*personnel*cough*, etc etc: it makes the plot decisions more interesting.All in all Firaxis has done a great job re-envisioning XCom. It's fun, it's fast, and it's not even close. 8/10			"

XCOM is even cooler than SHIELD, because they aren't so desperate as to call on lost creatures (billionaires, mutants, aliens) to defend them.This game is oozing with strategy, tactics, and theme.

Just look at how many reviewers (myself included) have wracked up over 100hours of gameplay… It’s a turn based game that requires you to use cover with a good variety of aliens, mission types, research choices and talent trees for each class of soldier.Plenty of reason to replay this game, whether you want to try the harder setting or want to finish up gathering steam achievements… the missions/maps are random each game (except main story)  and with the expansion you can decide whether you want to focus on more gene enchanced or Mech trooper robotic soldiers.

												I usually hate turn based games, but XCOM is very enjoyable. While the missions are pretty similar, new enemies, combat techniques, weapons and other features keep getting added throughout the game which keeps it feeling fresh.The balance in this game is excelllent; base resources aren't rare, but not plentiful so you must consider which area to fund most and you will pay for it if you neglect other areas (fighters need upgrades but so do foot soldiers and research expansion etc.).The tutorial gets you started well as I'm not a regular player of turn based games  and it eases you into higher difficulty missions scaling reallly smoothly; I never felt like I was grinding easy enemies and while I had to revert to saves, it wasn't so hard that I wanted to ragequit.Overall an excellent game and it deserves the high praise it has received.

												A good followup to the 90s classic this is well worth the effort. The game really makes you feel part of the story and the characters you interact with are well formed and its satisfying when aliens that slaughtered your troops up front are blown away by the end. Warning a campaign to save the earth can take 30-40 hours and the storyline effectively repeats for each playthrough so its not a game for those with big backlogs, nor is it a great game for those who like surprises in each replay (ala Civilization V, Europa Universalis).

The game isn't fussy, it will tear you to shreds and implant alien eggs in your body, if you don't use the lumping head of yours. Playing tip: give your units funny/interesting names. it's always good to have a Master Chief or a Mother ""Psycho"" Russia  in your team. I also suggest the DLC Packs, if you are a fan of nice looking sci-fi suits and as long as they are reduced.			"

If you have never played any of the old games then this will be a treat as it will all be new to you.  XCom is a turn based game so has the advantage that you stop and go take the dog for a walk and come back to where you left off.  The story is excellent and slowly drip feeds you more parts of it as you go along.  I like the RPG part of it in that you can see your squad characters develop and upgraded with the equipment you are researching and making.  It has loads of different aliens, autopsies, research, turn based battles and some strategy on how you manage your funds and the councils.  Great game which is definately worth buying - especially during one of the Steam sales.			"

The one and only down side to XCOM is its difficulty, it is very easy to find your self 10+ hours into your first play through, just to find out it is impossible to win. One tip to people that decide to play this is be careful with your decisions, because they all have a positive and negative effect.  "

The gameplay is great as any game should be but also has a unique story to it. The DLC is as good as the main game and adds loads of cool new features. I've played through this game loads of times and it is still fun to play and replay.			"

												If ever a game has been deserving of a remake / spiritual successor, it has to be X-COM: UFO Defense. It's a classic turn-based strategy game with a great sense of mystery and dread, regarded by many to be one of the best strategy games ever made.XCOM: Enemy Unknown (what happened to the hyphen?) is an excellent modern interpretation of that fantastic game, featuring great turn-based tactical combat, fun character progression, a beautiful musical score and above all, that same sense of wonder, dread and emotional attachment to your troops. XCOM: Enemy Within further expands on this amazing game with a bigger tech tree, a new soldier class and plenty of new enemies to fight, as well as a multitude of new maps to fight them on.. if the XCOM-project isn't destroyed from within. A must-play for any strategy gamer!			"

												I played both enemy unknown and within. No complains, I bought them on initial release and with discount they are a no brainer.They are not the same as the good old x-com: enemy unknown for different reasons. Like the enemies are not randomly generated and so on. But they are definitely worth the money and the time. Fun to play and addictive until the end.			"

Improved everything that could have been, but still kept the awesomeness of the original.Bug free, solid graphics and storyline. I played the PS3 version, and the Steam version is superior in terms of graphics and load times.I haven't played the multiplayer yet or tried the DLC, but if someone picks this up and wants to play head to head, I'm sure it would be fun.

That means, it is really good :)I bought the DLC Enemy Within, too, after my first playthrough of EU. You have to choose between EU and EW which is great as you will be able to play the less challenging EU at any given time. They keep their individual savegames in seperate folders, too. Nice :)When you start this game, there are two things you should know:1) It's not about what you want. It's about what you *need*2) Get satellites up as soon and as many as possible during the first three months.			"

												Xcom: Enemy Unknown is a great game with awesome gameplay and great graphics and will be likeable to most of the gamers, especially the ones who are into strategic games. It's a fine game which is very intense and makes you feel like a badass when you complete a mission without any casualties and naming soldiers after your friends makes this game even harder, because obviously you will try to keep them safe which is a hard work to do. All in all it's a great game that needs more attention and in my opinion it's worth every penny,it has an amazing singleplayer AND multiplayer(really awesome multiplayer because you can also play on aliens' side :D YAY! right?). So i give this game a 9/10. It's a must own.			"

												I found this game to be really enjoyeable and put a TON of hours into it.  Played through the game several times and plan to play it more once I get the Enemy Within expansion.. I never played the old ones and I know people were really excited for a new one.  I just really enjoyed it for what it was totally on its own.  I like the strategy games like this but I feel like the little details is what made it so great to play.  The music was AWESOME.  I bought the soundtrack actually.  I think the soundtrack was part of what brought tension to the missions and you really felt bad when you lost a team member that you had gone on so many missions with and your rookies had to cut their teeth to get to be like the veterans.  The bagpipes were a nice touch on the memorial screen.  I liked the story and Firaxis did another great job with their games.  I highly recommend and im sure you will put many hours into it like I did.			"

												The best strategy game of 2012, and a contender for best game of the year 2012. A merciless, yet still approachable sense of depth and unforgivingness make XCOM: Enemy Unkown a hallmark of excellence. Its expansion--XCOM: Enemy Within--meets the same quality standards as its predecessor. There is truly no other strategy game as tense and well structured that plays like XCOM. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys turn-base strategy games, the RTS genre, or games such as Fire Emblem and Advance Wars.			"

The main bits are the same; Aliens attack, and you gotta find them and hunt them down, while also trying to keep all the countries in the world happy. But in the remake, the NPCs makes it so much more enjoyable. They give more life to the game, and also makes you question your own actions.If you liked the original, play it. If you didn't, play anyway.			"

												In 1994, a stratgey RPG titled: X-COM UFO Defense was released on the PC. It was a hit, and the series continued, it eventiually got very far away from its turn-based RPG roots (See XCOM: The Buereu). Now, Firaxis has brought everything back to the start with a reboot of the series. It is definatley a triumphant return. The game has been very changed, and even those who played X-COM to death will have a new experience in XCOM. Without getting into every detail, the one thing this game does is simplify the experience. Each unit has infinite ammo packs, there is only ever one XCOM base, and so on. This serves not only to say that this is a modernized version of the classic game, but also as a completely new one. Now, the best part of the game is the customization options. If you get both of the DLCs, the game has a number of different voices, races, hair styles (even Guile hair!) to choose from, allowing you to make a team of whoever you want, and not just having generic soldiers. Personally, my team was Hewiki ""Stoneshot"" Ignika, Raida ""Radio"" Justice, James T ""NotaRedShirt"" Kirk, Barry ""Magnum"" Burton, Jill ""Sandwich"" Valentine, and Shaquille ""Slam-Dunk"" O'neil. When you give your soldiers names, themed armor, and everything else, the game manages to make things personal. When a soldier gets critically wounded, the game will make you freak out. Somehow, the game makes you care for these soldiers, and that is the strongest point of the game. However, the game also has some serious problems. It's pretty hard to care for your soldiers when one of them gets hit, and then falls through the floor, you kind of get taken out of the experience. In my experience though, it hasn't ever crashed, just had some problems with registering flanking, aim calculations, and clipping. Major problems with clipping. All together, with the amazing experience and the replayability the ghame has, with the buggyness in mind, 9.5/10 Pretty Amazing			"

												Easily one of the very best games in my collection, and one of the least expensive. As a guy who hates going through a game a second time, I am working towards the end of my second playthrough on classic iron-man and looking forward to my third one (on impossible, hopefully).The blend of micro- and macro-management is really fun and forces you to plan your funding strategies ahead (at least until you get full satellite coverage). The turn-based combat in itself is quite awesome, the action camera proving itself really immersive. Gameplay is both simple and ramified while the level design is well thought (while randomly generated). The entirety of the game is focused on making the fight for earth *your* fight for earth, and you can customize everything (even more with the dlcs) for your own enjoyment (and perhaps easier recognition of your soldiers while on mission).Understanding all the game mechanics can be hard at first and requires a lot of thought, but is well worth the time spent.Perhaps the only con I see for this game is the lack of real choice you have to make on the scenario. You can research all projects, complete the foundry, obtain full satellite coverage, have all your soldiers fully upgraded and geared all in the same playthrough. If I were to ask for an addition, it would be to force the player to make strategic choices (not only on what to research first, but on what to research at all), and challenges (why not adding some sort of automated earth defense system that you would have to deploy on earth, and the possibility to save countries that have left the X-COM project). XCOM : EW seems to deal in some way with this, I can't wait to buy it !Unlike most games, the challenges offered (classic/impossible mode, iron-man, and second wave options) are both challenging and not irritating. However higher difficulty modes are mostly based on modifying in-game values such as your soldier's base hp, costs of items/research projects... etc (even if the ai is slightly better) which basically force you to use overwatch more and be more cautious. I've yet to see a game showing additional mechanics and forcing the player to swap for totally different strategies on higher difficulty modes.In two words, GET IT !			"

												The addition of the Enemy Within expansion rekindled my love for the game!If you ever enjoyed any of the 1994-1995 XCom titles, you should definitely check this one out. While taking a new approach to the mechanics, it stays true to the Original XCom spirit.About the expansion:While I'm not finding myself enjoying MEC play all that much, I totally love upgrading my soldiers with various genetic twinks that make superman look like a wuss. Map pool has also been updated and together with more story missions it keeps the levels interesting for a longer time before boredom kicks in.There are still some kinks left in the game, like shooting through walls and the camera being an.. well..♥♥♥♥♥♥. in some levels. But the major annoyance from launch have since been fixed/changed. No more teleporting aliens right into the middle of your squad.I'm a bit torn about the general pace of the game. Unlike in the original XCom titles you rush through research and the missions in a blaze. It may be a good or bad thing, depending on your preferences. You definitely don't have to ""grind"" through a hard month anymore but you don't feel outclassed and out gunned, fighting against a superior enemy while slowly crawling up to a level playing field either.A Second Wave option for a longer game, which basically quadruples research times is available after you beat the game once though. Base and item management have been simplified to the levels of Ant farm and non-existent. Good if you didn't enjoy that part of XCom, bad if you did.All in all, I would recommend this game to everyone!			"

The tactical battles, while feeling a bit limited when compared to the original, are engaging.  The strategic views adds a bit of variety over the original, although I like the original simplicty a bit more.  Still taken on its own, it is a game that has basically unlimited replay value, and the tension with combat is real.			"

												Damn, I love this game. Within the first 15 minutes I've slayed, interrogated, and autopsied aliens for upgrades. Had my squad finish a Terror mission without any casualties... only to have them all wiped in the next UFO landing (damned Cyberdiscs). Then create a trap using an ""Assault"" class unit and 5 heavies (ever see 5 people light up a group of over eager aliens? it's pretty satisfying).Pretty faithful update of the original (though not as hard). Great gameplay if you like turn based strategy, multiple tactics, quite a fun multiplayer, and pretty good replayability.Been having fun so far, and I must say ... I may enjoy it more than the original...			"

												Had me hooked from the moment I saw someone else play it on Youtube. This game is hard on normal setting and best suited for people who like to think strategically, not just mindlessly blow stuff up. My only criticism is that the multiplayer could have been improved a bit - the game seems buggy when networked and the team editor is not exactly intuitive and completely different to the single player version you use before a mission. I really hope they release some sort of expansion pack for single player because I whipped through the game in about a couple of weeks (I don't play that often) and thoroughly enjoyed it. The aliens are sinister and cunning and very, very lucky with their dice rolls. Buy it.			"

												Absolutely my pick for GOTY 2012.  Enemy Unknown is a fantastic turn-based strategy game. All of the squad member classes are well-balanced. This means that there is no powergaming strategy, at least for your first few playthoughs. The variety of viable tactics keep this game fun and challenging.  Even though the story is reminiscent of a generic action movie, the gameplay is fully capable of keeping you playing for far more hours than you can imagine.			"

												XCOM is a nail-biting turn-based strategy that is chock full of nail-biting battles, wonderful visuals, and challenging gameplay.  My biggest gripe is that you have to take a passive role with combating the terror caused from the alien invasion.  It also lacks the feel of a large-scale invasion;  the size of the battles feels like a tactical contribution to an otherwise strategic war for the planet.  Still, I heartily recommend this game to fans of TBS's, or sci-fi games  in general. 8/10			"

												Modernized version of the classic UFO Defense with some substantial added elements (counting in Enemy Within). 'Modernized' not only meaning Unreal Engine 3, but also some simplified mechanics both in and out of combat to make the game more appealing to the current audience and to make the game flow more nicely. It works, though I do for example miss having multiple bases and an action point/time system rather than just having two actions per turn.I originally got this game right at launch, but was immediately turned off by the simplicity of the combat (I was expecting something along the lines of Jagged Aliance 2 if not the orignial X-Com) and it seemed very unbalanced. Picked up the Complete version in the last sale and somehow I loved it straight away. No idea what changed, it just grabbed me.This game with the DLC is in my opinion a worthy reboot. I hope it's reboot... please, let there be more!			"

												Um excelente jogo de estratégia que faz uma justa homenagem ao original dos anos 90 e atualiza a franquia com maestria.O jogo articula momentos de administração de recursos, pesquisa e construção com as missões, onde a ação estratégica se dá por turnos no combate a invasão alienígena. A mecânica é bem semelhante ao jogo original.Como pontos positivos da nova versão temos melhores gráficos e uma linha narrativa cinemática mais detalhada. Além disso a interface é um pouco mais fácil e auxilia o jogador iniciante.O jogo tem momentos bem difíceis, obrigando a fazer uso recorrente do save/load. Mas não chega a uma dificuldade impossível e frustrante da série original, que praticamente impede de chegar ao fim.Para os fãs de estratégia, recomendo!			"

												In XCOM: Enemy Unknown, you are waging war against an Alien Force invading Earth. You have to utilize limited resources to manage base construction, as well as scientific research and engineering projects to advance your team of soldiers into what is eventually a sophisticated military unit using hyper advanced technology.From time to time you are called upon to defend Earth from the invading Aliens, whether it be alien abductions in a major city or a UFO sighting. This is where the meat of the game is. You pick and choose soldiers who level up over time and assume roles like Sniper, Rocketeer or Medic, with permadeath mechanics involved.The game is really fantastic if you like turn based strategy games. There's a certain tense anxiety that comes from being pinned down by incredibly advanced, extremely dangerous aliens and hoping that one of your soldiers can pull of a shot that will shake up the situation and turn it into your favor. If you like the game, pick up the Enemy Within expansion as well, which is a comprehensive expansion pack that adds Mechs, Augmentations for soldiers and a new enemy faction.Shoutout to the Long War mod. If you feel like you've mastered the game, try Long War. It is a VERY expansive mod for XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM: Enemy Within. It adds enormous amounts of content as well as makes an already difficult game relentlessly and extremely difficult. In my opinion, the Long War mod completes this already very fantastic game.			"

												A great turn-based squad small unit tactics game in which you protect Earth from an alien invasion.  With the expansion of Enemy Within, it really is a fantastic game.  You manage your base between missions and do everything you can to protect your soldiers from death (which is permanent).  Don't worry, there's more where that came from (though you will be sad or just reload and hope you can save him).  And for the hardcore there's a an ironman mode in which it autosaves for you so you can't undo a wrong decision.  With mods, I see a long life for this great game.			"

												Thousands upon thousands have already experienced the might of XCOM, showering it with praise and recommendations like it was the greatest thing on earth. And I......am no different. Seriously, what can be said about this game that hasn't already? Each battle has its own twists and turns, each weapon is unique, every soldier can be customized until one finds oneself fighting alongside Jesus Christ and Mr. Hyde. Randomization makes every playthrough different, while the micromanagement(which is fine) fits neatly alongside the turn-based combat(which is exceptional). Couple that with a decent story and some heartfelt, yet subtle, lessons on the hypocrisy of war and you have a game for the record books. Stellar job.			"

												As an Xcom vet of over 20 years, involved in modding the old .exe files, keeping it all working up until win 7, I'll say right now that this is a faithful recreation of the original time waster, but modernized very conservatively. Some things changed slightly, it could really use some mods or options, but hell yeah it lives up to it's namesake. Especially the fun factor.The bad part for me is the way they implemented the camara tracking, and that could be a turnoff. It definitely limited my enjoyment, and limited my playtime so far. Still gets an 8/10 from me, otherwise would make 9/10 if the camara behavior were more customizable. "

												I have played ""XCOM: Enemy Unknown"" some time ago on my friend's computer. Finished it then for the first time, enjoyed a lot and decided that I want to have it to be able to play again at any time. Got it recently and played it again, this time on ""Iron Man"" mode. On Normal difficulty it took about 40 hours.I liked about this game following:1) Enormous replay value;2) ""Ironman"" mode which comes with a DLC and if enabled ""forces"" you to enjoy playing interesting game instead of the ""perfect"" one (where you do not loose a battle);3) Really great gameplay in tactical combat as well as in base management;4) Very nice graphics with most of the cutscenes made on a game engine, which is very good because in every cutscene involving soldiers you will see your soldiers and not predefined dummies (as it happens in many other games);5) As a result it is very enjoyable to customize your characters;6) Minor but very important thing is that all soldiers as well as other characters in the game come from various countries which makes it look like you are fighting a real world wide thread (in contrast and for example, in majority of the hollywood movies alliens or any other foes always have Los Angeles as a highest priority, like it is a centre of the world :) );7) Interesting story line, creative weapons, really distinct aliens as well as other design choices are really well thought and well made.List of advantages is not by any means full but big enough to provide an overview of reasons why one may want to buy this game.In order to be fair I will provide a list of disadvantages, though I think none of them significant enough to discourage one from playing this game. Never the less, here are those things which may have been better:1) Some minor interface bugs;2) Lack of difficulty levels between ""Normal"" and ""Classic"". Normal is very good if you playing reasonably well. On Classic however, it turns into the game where you struggle to survive. It is drasticly more difficult. Having difficulties between those two would be great. It can be partially solved by Second Wave options which as far as I know would require one to have appropriate DLC;3) Story line is quite linear and you do not really affect anything storywise except its pace. Having several endings or alternative scenarios of game progression would be great, but having said this I also know that story is not that important at all, as this game primarily about gameplay in two modes Base Management and Tactical Battles. Therefore, story serves its role as a background for everything you do.That is possibly it. List of disadvantages is more like a list of suggestions on how developers can make really great game even better.Thus, if you are into tactical turnbase combat and management in between then XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a great game for you as it is for me. It virtually provides unlimited replay value and it worth each pence or cent or any other currency you will have to pay for it. I would totally recommend it! :) "

												(NOTE: Despite my short playtime on Steam, I have owned and played the PS3 version since 2012).I have never played the original XCOM games, I just downloaded the demo, not knowing that the XCOM series existed. I got so addicted to the demo, I replayed it several times. Then I got the full game for Christmas. This game defines fun. The story may seem shallow, but guess what, that why you must create your own story. I mean, you can customize your own soldiers, even their names. Try naming them after your loved ones, and you'll get attached to them. That's the thing about XCOM, it doesn't trivialize death; it even has a memorial for your lost soldiers. Haven't played multiplayer, but singleplayer alone justifies the price tag. There are some lags here and there but they're minor. Come on, buy it NOW.			"

												Visually stunning but hardly the best game in the Xcom franchise, still enjoyable once you work past its faults. If you have played previous Xcom games the first thing you will notice is how annoyingly streamlined this game is. Anything you could do tandemly in previous Xcom games has been reduced to one instance at a time. No researching multiple things no launching multiple Interceptors or Skyrangers. Gone are the multiple independant bases, tho you can station interceptors at various fixed locations around the globe. Instead of having soldiers with stats and using those to determine how you outfit them, there are now fixed classes. Soldiers are (seemingly) randomly promoted to a class after their first mission (or automatically once you buy the foundry upgrade). Time units are gone so there is no more deciding what to do, you can either take an action which will end the turn for all classes except Heavy that have taken the skill that allows them to take a second action if their first action was to shoot. Otherwise you can move and take an action or sprint which ends your turn. Unless you are an Assault using Run & Gun which will allow you to sprint and fire your weapon. Time Units let you do whatever. move and shoot, shoot and move, shoot, throw a genade and move etc. The real problem I had with the streamlining of soldiers was the sniper. In the original Xcom if your soldier had the sort of stats that fit a sniper you could eventually work them into that position while still using them in other capacities if you needed to. In this itteration of the game BOOM your soldier is a sniper they will only ever be a sniper and snipers for me were dead weight through the first part of the game. They only really start becoming useful later on when you unlock a bunch of technology and manage to get them sufficiently promoted, selecting the appropriate skills. When the game says Alien Activity what it really means is you havn't run into a scripted event yet. They start off cool but they get old sorta fast. Effectively what happens is you walk to a point where the game spawns in aliens and it does so with a quick but not quick enouhg (when you hit the 30th+ time) in game cut scene where they go from standing around  apparently gossiping to dashing for cover. Where as previous games Alien Activity meant there was an alien somewhere on the map actially doing something with or without you there to watch it doing said thing. That said I'm not 100% sure how terror missions work because you still get the same spawn in effect but civilians in areas you can't see will die if you don't make your way to them fast enough. I don't quite get how a 9GB+ game can't seem to acomplish the same depth a game managed to decades ago and clocking in at only around 30MB. Still it really does look nice and if you never played the original Xcom you probably won't even know what you're missing. At the end of the day this is probably as close to a revival of Xcom as we can ever really hope for.			"

												PROS-Cross platform-Challenging -Replayability (different decisions, different difficulty settings, etc.)-Somewhat engaging story-line, even extra content you don't need to progress but is still interesting, like autopsies and other research projects-You can play it one-handed (easy pizza access)Just one annoying thing: Sometimes the auto-targeting puts your POV at an odd angle that does not allow you to see your enemy's hit points very well. Easy to get around if you just exit out of firing mode and go look manually, but it's still kind of inconvenient to have to do that.Definitely would recommend though, well worth the money.			"

												Like squad based strategy? Like kicking alien♥♥♥♥♥♥all over the earth? THEN PLAY THIS GAME!No, seriously, it's a good game. That said (and since the topic was raised), the only problem I had with it was a tiny oversight that somewhat negatively impacted the feeling of realism, it's missing that one thing, that tiny titbit of detail, that would make it seem as real as any ol' alien encounter today is (and y'all know it is). I am, of course, talking about the lowly Anal probe. Yes, indeed, the extra-terrestrial past time of cavity exploration, by way of some very novel and creative implements. Even though we all know it as the stock trade of those little baldheaded grey perv... visitors, it seemingly doesn't even have a proper cameo anywhere in the game.Tsk tsk... I'm sure they'll fix it with another expansion. Thought it was going to be ""Enemy Within"", alas it was not. Lack of bum probes aside, don't let a tiny oversight like that dissuade you from buying,this game is money well spent, and with the current sale it would literally be half the money(I paid) well spent.

												This game is very good, especially the Enemy WIthin add-on, which adds a load of new things to XCOM: EW. I'm just going to say, singleplayer is phenomenal, a decent story with a cliche yet cool ending, very fun gameplay, nice character customization (Made my entire squad characters from the Devil May Cry series and had fun doing it, even giving them certain traits I feel their actual characters had), a very cool menu for your in-between battles, and a whole host of other really cool things.I don't want to put anyone off, but for me, it's best you guys ignore multiplayer exists. It is horribly broken flawed, hell, even the leaderboards are♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. Not even the regular leaderboard hackers you see at the top are messing with it. Even funnier, someone with the name ""XCOM LEADERBOARDS ARE BROKEN"" is at the very top of it. God knows how long it has been there.Story timeFirst game for me: We start off at a semi great start, one of my guys dies after inflicting damage on what I assume was their main man, a decked out human, and killing a Thin Man. And the worst part is he was in my support's smoke. I chalked it off as bad luck (probably was), so then they have my support completely trapped and it was my turn. Luckily I had the Grappling Hook armor and I grappled on top of the building that he was inside along with my dead soldier, to join my sniper. The sniper moves so he can get in a better position. Next, a pretty buggy thing happened. His team apparently couldn't see my sniper, not after I killed 2 of his sectoids. After this, his remaining soldiers (the damaged human and what I assumed was his support) decide to go up the latter. My sniper couldnt use overwatch because he already shot, so I put my support in overwatch, who was not that far away from the ladder. The first soldier goes up the ladder (with 2 health) and for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reason my support didnt shoot him. So as you can guess, his soldier completely destroys my sniper. At this point, I am completely screwed, because his other soldier then climbed up with him, who wasnt injured at all, and threw down smoke (didnt make a difference in the long run). After their turn was up, I shot and killed his main because I didnt stand a chance anyways with my injured support. Next his soldier shot me point blank, didnt die, shot back, got a critical for 7 damage and ALMOST killed his soldier, but then I shot and got ded. Riperoni my vailiant soldier, heroes never die, they only respawn.In short, RIP multiplayer, Yay for singleplayer "

												Five out of five for this game. XCOM provides a fun and fairly simple strategy game experience that is backed by an amazing and replayable storyline. It's rare to find a game with a good story that you can replay and still have a different story experience. I found myself getting attached to characters and feeling some emotions I haven't felt since I went through the Mass Effect series. Aside from a great story experience that allows you to save the world the way you feel is best, the gameplay is really fun. It's simple enough that you won't get confused, but fun and versatile so you won't get bored of it. The campaign progression (research, mission choices, etc.) is like a game in itself outside of combat. You have to strategize on and off the battlefield to be succesful in this game. My only complaint deals with the multiplayer. Playing against friends with teams you've customized is a blast, except for when the game freezes or glitches in some other way. I've only had this happen in multiplayer and it's not a huge issue, just one worth mentioning. If you see this game on sale, snatch it up, because this game is a great investment even at full price.			"

												When I first played this game (about 3 years ago), I had a great feeling, as if I was a mastermind of a giant war operation. That was fun. Few years later, Enemy Within came out. I didn't see anything in it, so I passed. At first. Then I heard about a mod, called Long War, that made the game harder and... better. I thought I'd give it a try. I bought Enemy Within and Slingshot, downloaded the mod...I've played Long War for about 8 months. Sure, there were long breaks from XCOM, sometimes months long. But I'm still going. The game is mostly same strategy, sure. But instead of feeling like a great asskicking mastermind I feel like... an insignificant distraction for alien forces. Every mission feels like a punch in the gut, and I'm lucky if every solder survived that mission. The funding from the Council is usually no enough, the soldiers are consantly panicking and sectoids are using same genetic thech we're using, so now they've got 5 points of health and a random ability. XCOM 2 came out couple of days ago, right? I heard they made it harder then Enemy Unknown. Yeah, right. I'll still will try to beat EU with Long War mod. It will take time. Weeks, months, hell, maybe years. But it's too damn good to throw away like that. So, in short, if you don't have the money to buy XCOM 2, like me, buy this one. Then install the Long War mod (after you finished the game, because it'll be impossible for new players), and pretend to use guerilla tactics. It's one of the best games out there, and you won't find such a rewarding expirience even in Dark Souls.			"

Make one or two missions, arrange and upgrade your underground base... and believe me, you should be hooked, willing to have more time in your life! Such a nice gameplay, graphics okay, story just interesting enough, but all the upgrading of your operations and the tactical deployment make it a great game. Do recommend.			"

												I have played the game on PS3 and title was great success - mostly bacause it was one of the games you could see action happening on screen - while you hold pad in one hand and hot tea in other. Steering on controller was simply amazing. I'm yet to hook up controller to pc version as I have bought this to enjoy Xcom: Enemy within  on pc instead. Game is great fun. Despite little simplistic approach, it becomes very tactical very quickly. After one playthrough game become simply to understand, but maintain the challenging levels at all time. It is very cinematic at times, ad you will be telling stories to your friends.PROSGreat graphics tactical challengeunit customisationrandomised levels and second wave optionsController supportCONSRepetetive location setsBase managing could be more complicatedmore mission typesDLC seem to address some issues giving you more options and more sutable locations, therefore game is on my list to complete it again.

I just feel like they didn't put much effort into their research. I didn't get an authentic vibe from the game like I am replaying the greatest war in the history of man kind. However, like many red blooded Americans, I get a raging boner from shooting things in the face, especially illegal aliens. I wouldn't buy it at the $40 price tag, but if it is on sale for like $10 you are defintately getting your money's worth. Unless you need that $10 for crack cocaine than definately get the crack.

												A fantastic example of how to do turn-based grid movement well. XCOM is an interesting and rather unique take on strategic combat. Feeling like a combination of turn-based RPG (the Fire Embled kind, not the Final Fantasy kind) and RTS, the gameplay is fluid, quick-paced and brutal. The management of panic levels, research and engineering on a relatively strict budget adds a managerial level of complexity to the game in addition to the combat. With a whole assortment of randomly generated side missions, you can lose so much time to this game however that is what I like about it. Great fun and a great experience.			"

												An extremely well done remake of the original XCOM - ENEMY UNKNOWN from 1992. Great atmosphere! Very nice music, story-telling cutscenes, intuitive controls, balanced tutorial and tips. I LOVE THE IRONMAN mode when You cannot load previous position and You can only progress forward. It adds GREAT new level of difficulty - making Your tactics-MASTERY very important and so You learn it quick ! :)			"

												A very fun and addicitng game that is actually quite challenging and unforgivable of your mistakes. You have to manage your team well as well as your financial health. Making hard decisions and prioritizing your goals are all part of the challenge. I had quite an enjoyable time playing this game. The only negative things I say about this game is the controls and camera angles/views are quite wonky at times, especially when there's a building with more than one floor. Another thing to note is that this game is not really a story-driven game so don't expect a strong, in-depth plot. Otherwise, this is a stellar sci-fi based strategy game! * This game has grown on me. It is MY favourite game!*Remember, we will be watching!			"

												A solid and fun RTS game! If your looking for a good game that will soak up several hours of your time then I suggest this! As a fan of all of the original XCOM games, I have to say I really did enjoy it. It lacks some of the indepth management from the older games (such as buying ammo) and sleeks in down to more of a base building sim on that side of the game. The main focus is the RTS missions where you combat the aliens with all of your various goodies that you have researched and unlocked during the game. It's always fun to play just a bit longer to see what new weapons/armor/items you can unlock while researching the aliens. Highly reccommended!			"

												One of the greatest, most addictive and most fun games I've played in the last years. This is the kind of game that gives you a set of rules, a list of resources and a series of tech trees and let's you play with them, always forcing you to prioritize something, never being able to being good at everything and constantly elevating the level of challenges as you progress. It creates a constant panic environment where you are pressed to make compromises and you swear everytime you suffer any loss. Just DON'T play anything under ""classic"" difficulty.Problems: stupid teleporting bug still present which can ruin your perfect ironman game, the game story is not horrible but it is a bit underwhelming, at high difficulties losing a substantial number of squad members late in the game effectively means game over.Nor better nor worse than the original, just different (and incredibly good).

												The addition of the Enemy Within expansion rekindled my love for the game!If you ever enjoyed any of the 1994-1995 XCom titles, you should definitely check this one out. While taking a new approach to the mechanics, it stays true to the Original XCom spirit.About the expansion:While I'm not finding myself enjoying MEC play all that much, I totally love upgrading my soldiers with various genetic twinks that make superman look like a wuss. Map pool has also been updated and together with more story missions it keeps the levels interesting for a longer time before boredom kicks in.There are still some kinks left in the game, like shooting through walls and the camera being an.. well..♥♥♥♥♥♥. in some levels. But the major annoyance from launch have since been fixed/changed. No more teleporting aliens right into the middle of your squad.I'm a bit torn about the general pace of the game. Unlike in the original XCom titles you rush through research and the missions in a blaze. It may be a good or bad thing, depending on your preferences. You definitely don't have to ""grind"" through a hard month anymore but you don't feel outclassed and out gunned, fighting against a superior enemy while slowly crawling up to a level playing field either.A Second Wave option for a longer game, which basically quadruples research times is available after you beat the game once though. Base and item management have been simplified to the levels of Ant farm and non-existent. Good if you didn't enjoy that part of XCom, bad if you did.All in all, I would recommend this game to everyone!			"

The tactical battles, while feeling a bit limited when compared to the original, are engaging.  The strategic views adds a bit of variety over the original, although I like the original simplicty a bit more.  Still taken on its own, it is a game that has basically unlimited replay value, and the tension with combat is real.			"

												Easily one of the very best games in my collection, and one of the least expensive. As a guy who hates going through a game a second time, I am working towards the end of my second playthrough on classic iron-man and looking forward to my third one (on impossible, hopefully).The blend of micro- and macro-management is really fun and forces you to plan your funding strategies ahead (at least until you get full satellite coverage). The turn-based combat in itself is quite awesome, the action camera proving itself really immersive. Gameplay is both simple and ramified while the level design is well thought (while randomly generated). The entirety of the game is focused on making the fight for earth *your* fight for earth, and you can customize everything (even more with the dlcs) for your own enjoyment (and perhaps easier recognition of your soldiers while on mission).Understanding all the game mechanics can be hard at first and requires a lot of thought, but is well worth the time spent.Perhaps the only con I see for this game is the lack of real choice you have to make on the scenario. You can research all projects, complete the foundry, obtain full satellite coverage, have all your soldiers fully upgraded and geared all in the same playthrough. If I were to ask for an addition, it would be to force the player to make strategic choices (not only on what to research first, but on what to research at all), and challenges (why not adding some sort of automated earth defense system that you would have to deploy on earth, and the possibility to save countries that have left the X-COM project). XCOM : EW seems to deal in some way with this, I can't wait to buy it !Unlike most games, the challenges offered (classic/impossible mode, iron-man, and second wave options) are both challenging and not irritating. However higher difficulty modes are mostly based on modifying in-game values such as your soldier's base hp, costs of items/research projects... etc (even if the ai is slightly better) which basically force you to use overwatch more and be more cautious. I've yet to see a game showing additional mechanics and forcing the player to swap for totally different strategies on higher difficulty modes.In two words, GET IT !			"

												In XCOM: Enemy Unknown, you are waging war against an Alien Force invading Earth. You have to utilize limited resources to manage base construction, as well as scientific research and engineering projects to advance your team of soldiers into what is eventually a sophisticated military unit using hyper advanced technology.From time to time you are called upon to defend Earth from the invading Aliens, whether it be alien abductions in a major city or a UFO sighting. This is where the meat of the game is. You pick and choose soldiers who level up over time and assume roles like Sniper, Rocketeer or Medic, with permadeath mechanics involved.The game is really fantastic if you like turn based strategy games. There's a certain tense anxiety that comes from being pinned down by incredibly advanced, extremely dangerous aliens and hoping that one of your soldiers can pull of a shot that will shake up the situation and turn it into your favor. If you like the game, pick up the Enemy Within expansion as well, which is a comprehensive expansion pack that adds Mechs, Augmentations for soldiers and a new enemy faction.Shoutout to the Long War mod. If you feel like you've mastered the game, try Long War. It is a VERY expansive mod for XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM: Enemy Within. It adds enormous amounts of content as well as makes an already difficult game relentlessly and extremely difficult. In my opinion, the Long War mod completes this already very fantastic game.			"

												Um excelente jogo de estratégia que faz uma justa homenagem ao original dos anos 90 e atualiza a franquia com maestria.O jogo articula momentos de administração de recursos, pesquisa e construção com as missões, onde a ação estratégica se dá por turnos no combate a invasão alienígena. A mecânica é bem semelhante ao jogo original.Como pontos positivos da nova versão temos melhores gráficos e uma linha narrativa cinemática mais detalhada. Além disso a interface é um pouco mais fácil e auxilia o jogador iniciante.O jogo tem momentos bem difíceis, obrigando a fazer uso recorrente do save/load. Mas não chega a uma dificuldade impossível e frustrante da série original, que praticamente impede de chegar ao fim.Para os fãs de estratégia, recomendo!			"

												I never quite got into the original XCom as did others; I enjoyed the game but never to the point where I wanted to, say, write fanfic about it. It was a fun, but flawed, classic with as many good points as bad. Still, I was as excited as the next grognard when I heard that Firaxis was rebooting the series. My opinion of this newest title, however, is similar to that of the original: it is a classic, albeit somewhat flawed, game. Despite the moans of many, I find the removal of action-points an acceptable compromise towards making the game more accessible and less tedious than the original. The game moves more quickly now, advancing to those memorable firefights at a more rapid pace. But the game feels suspiciously hollow, with numerous missing features. Customization is shallow, the maps and missions are repetitive, and the aliens feel toothless lacking the ability to assault the XCom base. These gaps seem purposeful, probably to be filled in with DLC. The end result is a game which offers an often memorable experience but not one which drags me back to play it more than once. "

												I played Enemy Unknown a few years back when it was part of PlayStation Plus's monthly offerings, but never got around to all the DLC. At some point apparently I picked up the game with all its DLC from a Humble Bundle or something, so I decided to play it all again. The two character additions, Zhang and Annette were fun little add-ons, and the entire EXALT/Progeny arcs were fairly entertaining. I guess if I had one major compliment towards the game, it would be that it does a bangup job making me care about my characters. By the end, I was again very deeply attached to my characters, remarkable since it was the second time I had played with these kind of blank, empty, controllable soldiers! In fact, I think I felt more attached to this randomly generated crew than I felt towards many ""actual"" characters in recent similar games turn-based titles. Conversely though, if I had to pick something negative about the game to harp on, it would be that the story backdrop, supporting ""characters"" and the writing attached to both aspects is pretty much poop. They're not offensively bad, and they don't really take away from the experience, but they're definitely poop inasmuch as it's a pretty trite alien invasion story. Hopefully when I get around to finishing XCOM 2 this fall, I'll get to see an improvement all around!			"

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown places you as commander of a project dedicated to stopping the overwhelming alien menace flooding Earth in 2015. It is an excellent strategy game, in that you must effectively manage limited resources to build your underground base, launch satellites to protect member countries, and research technology projects. This management extends to limited troop assets in the field who must protect one another, save civilians, and take down increasingly challenging and well-equipped enemies. My favorite feature is the balance between third-person bird's eye view in the field, and over-the-shoulder and cinematic close-ups for critical hits, psionic attacks, and 'dash' movements.			"

												Rebirth of a popular back in the day tactical action game, involving Alien invasions on earth. Great looking top down, turn based, Alien repellent. Earth is once again invaded by Aliens, and you are given the chance to fight and eliminate them. Research different technologies from killed Aliens, construct weapons, tools and armor to aid your troops in combat. Level your troops and equip them with gear, build and expand your underground base, and stop the invasion. Take part in missions all over the globe to combat Alien invaders, in challenging turn based tactical combat. Great quantity of Alien enemy, weapons, armor and maps available. Game has good visuals, story, voice acting and animations, is a challenging experience even on easy. A bit of a downside that you can't co-op it with your friends vs. the Aliens.			"

												Firaxis stayed true to the original XCOM formula. The result is an old-school turned based tactics game that uses new tech and gameplay features only to enhance the XCOM feel rather than diminish it.This game is very challenging and the aliens are always upping the stakes throwing bigger and better stuff at you while you stuggle to keep up in tech and resources. This plateaus off though near the end game but you'll still run into missions that are hard even then.One of the best improvements is that soldiers can rank up and have classes and perks. This is a simple way to make each of your guys unique and have a role in the squad.A few downsides are that you only have one base and the game ends somewhat abruptly after the last mission. Interceptors don't matter very much but is it cool when they do shoot down a UFO like they are supposed to.This game is very fun and I'm glad as hell they didn't dumb this down for casual gamers or the console crowd.

												Approaching this as someone who still places X-Com: UFO Defense in his top 5 O.A.T., I was rather skeptical.  Especially after the debacle of the demo version; suddenly I worried that they'd completely missed the point (despite all their boasting about how they totally nailed it) and created something that felt more like Mass Effect 2 than X-Com.  It's true, there are some modern vidcon clichés that bother me, and there are times where the course of events feels a bit too railroaded compared to the more ""organic"" development of progress in the original game.  At the same time, to view the game from another angle, when was the last time I enjoyed a tactical combat game this much?  Front Mission 3, maybe?  While at first I stubbornly resented the absence of a larger, more generally versatile squad, I came to realize that the class-based tactics are not only what set this game apart, but what really make it shine and furthermore what make it a sequel/remake thing actually worth playing.

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is the latest in a series of strategy games about an invading Alien force. The game is quite fun and one of the best strategy games I've played in a while. There is a turn-based strategy element to it. You and the aliens take turns issuing orders to your squad. Inbetween missions, you do some strategy on a wider scale. You make some choices about facilities and skills your soldiers take. Some of these choices can be difficult to make because there is no chance to change them down the road. Overall, very fun. It is nice to finally see a real expansion instead of just a bunch of DLC like the rest of the industry. I'm not sure the expansion is worth the $30 they are currently charging for it, but it looks like it has a good amount of content and I think it will be worth it at around $5.I'd recommend picking this up for less than $10.I will update this review to be more in-depth at a later time.

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a shining example of how a series can be freshened up, but still be as good as the classics. Many games have changed their core principles in order to earn an extra buck with a different audience, but XCOM keeps it real.The XCOM games have always delivered a unique experience where players manage resources outside of the battlefield, but also successfully carry out demanding missions on the ground. These situations keep you invovled, and you are always struggling to fight the imminent apocalypse. Keeping track of your pool of soldiers, the amount of money you have, ongoing research and development projects, panic levels, and aircraft never gets old.While XCOM has a fantastic turn-based strategy system for the actual combat, just as much of the strategy is in keeping the XCOM Project funded by different nations throughout the world; Put one nation's needs above another, and you'll be losing their support. In addition to that, you have the ability to increase the resources gathered monthly by launching satellites above certain nations. You protect these satellites with the aircraft you keep in the hangar, which can be equipped with a variety of weapons. The game does have it's shortcomings, however. Enemies may randomly spawn during a mission, and I'm left wondering about some of their design choices. For example, the unmanned weapons platform that can replace a soldier in your squad is criminally inaccurate, and it lacks the ability to use cover. The UFO vs. XCOM aircraft system is weak, and the skill tree decisions you make when a soldier is promoted are generally unbalanced, making one choice better than the other. In the end, XCOM delivers a great turn-based strategy experience on the field and  strong-yet-flawed project management off the field.			"

												It's very rare I recommend triple A games, I simply don't think they need my voice to add to their profits. However firaxis have done the impossible and taken a much loved nostalgia riddled game and brought it into 2012. This game has almost completely evolved and built on what the original was while only trimming away unnessecary quirks and baggage. Something that every previous attempt at an X-COM sequel has failed to do. (And there have been quite a few). Your units will live and die by your tactics and stratagy, this game brutely punishes carelessness. The games Ai is smart enough to flank and fallback on harder difficulties.Almost completely evolved yes, but sadly not quite. The alien movements within the geoscape is a static scripted system. Which is a far cry from the originals aggressive AI that would attempt to win the game from you by expanding and performing missions to gain presence and power within the world.There are clearly defined points in the game where if you do not choose to progress. The aliens cannot win, they are frozen and must await your completion of key missions before the AI and script will advance to the next stage.This has a profound effect on replayability. Because of the lack of unpredictability in alien movements on the world map. Every playthrough runs through exactly the same script. But worse than this, is the fact that with a little thought you can easily make the game unlosable, regardless of the difficulty setting.A great tactics game sadly hampered by the scripted plot and alien geoscape scripting.

												I'd like to start off by telling you that i'm not used to writing reviews of games. I try my ""best"" to be sceptical of phenomenons in the gaming space, and not to buy in to the hype all too often. 2012's XCOM: Enemy Unknown appeared on many gaming sites top 5, and i dare say, even more often it ended up as their Game of the Year.If there's just an ounce in you, that enjoys the feeling of outsmarting things, whether it's an computer controlled AI, or another person (Even though i personally think the Multiplayer is somewhat undercooked in regards to singleplayer), you owe it to yourself to check out this game. I think it's pretty safe to say, that if you enjoy Firaxis other titles such as Civilization for instance, there is a pretty good chance you'll enjoy this aswell, but it doesn't have to be that way either. I've played it around 40 hours, and just with Civilization, i find the main issue with the game being that life takes too much time away from playing it.The difficulty levels in this game are good enough to encourage anybody to give this game a try, but fret not, hardcore players, as the Ironman mode coupled with the Impossible difficulty will leave you challenged to say the least.If this is the first&/last review i ever write, then i'll still be pretty satisfied, because this game really is a fantastic one, and i can only hope i've convinced one of you to give it a shot.

												XCOM: Enemy Unknown does a brilliant job of updating the classic X-COM franchise and bringing it into the 21st century, streamlining various processes for an easier-to-grasp challenge without losing complexity or depth. The game appears simple at first but, as you whittle the hours away, upgrading your base and purchasing upgrades, the game steadily grows in challenge. Unless you're playing on some of the higher difficulties (which the game itself notes are completely unfair), the game's challenge is always fair, and any mistakes you make are almost certainly your own - with some occasional missteps from the game's pathfinding and unruly glitches sometimes souring the experience.Even with the missteps, however, Enemy Unknown remains a great game, with addicting pace, fun gameplay, and fair difficulty.

												Only bad part about this game, is that once aliens or ""humans"" are detected, they get a free move to get to cover.But that only occurs once, per unit.This game is very close to the original game, although you can't pick up individual weapons from the battlefield, nor can you have more than eight people out on the ground at once.In X-COM: Apocalypse, You could have as many squards you wanted. With a max of seven or eight squards per mission. If I remember right, each squard could have six or eight soldiers each.However, I still hightly recommend XCOM: Enemy Uknown, with XCOM: Enemy Within added ontop of it.It's a great and unique experience.8.9/10If you want to have a quick look at the game before you spend money on it you can see gameplay of the game at the following link:

												Enemy Unknown has its flaws and suffers from a tiny bit of ""consolization"" in terms of scope, depth, and interface, but it's still quite an accomplishment. After years and years of disasterous attempts to bring the X-com game style back into the limelight, this is most definitely the most successful. Though I personally don't think all of the changes to the original formula were good ones, XCOM stands on its own as a great game on its own merits.Enemy Within gets an even higher recommendation from me! It's a glorious example of Fraxis' ability to make ""classic"" expansion packs, while everyone else is lost in a sea of DLC. Instead of adding another world or story or anything, Enemy Within just makes the game more... everything. The additional game mechanics serve to further set it apart from any pre-established formula, while the rest is simply hundreds of little details that desperately needed a boost, such as map variety (the maps are numerous enough now that their presculpted nature is actually a joy), equipment variety (the game puts more ""toys"" in to give a better feeling of choice and playstyle), and soldier personalization (both in terms of abilities and appearance). My favorite thing of all, though, is a simple option (that I highly recommend!) at the beginning of the game which allows you to randomize the available abilities characters get to choose from. This is AWESOME and they clearly put a lot of thought into making it balanced, allowing interesting combinations without giving game-breaking overpowered situations or taking away vital skills that define the class types. It really gives each character more personality as you begin to use them for what you know they can do, not just their class types, and you don't need to rank a soldier up very far to begin defining a unique role. A few example of this that I've done, all with characters with only four or five abilities:- A sniper who gets massive bonuses if she's on a rooftop and has supressive fire abilites- A heavy weapons guy who acts as my team's best medic (usually a support role)- A grenadier support character who can carry multiple, more powerful grenades in addition to extra smoke grenadesSo, overall, I'd recommend the game! But now that Enemy Within is out, I can't imagine wanting to play without it.			"

												Almost punishingly challenging at higher difficulties, it's a turn based progressive strategy game. It's not perfect, for instance the voice acting seems intentionally bad at points. I loved it anyway, I think I put 4 full play throughs in. I do suggest starting at normal difficulty and learning the basics before trying at higher difficulties. There is a lot more to the game than just the combat, including research and development expansion of your base and facilties as well as a small fleet of aircraft for intercepting bad guys in flight. It has some glitches but none of them are game breaking. There are some issues with certain indoor areas. They are usually fixable just by rotating the camera angle though.

												The most cruel Turn Based Strategy game I have ever played, but that's what makes it so good. The game throws difficult and dangerous missions at you constantly, and your soldiers are almost constantly in life or death situations. The odds are literally stacked against you, and the only way to win is smart strategy. You will fail many times, and have endure all the cruel and borderline unfair bull♥♥♥♥♥♥the game throws at you, but when you win, you really feel like you accomplished something. Think Dark Souls in a Turn Based Strategy form, or Fire Emblem.			"

												Easily one of the very best games in my collection, and one of the least expensive. As a guy who hates going through a game a second time, I am working towards the end of my second playthrough on classic iron-man and looking forward to my third one (on impossible, hopefully).The blend of micro- and macro-management is really fun and forces you to plan your funding strategies ahead (at least until you get full satellite coverage). The turn-based combat in itself is quite awesome, the action camera proving itself really immersive. Gameplay is both simple and ramified while the level design is well thought (while randomly generated). The entirety of the game is focused on making the fight for earth *your* fight for earth, and you can customize everything (even more with the dlcs) for your own enjoyment (and perhaps easier recognition of your soldiers while on mission).Understanding all the game mechanics can be hard at first and requires a lot of thought, but is well worth the time spent.Perhaps the only con I see for this game is the lack of real choice you have to make on the scenario. You can research all projects, complete the foundry, obtain full satellite coverage, have all your soldiers fully upgraded and geared all in the same playthrough. If I were to ask for an addition, it would be to force the player to make strategic choices (not only on what to research first, but on what to research at all), and challenges (why not adding some sort of automated earth defense system that you would have to deploy on earth, and the possibility to save countries that have left the X-COM project). XCOM : EW seems to deal in some way with this, I can't wait to buy it !Unlike most games, the challenges offered (classic/impossible mode, iron-man, and second wave options) are both challenging and not irritating. However higher difficulty modes are mostly based on modifying in-game values such as your soldier's base hp, costs of items/research projects... etc (even if the ai is slightly better) which basically force you to use overwatch more and be more cautious. I've yet to see a game showing additional mechanics and forcing the player to swap for totally different strategies on higher difficulty modes.In two words, GET IT !			"

												The is what modern tactics games should be. X-COM is fast and fun. Tactics by their very nature are slower games but that doesn't mean every aspect of the game should be slow (i.e. animations menu navigation etc).

												I love XCOM Enemy within/Enemy unknown combined!! Just look at how many reviewers (myself included) have wracked up over 100hours of gameplay… It’s a turn based game that requires you to use cover with a good variety of aliens, mission types, research choices and talent trees for each class of soldier.Plenty of reason to replay this game, whether you want to try the harder setting or want to finish up gathering steam achievements… the missions/maps are random each game (except main story)  and with the expansion you can decide whether you want to focus on more gene enchanced or Mech trooper robotic soldiers. PS one hint for this game: satelites!!! "

												A good followup to the 90s classic this is well worth the effort. The game really makes you feel part of the story and the characters you interact with are well formed and its satisfying when aliens that slaughtered your troops up front are blown away by the end. Warning a campaign to save the earth can take 30-40 hours and the storyline effectively repeats for each playthrough so its not a game for those with big backlogs, nor is it a great game for those who like surprises in each replay (ala Civilization V, Europa Universalis).

												One of the best and most addicting games ever made in my opinion. I have never grown so attached to characters in a game, yet the characters have absolutely zero personality. I am ridiculously happy I preordered the game so I can personalize them a bit, but the game basically lets you write your own story for the characters using your imagination. Want to cause your boss to get eviscerated by a six-foot tall bug with spikes for hands, causing him to turn into a zombie before giving birth to yet another six-foot tall bug with spikes for hands? Well now you can.			"

												Slow, strategic, and a proper challenge.If you dont like this game, you dont like turn-based games. (If you dont like turn based games, you may still like this).Be aware of some bugs, but a single playthrough on lower difficulty with ironman turned off (you'll need one of these to get familiar with the game anyway) should teach you to avoid the very few that actually hurt, and the others are simply graphical at this point (rather impressively bent gunbarrels being a highlight).Also note that at this point, the game has some good fun multiplayer, but this is crippled when playing with people you dont know by a set of horribly exploitable setups and multiplayer-only bugs.

												XCOM! I actually forgot I had this! Well Ill keep it short for you. Do you like chess? The strategy of planning each move? The brain power it takes to anticipate your opponent's every step? Well if you do, then welcome to XCOM. The closest thing XCOM has to chess is the intense, turn-based style of waiting. Yes, I know, ""Waiting? That sounds HARDCORE!"" Well your right! Between the 3-4 animations that loop for each person and alien, you, the gamer, get to experience HOURS of ""Edge of your seat"" action.Next theres the strategy! The worst part of turn based strategy games (As everyone knows) is figuring out how your enemies will react to your movement. XCOM takes that annoyance away from you. Half way through an operation they will just drop aliens literally anywhere. Thus removing the hassle of trying to use tactics to kill your opponents. So XCOM has obviously revolutionised Turn based strategy games. Obviously 10/10.			"

												SO GOOD!...SO TERRIBLE! SO FRUSTRATING! The thing about Xcom is that the mechanics themselves are fantastic, they really are. The turn based squad strategy is fun, the overall research/building strategy is fine. The problem lies only in two elements: 1. Difficulty settings. 2. Random Number Generators. Let it be said, if you're fairly casual with strategy and you play this game casually on ""normal"" setting, the game is absolutely fine. No problems there. This review is not for you then, just ignore. That's just not for me. I recommend the game on this basis, that it works fine on normal and that the basic mechanics are well done. If you're very serious about strategy, you'll almost certainly find ""Normal"" difficulty too easy and ""Classic"" fitting in general (at least if you're only planning one playthrough). Sounds great, right? Could have been except for one thing: the variance on Classic. Everything is a roll of the dice, which is fine, but the variance is insane. You can do everything right and still lose the game in one brief moment of bad luck. I'll illustrate the problem with this one scenario that actually took place for me: Turn 1. Your squad arrives in the woods. You move them into defensive positions just in case you're being charged right off the bat. They're all in cover, they're all in Overwatch (guarding). Three aliens attack, the squad takes down the first one. The second one uses a skill that automatically deals 1 damage, it hits one guy. *BREAK* Let me here say that one damage is nothing, it really is nothing. So, the guy who got hit with the whopping 1 damage rolls a dice and panics. He panics by turning to his right and trying to execute his friend standing right next to him because... well, who knows. It's the standard panic reaction in this game. He rolls another dice and misses from point blank range. Just can't hit. Well, fine you think, but alas. Behind him is a seasoned veteran, a captain who has seen many battles. He rolls a dice too, he also panics. Now, he has taken 0 damage, he has merely seen one dude take one damage. Well, he handles panic in the same way and decides to execute one of his friends. He chooses your best solider (and medic) and nails her right in the back of the head with a critical hit, killing her instantly. End turn one. Turn 2. Bring up menu, quit game. Things like this just happen, they just do. You can restart the mission whenever they do, but it wears you out. Or it did with me. Worst thing is, they could fix everything wrong with this game so easily. 1. rebalance panic. 2. remove critical hits. Just those two things would limit the variance to a degree where the game would feel hard but fair. It's really all they needed to do and then the game would probably be a 10.			"

												This is not your dad's XCOM. A typically slick Firaxis entry, this is a re-imagining of the original that takes the bulk of the source and transports it into a sleek, cruel, narrative-led shell. The principles of XCOM are all here with some additions, subtractions and lot of careful streamlining. While some stand-out elements are missing (goodbye fully destructible environments), a lot of the things you would expect to miss are shown up as unpleasant memories that make the forefathers difficult to return to (weight-based equipment management, I'm looking at you!). It's a polished, shiny, occasionally eerie version of an old treasure that does everything it can to entice newcomers while somehow keeping the vast majority of the grognards happy as well. Only a few games genuinely earn a $30+ price tag, but I would not hesitate to recommend this at any time, let alone during a sale.			"

												So, this is my first time playing an XCOM game. I thought I'd give myself a challenge and try an Iron Man game on Classic difficulty. And a challenge I got! This game is brutal!Enjoying it thoroughly though. I think at 24 hours I've already got my money's worth, and I'm sure I'll be spending a lot more time with it in the future.*EDIT after 150 hours*Finally completed the game on Classic mode. After over a dozen of restarts and letting go of the Ironman requirement I'd set for myself...My overall opinion of the game hasn't changed much. Both the tactical- and strategy-layers are engaging and play very well.I do have some criticism as well though: I don't like the difficulty progression in this game. It starts out extremely hard. Your soldiers have paper-armour and pee-shooters for weapons. While the aliens you face use highly accurate plasma weapons. But you can catch up with the aliens fairly quickly and the game gets easier from there on out.In the last few missions my squad was completely overpowered. Most aliens didn't even get a shot off before I killed them...Still, I am looking forward to playing the game again. And this time I WILL beat Ironman!			"

												(played on the xbox. Just have this game so excuse the play time)The story of the Xcom. A commitee by the worlds leading powers to stop the alien Invasion.We started so young.After our groups first mission went off without a hitch. gunned down the sectoids. and won the mission. Cue Several Missions of success. One normal downed UFO mission. We thought that was all it was. A normal mission. My squad consisted of Jana ""Strobe"" Becker the heavy, She was a killing Machine, Never letting the alien of the hour getting away from the Contact point. She played Suppresion and covering fire. She was one of our best operatives.We had Amadi ""Road Block"" Manana. He was Flanking and Assualt. His nickname was acuurate. He almost never missed. You could rely on him.Both armed with Frag Grenades and body armor. They didnt need anything else.We had two snipers, That was all we needed. Daniel ""Snake eyes"" Lynch and Kaito ""Stalker"" Yamazaki.We had the best team XCOM could buy. We were unstoppable.Lynch was relativley new. only 5 missions under his belt while Kaito and the rest of the team had ten to 11 missions. We were sent to A downed large UFO aircraft. We dispersed, did our thing until we wandered right into an ambush, We had our two heavy's take point and suddenly a muton walked through the door. We all went for cover. Lynch and Kaito went  back behind cover .Amati ended up behind the Muton, facing the rest. Amati fired. hit for 4 damage. Jana fired as well. Missed. Muton went for Jana, Between the damage she took from the mission and random chance. She was killed. Amati Panacked. Lynch and Kaito went for the kill. Lynch hit for 2 damage and Kaito missed. Amati was panacked. Who wouldnt be. He fired and hit Kaito. Critical hit. Kaito had two health. Muton hit and killed Amati, Kaito was injured badly. Lynch fired and killed the muton. Sergeant Lynch has been promoted! Kaito passed his turn. A floater dropped down from the sky. Right in the line of sight from Kaito. Kaito didn't have a chance. Lynch could see him. He took aim. 37% chance  24% Critical.			"

												10/10 for giving me yet another addiction..I got this one via some Free Steam Game deal and this one has that click that hooks you into the game.Sure as always and with every game, there  are some pros and cons but I'm seriously considering getting the DLC's for this one. However as recent discussions about DLC's is flaring up again waiting for a sale never hurts :)It would be weird to say it's worth every penny but it sort of does because the few cons there are, are easily overlooked and not really game breaking anyway. I'll mention the biggest one and all players know (and admit this) is the serious mouse acceleration during an aiming function, i.e. throwing grenades. Weird that this problem still exists after 2yrs but it's there.So if you can get it as a wholesale deal like below you won't regret it.Personally I like the Bureau idea but it feels a bit off to me so I'll hold off on that one..But come Winter Sale, Enemy Within will be mine too :-)			"

												Prepare to tighten the seatbelt on your car, because this game gives you a wildride, each and every decision in this game can put you one step from losing the game, ♥♥♥♥ing your soldiers up, losing countries (and losing), leave you unprepared for consequences, and totally regret why you didn't see a few things out before hand. This game is brutal and has a big learning curve, and you know what?I love it.You're the Commander of the Xtraterrestrial COMbat Unit, other wise known as X-COM for short, a multinational organization which composes itself of the finest soldiers, pilots, tacticians, scientists, and engineers that money can buy. You must mange your resources like in an actual war, and make decisions on what to do, whether to keep your countries and funding on your side, or to have your soldiers survive. My first playthrough ultimately ended up in losing Canada and caused me to go about at a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ standstill wondering what I should do because I'm too low on funds at the moment to ultimately gather anyone their satellites.As I said, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing brutal, and if you want a challenge on a play-by-play basis for turn-based combat and frustrating 90% hit misses? This game is for you. Play it Classic and do it good.			"

												A brilliant re-make of one of the greatest strategy games of all time.  The game has two main parts,  the base/resource management mode and a very intense turn-based combat mode.   The latter of the two is what really makes this game shine.You start the game with your base, and world view where you will manage your units, weapons, facilities and resources.  You search the globe for the alien threat.   This part of the game falls a bit short and can become a bit monotonous.  XCOM truly shines when you locate some aliens and send your team out to clear the site.The turn based combat is spot on, with a few minor tweaks to the original gameplay, although it still captures same the nail-biting intesity.   Your soldiers start out pretty weak, but will level up and accquire more powerful weapons as they complete more missions.  The game has 'permadeath' for your soldiers, so it really hurts when they are lost.Can you rid the world of the aliens?I give this a 97% on the Yeti scale.			"

												I would definitely recommend this to family and friends; hell, even to peeps I don't even know LOL.  This a wonderfully thought out arena of adventure and game play.  The delivery of smooth texturing while threading the huge amount of graphics memory needed for a gaming arena of this size speaks well of the engine and software engineers.  ALL the wonderful people involved with making the XCOM franchise are the epitomy of turn-based tactical strategy gaming staff.  I truly enjoy not looking at a ""honeycomb"" floorboard that detracts from the environmental ambience of the game.  It is through dedication of people like this that will make the future of gaming a frigging BALLYHOO!  How do I know you ask...because I've been gaming since the mid 70s and I plan on numerous more years of gaming with all of you.  BUY IT, PLAY IT and get XCOM 2!			"

												This game is HARD.This is most definitely not a complaint. I rarely get through a mission without losing a soldier, and it means something every time. This is my first experience with XCOM, having never played the older games, and I feel like I've been missing out this whole time. Perfectly mixes Tactical play and action, and I've put more consecutive hours into it than I have into any game in the past year. Pick it up in the sale if you can, hell, pick it up full price if you're reading this out of a sale time. Best value for money I've found for a game in ages.			"

												XCOM has proven to be one of the freshest, and most challenging games I've played in recent memory. Being a huge fan of grid-based tactical combat games, this particular title oozes with a classic feel, while still offering new gameplay mechanics and a modern graphical facelift. While the game isn't necessarily the most original (mankind must stop oncoming alien threat to save the Earth from certain destruction), it handles its subject matter with a pretty large level of depth, pages upon pages of information on each successful research project embarked upon, or every alien autopsy completed. The permadeath factor is unnerving and really keeps you on edge, where a single mistake can mean the life or death of one of your best soldiers. This constant threat keeps you from ever feeling like you're unstoppable on the battlefield, a prize I feel that far too many games give out freely. You earn your success in this game, and you'll find yourself patting yourself on the back after every successful operation. Fans of games like Fire Emblem and Advance Wars, be sure to pick this up for one hell of a great time. It's time to show those aliens who's boss, like Will Smith in Independence Day: Welcome ta Erff.			"

There's also no way to tell what the dev updates do, no log showing what has changed or why.I have my game properties set to ""do not automatically update"" but am not allowed to run the game via Steam without updating first.STOP  FORCING US TO UPDATE THESE OLD GAMES!

Every time I try to play the game (single player) I wind up with first wonky camera sliding around the screen and then excessive camera shake.

The game isn't fussy, it will tear you to shreds and implant alien eggs in your body, if you don't use the lumping head of yours. Playing tip: give your units funny/interesting names. it's always good to have a Master Chief or a Mother ""Psycho"" Russia  in your team. I also suggest the DLC Packs, if you are a fan of nice looking sci-fi suits and as long as they are reduced.			"

												This is truly one beast of a game. I'm not a big fan of strategy game in general but I felt in love with it weither it was for his gameplay or for the feeling it gave me.I saw my soldiers grow under my command, getting throught the toughest of situation, getting the newest weapon and armor I could give them. You feel attached to those man and woman as they risk their life to fight the invasion, you do what you can to not let them die, even if it can most of the time happen. As a exemple, my best three soldier was there from the beginning to the end, they always leaded the rest of the squad as a group while they helped each other on the front line. They were  brothers in arms and nothing could separ them. And what was my surprise when I later discovered in the game they were all gifted, making them the best soldier of my entir army. Those virtual soldier made me proud throught every mission and made me cry at the sacrifice of the end.If there is any game I would truly recommand it's this game. So go ahead and give it a try, it'll worth your money.			"

Works your brain as well, you can't run in with guns blazing unless you'd like to lose your whole squad.  Strategy is key, which perhaps explains why I enjoy it so much.  The whole violently dismembering aliens during autopsies doesn't hurt either.  Team Vahlen!			"

												Alien base. Sectoid commander has taken over one of my best heavies, who has close range on several of my soldiers, most of whom are wounded. I don't want to put her down.A Cyber Disk has reared it's head. My second assualt is bleeding out several rooms back, so I only have two turns to end this. My sniper, Mabuza, hanging back with one health, can't draw bead on the mind controller.My other heavy leaps off the balcony to get a line of sight on him, and Mabuza plugs him right in the noggin, saving at least two lives, for her seventh kill of the day. Just glorious.I like to think that last thing that went through that Sectoid Commanders head, other than laser beam, was to wonder how the hell a bunch of monkeys ever got the best of him.Good job team.

												A very fun and addicitng game that is actually quite challenging and unforgivable of your mistakes. You have to manage your team well as well as your financial health. Making hard decisions and prioritizing your goals are all part of the challenge. I had quite an enjoyable time playing this game. The only negative things I say about this game is the controls and camera angles/views are quite wonky at times, especially when there's a building with more than one floor. Another thing to note is that this game is not really a story-driven game so don't expect a strong, in-depth plot. Otherwise, this is a stellar sci-fi based strategy game! * This game has grown on me. It is MY favourite game!*Remember, we will be watching!			"

												If you are a kid this game will make you a man.Every decision you make in the battlefield will have consequences and most of the time deadly.You may start with a full equiped squad and seconds later find yourself left with only one alive,because you were flanked or mispotitioned and now you have to fight with what is left like a real soldier you have to readjust your strategy constantly.Tension is amazing in this game and consider that i never liked squad based games.Pros -Battles with real tension-Maybe the best artificial inteligence i have seen in any video game-If you don't use tactics you are dead-Great visuals and sounds accompanied with amazing physics-Even though story is almost non existent you will be quite eager to learn more about this unknown enemy as the game progresses-Gameplay is solid and addicting-Very nice set of upgrades and base management-Very challenging and unforgiving but never frustrative-Lots of maps and each one is well designed-One mistake in the battlefield and the odds can turn against you which makes every encounter awesomeCons-Camera issues-Poor soldier progresion system-Repetitive objectives-<90% missed> shots happen way too frequently-Poor tutorialOverall 9.5/10 a true masterpiece!

												I bought the XCOM Complete Package on Summer Sale and I would have definitely paid full price for this awesome game. I really liked Civilization V and come from an RPG/Strategy/Turn-based games background mostly. If you have a thing for Aliens, military infiltration games and simulators you will love XCOM.My first experience was playing Enemy Within directly, which adds several elements that make this game even more wonderful and I can't think of living without them in my gameplay so I advice you do the same.I've spent quite some nights developing my XCOM HQ, building facilities, upgrading weapons, aircrafts, soldiers, slaining aliens and overall getting the grip of intelligent positioning and careful selection of the units I take to each mission.I don't think I know anyone that regrets their XCOM experience and I don't think you will, just be prepared to hand over your life to 2K one turn at a time.Still... one thing to have in mind. There are some bugs on the tutorial which, if your particullarly affected like I was, will not let you go further in the game, so try playing it, understaing the initial bits of the story and how-to's and if you get to the point in which it's bugged, just disable tutorials and start over, you won't really need it.

												XCOM: Enemy unknown is a turn based strategy game that puts you and your soldiers up against aliens of various types.  you start off with basic soldiers that you would expect to see today and through reverse engineering alien tech you get better weapons, armor, and more.the game has strategy outside the combat as well as you must build your base, shoot down UFO's and keep countries happy or they will withdrawl from the Xcom project.graphically the game is good  and  I enjoy the sound design and dialog though  the sound effects eventually do get repetitive.the story is pretty good but feels like it ends a bit abruptly.  there are many strategies  to win as there are different classes of soldier.overall the game is enjoyable. is it worth $60? only if you are a turn based strategy fan as you will probably get multiple playthroughs out of it but even novice players should pick it up for under $5-$10 as the stoy can last 10 hours.

												If you don't own this already, there's something wrong with you. But don't worry. It's on sale right now so you can repent for your gaming sins.You might as well pre-order the Enemy Within DLC while you're at it.If you're not familiar with XCom... it was a game released back when I was a babby. It was really buggy and impossibly hard yet incredibly good fun, an intriguing mix of turn-based strategy and financial management.Aliens are here and they're not gonna sit around and let filthy, smelly humans wander around unmolested.Good news! The nations of the world are willing to fund the XCom project, a military outfit headed by you to counter the alien threat.Bad news! The aliens have plasma weaponry and humans are squishy.In the same style as the original, humanity starts at a major disadvantage. It's up to you to throw dispensable jarheads at the aliens 'til humanity can invent technology capable of stopping them... and then, you know, figure out how to turn the tables and stop them murderizing everyone.The standard difficulty is difficult enough that you're gonna die within a month until you get to grips with it. Then it's still pretty dámn difficult. Of course, if you want a challenge you can opt for classic difficulty to make it as hard as the original. And then there's impossible mode. Like you're ever gonna finish it on classic.Anyways. One of the best games ever with plenty of replay value. But of course, you already own it, 'cos you're a true gaming badáss, right?

												3 Playthroughs ive gone through. So many tears, over the fallen, so much mourning, Its like a Game of Thrones, that you play with your own children, whom you helped develope. You offer them the best armor, Weapons, and gadgets that you could afford Only to see your son/Daughter get their life taken away by that god damn Thin Man.. Curse them... you scream.. as you realised that no matter how hard you try they will never come back... all that time you spent nurturing them was all for not. (Spoiler)It was the Final Mission assault on The Temple Ship, my Six Soldiers were ready, A support Named CJ, A Support Named Texas Tan(Had to put myself in to feel the game truly), A Heavy named Taylor , A Sniper named Robert, A Support Named Kola, and assault named Ben. All of them Battle Harden, of the 6 half of them were Psionic, Robert, Tayor, and Kola. I fitted them with the best gear that I had to offer, They went in to the mission like any other, assuming their kill count would signifigantly raise. They battled the many enemies that the Temple Ship had to offer, upon reaching the Final Room where the Supreme Etheral floated, I had the feeling in my gut this wasnt to be a easy battle, the battle began with 2 dead Muton Elites, being shot in the head by Robert, with a double tap skill. then came the minor Etherals taking over Ben's and Kola's Minds, both had succumbed to the dark powers of the etheral only to fire apon their own brothers, critically wounding Texas and CJ, It was the last choice I had either kill CJ and Myself, or Kill the Supreme Etheral, i took the shot and killed the Etheral but without knowledge, the cutscene came and Robert Gave his Life to save The Earth, but when the cutscene was in action it still had Me and Cj Critcally wounded on the ship with robert thus ending the lives of half the squad on the Temple Ship. After that gameplay I realised that This game took me through so many turns and twist, you never really have every little plan down to the detail produced visibly. Id like to say 100/10, mainly cause this game had it all, the terrible chance that you could miss the 99% shot, or make a 5% shot, the times where your newly recruited squaddies decide to blow a hole through your medic's Head out of sheer panic. the cutscenes that made you either crap your pants out of fear of loosing a soldier or a new type fo alien in which you slowly begin to hate and overwhelmingly hate further. 10/10.

I hear the DLC adds a lot to this but I haven't played it yet.I still really wish they'd improve the autopsies though and show more on the alien biology like they did in the very first game!

												This is a very good game that is faithful to the original in terms of the original's positive aspects and aspirations, but actually manages to change a lot more than initially meets the eye. This is also a hard game, and you may want to tone down the difficulty until you get the hang of things. Replay value is better than one might think, but it is not the game's strong suit. Thus, unless you loved the original games, you may not want to pay full price. As I loved the orininals, I have no regrets paying full price.			"

												Having fond memories of the original classic I can only say this remake does the original justice. I was a little dubious to begin with thinking no re-make (and a few have been attempted the ""UFO trilogy"") would stand up to the original. Aspects such as squad creation and progression down to tech research and engineering all are standard formats most people know, but crafted alongside a great alien invasion story and turn based tactics I would say its a must buy for anyone into strategy games with RPG elements. For those who recall the original and are wondering what is missing, main aspects are multiple base creation, allocating equipment Deus Ex style alongside more specific equipment slots. Also aspects such as squad members becoming more accurate with certain weapons the more they used them to a standard aim ability, and a limit to high ranking soldiers based on the number of soldiers you had in anyone base. But overall these are minor issues compared to new aspects of the game not in the original. I hope this review has been of some help to gamers out there!			"

Yet underpinned by a realtime storymode which is arguably more difficult than the missions themselves. Classic and Impossible difficulties are relatively unenjoyable given the random and unfair disadvantage you are put at, but easy and normal are the most fun you can have with your pants on.

												This should be the model for all remakes and reboots. Firaxis’ X-Com is attractive, easy to learn but still challenging, and keeps the elements that made the original memorable (destructible environments, Chryssalids, mountains of rookie corpses, etc).I highly recommend it. "

												Unlike the previous games it feels abit more hand holding but that is because this is very story based, most missions have some related cut scene or research potential etc.If you even vaguely like the previous game, you'll love this!			"

												Xcom is widely known to be an exceptional game.I would agree absolutely with that general concensus that this is a really decent tactical strategy game.  I can almost see what this is based on and where it has come from.  This version too exhibits some really nice additions which allows me to say with absolute confidence that technology made this game better.  In saying that there are issues with this game's quality and its design, and irronically Firaxis are getting no better at making games that are flawless... and that is worth saying as these are integral parts of the game I can  see that don't work/don't give enough feedback/ or just are buggy as hell, and it doesn't feel like it will get fixed at all.The beauty of Xcom Enemy Unknown is that is has so many sides to it.  It is in everyway, like Divinity : Dragon Commander, where you manage your ship, build stuff, get reserach, monitor stuff, build more stuff  in between tactical battle mode.  This design is brilliant can offer so much depth I think, and Dragon Commander went a step further in many cases.  I will add that Xcom's implementation of that is no different and allows you to do all sorts, though from what I can see, if you dont get this stuff by a certain time in the game, the game seems to suffocate your operation... not sure about that exactly,  but it felt like I 'nearly' did and it cost me at some point throughout the game.  Whats more, as Dragon Commander's Political exploits are generally not required in your 10th game, alot of the stuff on here is not time draining and does NOT keep you from getting into what XCom is all about.  Combat.Combat is decent and has reasonable depth and certainly does not get overloaded with stuff.  Its seamless, nice to do and leaves you little to worry about in your decisions.  improvements of weapons are worth it, improvement of the skills of each soldier is worth it , and when you get to a stage in the game where some of you soldiers get 'extra skillls'?  It's definately worth it.  However when its late game and your waiting to 'get paid', battle mode does feel like a chore sometimes, it restricts progress.Each of the classes to some extent feel like they are worth using, though the best ones at the start feel weak at the end, and the weak classes at the start feel OP at the end.What adds to this is the camera system, when an order is made, the camera follows your soldier, or some cinematic view is taken.  This is not something I would comment as being essential, but as it doesn't break anything and it looks good, gives  the game a nicer feel, it defeintely is good overall and gives the game a nice sheen.Now what I don't like about Xcom: Firaxis, have had a few gmes I have played with certain bugs and broken functionality, Xcom is no different.  As amazing as Xcom looks, and runs, Firaxis clearly didn't get the engine right.. There is a serious issue with the selection of parts of the map that you are not looking at ... for example, I can be looking at the interior of a ship and then click inside to move, and the system will think I the roof tile (above)or lower floor(below), potentially screwing up tactics(yes which is the difference between something going horribly wrong!)and the game (Diablo Hardcore characters and poor connection come to mind, and yes you can play hardcore on this - no saves!). I guess there is a cure, if you are pretentous enough to challenge that assertion, as you will need to look carefully where the point is and where the path fidning trail is.  This generally means, you have to zoom out, rotate the view blah blah... all in all its a bit of BS.. waste of time and does takes from the game. This should not happen if you are not zoomed to another 'layer' in my oppinion, and I think that is just logical.  I think if Firaxis thought about this issue, then they could have included an undo move button function, but they didn't... There are other issues with seeing the range of your units and what they can attack as it is not clear at all what you can attack and what you can until you move that unit...Also as far as i can see, you cannot pick your squad, i.e. if I want to train up a bunch of noob soldiers instead of using vets , then I can't, it's simple... Well, I could of course make sure (the vets) all take mortal wounds last match so they are off in the infirmary nursing wounds, but nothing more from looks of it.  Then in addition to that, when they are removed from the squad without wounds, the equipment stays on the soldier... Sometimes those soldiers dont show up in the team for the next mission, so you have 1 soldier with no gear (perhaps returning from the infirmary)and another one in the barracks that you have to track down and strip of their gear, and you CAN'T switch them... makes for boring cheese and bad design if you ask me... and yes, some equiptment mid game is damn expensive, so it is important that this works!Science is a let down, like supcom2, once you researched everything, you have wasted money on labs and scientists are in-effect worthless, it is very dis-empowering, and as much as your squad is powerful enough and the rest is justifiably left up to you to be a good strategist, it still makes for something of an empty concept... Civ and Alpha Centurai had post science qualifications.. I think they could have added those in to make an intersting endgame of sorts, making science a worth while endeavour.The story was alright I guess and the game flows much like Unreal 3, so its not complicated, but its good, and the art design definately complements that with the idea of who the alien race really is and where your going.There are some bad parts to this game , and as many people will rave blindly with the 'horde', I feel its nesscessary to point out Xcom is NOT perfect.  However, as a game, I spent 50+ hours  on this and I could play it again.  It was generally fun to play, so I would say most of the hype is infact justified.I will add, that I would definately consider gettin Xcom 2 at near full price as I liked this one so much.			"

												I absolutely love this game. I could spend way more than a hundred hours on it and I probably will eventually.  The strategy feels real, the player is in complete control of his forces in the battlefield during intense battles. Throughout the game the player has the ability to choose his own preferred methods of upgrading his units. The more you play the easier it gets because you can use your research to jump past certain technologies allowing you to progress at your own speed. Making the game absolutely feel like the player has gotten his full moneysworth. The DLC Enemy Within is also worth buying because of the new mechanics and care added to the game. It's a little odd that the characters have their entire bodies replaced, but that is the way it works in this universe.			"

												XCOM:Enemy Unknown is one of my personal favorite games. The gameplay is diverse and impressive and you can find yourself immersed after playing the game for only a few hours. You will become emotionally invested in your squad and the people in it, and you'll try your hardest to help out as many people across the world as you can. Firaxis has managed to create a game almost infinitely replayable, and they've managed to create a game that you'll WANT to play an infinite amount of times. The graphics on this game are also very impressive, if your computer can handle them. Textures are very detailed and the sound design is top notch. Ambient noises, such as the aliens chilling sound effects, resonate as you try to take your unit safely across the map. In conclusion, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a must have game if you're a fan of the strategy genre. Even if you aren't, I recommend you buy this game just because it's so immersive and fun. 10/10			"

												Prepare to tighten the seatbelt on your car, because this game gives you a wildride, each and every decision in this game can put you one step from losing the game, ♥♥♥♥ing your soldiers up, losing countries (and losing), leave you unprepared for consequences, and totally regret why you didn't see a few things out before hand. This game is brutal and has a big learning curve, and you know what?I love it.You're the Commander of the Xtraterrestrial COMbat Unit, other wise known as X-COM for short, a multinational organization which composes itself of the finest soldiers, pilots, tacticians, scientists, and engineers that money can buy. You must mange your resources like in an actual war, and make decisions on what to do, whether to keep your countries and funding on your side, or to have your soldiers survive. My first playthrough ultimately ended up in losing Canada and caused me to go about at a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ standstill wondering what I should do because I'm too low on funds at the moment to ultimately gather anyone their satellites.As I said, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing brutal, and if you want a challenge on a play-by-play basis for turn-based combat and frustrating 90% hit misses? This game is for you. Play it Classic and do it good.			"

												XCOM is a very playable tactical combat game that rises to greatness because of its attention to detail. It perfectly nails the 1950’s mysterious alien invasion vibe while still being taken seriously. Very strong voice acting for the several key NPCs along with stellar music and ambient sound effects create a nearly palpable mood, both during missions and back at base.Graphical details also contribute to the believability of it all, with expertly crafted combat zones ranging from sunny forests to urban jungles. Then there’s the ant farm style headquarters that lets you build deep into the ground and zoom in to observe the fine details of your labs, workshops, and other facilities. You can even see your specific soldiers resting, training, or healing in the barracks.Gameplay wise, there’s two separate parts: strategic global management and tactical combat. First, on the management side, you have to build your base, launch satellites, and prepare yourself for attacks. This is all done through menus although the game wisely spruces things up with cutscenes and the graphical ant farm base, which both greatly reduce that “spreadsheet game” feel other games suffer from.In conclusion, XCOM is an atmospheric alien invasion simulator with decent strategic elements and very addictive combat. It truly is a great game partly because of the attention to detail and partly because of its uniqueness. It does get dragged down by its unexplained and unbalanced strategic side, arbitrary difficulty, and turn-based quirks. Still, if you are willing to put up with the frustration, XCOM may turn you into a mastermind of massive alien murder.The Good-Wonderfully detailed combat zones-Simple yet diverse combat-Very tense battle situations-Great close-up cameras during battle-Strong character and alien design-Immersive ant farm base design-Very atmospheric music and sound effects-Strong voice acting and dialogue from key NPCs-Lots of little stylistic touches everywhereThe Bad-Unexplained strategic mechanics-Ideal build prioritization limits freedom-Arbitrary difficulty-Questionable alien discovery system-Turn-based quirks-A bit too random in missions and rewards-Only a few mission types, locations repeat-Unfulfilling last mission and ending			"

												This has been one of the funnest games I've played over the last 5 years.  The turn based ""move and cover"" mechanics make the alien vs. elite soldier firefights full of potential strategy.  The various soldier classes add to the mix of complex possibilities of how to best play your 4 man squad on a mission.For a real challange, name all of your soldiers after people you know and love.  For heart break, play on hardcore mode so you can't reload previous save point.  Oh the anguish when you gamble rushing your assult spec'd wife through a doorway only to find an overwhelming force of aliens on the other side - knowing that as soon as you click ""end turn"" she's going to be taking a dirt nap for the rest of the game.  At least she will be remembered with a plaque on the wall of honor.			"

												XCOM enemy unknown is the best modern turn based strategy game. It has an excellent blend of base management and gritty tactical combat. It's a lethal game, where a tactical blunder means a dead squad member or a mismangement of resources leads to the loss of a country's support. XCOM starts off brutally difficult, with your soldiers clearly mismatched. However, as the game goes on, your soldier's training and equipment clearly outpaces the alien army. The disparity between your progression and the enemies makes the endgame start to drag, and the final battle is anticlimatic. XCOM enemy unknown (and I daresay it's essential expansion, enemy within) is a fantastic game that captivated me. It took me 3  days to complete the game the first time in 25 hours.
