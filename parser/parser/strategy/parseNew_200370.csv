												Buggy and unfinished.Good art style, but feels low quality and rushed.DLC available for a game that should be an alpha: It has clearly been designed as cash crop from day one.Developers/Publishers simply slapped on a 1.0 sticker and moved onto other projects.Bugs consisted of terrible pathfinding, graphical issues and many other issues. Clunky.Not really anything to do after an hour of two of gameplay: Literally no reason to play on.Dug into dungeon of mobs and got absolutely massacred, had a few warriors as well.This is not anywhere near a Dwarf Fortress 3D successor like I had hoped, nor will it clearly ever be, which is a shame as it had potential.

												My first impression of this game was very optimistic; its gameplay was somewhat different from most games, and the games that this one is likened to are only in 2D, making this very promising.However, after the first hour it became very apparent that this game was designed to be casual- no real resource management or needs/logistics to cover even the most sprawling of dwarven strongholds. Granted, the game IS in the casual genre, but a game like this has so much potential that it comes off as more of a half-baked idea than intentionally casual. This is evident in the lack of true challenges and very repetitive gameplay. So, avoiding the strategy genre because there is nothing challenging, I wouldnt count it as a building game either. The number of items available arent very many for a builders' game, and what's available is most likely useless decoration, which would have been fine if the game had direction, but because of the immense amount of time it takes to make one or two decorations, playing this just doesnt seem worth the effort. I was looking forward to this as an alternative to Towns, but I am disappointed to say that Towns is far more engaging and rewarding.			"

												I bought that game with no expectations at all. And that's probably what helped me enjoying it. In the end, I did enjoy it. I even went up to the end, which kind of took me some time. Of course, it is full of downs/cons, like, it's a casual game, it's quite bugged, it has huge slow downs when the map becomes huge and full of your constructions, it is not very deeply thought and programmed, the scenario is poor, the dialogues useless, blablabla, you could make a huge list of the bad stuff, as there are probably more of these than the good ones. HOWEVER. However. All in all, there is one huge aspect of that game that is so nice that in the end it becomes heavier or at least as heavy as the bad stuff in the balance used to rank this game: the exploration feeling and the construction features. And you know what? These two simple facts, no matter how bad all the other things are, made me feel closer than ever to the golden past of games like Dungeon Keeper, more than any other game did these past 20 years. So, if you understood the whole situation here, yes: I DO recommend this game.			"

												This game tries to scratch the itch dungeon keeper and dwarf fortress have long since stopped scratching for me. (hundreds of game hours can only do so much.)Unfortunately, where those other games are like a Velcro nose scratcher inside a spaceman's helmet, this is more of a damp sponge. You can try as hard as you want, it won't scratch.I only managed to stick with this game due to the mild amusement of designing a very simple dwarf base, but that gets old FAST; it was pure stubbornness after the first 3 levels. You don't have the challenge and satisfaction of making something like in dungeon keeper or dwarf fortress, and it's not much fun aesthetically because the near non-existent challenge the game does provide wrecks your design.The major problem with the game is how unfinished the final product is. The potential is definitely there, but it was rushed into final product for obvious financial reasons. Hence the cash grab DLC rushed quickly out.The biggest clue to this being an unfinished mess is the falling animation. When your dwarves tunnel into a large cavern, or are falling for some reason, they panic, fall one Z level, stop in mid air, Panic again, Fall another Z level; rinse, repeat till the bottom. Come on guys, didn't have time to fully program that one?The second clue is the half-hearted attempt at making your dwarves happy. You can decorate your entire dungeon with minerals you find, but this is purely aesthetic. Rough wooden walls and floors do the job just as well as Dragonite ore, the rarest mineral in the game. Come on devs, was the balancing too hard? Dwarf fortress had that coded!If we are talking balancing, the teleporting mechanic breaks the game so hard it physically hurt me sometimes with boredom. You can teleport your dwarves anywhere on the map you have visited, as many times as you'd like, and as fast as you'd like. Sure they TRIED to nerf it by only letting you do one dwarf at a time, and by having special fields you need to send your dwarves to destroy, but you can work around them easily, usually by tricking the stupid AI.If I send a dwarf tunneling into a unknown cavern, I should fear for his safety, or for the safety of my base, not watch bored with my hand on the teleport button to whisk him away from the slow moving enemies. (The combat AI is so bad they even take a second to spin and position in a North-south or West-East pattern before hitting each other.)I never had any fear for my main base while playing the game. You can stop intrusion by deleting a ladder. Enemies try to circumvent this by randomly teleporting around, but half the time they stood there stupidly. Depressingly, I never had the chance to use all the nifty traps they game had available for me. By the time you can afford the traps you already have the appropriately levels fighters, making them useless.I was REALLY angry at the half-coded ending to the game. Anti-climatic, with rushed animations; even the writing was half-hearted. Did they even expect anyone to get through the entire game?There are more problems, Terrible AI, bad animations, ETC; but this game has taken enough of my time already.I know some of you out there are desperate for easy to play games that scratch that itch I mentioned above, but don't come here. You will leave wanting, and with less money in your wallet.			"

												Best viewed as a sim dungeon, dwarven style. There's a campaign mode where dwarves seek to reclaim their land from evil magi, but it's pretty rudimentary (I like the Dwarves-Elves angle in the story though!). It does structure gameplay a bit on each level with preset elements and gives some bonus incentive to continue playing, however it's still rather sandboxy experience, in the end not differing all that much from actual ""custom mode"", which is pure sandbox without the preset storyline elements.Otherwise, if you want to treat it as a strategy game (real time with pause), you're going to be dissapointed. It's as if creators were aiming to make something like Dungeon Keeper but in full 3D (multiple levels of dungeon not just one), changing the tone from dark lord to sort of supposedly benevolent dwarves, perhaps being inspired by Dwarf Fortress, but in the end they realized they won't make it and dialed down difficulty a lot. It's very basic, no AI to speak of, no challenge, you can do everything at your own pace without being forced to discover (always marked) rooms with enemies until you feel ready. No enemies respawn or surprise you unless you dig your own grave unprepared. Many things feel unbalanced and purely aesthetic in nature (although aesthetics do have gameplay implications of keeping dwarves happy - the more you dig, the more decorative stuff you need for dwarves to feel at home). Early game on a new level is rather slow in terms of trying to push story forward/discover random enemy rooms, because you are too weak. And then, after a bit of building up, you're totally overpowered. Especially once you realize your ability to move stuff anywhere you want by your godly player powers is overpowered on its own.So yeah, as a sort of sandboxy doll house, err- dwarven dungeon, it can work pretty well. You dig around, gather resources, set up farm for food and wood (ultimate renewable resource that buys you everything), and possibly some shrooms for happiness (yeah.. but I usually just stick to wood for cash and get happiness otherwise :P), build some cozy place for your guys to live, occasionally fight baddies who won't be a problem at all after a bit of building up, push story forward. Can be somewhat slow, and there surely are better sim games, but the overall tone and setting here is pretty unique for such genre I think.Doesn't work at all as a strategy game, though. And if you want to be picky, animations are bit off, but otherwise looks are sort of cute.Bonus points for spelling ""dwarves"" properly (not ""dwarfs""). Malus points for broken achievements (one mission is broken and doesn't give you full influence, required for cheevos).Also take note there are silly in-game cosmetic microtransactions, but many are free and you can easily ignore the rest (of which only Ales DLC is separate on Steam and only gives you ale tree and kegs to increase dwarven happiness). Bigger DLC is Space Dwarves, which changes medieval tone to futuristic, but it only works in pure sandbox (aka custom) mode, not in the campaign mode. No idea about the Pets DLC.In the end, this title isn't very strong overall, but I still recommend it for its setting, however only to people who like to mess around sandbox/dollhouse style and maybe have some TV series to watch at the same time for slower moments or something xD			"

Posted: April 9, 2015
												I recently played through the campaign for A Game of Dwarves.  I'm giving it a thumbs up, but a qualified one.The GameThe game is something of a builder/manager game: you control a settlement of dwarves and guide them in both mining out the area around their settlement and building the things they need to be happy and do well. I really liked the potential of this game: I find it a fun thing to occupy myself with while watching TV or just winding down in the evening, and there is some challenge to it too — more than once I restarted a scenario to come at it from a better angle.Overall, I'd say it's a decent enough game when it's available at a reasonable price.  Less than $10 is certainly OK, but around $7 might be more appropriate.The ProblemsWhy would I want to knock the price down further?  Well, the game certainly has its flaws.  For one, while there are Steam achievements for the game, some simply cannot be earned because some of the levels won't give you full credit for completing them.  (Paradox knows about this bug but has said that, with developer Zeal no longer in existence, no further development will be done.)There are several other little problems that, while they are not game-breaking, can be annoying as well. Dwarves have problems climbing staircases, and sometimes repeatedly fall through them before navigating them successfully (this can be particularly annoying when they're starving and need to get up those stairs to eat). Pathing is generally pretty good, but, for some reason, when some dwarves are attacked, they just stand around instead of fleeing and you end up needing to move them manually or watching them die. If you happen, at some point, to spend all your money, no new wealth tally shows up when you get more (until you restart the game). There are a lot misspellings and grammar mistakes in the game text — anywhere from repeatedly misspelling ""environment"" to sentences that make no sense whatsoever and game missions being called different things depending on what piece of text is referring to them. I've had a lot of problems with camera angle.  Sometimes about midway into a level, it just decides the only view I want of the dwarves is at the level of their feet, and nothing I can do can get it to reset or take a better angle.  The only solution is waiting for it to get so bad that, when you load the game, the game corrects it. Level design leaves a lot to be desired: sometimes the monsters right by your starting location are, say, level 10 or better, while the ones far away and deep underground are level 2.  It seems somewhat random.I'll also say that, tone wise, I'd have preferred fewer puns and pop culture references (example: one resource is ""dragonforce"", with the tooltip, ""the hardest metal known to man"") and dialogue that was worthwhile reading — instead, it frequently pauses your game mostly to waste your time.  Some of that is, I think, poor translation work (or non-native English at the very least), and it tended to annoy me to some degree in that I generally expect a bit more polish from a game I've paid to play.The GoodYet, all that aside, I really did enjoy the game itself.  That is, despite its slap-dash feel and poor finishing.  The pacing is relaxed, and the graphics cute enough that you can spend time just enjoying digging around and making nice settlements.There are some DLC available for A Game of Dwarves, both add-on packs (Pets, Ale Pack, and Space Dwarves) plus some in-game purchases of furniture available.  I got a few of the in-game furniture packs, but they seemed a little overpriced (about $0.99 USD for three pieces of furniture).  Overall: the game can be fun, and I can entertain myself for an unreasonable amount of time laying out settlements and making attractive rooms for my dwarves to enjoy.  Just know that the game is not really ""finished"" in a sense, and try not to pay full price for it.			"

												Basically an abandoned early-access game, A Game of Dwarves had a lot of potential, but is left poorly optimized and riddled with bugs. Seemingly inspired by the much better ""Dwarf Fortress"", A Game of Dwarves sought to improve upon it with better graphics, only to fall short in every other area. It can be fun to build in, or stripmine, as suits your moods, but there's no strategic depth and any of the levels can be beaten almost blindfolded (which is how your dwarves behave half the time). Overall, it can be fun to waste some time in, but I can't recommend you purchase it.			"

												At first quite nice. Digging, gathering resources, creating home for little creatures. But after some time the game  gets really boring. And is full of annoying bugs or weird ""features"". Yes, really weird. For example you can build some furniture like beds or chairs. But dwarves don't use them (at last in the way you can observe). What is more annoying the cannot pass through items like chairs or plants. So it's easy to block their way. Just after a short time it's quite easy to notice a lot of bugs.The game has some potential but seems to be unfinished or even abandoned. "

												This game is horrendously addictive.I will initially start with the one thing I really don't like about the game - and that's the conversations between King and Prince - and only because it usually interrupts me as I'm either moving an object or placing one to build - having to click the arrow to continue the conversation is, for me, a niggle.Other than that, it's quite a simple premise that is developed very well indeed.  I find myself thinking ""oh I'll just clear this area here, just a few blocks"" and when I eventually look up it's been several hours and let's just say more than just those few blocks, because those few always lead to more, and more, and more...The storyline itself is quite funny, and if you take the time to read the conversations when they appear, it carries that dry humour through the game.I've seen some people complain about the DLCs/Stores items that are purchasable with real life pennies - well all I can say to those it what do you expect when the game itself is so cheap for what you get - the small (and it really is!) amount for the extras help create more revenue for the developer, and in my mind that means the developer can afford to spend more time on updates - which is a win!  However, you don't need to buy anything from the shop - it's fluff stuff.  Instead of bed A that is 3 smileys and 4 Z's you can purchase bed B that is 3 smileys and 4 Z's.   Each item you purchase usually cost the same resources as one of the items (from the same group, ie beds) you already have.  So to repeat myself here, you don't NEED to buy anything from the store, you can play just fine without them.I have only found a 1 bug, but found that others had noticed it as well, reported it, and the developer acted upon it incredibly quickly - so if you do find one, just report it as best you can on the forums.Now if you don't mind, I'm going to leave this review short and sweet, as I really want to go back in and look after my dwarves :) "

												As much potential as this game had, it's sad to see it never actually befoming a fun game.The digging is fun, and there's good bits of crafting and decorating and other things that are fun.  But the engine the devs used, killed any modding community or content sharing.  That and the tedium of the 'story' missions ie 'where can i dig to get to the sparkly square and tell my warriors to go' sadly remove all the acutal management and tactical parts of the game.   I wish this had gotten a sequel made in a more flexible engine that allowed for actual AI.  Skip it.			"

												This is an absolutely fantastic little game. You're a Dwarf Prince, who is given control of a group of dwarves, and you build fortresses and caves underground and fight bad things who want to kill you. You go searching for materials to build furniture and decorations, and to advance your dwarven army. Once you kill the bad things, you can steal their beds and bunny rabbits and stuff to put in your fortress.There is a campaign mode with quests which I think is really well done, and great to play. There's also a sandbox 'free' mode so you can build your ultimate fortress without any distractions. In both sandbox and campaign, I love being able to decorate my little dwarven fortress.. thing. There's a whole range of decorations and things to do, and discover. Killing stuff and making a badass army isn't bad either, theres a fair few enemies and bosses to defeat with your military dwarves.Theres a skill tree type doohickey that will allow you to give your group of dwarves more powers and items as the game goes on.It's a great game to play casually and relax with (if you learn not to try and rush through, which made lead to stress and death unless you're quite focused!). Sometimes your dwarves don't do quite what they're told, plus they're fat so they get stuck behind furniture a lot and then panic and die of starvation.. but it's okay, you can just spawn another one. I definitely recommend it. It might take a tiny while to get used to (at least, it did me) but once you're there, it's quite addictive. One thing though - Apart from the DLC, there is an in game 'shop' to use your steam wallet to buy yet more decorations. The packs in there arnt expensive, and I think anyone who enjoys building/decorating/creating things like I do will be happy to pick them up for the price they are.. but if that sort of thing annoys you, well.. it's here.

+ The gameplay can be quite enjoyable and addictive. You essentially control a group of dwarves and work on expanding your underground base, digging for resources, and exploring new areas. You also need to meet the needs of your dwarves such as food, beds for sleeping, decoration, etc.+ A very unique floor system, where you can go up and down MANY layers vertically. You can dig like 20 floors down or up, which I thought was pretty amazing.+ Visually the game looks really good. It reminds me of a minecraft texture pack called BDCraft+ Great soundtrack ~ The intro cutscene is great and quite funny...although it didn't relate to the actual game...- Poor controls. You can not select individual dwarves, and you can't click on or click+drag to select anything. You can't issue simple move orders. You can't cancel order queues easily. Overall the game just did not feel properly designed. - A rather convoluted user interface "

Also, it has a bunch of bugs. Eg. Your dwarves will always fall down stairs once before going up them, because the game does not understand that it is not an empty space.It also has a bunch of DLC, $5 DLC at that.

												Now THAT is a fun little game! The graphics are not great, but hey you don't really care! It is similar to minecraft, but with far less complicated things that you can build. You are a dwarf leader building an underground kingdom by digging down. The lower you go, the more valuable ressources you find. You got a nice campy campaign and the game is upbeat and a bit funny. You got a few different kind of dwarves that you can have and each has its own speciality.The game is not hard, at least the first few campaign missions are pretty easy, but it needs constant digging and you can easily lose yourself for hours at a time.In its simplicity, this game is deceptively addictive like crack cocaine if you can believe it! You look at the time, heh it just 19h00 so ill dig a few more blocks. Then when you look again, its 3h00 in the morning and god damn youre going to be dead tired for work tomorrow! argh!!!!!And the game is cheap at 9$. It is well worth it in my opinion.			"

												Recently I looked on the store page wondering what others thought of this game, and looking over the reviews I could only see ones that did not recommend the game, and in all seriousness I strongly disagree with these claims.The game, much like any managment game, plays very slowly, you start off with a barly functioning settlement and create a thriving dwarven city/stronghold/research lab, really whatever you want to make as long as it involves dwarves. From the start you must gather food and minerals, level up your dwarves as you go, fight off monsters, decorate your town/city/fort etc and make sure your dwarves are happy, you need specific materials for specific pieces of furniture and so you should really look to dig everything you can, you can make traps, barricades, grow food and create an army of adorable little dwarves. Honestly I love this game, it is slow but when you finally finish your 10 story all-marble throne room with pillars and suits or armour it is extremly satisfying. At one time I literally filled up the largest map with a city which I named Moria after the lord of the rings franchise.The game is slow but satisfying and is NOT for people who do not like both trial and error and having to choose wallpaper for bedrooms...oh also you need to be patient, very patient.Now, the game itself is only 10 dollars and I got a pre-order of it, it is fairly cheap comparing to most games and much better than a lot of more expensive ones *cough* infection survivor stories *cough*. All in all that is around pocket money price for the average teenage male/female assuming you don't spend it on something else.As any proper review does, I need to point out the bad. The main point being that it is repetetive, very much so...to the point where the only reason you play story mode is to see what the ending is, which brings me to my next point, terrible writing. The story isn't immersive and feels like it was rushed, VERY rushed. But the levels are thought out well and allow a fun time while you struggle to understand what the hell is going on. And the worst part are the DLC's....ill just leave it like this.All in all it a very fun game, it sqanders is potential a LOT, however I still love the game, and I love playing it, right now I am still trying to get enough dragonstone to finish my grand treasure chamber so I have to go, but seriously check the game out.

												I somewhat enjoyed this game but, to be entirely honest, for somebody who does not love designing their own underground fortresses A Game of Dwarves is simply a game that is sorely lacking in any form of real challenge. To add to that, even if you do enjoy designing said fortresses you are probably better off buying a game that actually has building and managing a community as its main focus. This combination only leaves a very specific group of those people who want to build a decent looking underground dwarven home without anything else going on as people whom I think should buy it.

												FRUSTRATED.This game looks interesting, but have just spent 2 hours trying to:a) understand the clunky controlsb) make sense of the 'levels' its too easy to get 'lost' between levels - therefore you spend more time clicking buttons and getting annoyed than playingc) get the dwarves to follow commands! the dwarves to seem to follow commands all that well, it is intermittent.I can't actually say I 'played' the game.I dont recommend the game unless you like clunky management and functions..2/10AVOID			"

												The game is fun, However, I'm going to have to not recommend this game because of just one reason.Hidden DLC's.I based my choice to buy the game and the 3 steam DLC's on the total price and the expectation that would be all till new  DLC's would come out some future day.Only to find there were already about 10 more dlc's once you open the game and find an in-game shop.Not to mention the ingame dlc store for the free items seems to be broken for several people, but that's another matter.

												GAME OF DWARVES is just like Dungeon Keeper 2, but without voice acting, charm, fun or anything of interest really. The game is less pick up and play than Dungeon Keeper 2, because there is a lot of text that needs to be read and well supplies that you buy with gold. Supplies like wood to build stuff... you buy it, you don't chop it down. No this game is completely under ground like Dungeon keeper 2. And you play as Dwarves on a grid. Your dwarves dig out walls along this grid, but unlike Dungeon Keeper 2, you can dig up and down instead of just north, south, east and west. You hire new dwarves and assign them roles or jobs. Its just so much like Dungeon Keeper 2, but less faceted and a lot more boring. Not to say that every FPS is like Doom, with a new coat of paint, but imagine if a game released 10 years after Doom, used a modified Doom engine, yet had less interesting things than Doom. This game just feels so dull, incomplete and uninspiring. The only plus is that playing custom games will generate a random underground world for you to explore.			"

												A Game of Dwarves is an attempt to make a 3D Dwarf Fortress. It is much less complex, of course. This is both good and bad. It is less complicated to play, but it has very few options compared to Dwarf Fortress. Also, I found the game to be unbalanced. Some things are completely useless, like chairs and long distance military units. The AI needs improvement too. But it is fun to play, especially if you use traps.			"

												I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews about this game.  I think this game is absolutely adorable and quite fun.  The mechanics take a little getting used to but I don't want a copy cat game - new mechanics are good.  The story is silly and you get a chuckle once in a while.  I wouldn't rank it up there as a MUST have game, but I still enjoy tossing the game on once in a while and building away.  It's a very nice casual game.			"

												This is a great, affordable game for anybody who loves base-building and the idea of running a little Dwarven colony. I'll admit, it's not the best looking game and is a little awkward to watch (the Dwarves/enemies often ""slide"" along surfaces, especially up and down ladders), however you get used to this and it actually is a little charming after a while.The game has some pretty clever mechanics, where you have to continue to build Dwarven items and decorate your hold the deeper you delve, otherwise your Dwarves become unhappy. This keeps you pushing forward and gives you a reason to actually ""conquer"" and turn the mineshafts and caverns into actual Dwarven homes. Also, the game has a clever ""question mark"" system to encorage you to mine in different directions. The leveling and variety of your Dwarven warriors is also a cool way to add depth and variety to combat, plus naming each of your Dwarves gives you a connection to them and their exploits as your colony grows.The story missions are quite extensive and become challenging, so there's plenty here to keep you busy for hours. Or you can just run wild with a custom game.Overall, while this game isn't the most polished and could have more features, it's still an incredibly fun and fairly unique base-builder/dwelver game that has plenty of character and charm. It's definitely worth the current price, especially if you snag it on sale.			"

												""A Game of Dwarves"" is a little gem, if you want to have a relaxed and jolly gamesession.

That game might be not something special for everyone, but I had a great time with it!			"

												I love this game, the thrill of watching my dwarves hustle and bustle about as they tend plants, dig holes, and kill goblins is exciting to me! it's fun because it's simple and easy. In custom game I always pimp out my stronghold to max pimp. This game is fun if you find watching your little minions doing stuff on there own and designing awesome fortresses to your hearts desire! If you're a call of duty fanboy who thinks everything needs to be fast paced this isn't the game for you. I personally enjoy this game for its slower pace and watching the hustle and bustle of my fortress as I pimp it to my hearts desire. If you're like me, I recommend it!			"

												While it has a neat premise, it falters in several areas. Despite items having a bonus listed in their description, it's quite obvious that some items are better than others, even if they have the same bonuses. There's no mention of these bonuses anywhere, and a little internet sleuthing reveals that the game designers intentionally did this, and refuse to reveal what the actual bonuses are for each item.HUGE MEMORY HOG! Each level starts off fine enough, but once you get close to maxing out your population and/or getting to the lower levels, the game grinds to a halt, making it nearly unplayable. Repeated requests on the forums for assistance with this issue appear to go unanswered.			"

												I never did quite get in to this game. Every time I tried maintaining a colony of dwarves, they would either become depressed, or as soon as I went to explore a dungeon, the enemies would teleport themselves past my defenses, slay my level 10 soldier dwarves with ease, and be free to kill the rest of my passive dwarves. The game is a lot of fun to play, but it seems to be one of those games you are supposed to devote a lot of time to, and not rush things. Being a hasty person myself, and wanting to get right into the thick of things, I fail to succeed at this game. You, however may be a different story. I recommend you grab this game and give it a go.			"

I start with nice neat bases and then when I need more resources, it becomes huge multilayer mines stretching everywhere. I've never ran into any bugs and the game seems complete to me so I don't know why all the negative reviews. If the developer ever decides to return, I'd buy more DLC and would LOVE a sequel.

												While theres nothing inherently wrong with A Game of Dwarves theres nothing all that good about it either.  I was looking for a Dungeon Keeper-esque/ general RTS game that would fill waste some time and I did find it in AGoD (kind of an interesting abreveation, no?).  The gameplay itself is not terribly revolutionary, you dig out and settle an area, collect resources, do research and train and build an army.  The thing that kills the game for me is the AI, especially in combat.  To intiate combat you must dig into certain areas where monsters may or may not be waiting.  If they aren't you may find a few resources and go along with your day, if there are monsters they usually kill one, if not two, of your diggers because your army is perpetually late to the party.  Your supposed to be able to place down these flags that your army is supposed to stay stationed at but they just dont care about them.  So wherever they are they have to run to meet the goblins or orcs or spiders or republicans or whatevers killing you this time and stop them from stomping your♥♥♥♥♥♥  90% you can dominate them, rebuild your diggers, take their stuff and move on.  10% of the time your army gets wiped out and its game over.  If you lose a battle there is no coming back, theres not enough time to train new units, there simply isn't.  So really the combat consists of coin toss on wether or not enemies show up, a tense few seconds of them stomping around killing whatever they see till your army shows up and then a fierce but usually short battle that either allows you to move on or completely ends your game.  And I just dont think thats fun, probably because it isnt.Luckily combat is a minor part of the game overall, in my playtime I would say only a sixteenth of it was actually spent fighting anything.  Most of the game is mining and building and on this aspect the game does a bit better (though only a bit).  The minecraft like cubeness of the blocks seems like fun at first until you realise its a pain to fill in any dug up squares and covering them with wood is costly and ugly.  Using the resources you get from mining allows you to build all sorts of things dwarves need in a variety of models.  I made a little barracks once and was really proud of it until I realised I had to dig out the floor to try to find gold so I could continue progressing the story.  So anything you do build on either wastes the resource its built on or has to be gotten rid of eventually which kinda sucks.  Still its fun to be creative and make death pits for miners and cellars full of random cleaning supplies that no one can get to no matter how hard they try.The art style was okay but it wasn't something I really liked looking at, its cute for a while but it got old for me pretty quickly.  The music got old even faster however, I had to mute it within an hour or so of my first game and pull up something on itunes just becuase it was so bland and repetative.   And there are some glitches that are pretty annoying, though nothing game breaking that I found which in a way was to bad, it probably would've been something fun.  But the reason I cant say I hate this game is that it really pulled me in.  It didnt really mater how boring it got or how annoyed with it I was I just kept saying, ""One more area to clear then I'll (shower*eat breakfast*eat lunch*go meet my friends*eat dinner*sleep*etc).""  But no matter how many times I told myself that I would always find something else to do, this archer sucks, better make him practice, if the walls in here were covered in decorative stone it wouldnt look so bad, etc.  I guess ultimately if you need a time waster, this is it, its not the best but its not the worst I've ever seen.  I just think for the money you could find something a bit better.			"

												If you're reading this hoping for a challenging sandbox survival game, look elsewhere. Enemies appear only in air pockets dug out by the player, and keeping a good supply of resources is just a matter patience of not getting careless along the way (forgetting to make farms). This is the fundamental problem with the game if you're looking for a survival challenge.Aside of these problems a number of other major issues and a significant lack of polish plague the game.[Combat]:Enemies lack proper patch finding and will when encountered instead wildly teleport around the level until they find a dwarf to beat up. Your own dwarves cannot be controlled (aside from teleporting them) and soldier dwarves will simply bullrush your enemy they can patch-find their way to, even if they are on the other side of the level and have 1% of their maximum health available (no way to prevent this aside from sealing them in).Enemies teleporting makes traps useless, and since you can't stop your dwarves from blindly rushing into battle the only factor is having more and higher level dwarves than the enemy monsters.[Resources]:Certainly better than the combat, but basic resources are surprisingly rare, while 'rare' resources when found can buy you immense quantities of these resources, which leads to situations where the best way to get ""stone"" is to find an unholy rock and sell it for a few thousand rocks. Unfortunately you also need to mash the ""buy rock"" button a few hundred times since you can only buy very small stacks. Aside from this you have a few minor issues like resources sometimes permanently disappearing from your resource tab if they reach 0.[Graphics & Sound]:The sound and graphics for the game are both nicely done and get the point across. Aside of a few minor issues designing a good looking dwarf fortress is both possible, fun and fairly easy to do.[Summary]:A few major design flaws and a severe lack of polish across the board prevents this game from reaching its full potential. Perhaps the game will change later on, but as the game is now I do not feel that I can recommend it to anyone.			"

I saw this as something akin to Dungeon Keeper or even Gnomoria, but it was dwarfed (heh, puns) by the sheer vision of those other titles. If you're considering this, I'd recommend looking at Gnomoria instead.			"

												This game is a charming mix of Dwarf Fortress, The Sims and Sim City Ants.  Confusing?  Allow me to explain.  In A Game of Dwarves, you are a young dwarf prince who has just been told by your father to strike out on your own and re-capture a magic crystal that will help you defeat the evil wizards who banished your kind from the world above.  To do so, you will command a group of dwarves, whom you will assign a role and give orders to with the goal of growing your community and building an efficient and productive colony.There are several different types of roles these dwarves can fill, but the first ones you will encounter include, warriors, workers, diggers and builders.  Most of these roles are self-explanatory, for instance warriors defend your home from creatures and monsters that hide in the forgotten ruins and tunnels underground.  Workers harvest food and other resources from fertile patches of earth you find underground to keep your dwarves fed.  Diggers are the primary workhorses in a dwarven society as they expand your colony by digging new tunnels and excavating long lost ruins which may contain treasures and other useful tools.  Then there are builders who craft the various beds, tables, benches and decorations you will use to keep your dwarves fed, well rested and happy.This game has a good sense of humor and doesn’t take itself too seriously most of the time, but don’t let that fool you.  It is easy to lose track of your dwarves as you are off in another part of the colony, and you will return to find them dead and a gravestone left in their stead.  This happens usually because a digger falls in a hole and starves because there is no ladder there for them to escape, or they unearth a monster and you don’t have any nearby warriors to assist them in fighting it.  So while the game seems simple at first glance, you have to pay attention and plan out your expansions so that there is a food source (table) near your frontline diggers, as well as a military member and builder to assist them when they need it.Each dwarf needs food, rest and has a level of happiness to keep track of.  Like Sims, they will try to take care of these needs automatically, but know that they will have to travel to the nearest food source and bed so it is a good idea to have plenty around your colony so that the dwarves can work where assigned and quickly resume working once their needs are taken care of.  Additionally, dwarves are vain creatures, so they want to see decorations and tributes to their greatness to keep them happy and working at maximum proficiency. This game is nowhere near as complex and crazy as dwarf fortress, but it is also much more accessible.  I did not encounter many issues or bugs while playing this game, except for the fact that I could not get the client to go full screen.  I am not sure what was causing this to be the case, and I tried several resolution settings without any luck, so this may just be something going on with my setup.Overall, I think this is a fun game.  I have played it for 2 hours, which was just enough to complete the tutorial missions, which btw I think are very good and taught me how to play the game in an engaging way.  I am currently doing a Steam Run, where I play every game in my Steam Library for at least 2 hours, but I plan on coming back to this one for sure.			"

												This is not a terribly memorable game. It attempts to fill the Fortress niche that games like DF, Rimworld, Prison Architect, and Gnomria fill in different ways, but fails to do anything unique or add to the genre in any real way. If this game commits any specific crime, it is being bland.This said, I haven't played it or felt a desire to play it since I first put it down a few years ago. Still, it was a little fun while it lasted (and for me that was about 12 hours).			"

												i really wanted this to be good, but alas...first, nobody should have to sit through a mission that's 2 hours longmissions are boring and sometimes to find the objective you have to mine out half the map!story and writing is full of cheese, and are not engageing for me - i don't care about how my dwarf leader is a squeaky puss-puss, and the 'jokes' if you can call them that, are intentionally bad; bringing back my point that dwarves should not be seen as good-for-nothing puff!tutorial is broken, i've seen many bugs during my time with the game.Miners are kamikazee dumbos! one shall not dig a 1 block deep hole, get stuck in it and die [dwarves aren't puff!]when found a cavern filled with goblins, they think 'oh, that's a nice chair' , go sit in it and die! rightfully so, i have no desire to lead dumbos to victory of any sort.dwarves falling down tunnels. AAAGH!  there's only one animation- falling down one block! so if you dig into a 5 high room, your dwarf will play the animation, stand up mid-air, and play the animation after some time again 5 times!why can i not refund prince upgrade points? if i spend 10 hours doing all the missions for one 'playthrough' so to say, i want full control to make the experience less infuriating. not to mention the countless bugs which mean that optional objectives give no 'influence' (used to gain Prince Upgrade Points) after mission is beaten, so off i go again for 2 more hours doing the side stuff just due to a bug!happiness is a pointless, broken system. there is no advantage to building aesthetically pleasing stuff (most of which is behind a ridiculus 2pence pay wall) - you just use the excess resource to build a 'decoration'. this can be a {storage} room of statues- do that and suddenly your happiness meter booms!if you're gonna have me pay ANYTHING for DLC decorations, make sure i have a reason to do so. core game has more decoration than i can ever use, as anything takes up a 1x1x1 block.mining, walking, eating, complaining all takes too long! if you wanna have me enjoy the 'slow' gameplay, ask yourself, what advantage would it give me? i've had a game where i lost mid way through because a goblin destroyed my main feeding table and my king starved. having sunk an hour into the mission, i was furious.your game pauses every time you enter a menu! there's no way to change this, i've tried.to say this again, i wanted to love this game, i wanted to have fun, and the game with full capability, refused to give this to me.artists, you've done well, coders, i wish you better luck next time.

												This game will eat large chubnks of your life before you realise it but I found it to be creatively rerwarding. It's a bit like a very simplified Sims with Dwarves in a Minecraft world. Also there's a tech tree inside each level and one outside. The one outside does really help determine your playstyle but the one inside the level will be completely filled out about halfway through any given level. It's a good game for building floating, 3D gardens and learning how to conduct strategic tunnel sieges. But the traps are rather useless and hard to implement. Easier just to block things off. See what I did there. Play the game and you'll get pun. That's all I can promise.			"

												Went into the game wanting a qwerky game of commanding dwarfs. What I got was not to my standard.-Ran into a bug that wouldn't allow me to assign dwarfs to things, which after 10-20mins of getting mad at the game a simple restart fixed but this type of bug ruined the experience for me.-Slow progression (not always bad but for me it was)-Voice acting is a bit of a tease in this, it seems like it will have voice acting then just makes read over extended dialogue that simple tells you to do a small task-The animation and graphics could have been better, but for a $10 game its understandable in the graphics area, but I really expected a more fuild walking animation between charactersIf you can pick the game up cheap and love dwarves beyond all else get this game, but I'm not spending anymore time on this.

												This game is plagued with bugs: I'll just list one: every other hole I'm digging I can't set up ladders in. Which means my dwarf at the bottom of the pit will die as he cannot get out of it (unless I teleport him back up manually) and the hole becomes unusable. In a game where the main goal is to dig (down) this pretty much ruins everything.The prospect of the game was nice, the specialization of the dwarfs, the leveling up and researching are nice. But the execution is bad. You get lost so easily with the huge amount of stories you build on, you lose dwarfs way too quickly and too often and digging is a pain. It also drags on forever, as your workers stop to sleep and eat so often.Much of the pain could be spared by having the digger build ladders automatically but what to expect from a company that offers you decorative item DLCs in such (singleplayer) game? This thing is unpolished - I would like to see the good in it but it keeps♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. Do not buy! "

												This game is a bit like Dungeon Keeper and a bit like Lego Rock Raiders if you can remember that gem. In the campaign you play a Prince that leads his clan to re-take lands lost to mages years ago. Each area consists of a randomly generated grid with multiple levels so the resources and non-quest specific rooms will move around if you restart. The focus is on furniture rather than specific rooms, but this allows for a player to designate their own shape and size for a ""room"". There are about 14 different resources of increasing rarity that will make better furniture to keep dwarves happy or upgrade your army. Game isn't too difficult but much of the time you spend will be mining the resources you need.			"

The game is $10, which is much less than you would pay for some of these larger game titles (which some flat out suck but cost $60+ because of the company).  So, on that I would say if are going to compare game quality to that of top brands, I suggest comparing the prices as well.For me, I would have liked to have seen more building options.

												They've tried to emulate Dungeon Keepers and failed miserably - there aren't enough items, no dynamic rooms and digging through different layers is painfully boring and hard.You can't clone or paint textures fast and efficiently and the developers had ignored requests for this on forums. In fact - they had update their game only once since release.Underneath layers of bugs, muddy textures and boring music there are some good ideas. The gameplay gets stale pretty soon, there's nothing to hold you playing for more than a few hours. In short - the game was dead on arrival. Try ""Craft the World"" instead.			"

												This game is one of those Dungeon Keeper 2 clones that's done REALLY well. There are many differences, such as being three dimensional in it's layout meaning you can mine down and up for resources. There are also no designated rooms meaning you can freely put whatever you want where-ever you want. It is a very long game and I warn you now, since the game has a huge area, especially in the later levels when building in large groups of Dwarves it'll munch on your virtual memory like it needs ever inch to survive. The story is certainly not epic, but it's definantly commedic and quite fun to play. I recommend playing it if you love games such as Evil Genius or Dungeon Keeper 2.			"

												Hugely disappointing. Having hyped this game as a simplified 3D Dwarf Fortress, the developers either had no time to polish and add game functions, or they simply didn't have the skill to execute a game of this scale. Game mechanics are often hidden or pointless, navigation and moving the camera can be very confusing, AI struggles to accomplish simple tasks often doing it the most inefficient way leading to unnecessary deaths, animations and graphics that make me crave for Dwarf Fortress ASCII art, and a gameplay that does not infuse excitement or challenge with a dash of poor attempt at comedy.

												Dwarf Fortress Lite, for those of you who can't stand tiles/text based graphics. It's dumbed down to an incredible degree, to the point that it's almost insulting to play. It's intresting for a little bit, but Dwarf Fortress has a /lot more/ replayability, I doubt you'll get through the ""Story"" before it becomes too boring.At least Dwarf Fortress is Free.			"

												I used to love the old ""Dungeon Keeper"" game, but my dungeons always got destroyed when I broke through to the hero's lair because I couldn't keep up with the attacks. ""A Game of Dwarves"" is styled after ""Dungeon Keeper"" but has what amounts to a sandbox mode (so you can play and dig and build to your heart's content without being attacked left and right), is brighter (one of my complaints about DK was that everything was dim and dark, being in a dungeon, and that I couldn't see what was going on half the time), is 3D so you can dig up and down as well as sideways, and retains the humour that made DK fun to play. It's not perfect. The voice acting is a bit weird in places (""what does it take for me to get somebody to listen to meeee""), though in a way that's generally amusing rather than off-putting. The dwarves can be slow to react - especially the military. (I miss the DK Call to Arms banner which at least told your dungeon's inhabitants to respond immediately to attacks. There's something similar in GoD but it's more like a garrison flag, a ""mill around here until told otherwise"" banner, rather than something you can use to make them react quickly to invasions.) The controls are not always intuitive or explained well (it took me forever and an internet search to figure out how to rotate objects. While I'm not averse to using walkthroughs when I'm stuck, I shouldn't have to look to external sources for basic controls). You also spend a ton of resources on placing tables and beds for your dwarves to lay about doing nothing (they need to eat and rest frequently and die if you put said food and beds too far away for them to reach after their work shift), compared to DK where you'd just build a lair for each creature to live in. Despite that, I still find it easier and less labour intensive to play GoD than I did DK, which had you constantly digging for gold to pay your monsters. With GoD, as long as you've got workers operating your ""farms"", you can just sit there and let your dwarves take a long holiday.I haven't gotten too far into the campaign side of the game so I don't know how much harder it gets to keep your dwarves alive. My biggest complaint so far is that the resources are scattered so it's next to impossible to have symmetrical farms that aren't scattered in small pockets all over the place, but that's not a complaint so much as a personal peeve I have with keeping everything compartmentalised. All in all, I'm enjoying Game of Dwarves more than Age of Mythology, which I paid at least twice as much for, and you can get a few freebie DLC to go with it, so I'd definitely recommend.			"

												This game is NOT worth any of your money. A Game of Dwarves is a base-builder where you end up leading a small pack of dwarves and have them extend their empire deeper into the caverns, yet as you dare do so you begin to uncover caverns containing monsters and possible treasures. That is the only thing that makes you keep on playing until you realize how dreadful the game actually is. First, the game has no to little updates. You will find the game to be always the same bland pointless base-builder. Second, the game enertains you for a few hours until you simply realize you do the same thing over and over again throughout the entire game. Dig down. Discover Cavern. Kill monsters. Rinse and repeat until you discover every cavern in the entire game or slaughter every monster. Lastly, the game is simply not enertaining and does not give you that thrill every time you discover a cavern. You end up finding it actually boring upon discovering caverns as your dwarves just wave in and loot the place or kill the monster. There is no all powerful artifact or enchanted weapons in these caverns. Only gold or monsters along with some furinture! I reccomend buying another game that is worthy of your money.			"

												Warning: has tiny DLCsI got this as part of some bundle. I recently felt like playing a base building game and this one was unplayed in my library.This game seems unfinished. It has traps and walls and tiers of military but there's no enemies to use them on. I've only played the tutorial and what seems to be 1/3 of the campaign so maybe there will be armies later but from the looks of it it seems that you don't need to ever use any of the combat features.The only enemies are weak mobs that just exist until they die. Nothing spawns. So it is as if the developers had all these big things in mind but abruptly stopped developing. The in-game economy consists of putting a few dwarves on farming and you're done for ever. Money is made by clicking the sell-wood-button repeatedly unless you buy the DLC that supposedly has the money tree. There's a technology tree that gets researched autmatically over time so long as you have some dwarves researching. Once they're done and the tree is complete, you can't do anything with those dwarves and they just keep researching for ever.This game should be considered very early alpha with lakc of features.A game that is early access and has more features, mod support, full invasion support, economy, seasons, etcetc is Gnomoria. That one is 2D isometric and something I go back to every few months. This game though, I'll probably try to finish because of the sunk cost fallacy...			"

The graphics and voice acting are simple but enjoyable, with a good sense of humor. The mechanics are exactly what is needed in this genre; you dig, you accumulate resources, you move up a tech tree, and then you dig too deep and watch your dwarves die terrible deaths.

												This is not a perfect game. It is a bit unfinished, and will never be completed as the developer has quit operating.So why am I recommending it?It's a lot of fun! You play a Dwarf clan and can build vast, underground caverns for your people. You have to dig for gold and other materials, but also make sure you don't run out of wood, and have to defend yourself from incursions by monsters such as Goblins or Spiders.The campaign is silly, and while there are voice clips they do not match the dialog at all. But it serves its purpose in teaching you how to play. Sandbox is where this game really shines.There is an in-game shop which wants you to buy items for in-game currency on top of the DLC, but all that's in there is cosmetic and can be completely missed.If you like your ""town builders"" but don't want the complexity of something like Gnomoria or Dwarf Fortress, give this game a try.

												Honestly wish they had a mix option for reviewing. This game is not so great, but neither is it not so bad either. With any games, it going to have its ups and downs. So does this game. I find it fun to play because this game is all about dwarfs, which if fun, second it also a qurcky mine, build, and slay the monsters that are in your way to get to that treasure room. I like this game because of that, but its also bad because it does have glitches, bugs, and the sometimes hateful crash and burn. Those do happen a few times that make it less fun, along side that all the decs in game for your hold, there are not a lot of them. The devlopers could've add more, or added a feature that let them build their own structures like Spore does. The other thing i find hard is that you cannot build top side that well, which is a drag. Dwarfs build ther hold from under ground to the top side. Like in the lonely mountain from the Hobbit, that hold had the whole mountain side carved out. But this is a mixed reaction from me. I neither like it, nor hate.			"

												I just got this game, but I am completely addicted already. ""A Game of Dwarves""  is a building game where you make a multistory underground fortress for your clan of dwarves while defending it from vicious monsters and natural disasters. For more picky players, there are tons of little items and banners to add into your fortress to make it look better and raise the happiness of your dwarves. The main reason I'm recommending this is because I really enjoy building games (Minecraft, Terraria, this, etc.).*Edit* It does get boring after hours of play. It's a nice game to have every once in a while when you're bored of everything else and want to dig up some ores for an hour or two, but not a serious play-all-night kind of thing.			"

												This isn't a great game, but I still managed to spend 50 hours on it, if you like free-form building games you'll like this. The graphics are simple yet aesthetically pleasing, and there are lots of small objects you can place to add details. The combat and survival parts are easily overcome in sandbox play - depending on the difficulty levels - so the challenge usually boils down to mining for precious ore, in order to finance the construction of the increasingly extravagant dwarf hold. Enabling the option for Dark Mode - which disables the overly bright lightning you see in the screenshots - creates a nice atmosphere as the only source of light comes from torches and braziers you build.If you enjoy building then you will enjoy A Game of Dwarves, there are small 1€ DLC packs in-game which add a decent amount of new objects for you to craft. If you are looking for something deeper than just building and gathering  then you'll be disappointed with this game.Also, it can get buggy, exitting and re-loading your game usually fixes this.			"

												A Game of Dwarves has been described many ways by many people with much more experience in ""gamez journalizm"" than me, but I will attempt to give a recommendation for you, the reader, anyhow.This game can best be summed up as Dungeon Keeper and Dwarf Fortress having a big dumb pretty baby.The game isn't terribly deep, but that isn't to suggest that the game is simple, it has quite a few layers but after your first deep inspection, you won't have much left to figure out.For those that are going into this thinking this is DF in 3d, it is not, please do not expect it to be as I did. The game is mostly centered around its story mode, with objectives on a series of small maps. You do indeed mine out areas in 3d (with ease might I add once you understand how placement of ladders work) but it is mostly to mine out gold and other resources to fuel your army when you uncover pockets of enemies or other objectives strewn about the map.There is a non story mode, but even those center around monster spots and other objectives. Do not come into this game expecting a 1000 year fort with multiple generations. The dwarves don't breed, you simply buy more dwarves as you upgrade a spawning pool, and food is pretty much trivialized by being a simple plant and harvest resource set instead of being cooked, processed and so on.This does not however mean it is a bad game. I am a huge fan of Dungeon Keeper and this takes a good number of bits from that game and enhances them for a new way of doing things. The systems are clean and work together well, are easily utilized, and research isn't made to be a complex chore.This is very much a straightforward game for people that want to mine a large area, kill a bunch of stuff, and make a couple cool rooms along the way.Summarizing my rambling thoughts above: If you like Dungeon Keeper and DF, you probably will like this, as long as you go into it knowing that is more on the DK side of complexity rather than the DF.Definitely worth the price of admission for fans of Dwarven fun!

												It has it's odd little glitches, yes. Furniture's prone to getting stuck now and again, the dwarves are mildly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.. But all in all, it's a ton of fun, and glitches are easily remedied by saving and exiting to the main area, then returning to the level. Even if you save after a known glitch makes itself known, it repairs (Unlike some games). I would recommend this for people that love casual play, exploratory, and games that make you feel kind of like you're God of some very, very special creatures. XD			"

												Pros: great graphics considering the age; good tutorial; easy to understand even for a beginner; low priceCons: unable to get past the initial music/video each time the game is started which takes a little time; even if I do everything right, my chars still die for no reason that I can see; when placing ladders it is rather difficult to get them placed the direction you want (other items seem to place OK though).Overall, it's a cute game and worth the small price.  It was a little frustrating for me but that's probably my lack of experience speaking.			"

												This is THE true Dungeon Keeper alternative, with added complexity. The only con I can find is that as a DK fan, this game doesn't have the theme that the DK has, which is gore, blood, torture chambers etc. That's pretty much my only gripe, but it should not matter for majority because this game has a more in-depth gameplay than DKs and the theme aint bad.

												I can understand the mixed reviews that I am seeing with the game because when I first played it it did feel a bit unfinished. A lot of improvements and fixes seems to have come out of late and have had a lot of fun with the game. I recommend it it is an interesting base building game and I like the diversity of the bases you can build. Good dynamics and a fun enviorment.			"

												Hello,I would recommend this game to anyone who can go into it without expectations. As others have mentioned, this game could have been amazing. Imagine just about any builder game, but with this games perspective/control and I drool. Gnomoria, Towns, Dwarf Fortress, Terraria, Craft the World, ect. They could all benefit from this type of 3d environment.Sadly, this game doesn't even bother to try to take the gameplay features of the genre and implement them. Instead it gave you just enough to finish the campaign and rip some more money from you in the form of DLC before it was declared finished.I had a great time with it. Like all early access alpha/beta type games, you play them and enjoy them because the anticipation for the next content patch keeps you involved. However, if you can't help but let a game rub you raw with it's blatant inadequacy, don't get it. If you can take it for what it is, grab it.I don't regret getting, so I will upvote. I am saddend by the developers/publishers lack of vision and dedication in letting such a grand opportunity to become the best of the genre slip away.Cheers,Michael			"

												This game is a very casual game. I frequently mine nearly every tile I can before solving the main mission,just because I can without the fear of loosing.  This is not an intense action game nor does it require deep strategy.  I enjoy playing the slow paced when I need to unwind from a busy day.			"

												Generally if you're going to create a game where the player has no direct control over characters, you need to have an AI that can back this up.Ten minutes into the full game, post-tutorials, every dwarf in my base save the king, a single farmer, and a researcher who I made later than everyone else, spontaneously died of starvation and/or exhaustion. The farmer and the king had remembered to sleep and eat. Nobody else did. There is, barring me using a ""teleporter"" with a cooldown, no way for me to direct people to the massive ♥♥♥♥ing table and/or room of beds I had one of the crafters build.A Game of Dwarves is pretty unimpressive (some might call it ""bad""), you guys.

												A Game of Dwarves is a mixed bag of fun and frustrating; quirky and buggy. Drawing heavily from Dungeon Keeper, AGoD puts you in charge of a group of dwarves in a small mine. In each mission you expand your starting location by digging outwards and downwards, building new room types to supply your dwarves and advance your settlement. As you explore further, uncovering new minerals that unlock new rooms and upgrades, you encounter increasingly deadly enemies. AGoD has you constantly juggling between exploration and training so that your military dwarves can always handle what's around the next tunnel bend. Problems start with the interface. A substandard UI and poor camera controls are mentally taxing.  This wouldn't be such a problem except that the campaign missions become obviously uninspired as time passes. Campaign missions involve digging your way to Spot X, and then digging your way to Spot Y, but this can be frustrated with the way the developers ""walled-in"" objectives with impenetrable rock. This often means digging around for a long time, juggling the poor camera controls, just to find the entrance. Still, there is fun to be had, especially if you can let go of the campaign and focus on building and creativity. In the end, I can only recommend AGoD to hardcore Dungeon Keeper fans and those who enjoy building epic projects in sandbox environments.  "

												Do you like to dig?Oh of course  you do, you are a dwarf! This game brings the dwarf life.... well, to life! Mine, build, survive, and thrive. Fun to play and find all sorts of hidden treasures far underground in your mines.If you like a simple dwarf colony game with mining, building, gathering, farming, and much much more. Check this one out as you won't be disappointed.			"

												I love this game. Some say it's not as good as Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria, but I argue that it is, in its own way. Nice little story in the main campaign with a little humour, and I love the fact that you can just fire it up with no enemies and make your dream underground domain, or with enemies and train up your soldiers to defend the realm. Graphics are more polished than Gnomoria, and the interface is far easier than DF! A few very minor bugs, but they don't detract from the gameplay.			"

												Finally came around to change my review from my native language German to English :) Perhaps some people might hate me for my opinion, but I do recommend this game, even though not at it's full price. I love ""A Game of Dwarves"" a lot and I continue to play it from time to time (at about 200 hours playtime for now). I really like the general gameplay, the isometric view, the animations and also the weird kind of humour. Problem is that the game is still a bit buggy and shows unused potential, but the developer's company Zeal doesn't exist anymore... Players have condemned Zeal for selling over-priced DLCs before even fixing the main game, which is absolutely understandable in my opinion. But was it the small Swedish indie-company Zeal who came up with that idea or their international distributor Paradox Interactive? Some reviewers recommend to teach ""them"" a lesson by not buying the game until the bugs have been fixed. However that would be completely fruitless since Zeal has already dissolved a long time ago, only a short while after the release of ""A Game of Dwarves"". On their Twitter-page https://twitter.com/agameofdwarves the last entry was about the early access (!) release of the game in October 2013...Paradox Interactive on the other hand has not given a d*mn about low sales and boycotts up until now, as they still continue to charge extra-money for the DLCs on Steam. More smaller DLCs can only be ordered from within the game though, and perhaps that cannot be changed without developers? Well, it's not like you are going to need the DLCs anyway! * the ""Star-Dwarves""-expansion pack can only be played in ""free-style"" mode, not during the story-mode-campaign. The Star Wars-like fighters might be a little bit stronger than the ""ordinary"" dwarven fighters, but with not much visible difference* the ""Ale""-pack is absolutely not necessary to keep your dwarves happy. Instead it's totally easy to get them all to 100% happiness forever by regularly crafting additional cheap storage-cupboards and/or decorative wall-tiles and floor-tiles made by wood (renewable) and/or stone* the ""Pets""-pack is mostly decorative. Even though some pets will also help with fighting, they are very weak in the beginning and it takes a lot of patience until they have levelled up * the rest of the DLCs are just completely ""cosmetical"" additional itemsPerhaps I am just lucky but I have stumbled over only very few bugs during 200 hours:* ranged attackers sometimes have troubles with positioning themselves, and sometimes they can miraculously fire through walls or corners :D * there have been a number of crashes during the ending-sequence in the last ""chapter"" of the campaign - seems like this has been the last part of the code before Zeal gave up* very rarely my dwarves have somehow managed to get (fall) into small closed or secluded spaces so I had to teleport them out of there manually before they could starve to death* sometimes dwarven fighters wouldn't attack enemies by themselves if too far away; but it always helps to station them close to critical areas beforehand (just like in ""Craft the world"") * generally it will help to save and relog every few hours (will prevent most fighting-AI-bugs), as well as to make copies of your savegames once in a while just to be on the safe side* in my (PC-)version of the game I've never spotted any dwarves falling from ladders or getting inactive while fighting. They seemed to have troubles with staircases though as far as I remember, so I have long refrained from building those. They are too pricy anyways :p* very rarely the camera suddenly ""fell"" below the current level and got stuck - but that could always be fixed with a relog * I personally like the random and sometimes mean level-designs with a few tough enemies placed closer to the starting-area, as this poses a bit of a surprising challenge sometimes. Not everybody is going to like that though I think* the ending wasn't really bad, but it underlined the feeling that Zeal once had more in mind previously, but just couldn't make it into a reality before dissolving* the German translation also is quite good; even much better than in many other games I've played, with very few mistakes or bugs :) All in all the few bugs I have experienced have not been able to kill the major fun I had and still have while playing ""A Game of Dwarves"" :)			"

												A quirky little game about dwarves. It is fun for the casual player since there really is no rushing and organization is only slightly important. The draw of this game is customizing your kingdom from the type of dwarves to the appearence of the walls and floors. The biggest drawbacks are small unfulfilling battles and slow pace. I'd give it a 7.5/10			"

												If you like Dungeon Keeper, then this is a good game for you. You play as dwarves (obviousely), and your task is to create a dungeon. You mine different ores, research perks in a skill tree way, hold an economy, and make a muti-levelled base, whilst being awhare of attacks from goblins.The only thing about this game which i can say is that the levels are pretty repetitive, but it is a good game if it is on sale, or you want to try something different.

												Despite the bugs, it's fun!If you like the 2-dimensional games like Craft the World, Junk Jack X, or Teraria; this game pops into 3-dimensions. It does have many bugs, particularly annoying are the text dropouts. In the dialog boxes all F's, L's and S's did not display when in full-screen mode. It made for some hilarious guesses because the dialog is on a timer and  forwards to the next box whether you click or not. On sale, it's worth several enjoyable hours.Pros:Dwarves do your bidding!Tech tree.Can decorate to your heart's content.Graphics are pretty good.Proven concept.Not expensive if you get it on sale.Can continue playing campaign levels after you have achieved the objective.Did I say dwarves!Cons:Dropout text leaves you guessing.Extra charges for DLC.Needs some serious tweaking from it's developers and they don't seem to be interested.Overall, it's worth buying on sale, especially if you can get it for 50% or more off.

The game looks good and is easy to learn the skills to make your Dwarves happy and healthy.   You can speed up and even pause the game which is handy when you find monsters underground.   The only direct input you have with your Dwarves is that you can teleport up to 5 dwarves to any location.   Grab it while it is on sale and have fun :-)   I did not get the DLC's but the only one that looks good is the Pets.			"

												tl;dr: A tepid recommendation. If Steam had a ""neutral"" recommendation, or an X/10 system, this game would rate right in the middle. Younger children or newcomers to RTS looking for a very shallow, slow start may enjoy this for its gameplay, most others will find it a casual experience at best.Vaguely reminicent of Dwarf Fortress, if DF was designed for younger folks instead of psychotic, bloodthirsty engineering aspirants.It's cute and cartoony, but the game's economy is broken the moment you discover the wood->gold->wood loop, leading to a significant decline in challenge (unless you hurry through). Unlike DF, this game is less about keeping your dwarves alive (usually a trivial task) but in providing beautiful surroundings with the fruit of their labor. Even here, however, the game is lacking. Simply slapping up massive quantities of wooden-covered walls and wooden flooring (again, infinite wood->gold->wood loop..) is enough to keep your dwarves beaming from ear to ear, if you're consistent about it.That leaves building a palace for yourself differently on THIS level because you like the pink flooring instead of the black, and playing through the story. The story's not bad, but the characters become long-winded and repetitive at times, and it's not a particularly strong story.Lengthwise, the game feels short, unfortunately. Once you've learned how to break the economy, levels are reduced to mere delay while you wait for your military to be strong enough to steamroll a few foes, then a few more. It's not a bad game, but it's a casual game for new gamers.tl;dr: A tepid recommendation. Not a challenging game, more of a casual building game with a few vestigial combat and research elements.

												Heyyo, this game is an interesting take on the base customiztion/management RTS style that is famous to Dungeon keeper since this one you play as Dwarves trying to reclaim their lands from evil Mages and their Orc allies. I like it and how in this unlike Dungeon Keeper there's different heights to the map you can scoll through and build ladders/stairs to access. I recommend this to anyone wanting a bit of a kick-back to Dungeon Keeper but want to try being the good guys again. I must say I did end up enjoying this game more than Dungeons.			"

												tl;dr: A tepid recommendation. If Steam had a ""neutral"" recommendation, or an X/10 system, this game would rate right in the middle. Younger children or newcomers to RTS looking for a very shallow, slow start may enjoy this for its gameplay, most others will find it a casual experience at best.Vaguely reminicent of Dwarf Fortress, if DF was designed for younger folks instead of psychotic, bloodthirsty engineering aspirants.It's cute and cartoony, but the game's economy is broken the moment you discover the wood->gold->wood loop, leading to a significant decline in challenge (unless you hurry through). Unlike DF, this game is less about keeping your dwarves alive (usually a trivial task) but in providing beautiful surroundings with the fruit of their labor. Even here, however, the game is lacking. Simply slapping up massive quantities of wooden-covered walls and wooden flooring (again, infinite wood->gold->wood loop..) is enough to keep your dwarves beaming from ear to ear, if you're consistent about it.That leaves building a palace for yourself differently on THIS level because you like the pink flooring instead of the black, and playing through the story. The story's not bad, but the characters become long-winded and repetitive at times, and it's not a particularly strong story.Lengthwise, the game feels short, unfortunately. Once you've learned how to break the economy, levels are reduced to mere delay while you wait for your military to be strong enough to steamroll a few foes, then a few more. It's not a bad game, but it's a casual game for new gamers.tl;dr: A tepid recommendation. Not a challenging game, more of a casual building game with a few vestigial combat and research elements.

												Great concept, I really wanted to like this one, but could not. The game is seriously underdeveloped and lacking in all areas - presentation, usability, performance, mechanics, content - it hardly works at all.When I reported a game-breaking bug, the devs didn't even respond, not even to say ""We're sorry, there will be no support for this game"", and that was only a few weeks after release.I truly regret this purchase.
