								People who boost their decks through real cash have the advantage/upper hand against those who don't. Why is that, you ask? Because the match-making system pairs newcomers (with only their starter decks) against these sharkers. If you think it's ""fun"" or ""challenging"" to play against someone who has 40+ arsenal of devastating cards while you've only got a starter deck, then by all means play the game and enjoy in this sadomasochistic merry-go-round. The game has potential, so it's kinda sad to see that pay-2-win and an unfair matchmaking system (there are almost always around ~200 players online, so I don't see why shouldn't a newbie be matched with a newbie) makes it a title to stay clear of... at least until (and if) these issues are adressed properly (alongside the ridiculous paywall for the new heroes.)

								Great game, it's extremely polished, especially for an Early Access game.  Yes, there are glaring bugs that do get annoying, but don't let that stop you from jumping in and having fun.I have actually never played a CCG that was LESS pay to win.  Let me repeat that, this game is absolutely NOT pay to win and those that have stated it is...I'm honestly not sure what they could be talking about.  In the time I've played, already I've crafted all but four of the ""Exotic"" cards that can be crafted.  After 200 matches, I've not gotten every card I've wanted, but I'd say 90% of the current release is sitting in my library.The interface, is very tablet-centric, and I do not like that, however, due to feedback, it seems the next patch will make the interface less tablet focused and be more appealing to the PC gamer.

								Thus far, I'm totally digging this game. It's a good turn-based, strategy game on a grid. The gameplay is reminiscent of Final Fantasy Tactics, so definitely check it out if you loved FFT mechanics and wished it was online and multiplayer.  The battle system is easy enough to pick up and a fun challenge to master. I do have some beef with this game. It's still in the beta stage, so I experienced a few bugs (inability to deploy in the middle of a match or a unit completely disappearing for no reason), but they were few and far between. Although the game is free-to-play, my main beef is that you will need some 'dinero' to compete seriously.Overall, it's a good tactical game and has the potential of being a great tactical game.  Try it. "

								EDIT: I've stopped playing Conquest, so this review may be outdated already (I know 1 or 2 major updates to gameplay have already transpired since this review). It's taking very long in early access, and I would not invest in it unless you're OK with an indefinite release date. there aren't really enough players in game atm to keep a steady flow of live games, and I dont enjoy asynchronous mode with this game.It's currently in early access as I write this review, so there is somewhat of a low population. Worsened by the fact that this is a tactical ccg genre, it is already a smaller niche audience. The matches take very long (20-40 minutes on average). The grind is pretty slow. It is not very pay-2-win, but it is pay to skip or pay to accelerate. You don't have to grind for 3000 gold for a new deck, when you can plop down $5 for that deck. They are intending to give all 3 starter decks for free (which is what they announced for future plans). Buying more cards/decks doesn't necessarily give you an assured win, but it helps to optimize your deck's strategy (boom, rush, turtle, etc). Everything you can buy with real money, you can buy with in-game currency. The deck you will have in a 1-2 month's time, you can get right away by purchasing with real money. But then after 1-2 months of playing, you'll be re-earning tons of cards you've actually bought with card packs.Overall, I am a hardcore fan of the tactics genre, so I will recommend this to other hardcore fans. But I hope they make their game more accessible to the general audience. Games are very long, it is hard to find other new players or AI to practice against, and it will take a few weeks of grinding before you get a really competitive deck.Newbies in particular will have a hard time, since its low population, you will get matched with more experienced players very often. While this may seem very unfair at the start, you will gain a more competitive deck over time and understand the game better by playing better players. I reached top 20 rankings after two weeks of playing, but only after matching top 10 players consistently. It is a shark tank for newbies at the moment, and many do not survive :-) If you don't have the patience or dedication to get through the initial hump, this game probably isn't for you.I was deciding between Conquest, Scrolls and Faeria for a tactical CCG. But Faeria will be in closed beta until end of 2014 and Scrolls is dead, so you might as well try Conquest out anyway, because 1) what's the harm in trying, 2) it's free to try out.  gl hf.			"

								Conquest of Champions is a game that has a lot of shiny things dangling in front of you, but the only way to reach them is by wading through pools of mud. It just makes you go through a lot of hassle to get something you want. That, or you just do it the dirty way by forking over money and gambling for digital cards. And it's for that reason I have a bit of trouble recommending this to people.If you guys want to see the basic gist of the game, here's a quick look video showing off its gameplay and most of its good side. It's long for a quick look, but strategy games always never go quick. And for those of you who like to keep things brief, I'll leave the summary below.


YouTube™ Video: Conquest of Champions: Quick Look 

			Views: 5,969		

			Watch Noble of Lost Pause take a quick look at Conquest of Champions, a free to play strategy trading card game. I say quick because it's a strategy game, and quick doesn't exist in strategy games!		

I'll start by saying the gameplay is solid. The way to win the game is simple, just kill the enemy hero and the towers on their side, but what makes it fun is the mechanics behind it. There's tons of interesting units and spells that do a variety of things, and the units themselves all have specific abilities on top of filling the board. The heroes you control have powerful special abilities and can transform into even bigger monsters that dominate your foes. The resource mechanic of gems, action points, and cards flow well together. Are you out of actions? Then use gems to squeeze 3 more beatings out on your opponent. Running out of cards? Sacrifice one gem to luckily draw the spell you need to finish off a unit. And if you're short on gems, there are plenty of cards that give you more, and units can easily build mines to increase the flow once again. Combine it all together and you got yourself a mashup of meat and magic pounding against each other in the center of the battlefield. And the one named the victor is usually the one with the best chemistry and tactics.But now that I got the reason you should play this game out of the way, I have to tell you about the stuff dragging the game through the dirt.You start the game by selecting a hero out of 3 separate factions (basically the typical fantasy dwarfs, elves, and undead. Nothing new or unique). What you really don't know is that you're choosing the ONLY hero you can play without forking over money or gold. That's right, you pretty much go on a blind date that ends up as a shotgun wedding, so I hope you're happy with what you pick. Sure you can start a new account for free, but why should you have to go through the hassle just to try out another playstyle? And if you do, you won't be able to pool all your cards together from your other accounts, so it highly discourages you from changing right off the bat.Another peeve of mine is most of the cards you get as rewards you can't even use. Imagine how I felt after I played multiple 30 minute matches, opened up a deck with the gold I acquired, and I could only use a SINGLE card out of the 5 given to me. One of the cards was even a component you can only make use of by combining 3 other ones to MAYBE craft a card you need. And even then, you need to level up your hero/faction in order to even craft the bloody thing in the first place. And speaking of crafting, let me tell you a little more on how bad it is. Plain and simple, you cannot craft the all the cards you really want and make the deck that suits your playstyle. Instead, you can only make 4 for the faction you have. And even then they smear dirt in your face because you have to get lucky with crafting drops in order to do it. It's just a sad, sad joke. Now don't get me wrong. I get the reason they do this. It's a FTP game, and they want to make money by charging you for more cards. That's perfectly fine and acceptable. But why should they limit you so greatly to just playing a single hero? Sure I may like him, but I want to see/test if I'd like another one better. I want diversity! What they should be charging for is just cards that tweak each faction, or at least grant us one of each of the factions' heroes so we at least can grasp the basic mechanics behind each one. That way when I get a card for a certain faction, I can actually use the damn thing without it being completely useless to me. I'm even able to overlook the garbage cards you can't use in anything besides crafting if they at least grant you access to other heroes from the very start.And since we're still on the topic of their business model, nothing pisses me off more than a token system that almost NEVER comes out even. This isn't Chuck E. Cheese. There should be straight cash bundles for everything I want. Most people don't want leftover hot dogs without buns. But that's the kind of crap you're gonna be dealing with as you'll have to overbuy crystals in order to get what you really want. It's just dirty business practice.*(updated) It looks like they have some straight cash bundles on steam now, which is a good start. Let's hope they stay there*But still, I think the enjoyment I had in the game outweighed my annoyances. But just marginally. It being a FTP game made that so. I also would've listed that lacking playerbase as a negative since it's so hard to find a match, but with this being released on steam, it will hopefully fix that. That, and they are promising to implement a card auction/trading system, so hopefully that'll also fix the card issues just as long as they don't milk you. It is only early access, and they are probably going to listen to their community so that some of these issues are fixed. If they have good sense, anyway.So all-in-all, I think you should give this game a shot and see if it's for you, just as long as what I listed doesn't bother you. It's still fun and a decent time-waster that'll put your brain to work. And my brain certainly needs work.			"

Early Access Review
								If you're a fan of fast-paced, tactical strategy games (like me) you will find this game to be ... very depressing. There is nothing really wrong with the combat or strategy, but more with the intensity, or in this case, lack there of. If you play this game, I hope you don't have any plans for about the next hour, not because you'll be playing many rounds of this because it's so addicting, but more because it's so slow. I have never been so bored playing a game before. It takes the computer about 10 seconds at least to make a move, when it takes me about 2-5 at most. Many other games (like Civilization) will decide what move to make in about 1 second. When it was my opponents turn, I basically went on YouTube and watch some videos, just to arrive like 5 minutes later to see that my opponent is still moving. My next problem, isn't anything to do with the combat or action, but the game in it's entirety. I found this game to be extremely similar in concept and design, to Mojang's game ""Scrolls"", scaringly similar. But, let's assume this game has no relation to ""Scrolls"" at all. My only other complaint is that there is no way to adjust the sound or music. Yes, you can ""enable"" and ""disable"" it, but no meter or slide to let you increase or decrease audio to your liking. In the end, I'd have to give this game a 4/10, and that's being a little nice. The slow-paced combat just takes so much out of the game, and the resembalence to ""Scrolls"" is a bit concerning. However, this game is ""free to play"", and it doesn't take up a lot of space on your computer. So, I'd say, install the game, play it yourself, and if you don't like it, at least you didn't get ripped off by having to pay $20 or worse. If you like the game ""Scrolls"" you might enjoy this ... however you likely will not.			"

								Don't listen to the negative reviews! This is a good game, the negative reviews seem very inaccurate.  I doubt they even gave the game a real chance. Give it a try for yourself because I found the game quick and easy to get started and satisfying and rewarding to play.  Even though you have a fun and complete game to play here, it is still also being worked on and improved, so it will only get better... there is little to lose in giving this game a try for a couple of weeks.  It really doesn't take much time and it becomes even more fun when you get the hang of things, which isn't tough at all.			"

								I've been playing CCGs since the first year of Magic and Spellfire(TSR's CCG based on D&D characters) so it takes alot for me to get excited about a CCG since I've seen everything done before.  The bad reviews for this game almost made me pass it up and that would truly have been a shame because I would have missed out on such a gem.  This game has everything.  Upgradeable cards, asynchronious play,  a good mix of ccg and board game elements, and a micro- reward system.  Every turn you play you get something.  It might be some gold or some clan experience(which lets you craft better clan specific units), crafting material or even a random card.Yes, there is some pay to win aspects.  However, all content can be bought with in game currency so it will just take you a bit longer to get something if you don't want to pay.  From what I see it does not cause an imbalance.  I have not paid a cent and  have played 10 games so far and have won 9 of them.  The other downside is that the playerbase is small right now.  I went from ranked 580 with 1 win to ranked 205 in two hours of playing,  however there are usually between 20-25 players on at any given time.Overall a great CCG and I highly recommend it. "

My only complain is that the quick matches are too long for me personally.The shortest quick match i did was 1 hour.Maybe they should reduce the turn timer.So thats my minor complain.Everything else is awesome.Love the graphics style too.

								If you look for a card game that allows for deep tactical combat and both rapid and drawn-out battles, you should try Conquest out. The game is free, rewards you with enough to not have a big advantage over people who buy booster-packs and is pretty stable software-wise. Since I initially wrote this review, there has been a major update, which made the game even more rewarding gold-wise (The currency you buy everything with in-game).The last major problem I saw was the amount of players online at any given time. This gets better pretty fast now and the time spent in the queue waiting for a match is going down constantly. The option to play an extended match, where both opponents have 3 days for their respective turns helps a lot with still being involved, as you can have a lot of them running at the same time against players who you'd never meet online!7/10 and on a good way to ascend further.

								Omg, love this game. For those of you claiming it's a pay to win, let me clear up a few things. First of all, the payed features are mostly fair in that almost all parts of the game are acessible for free, albeit with a bit of playtime. I got the game yesterday, I play for free, and I'm already 267 on the leaderboards, so you can't really say it's pay to win. Second, it was stated on the conquest of champions announcements forum that all the heros would be available for free after the beta. So the pay features will become free after beta.Now that I've cleared up that little tid bit, let's talk about the gameplay. The game is a very fun, and doing well for being in beta. There are a decent amount of cards out right now, and more to be released soon(I'm fairly sure by the end of the month, I could be wrong.) There are a couple of issues such as servers bugging out every once in a while, and the fact that the community is a bit small right now, but other than that, the game is very well made. I would definitely reccomend it. 4/5 right now, hope to see it made into a 5/5.			"

								only a c ouple of hours in, the game seems ok, but as an early access game it is a bit rough around the edges! (Note, if you try this, start your three extended games first to 'activate' the pracise button >.<)alot of it is confusing at first, there's little to no explanation on what the icons are or how it affects things (differing attack types for example), debuffs and buffs should be more easily visible...only real gripe is that the game seems to go unbearabley slow as far as progression goes, maybe a one off 'newbie' pack of cards for a small amount in the store (e.g, 100 gold for 5 cards, with one random rare), to give you an idea of acquiring cards and mixing things up, and prevent the uphill struggle that is practise AI with a full level 2 deck and exotics versus your stater decks, or the mass grind to afford your first upgrade.. will keep an eye on this one, provided it keeps a good balance and it's not too paywallish, might be worth a go!

								This is the best free-to-play turn based tactics game out there at the moment.Much deeper than Aerena and more concise than Dogz of War or any of the others.For those claiming this game is pay-to-win...that's a load of utter garbage.In two weeks I've gone from rank noob straight into the top 20 playing nothing more than a slightly modified starter deck without spending any money whatsoever. It just takes a little bit of time to find out what works and what does not. The tutorial and practice mode aren't great so you do have to put SOME effort into learning how to play the game yourself (people tend to be happy to offer advice too). And off course you have to be somewhat competent at tactics games to begin with.Also have no idea what kind of matchmaking problems people were talking about but they appear to have been solved. The game only ever paired me with people roughly equal in rank.As for time...most quick matches take about 20-30 minutes on average which I don't find excessively long for a turn based game.And a little bit of advice for new players to start out with: Take the enhancements out of your starter deck as soon as possible and replace them with whatever free soldiers or spells you might have gotten (you get FREE CARDS just for playing the game, one free card, leveling component, gold reward or experience every TURN of the game you complete and five more at the end if you win).

								I actually highly reccomend this game! It draws a favorable comparison to hero academy, and at the moment seems fairly balanced and fresh. The progression system of unlocking new cards and so on, crafting cards, and ect keeps you interested rather than just competition for the hell of it. Starting off you get a full fresh deck that can hop in immediately versus any developed deck and probably do pretty well haha.Gameplay wise it's pretty unique and hard to describe it's deck based grid warfare to put it shortly.

								***UPDATED***       ***REVIEW*** It's been awhile since I last played, I'll be updating the review as I continue playing now. So there's been alot of new updates, new expansion was released, lots of things changed, etc. The UI of the game looks great, I can expect it to look fantastic later but it's a good improvementright now. There are rewards for playing everyday and milestones for tons of things like transformingyour hero x amount of times, killing this and that x amount of times, etc. I find quick matches pretty much instantly, extended match still takes awhile but you can just queue a bunch of times and they will most likely be filled up within a day. The game lets you buy heroes and card packs with in-game currency now so you don't NEED to spend money! They also give crystals as rewards which is great!Overall, this game is just getting better and better and it's still unfinished. I'd recommend this game to any fan of Strategy games.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Disregard what's written below, that is a review from a long long long time ago when the game wasnearly released.This game is absolutely amazing. In its Early Access version, there are bugs but many players including me post on the forums about what's up and the devs quickly try to get everything fixed. There's currently 2 modes you can play which is 'quick match' and 'extended match'. Quick matches are timed and usually end within 10-30 minutes. Extended matches last days because once you take your turn you can log out or do something else until your opponent takes their turn. I love logging in everyday to take my turn for 20-40 extended matches. It just gives me something more to do everyday. There are currently 3 factions in this game each with 2 different Heroes of each faction and tons of units to select from. You choose a hero and 29 other cards to fill your deck with because 30 is the minimum deck amount but of course you can have a 100 card deck if you wanted to. You get a reward for each turn you take in the game whether it's a card, gold to buy from the store or faction XP to level up or a crafting material which is used to craft cards for each faction. Separating my collection of cards into different decks and testing them is really satisfying and it makes me want to play more. The devs are working hard on the expansion for the game which has more cards and heroes I think and it will be so exciting as this game develops. The community for this game is great too, there's no trash-talking, just friendly chatting and fun. I'd recommend this game to any fan of Strategy games.			"

								Combining turn based boardplay with a cardgame is what Conquest of Champions is all about.Unique design of having animated characters on a battlefield while you control them and shape how your enemy plays with different cards and objectives that are placed on the map. It can sound a little complicated to some, but fear not young lad! for this game has a quick and easy tutorial to teach you how to play, and if this isn't enough for you then just hop into the campaign, sure its boring and kinda tedious but it will give you much needed practice in the ways of warfare. The game is easy to learn and pick up, putting emphasis on not being complicated. It also is very laid back, allowing you to have up to 30 different games VS people going at the same time, which you can play at your leisure and can take days to complete. If your more in a hurry, just play a quick match and hop into a real time game.Some negatives about CoC is the very low player base, peaking on steam at just around 200 people. The campaign, though good for practice, is incredibly boring and hard to finish.It's free and unique so give it a go and see what happens.Personal Rating 2/5			"

								Game has a great tactics system backed up with deck building.  Themed approach to deck building which is a great thought out process by the development team.  Simple startup and go with minimal learning curve.  The ability to redo turns felt slightly cheaty in the beginning but actually ""taught"" me more of the indepth decision making moving and casting and positiong can do to help your summoned army win.  Only real con is that player base seems kinda small.  Main reason for writing the post is to encourage players that enjoy TCG and Tactics games to give this one a go.			"

								Ultimately a let-down. I spent a lot of time on this game and it's not without its merits, but it's getting boring, the 2nd expansion is taking FOREVER to arrive and worst of all, the changes they made to the game's economy to make it DRASTICALLY less F2P and more P2W are repulsive and inexcusable.I DO like the feature that allows you to play PvP games against an opponent 1 turn at a time spaced over the period of several days. I think that's brilliant. And I also like the ability to ""undo"" your turn when playing these spaced-out games or against the computer, where you have no turn timer, because the game is very calculating and it's easy to make minor slip-ups that can cost you terribly. But on a technical level the game is appalling- the controls are clunky (OK, so if I want to look at an enemy unit I need to left-click on it, but if I have a creature of my own selected and it's in attack range it'll attack it instead, so I need to right-click it instead), the art is terrible (only hero cards even HAVE ""art"", the rest just have a picture of the dull and interchangeable sprites) and there are numerous bugs. The strategic gameplay has a modest and enjoyable level of depth, but it's ultimately not enough to engage for long.If the management of the game had been a bit better, if they hadn't decided they weren't screwing their players hard enough and hadn't taken forever with the 2nd expansion, I might have stuck with this game a bit longer. Alas, I'm just too bored with it to continue.ADDENDUM: Oh yeah, and despite still supposedly being in ""Early Access"", the game hasn't been updated since APRIL. It's dead.			"

								It's free so if you like TB stratergy/CCG games stop reading this, give it a go and make up your own mind.That being said, I think this is a pretty good game if you invest some time into it. It's one of the most balanced CCG games i've played in a while with the free decks being just as good as the bought ones if played right. E.G. Free heros have cheaper but weaker units so can rush effectively early game but the bought ones have more expensive and powerful units which can win out over numbers if played right. But the free/bought argument isn't so much of an issue as in every game i've played i've earned at least 1 card during game play and if you win you get another 5 random cards, so as you play you can build and edit your decks. You also earn gold which can be spent on new heros and decks, it accumulates slowly around 50-100 per match i've found but you can get rewarded with more as you level up/play the game daily.The drawback I've found so far is that there isn't a trading system implemented yet, which is a shame but they do plan on adding that to the game. But apart from that it looks like it'll turn out to be a pretty good game aslong as they keep content from all expansions available to F2P players and keep it balanced. =)			"

								Good game.Its a strategy game like Heroes might and magic (I/II/III/IV/V/VI) i liked those type of games it brings my childhud back.The strategy in this game is first try to kill the hero ofguarg, always attack first and look at their speed so you know how much can they move and their range.After a succesfull hero kill try not to make your hero die evolve him to epic mode.Then just charge like a mad cow on their towers but be carefull have a strategy always think a head whats going to happen if you move someone or attack with someone.The only thing i hate obout this game is its a little pay to win, if someone is crazy for this game and buis all sh*t theres no way for you ti win.Also if you have 2 same creatures, monsters, demons you cant have more, what i do is i turn them in to xp for the other monsters, demons and if you have multiple items you can have them more but i also turn them in to xp.And also i pefer the undead cuz theres 1 demon that when hes attacked he cant be attacked again and if the ennemis tower is low hp just charge like a mad cow at it they cant attack you.Srry for my pro english :(			"

								The game itself is pretty good, but its the only game I've ever heard of to release an ""expansion pack"" while the game was still in beta. I gave the developers $19.99 when this game 1st came on Steam, and there was talk of making people pay again for an ""expansion"" while the game is STILL to this day in beta. The whole moneymaking sceme of this game turned me off and I quit playing because of it. I see they gave the ""expansion"" content to people that paid for the pack that I did, but the damage was done already in my case, cause I'd be damned if I gave them 20 bucks for a game still in beta, and then have them try to charge me again for an ""expansion"" while the game was still IN beta...if a game is in beta...its not an EXPANSION...its adding more content for the official release. When I paid for Minecraft, they didnt say...oh! we are putting horses in the game...but only if you pay us another 20 bucks before release. There was some good strategy involved in playing this game, and it was decent, but since the talk of a paid ""expansion"" while still in beta, I havent touched this game on principle, so even though they added the content in question to those that paid, the developers can take my 20 bucks, but also my bad review, and the fact I'm unable to recommend the game with the glimpses into the plans they had rolling in their heads about how to make the most money they could before the game was even out...Here's a tip...if you need money for development of a game, dont make early access FREE TO PLAY, make the finished product free to play, and give the people that paid you money early, some kind of bonus for backing your project. I followed this game early, the plans the developers had, and what they saw for the future, it wasn't a pretty picture for people paying to play it, and the incentive to pay wasn't there...so just go F2P on this one, and take out of it what you can, while you can, cause I dont see this game being around very long if they try to screw the people giving them money to cater to the free to play people who whine about the game being pay to win.

								Don't know if I can recommend it yet. I don't like the business model at all, and I'm not talking about the ability to buy cards/decks/in-game currency with real money, that's expected, but just the way it's setup forces you to pay extra for specific things you want so they can get a little extra money (a lot of games do this, but it's still unacceptable to me imo). Scroll down further for a brief explanation of gameplay if you just don't care about my gripes with the way the purchases are setup.Here is the current tier (gems are the premium in-game currency to buy things like decks):$2 = 12 gems$5 = 35 gems$15 = 120 gems$35 = 320 gemsSo how much do hero decks and card packs cost?6 card pack (3 common, 2 uncommon, 1 ""mine"" card) = 10 gems""Deluxe"" 7 card pack (1 rare, 2 uncommon, 3 common, 1 mine) = 25 gemsNot too bad there right? Slightly cheaper than real life booster packs.Hero decks which include a hero card and around 30 other cards (it varies) cost 40 gems. Already I hate this just because there is no gem tier where you can buy this with, you either have to spend 7 dollars or 15 dollars. To me this is a shady tactic to try and get people to spend more money since you get more for your money as the price goes up.Aside from that though, each Hero deck varies quite a bit but are priced the same which makes no sense to me. For example, Krak Ironbark and Declan Ravenshoe come with 34 cards each, only 4 uncommon cards and the rest common. Blight Mistmantle comes with 36 cards, 7 which are uncommon and 2 rare. The cards aren't random so I'm not sure why they are all priced equally. Either way, it just rubs me the wrong way.You can also buy gold, the normal in-game currency for real money too.12 gems = 6k35 gems = 17.5k120 gems = 60k320 gems = 160kThere is a normal card pack with 5 randoms that's 1000 gold, aside from that I'm not sure if there's anything else you can spend gold on. Crafting and fusion doesn't appear to take gold, this may change later. This might be a huge disadvantage for people who can't or don't want to spend real money. 5 dollars for 17 card packs with gold seems quite significant.====================GameplayThe overall idea is pretty neat. You deploy cards as units on a battlefield, there are spawnpoints you can capture so you can deploy cards closer to the enemy, you can capture mines to increase your resource generation, your hero card can... ""transcend"" into whatever if you accumulate enough extra resources (ones you don't use get added to your hero, you need 10 to transcend). I say transcend in quotes because I was expecting something epic to happen, I'm not sure ANYTHING happened visually because I couldn't see any difference. I may have blinked and missed it and it was so similar that it didn't look like anything happened, or nothing simply happened and it just gained an extra ability/damage.There are some interesting card combos as the undead so far and I haven't run into many issues aside from the tutorial freezing when loading level 2 and having to start over again. Luckily they're short.As of right now there are only 70 players online, the nice thing is that you can have matches over the course of several hours or days and Steam will notify you when it's your turn. This is a cool mechanic that you don't see too often in games. The only thing I can think of off the top of my head that still does this are probably facebook games like scrabble, and I know a few rts games might still do this. You can play live as well.Matchmaking might be a huge issue for some people. I honestly don't know if there is any matchmaking at all beyond simply pairing you up with completely random people out of everyone who's online. Matches can take quite a long time, the timer for each move is around 2 minutes 30 seconds and most of the time either you or your opponent will use up most of that timer (at least when you start out, I'm sure later you will go through turns faster). Another cool thing during matches though is that you seem to get random cards or gold or exp after every turn. I'm not sure how great of a card you can get but it's still nice.====================Overall thoughtsOverall, it's pretty fun and I do like the idea, however, I can't speak much about the matchmaking and that sort of stuff because 80-90% of the people online are complete newbies so you're likely to face off against one of them. That means I have no idea if the match making is good or bad until it makes me play against someone that's obviously way higher ranked. I also can't speak about how the in-game purchases with real money affect the game overall. To me it is a bit concerning so I would be cautious about it.The game is a very small install, I think 200-300mb, so it's at the very least worth a try if the gameplay sounds interesting to you. It might be a good game to play casually using the extended match feature, but I can't imagine how long those would take to complete if my first game took me around an hour to finish.====================(Initially I was going to give this a ""No"" for the recommendation, at the last minute I am changing it to a yes just because there is plenty to like about it and it's such a small download that it's at least worth a TRY. For long term or serious play I don't think I could recommend it, so make your own decision based on this and other reviews.I obviously haven't played it that long, maybe after more games and 5-10 hours of gameplay my recommendation could easily turn into a solid ""No"" but I don't think I will play it that long and I don't feel like it's fair to not recommend the game based off of assumptions of what the game will be like 5 hours from now, whether that means discovering the match making sucks or it's too ""pay to win"")			"

								First sight kinda simple game, but after played it, more complex than i though..The good one is you don't need money to win, or at least this game is still competitive even you can't spend money to get cards..Well it's a beta so i can't say much for the game play, but you need more cards (i think about 200-300 cards) to play so every people can make different deck and can make the game more addicting..I hope i can buy crystal with steam wallet because i don't have any paypal, amazon, or credit. Maybe quest for crystal? :3Overall is so-so, but looks promising and probably can become addictive game depending on how you develop it in the future.EDITED: hmm.. we need a trading card, well some player need some cards for crafting.. Also delete some review following the game updates.Keep works!			"

								A great mix of Magic/TCG and turn-based tactics, I strongly recommand it !Made by the creators of Pox Nora, which learned from their mistakes and improved on its strong points !Easy to play, but deep and challenging !Not many bugs despise being still in early access, already very fun and addictive !Possibility of playing casual matches at your rythm (like Chess PBM) and to redo turns to correct your mistakes, so very casual-friendly !Each matche is like a little wargame, with your troops and their special powers to manage the best way to beat your opponent, a real must play for strategy fans !It's NOT PAY-TO-WIN at all, I reached Top 10 of rankings with a 80% W/L ratio in just a a few months without spending a cent yet, just to prove this point.You can buy card packs with in-game money you earn in matchs and solo quests and even craft cards using components you also get, but even without most of the rarest cards you can build a competitive deck, it's just a question of skills !Quite similar in concept to Scrolls, but much better gameplay-wise for those who like me tried Scrolls  and got desappointed...

								First sight kinda simple game, but after played it, more complex than i though..The good one is you don't need money to win, or at least this game is still competitive even you can't spend money to get cards..Well it's a beta so i can't say much for the game play, but you need more cards (i think about 200-300 cards) to play so every people can make different deck and can make the game more addicting..I hope i can buy crystal with steam wallet because i don't have any paypal, amazon, or credit. Maybe quest for crystal? :3Overall is so-so, but looks promising and probably can become addictive game depending on how you develop it in the future.EDITED: hmm.. we need a trading card, well some player need some cards for crafting.. Also delete some review following the game updates.Keep works!			"

								Before the last update I would have recommended this game.They have changed the pricing so you now pay more and get less. More things can now only be purchased with crystals, so you either pay $$$ or grind forever.Can not purchase individual cards. You may get lucky and get 1 or 2 cards per pack that you actualy want. Replaced AI practice matches with short campaigns that use different rules than PVP (would have been better as a addition instead of an replacement).Very buggy - 6 hot fixes since patch. Have had to force close game. After the latest patch it will make it harder to get new players			"

								I bought the 20$ bundle. It abled me to do alot more then with out it, I highly recommend buying it. IF you plan on playing this game. Also it might not be a pay 2 win game. And note all content you are paying for is strictly, early acess and convince this isnt a real TCG its more of like pay for content, in a few months the content is then released as a earnable reward. To continue where i left off, even tho its not p2w its now became a grind to win game. So unless you have tons of time to grind, this isnt the game for you. Will be very expensive.			"

								Well, for anyone that ever found the least bit of joy in Pox Nora, this game is worth checking out. They've solved pretty much all of the root causes that created problems in Pox, and they've deepened the strategy to boot. The visual style is not to my personal liking, but the game more than makes up for it in my eyes.And for people that never played Pox Nora: This is how CCGs should be made. Plain and simple. There's a strategic depth here that you will not find in any other game, and a tactical depth that is just about as immense. Give it a try! It can be played without spending a dime, so checking it out is really bloody simple. That said, if you want to invest any significant time and effort into it you should probably consider at least a buy-in big enough to get a few additional heroes.Pros:- Strategic and tactical depth on a level you will not find anywhere else- The ""extended game"" play mode that lets you take turns when you have time.- Ability to play the game on an even level with either no, or very small, monetary investment- A development team that are ridiculously quick at fixing bugs that the players report (as in, a couple of days)Cons:- The visual style is kind of meh- Still in development, so plenty bugs for everyone- Rather shallow card pool for now. First expansion isn't that far off though, so not a real con.- The amount of actual work you'll get done is in severe jeopardy. You have been warned!			"

								Gave the game a fair shake, and I have a few things to say about it, just to let you all know before hand I can't reccomend this game, please read below to find out why.First of all the play by post kinda system is nice but at the same time, I know that some people that might give it a try may forget about the game and thus leave people hanging for a while.Second the art is okay but could be better(some ""card"" are missing their hands, almost the whole fibian race cards for instance). That said I realize this is early access and hopefully it will be fixed.Third, this game smells a lot like a pay to advance in some ways, as you can buy crystals with real money to buy booster packs that have assured better cards, and the cost in gold (the in game earned money) for a booster pack is very high to the point I think it was done as a way to incentivise the cash grab boosters in conjunction with the assured better cards in the real money bought boosters.Now it's not quite pay to win since the cards are moved on a tactical map and stratigy has some element in the game, (and a overly strong card, and even your hero can be curbstomped by a swarm of smaller cheaper units) but eventually those stronger cards do tell especially when the smaller units start dropping like flies. so the ""Buy to advance"" is a factor.also Everything that would make getting better cards easier is locked behind level advancement (which can take a bit) preventing you from crafting new cards till level 4, and then fusing cards at level 5, While it's good to see some advancement, it shouldn't sacrifice the ability to get more cards to do so, IMHOnot to mention it looks quite like a mobiel port, but that's an art choice I am assuming (for now) and I am also assuming they are going to increase the quality of the art and the like (after all it is early access) so I haven't really judged it on that)On the psotive side the game is a bit on the fun side of things, and it's free to play so can't argue with that. But that's kinda where the good ends as it's just the rest of the game is hidden behind a level grind, and the ""pay to advance"" aspect for new booster cards that stabs this game in the foot.in the end untill some changes are made to the booster pack shop and the buy to advance aspect is toned down quite a bit I cannot reccomend this game,			"

								Another neat little hex tile tactical turn based combat game, done in a collectible card game style. Not bad, progression seems very slow, and after playing for a few days i still hadn't unlocked all the features such as crafting.  Maybe you'll love it, it just didn't draw me in. After digging into it a little it just didn't keep my attention. Maybe it was the sometimes long delays in waiting for opponents to take their turn, or maybe it's just me not being into games focused mainly on pvp.			"

								Highly recommend.  I hope to be playing this one for a long time.  Turn based card/chess game.  Pros-Very easy to pick up, I felt like an adequate player after a handful of games-standard pve 'practice mode'-'quick match' feature which is like speed chess, you've got 2 minutes to a turn.  EVERY turn you and your opponent get in-game cash, upgrade tokens for your cards, XP OR new card.  Huge motivator to play these ranked games.-LIMITED movement.  You don't get to move every single peice each turn, you've got a set number of 'actions' you can do each turn, so around mid-game you have to start parsing them out wisely to your pieces and choose which abilities to use strategically.  Combine this with huge boards, a mana pool where any overflow POWERS your hero's 'special' power and you've got limitless strategies and counter strategies.-Ranking system of course-You can 'level' up your cards by sacrificing other extra cards or special cards which are only used for that purpose.  I've got half my deck leveled up to 2 a few hours into the game.  So this moves at a good pace and allows you to actually feel some progress.-Quests-The awesomely unique feature of this game is the 'extended game' mode, which is basically a shoutout to the old correspondence chess games.  You and your opponent take turns playing OFFLINE.  Meaning you can take as long as you want on a turn, then leave the game, and they'll be sent an email to either/both their steam account and/or registered email account.  Then they can login when they want to play.  3 days without a turn = forfeit.  Its a really nice option for a lot of the 25-50yr crowd who have jobs and don't have hours to sit and playCons-There is no 'practice' mode vs players.  This is a HUGE drawback as you can only test out a deck vs AI.-Limited number of players.  I only saw 20-40 players at a time, that was the full spectrum of all ranked, so that means youve only got max 10-15ish people at your level online at any given moment for a quick match.  There appear to be 1000+ people on the ranked boards.  Hard to tell.-Takes a LONG LONG time to get a new 'leader' which allows you to adjust your playstyle (I have 200 gold after several hours, it takes 3000-4000 for just one hero).  And I mean it may take weeks, so you're basically stuck with the deck you start with.  May want to read some reviews/forums before you pick one.  They need a 'discount' on the second leader you buy or gold needs to drop just a bit more frequently.-Takes a LONG time to buy any decent packs.  Can get the cheapo ones, but you may just end up with upgrades instead of usable cards.  -1/3 of all cards that drop will be for the deck you are using.  The other 2/3 will be for the decks you can't use until you can buy a new hero.  -Of the 1/3 cards that drop for your deck, I'm seeing maybe 1/5 to 1/10 that are NOT duplicates that you can't use, since you can use only 2 of each card.  Your deck grows very very slowly.-Heavy potential for pay to play.  But there are lots of opportunities to outsmart your opponent.-I'm not sure about the ranking system yet, my first match I was throw in with someone that had literally twice as many cards as I did.  I totally held my own, but given how few players there are online, I feel like this has the possibility of repeating itself too often.The cons are frustratingly significant, but the actual games are diametrically just as great.  There's deep strategy in the placement of the actionable items on the board combined with spells, spawn nodes, playable cards, enchantments and your hero.  You need a LOT of patience, but I think it's worth it.  The upside also being that ALL the cons could be easily fixed/tweaked.  No clue how responsive devs are to feedback.  More players would honestly make a serious dent in the cons.			"

								Ok, so this is really a fun game at it's core.  PLay cards to get minions, and then send them out to kill the opponent.  Overall a pretty straightforward game.  The multi player can be done live(not often) or over a span of several days.(where you'll find most of your battles.)  The only real gripe I have is the content itself, or lack thereof.  There has only been one expansion to the game, at least that I've seen.  Also, the content that is available can only be accessed by either a MASSIVE grind to get gold, or by shelling out real money.  As a follow up to Pox Nora, this game is great, and has a lot of potential.  I just hope that like Pox Nora, the devs continue to supplement the base game.			"

								As of 11/14/15 and before, this is my favorite game on Steam. Awesome. Free to play and very fun. A collectible fantasy themed card game with tactical battle board resolution. Turn based tactics. Army composition strategy. Loads of free content. Play the computer or take turns in multiple games online. Dwarves, woodlanders and dark foes.Strategy, tactics, customization, fun play modes, collecting, crafting, all make up this game. What you have are battles to fight with prior selections of troops and items themed how you want, your card deck(s). You play out the battle on a grid battlefield where you capture resources and deployment spaces while denying them to your opponent. Feints, evasion, subterfuge, gear, are all considerations; as is your soldiers' ability to leap, fly or fire ranged attacks.Fun Play Modes: Play live games with a two minute turn time limit or play several games turn by turn without a time limit, turns sent to multiple opponents. Each battle you can play a different deck, and a deck from any one of three factions.Collecting: You begin with a starter deck and as you play you earn free cards, free game gold and free game crystals, with which you can purchase additional cards, avatars and other heroes. You also earn free component cards that can be crafted into special soldier cards and other items. All of this is free.Tactics: Which soldiers will you gear up, use together, or send out on their own? Do you need to grab territory or resouces, defend, raid the enemy stronghold or pursue their hero quickly? It's up to you and how you theme and build your army. There are sneak attacks, misdirection, counter attacking and luring into traps.Strategy: Build a deck with soldiers and items of your choosing. You want a mob army? Elites? Flyers? Powerhouses? It's your decision. Will you rush for and deny resources, territory or have a slow moving tough battle line? This is for you to decide with each battle to be fought. Playing the computer in the Campaign mode allows you to try out various combinations.Customization: You choose one of three factions but you can play all of them. There is a number of free avatars, others you can purchase with earned game gold. But as you can have a number of saved decks, you can have multiple themes, everything from low cost troops, to fast or ranged troops, or certain types or races of troops.Crafting: Playing gets you component cards that you can combine into special soldier cards. While they are stronger, they have a higher cost to field in battlefield resources. Soldiers you can get on the field are important so special soldiers take consideration in including in your deck. Your other soldiers can be leveled up by the Fusion option, the combining of duplicate cards to nuance your soldier cards. It is for you to decide whether it is worth it to level a card up as it comes with increased battlefield resource cost.If you like strategy, turn based tactical combat, a fantasy theme or customized gameplay you might enjoy Conquest of Champions. It has all of these well represented and is free to play.			"

								Even though i enjoyed this game, i still can not recommend it, as it is too much F2P for my taste.I mean, F2P is ALWAYS a pain, and a big minus for every game, as it basically means: One player has an advantage over the other.Players who pay the most have the biggest advantage, followed by players who play the most.It may be welcome for people with lots of free time, or who are willing to spend lots of cash into a single game, but im none of those and greatly dislike that model.And then, ABOVE all that, theres even more pay-and-play-to-win with the option to level cards, which means:Cards can be sacrificed, to make other cards stronger. That makes Conquest of Champions very unprofessionel and a very unsatisfying experience for me.			"

								There is a lack game content, very few card choices and even fewer for heros.  Most of the game is locked/limited to the free to player and requires the player to buy in game currency to achieve any new hero, leaving you with only 1 hero per faction for ftp. Although i have been informed they plan to put in more content and make it more earnable, i feel that pay to win players may still have an advantage with money only heroes. If they would change this so everything would be unlockable,except for comsmetics, it would be much better in my opinion			"

								* Everything is slow in this game. You'll probably fall asleep before the end of the tutorial.* The interface is horribly designed, unresponsive at times, and buggy. * AI sucks, and it's definitively P2W in multiplayer. Send them lots of cash if you have any intention of winning unless you're a masochist and like to play a mess of an AI.I can not recommend this ""game"". It was plain boring, too slow, unbalanced between free and paid players.			"

								It does have pay to win elements, but if you don't care about being #1 on the leaderboard, its really enjoyable.Without spending a cent you can easily beat all the AI with few practice games.You can upgrade your units fairly quickly with the free turn based loot drop system.Even with buying a bunch of cards, they will only be level 1, so you will still have to play to get loot to upgrade them anyway.The match maker is fairly fast, 1-2 minutes it seems, and currently you can play 30 ""extended matches"" at a time, with the devs saying that will be gradually raised in the future.There is a stack of features still in the works, just read the page, they sound amazing, but it's already really solid.I have played a stack of these card games, and this one does the tile based combat system the best I have ever seen, and for a ftp its as fair as it gets, without being really dull like Scrolls.8.5/10  -As a game.10/10   -Compared to other games in this genre.

								Yet another pay to win game.  I enjoy the game play, simplistic as it is, but since this is multiplayer only I find it hard to compete with others with the stock set of cards.  It would be an enjoyable time killer, but for seriously competitive players, I'd have to give it a pass.			"

								I thought I had liked it. You can see my buddy Roder has a top review here, and I agree with most of what he said.The gameplay is pretty fun, I don't mind long, thoughtful fights. I thought the mechanic they had going for them (where you take your turn and then can come back hours/days later to play again) was really smart and it kept the game w/it's none-too-large player base interesting.But heaven forbid you get sick or have to work, or possibly even have a life. I was in the top 40 - rank 32, couldn't play for a few days, came back and every match I was in I apparently auto forfeited, down to 117th! I was winning 80% of those, hands down.I foolishly put a few bucks into this for heroes. Considering the multitude of hours they just threw away. I can honestly say - F*ck this game.			"

								If your a hard core strategy fan who loves every strategy game ever, than you'll like it.  Otherwise, its a little boring.  The battles tend to be generic and unintersting.  And pretty much every fight went the same way.  Kill each others heros, then I make a mad dash for my opponents shrines (goals).  Add to that the game plays increadibly slowly, and it makes for a really boring experience.			"

								As a critic, I know that there are a lot of terrible indie games, and this one isn't exactly terrible; it's just mediocre. The reason why is because this game is clearly a COMPLETE RIP-OFF of the ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" games, which are actually better, (even though they have to be bought, in order to be played) and of course, they don't make you spend money, just to play as another faction, than the one YOU JUST CHOSE. My advice? RUN AWAY FROM THIS UGLY PIECE OF CRAP; THIS GAME IS SO LAME, THAT EVEN THE WII GAME ""Sonic and the Black Knight"" IS ACTUALLY BETTER-LOOKING THAN THIS!			"

								This is my favorite strategy game right now.  You collect cards that can be units, items, or spells.  Use these cards on a battlefield grid against your opponent.  You move all your units and take actions in one round, then it's your opponent's move.  The goal is to kill their leader and destroy their shrine.  There are three factions to play (Dwarves, Elves, Demons) and each faction have multiple leaders and their distinct units and spells.Later on you can upgrade your unit cards up to five levels.  Although, the best part of the game is when everybody is at level one and experimenting with their decks.  Don't need to pay to win because I've reached top rank without paying for cards.  Although buying lots of cards is a definite advantage.  You get rewards for just playing.+ Great turn based strategy+ You have several days to take a turn and check back when it's your move+ Fun getting new cards			"

								This game has unethical developers. I had 17k gold saved for packs, they updated the game for the new expansion, they then took away 9/10 of my gold and only dropped the price of ONE of the packs by 1/5, therefore screwing me out of my gold that I could have bought twice as many packs for. Avoid this piece of ♥♥♥♥ unethical game at all costs, the devs will just screw you. If you already play and have any self-respect you will uninstall this game now. These developers are a$$holes and just want to greedily take you money. F that ♥♥♥♥.			"

								Greetings all,Previous reveiw below..and still like the game BUT... BIG BUT...  the last patch ruined it.  1. Pre spawned guys = total change to deck play and construction and even more advantage for player who goes first ... 2. Changed new card aquisition.  Now you can only really have a chance at an exotic IF you spend really money.. .Pay to win anyone?   3.  As a player who has almost every card and need just 2 or 3 more exotics to have them all I have virtually no hope of ever getting them... I will constantly get cards I already have lots of copies of.  As a new player YOU HAVE NO chance vs the old guard who already have the exotics...  unless you spend say 1000$ on gems...  yeah right...Willl check back in a few months to see if devs fix this colossal error.EWWWell I have been playing for about 3 weeks now.   Please remember the game is in BETA still so changes are being tried out and  adjustments are being made.  The Dev's have listened to the community.  --The matchmaking is better.  Not perfect but improving.  --After recent patch they quickly got feedback that income (mana) was too low and hot fixed it that day.  Yes if you spend a fortune in $$$ you will have good cards... That won't make you good.  In my first week and a half I lost games to guys with better cards not better strategy.  I did not have a rare or exotic card in my deck.  I still got to rank 37.Today I have built some good cards... Spent 20$ to support developement and have 3 competative decks...  As of writing this review I am ranked #1 (for last 2 days). The game is NOT ""pay to win""  It is fun.  Crafting and Fusion (upgrading your cards) require you to play games to get materials.The Extended mode is one of my favorite game types... load up 50 games vs a variety of opponents.  Play your turn and come back in a few hours play them again.  Best option for new players to get cards and experience.EWW			"
