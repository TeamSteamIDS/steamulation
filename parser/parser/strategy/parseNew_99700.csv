												NightSky is a well-crafted little physics puzzler. You maipulate a small sphere through a series of 2D mazes with obstacles and puzzles. In a single sentence: ""Limbo"" meets ""The Ball"". The visuals are striking. It looks like perpetual sunset, with silohuettes of Edward Gorey-style monsters lurking in the background, which are actually more interesting than the game itself. Good sound, too.Pretty good game on the cheap if you like environmental puzzlers. "

												I'm not normally a fan of physics-based puzzle games but this puzzle platformer is charming, smart and well-crafted. Most levels require precise platforming skills but it's still a thinking man's game. I've played other games by Nifflas and his distinct style of gameplay, graphics  and music once again work in so many levels. Recommended.P.S. You need 12 stars to unlock all the stages in the last level. You can go back anytime you want but I recommend collecting them as you progress because getting to the last level and realizing you need the stars to fully complete the game can be an unpleasant surprise (as it was for me).

												While I certainly won't say I necessarily agree with the price of this game (especially since I got it from a humble bundle pretty cheap), I will say that this is a very nice, relaxing game that's definitely worth a playthrough.It's a very simple game, so don't expect any super in-depth challenging gameplay out of this, however there are a few moments that will require you to think a little more critically. Generally, the game remains pretty easy and just as relaxing all the way through. Definitely a good thing to do if you need to clear your mind and if you're stressed out.The forefront visuals are very basic and unfortunately there isn't much support for high resolutions at all, so fullscreen will have you super zoomed in sadly, but for what it's worth, the backgrounds are very nice looking and are probably the strongest point of the visuals. The sound is also really nice. Not very much sound as far as what you do, but the very, very calming soundtrack that's more or less just ambience really helps add to the relaxing mood of the game.All and all, I'll say I recommend it. Even though it's another indie puzzle game, this one has always stood out for me as one of the best designed.			"

												Nightsky is a casual physics platformer puzzle game with exceptional sounds and graphics. Although, despite sounding and looking amazing, it’s gameplay can be repetitive, I can still recommend this and here’s why.Pros:♦ Great Atmospheric Graphics (It’s simple art style but it all fits together and looks amazing)♦ Relaxing Eargasmic Sound (Relaxing and calming sounds that just fit together and make playing the game so much better)♦ Relaxing/chill gameplay (Gameplay isn’t 100% but if you want a game you can easily pick up and put down in your spare time or want something to relax to, then this hits the nail on the head)♦ Nice number of easy achievements (You can get all the achievements just by completing the game)♦ Reasonable price considering the amount of work that has gone into the Graphics and Sound (Though if you are buying it for the gameplay, I’d say buy it on sale for a couple of bucks)♦ Controls that just work (They just work)♦ Interesting Vehicle Concept (I won’t spoil it, but vehicle concept is very interesting and fun)♦ Interactive Credit Concept (This was a nice little way to do the credits and made reading them that little bit more enjoyable)Cons:♦ Really Repetitive (I say this as I was happily playing and then all of a sudden when I expected the game to almost be finished, it tells me there are more levels but to progress I have to redo the old levels and find a “Hidden Star” which it never told me about. This concept is so annoying, as having to redo levels you’ve already completed to find a hidden object just to progress the main storyline seems really redundant and stupid)♦ Really Easy (For 90% of the game all I had to do was hold down the left or right arrow and roll to the next screen/part of the level. This is kind of silly for a puzzle game to be this easy)♦ Non-Existent Puzzles (I say this as I mentioned above I could hold left or right and progress easily. Also the only puzzles I seemingly found were timing jumps or rolling balls into the correct spot at the correct time, which I imagine a 5 or 6 year old could figure out easily)♦ No Steam Trading Cards (Would be a nice addition as the graphics of the game are amazing and I imagine they could create some really stunning backgrounds, emotes and badges).♦ No way to tell how far you have progressed in a level or how many are left (There is no level numbers and I could only seemingly tell how far I had progressed via exciting and selecting the level I was on. Then again it still didn’t tell me how much of that level I had left and how many more levels were left. The only way I could tell how many levels were left was via the Achievements. This concept is annoying as they should show each level and part of level as locked, not hidden, to make it easier to know how far you have left).♦ No real storyline (Tried to implement some kind of Storyline but never executed it well enough to make any sense or significant impact on the game)♦ Wasn’t aware some levels had hidden objects that I needed to collect to progress later in game (Not being aware of this until I needed these hidden objects to progress is really annoying as I would have searched and collected them on my first run through to save me having to repeat the levels again just to find one hidden object)On a Side Note:♦ I haven’t finished the game as much as I wanted to because even though I had only played 2-3 hours of it, it was already getting on my nerves. I say this because it was repetitive and never really offered anything new in the terms of its puzzles per level and every time I progressed, I felt like I was just playing to get the next achievement. Then when I got to the point where it said I had to go back to levels I had already complete and find hidden Stars to progress… it just ruined the whole game for me and I closed it. I ultimately wanted something new, not having to go back and search old levels for something I missed on the first run.Overall, even though there are a lot of cons, I never finished the game and probably won’t and the gameplay is repetitive, I can still recommend this. I recommend this if you want something easy and relaxing that has great graphics and eargasmic sounds. Therefore, I recommend you pick it up for that reason. However, if you are buying it solely for the gameplay, I’d recommend buying it on sale at the cheapest possible price due to lack of actual puzzles and how repetitive it is as mentioned in my side note and cons.

												The one thing NightSky gets right is being a soothing game to play. The silhouetted visuals, color palette full of blues and violets, and ambient / new age soundtrack combined with its gentle pace make this physics-based puzzle game a relaxing ride.Unfortunately, that's about all I can praise here. Given the near-universal acclaim of other reviewers, I'll probably be shouted down as in the minority here - but this game just didn't do it for me and I can list a number of reasons why.The plot is a complete throwaway. There are a few screens trying to explain the origin of the ball players roll around, but that explanation never goes anywhere. It's the kind of tactic that screams ""indie game trying too hard to be important.""The core mechanic (""roll a ball to the end in a side-scrolling maze"") isn't revolutionary and is mostly well-implemented, but it has some issues. The ""wall riding"" and ""air control"" mechanics in particular are awkward (as in one must continue to hold down the direction the ball was originally traveling to continue rolling, no matter which way it is going - but be sure to switch directions mid-air once it falls off). There is no native gamepad support - an analog stick would have been desirable for this reason.While there is a good bit of variety with fun contraptions and game mechanic modifications that are used in some scenes, the problem with these scenes is that they are often easier than the standard ""control the marble directly"" levels - which are already pretty easy.And that's probably the biggest issue with the game. This game's normal mode is way too easy. There are way too many scenes that only require the player to hold the right arrow to complete. There is an advanced mode, but since it contains no prompts at all (including what the controls are), players will likely need to play through most of the normal mode to learn the game's mechanics before tackling that mode. Personally, I had no interest in running through the game a second time after I had to force myself to finish the first run.There are plenty of great physics-based puzzle games out there. That makes it hard to recommend one that doesn't do anything unusual except be low-key - and has some flaws, to boot. I'd give it a pass.			"

												It's a calm and enjoyable little game. It's a bit simple, but that works in its atmosphere. Ten dollars admittedly might be too high of a price, but if you can get it for less, it's not bad to play through, especially if you need to relax. It has a few good puzzling hours in it, and even the more difficult levels aren't game-ruining.			"

												I wanted to recommend NightSky for a little while now. A must-have if you enjoy puzzle games based on physics!You control a mysterious marble going on an journey through several dream-like landscapes : Industrial, littorals, forests, caves, ruins, etc; Your marble has two main skills, the Slow-Down button, and the Speed-up button. The former allows you to be more precise in your moves, but lacks some motion power. The latter will allow you to jumps gaps and do wall-rides, but it's harder to control properly.Your job is to find the right ballance between those powers and switch them accordingly.Now the interesting part, is the fact each level has different rules. Sometimes you will have both powers, sometimes one of them, sometimes both are disabled.That doesn't stop here though! Sometimes, a power is forced on you and you must deal with it, sometimes you cannot even control your marble, and have to play with the decor to help it move.Through your adventure, there will be loads of different puzzles with unique mechanics, giant-sized pinballs, crazy vehicles, physic-based puzzles with bridges, buttons and moving obstacles, or even altered gravity!Even though the storyline stays a bit in the background, it completes the game with a nice touch of mysteriousness and fascination.The music, soft and relaxing, gives that ""end of the day"" kind of feeling, which fits very well to the name of the game.The lenght of the game is actually very good! There's a total of 11 chapters, each of them containing ~20 puzzles with very interesting mechanics.When you finish all the chapters, you unlock the ""Advanced mode"", where every single level of the game has been redesigned to make it much harder. That a total of 22 chapters of fun and insane physics.What makes this game great in my opinion, is the great variety of levels. You will NEVER have the feeling to do the same thing over and over as all the puzzles are different. The level-design was amazingly well done.As for the explorers and other tricky challenge hunters, there's a few stars hidden in some levels, both in the normal and advanced mode. Beware, skills required if you want to retrive them all!			"

												You'll find no end of physics platformers on Steam, but they're notoriously difficult to get right. Without a solid physics system, mechanics that make the most of them, and scenarios that challenge your understanding of both, you're left with games that are too frustrating or too boring. Luckily, NightSky nails the trifecta with a charming, otherworldly presentation and a wide range of challenges to face.There's no story to speak of, aside from an intro scene where you discover an orb on the beach and start dreaming of the alien landscapes of the game proper. You control a glassy black sphere in these remote, shadowy places, your only goal being to exit to the right. The obstacles in your path can be as simple as hills or as complicated as spinning mazes and grinding gears. Most puzzles are solved simply by careful rolling, but some levels give you special abilities, or limit you in some way. Sometimes you can roll more slowly and carefully, sometimes you can roll fast, sometimes you can control gravity, and so on. Additionally, there are levels where you use the ball to control some goofy vehicle or don't control the ball at all, and instead control flippers or platforms to help it on its way.There are about a dozen thematic areas, each divided into another dozen levels of three screens each. Losing your ball or getting stuck just starts you at the beginning of the three, so you never lose much progress by flubbing. The art style of each area is striking and full of creative details like tiny cities and alien creatures, and the sound design is appropriately reserved with simple effects and a fitting ambient soundtrack. If you've played Within a Deep Forest or any of the Knytt games it'll feel very familiar, being made by the same fellow.The challenge level isn't terribly high once you get used to the traction of your ball, and a full playthrough should take about two hours. There's a hard mode you can attempt afterwards if you want more, or you can hunt for hidden stars across the many areas. With solid mechanics and gorgeous levels, there's no reason to pass this one up. I consider NightSky a classic of the physics platformer genre, one that makes a great entry point for new players or a great example for new games.			"

												Normally, a $10 game that I spend under 3 hours on would need to be really good in order to get a thumbs-up from me, and NightSky is not a really good game. It's not bad as indie puzzle platformers go, don't get me wrong, but a lot of the levels feel like one-off proof-of-concept gimmicks. (Admittedly, I only played Normal and then enough of Alternative to realize that it was basically just the same levels reworked to be jerkish, for the most part.)That said, the reason this is getting a thumbs up is basically just that it was full of neat gimmick levels and the art, sound, and level design really clicked with me as something neat. So, I dunno. It's not a glowing recommendation, more just a ""buy it if you really like puzzle platformers, ridiculous vehicles, or the artstyle"" recommendation.			"

												Game: NightSkyGenre: PuzzleDeveloper: NicalisSystem: Steam (PC)Total Score: 75/100Value Score: 7.5/10• Story: 4/10o NightSky's storyline revolves around a young child who one day went to the beach and found a illuminating sphere. When he grabbed hold of it, it felt like it was alive, he decided to take it home. On that night however he started to have these strange dreams as the sphere itself. You play as the sphere in the child's dream as you will go through a strange world within the dream.• Characters: 4/10o Basically there are absolutely no characters at all but however where the game lacks up to actual characters the personification of the player as a sphere going up against the entire dream world which is consisted of imagery that contains all sorts of beings and different events make up for it, this is however only if the player uses his or her imagination to even consider that.• GamePlay: 10/10o NightSky's main aspect is its gameplay, as a physics game it consist of several puzzle elements that the player must solve to get past each section and level within the game. There will be parts where you will be able to increase or decrease the speed of the sphere, you would have to use gravity and pull, and other moments where you must simply use the environment itself to bridge your way a path to the destination. The game also comes in two difficulty modes - one for beginners and a challenging mode for those who are experienced in the game and want a more difficult challenge to the game overall.• Graphics: 9/10o One of the best aspects to NightSky is the imagery which is present in the game - it brings a whole new level of design and depth into the playing environment for players. You will be awe and left mouth open at the beautiful visuals which illuminate quite well with the music and the overall gameplay. Despite the fact that the game has mostly dark tones, NightSky does incredibly well in terms of visual effects and design.• Sound: 9/10o The sound effects in NightSky go hand to hand with the eerie music and the dark themed visuals. You will get chills from the beautiful sound effects as each stage will have certain sound effects as if wind blowing in a forest or plains, the gears chiming in factories, etc.• Music: 9/10o NightSky's music is quite soothing and relaxing, if you are into orchestral tracks which are peaceful and soothing, you will enjoy NightSky's OST. It brings a eerie feel to the touch that goes well along with the sound effects and the visual appearance the game has.• Length: 4/10o Possibly the weakest aspect in NightSky is its length - the game will not take you more than 3 hours to complete on the first try. The game's multiple difficulty and the fact that you would have to collect/complete certain hidden stages in order to unlock the final level will of course allow you to play a few more hours in the game however NightSky is a type of game where you can pretty much start and finish it in one day or go little by little and finish it within a week or two.• Replay Value: 8/10o NightSky's replay value relies on its puzzle capabilities - the multiple difficulty adds not only another challenge but brings a whole new dimension to the overall gameplay as if you are playing a second game. Although this might not seem like a lot, it really is in terms of content. Along with that you are free to go back to each level and each stage to go back to see if there are multiple ways to finish a level or as a challenge to see if you can pass a level in a different way.• Player Value: 8/10o NightSky is a short and still enjoyable game with amazing visuals, soothing soundtrack and a unique style of gameplay which will be enjoyable for anyone especially those who love puzzles or those who play games casually. You will not find anything wrong with the purchase once you start this game, it is highly recommended to get this fine amazing piece of art and incredible indie game.			"

												NightSky is a simplistic platformer in which the objective is to move an innocent sphere to the end. The end of what? You will have to decide as there's no narrative but your own motives to drive you there.The controls are simple, movement based, which change depending on the level. In a lot of the levels you are the sphere and directly move it where you want to go. Some levels mix things up a bit and let you control things around the level, where the sphere relies on gravity to move. In one level you control pinball style flippers and in the next just need to hang tight on a moving cart and not fall off. Its all done in a tasteful and simplistic manner to break up flow a bit and make things a tad more interesting.The world is wrapped in beautifully gradient colored backgrounds which let your mind fill in the gaps where the levels are taking place. Shaded foregrounds representing the physical world you move around and obstacles in your path are complimented by factory-brown backgrounds or misty-white rain plains and orange-yellow sunsets behind shades of trees. It's a good example of less is more and its works very well. Music wise, the soundtrack feels genuine to what you see on screen. Ambient and experiential tacks help with invoking the right emotions that coincide with each levels color.The developers included a new game plus mode which involves the same levels with some objects modified to make them more challenging. This works for the most part and provides an extra set of achievements to complete and lengthens the game if you are into that sort of thing. I would recommend NightSky to anyone looking for a simple platformer to wind down and hey, if you get addicted to the gameplay - there is the challenging NewGame+ to complete after you are done. Took me about 10 hours to complete to 100%.			"

It's probably said a lot but the music and the visual graphics create a charming atmosphere that will amaze you throughtout your playthrough. The length of the game is sufficient enough to what you would ask for, it doesn't feel boring after a few worlds nor it strives for more levels.			"

The music and the gloomy look of it is really appealing, but it was just not exacly what I was expecting.The puzzles for the most part are very easy and wouldn't take too long to complete, this comes from a guy, who always has a hard time completing puzzle / platform games.The mechanics are interesting, but very unrealistic. Most of the time the ball you controll has very unrealistic movements.In conclusion, I do recommend this game for those of you who want a short and relaxed experience and don't want spending a huge amount of time solving puzzles. I certainly liked it, but was expecting something better, still a good game !			"

												NightSky is a game, made by humans. As far as I can tell; usually that's enough to make me buy things.This game surprised me in a pleasant way by overcoming my aversion to more abstract indie software, which in my experience tends to exude a strong atmosphere but lose out on substance. NightSky favors a deliberately minimalistic style both for graphics and control, which after initial doubts quickly grew into a grander experience. The effortless interaction between the player and his mysterious ""black sphere"" lends the game play an almost subconcious quality, which is layered upon an enigmatic background of churning machines and eerily blinking creatures (think World of Goo). I actually played this game on 3DS, but don't tell the people that work here (they might be Steamed)!			"

												Ah, physics, where would we be without it? Well, we wouldn't have this little ball beauty for a start! Or gravity. Or molecules. Or ukuleles. Or underpants. Or hotdogs. Or gangrene. Or police pension funds being suspiciously syphoned off into untraceable dummy accounts. Sorry, where was I?... Oh yeah, NightSky!...NightSky is a physics, balling, roll-'em-up puzzler of sorts where you have to guide a ball through a wide selection of varied obstacle courses. This is primarily done by simply moving around with the arrow keys and adjusting your ball momentum and timing accordingly, as well as speeding up, slowing down or braking on the stages where it's allowed. But as it goes on, further elements are added, like parts of the environment that can be manipulated or inverting gravity or any number of marvellous contraptions that can be guided around while housing your ball. It really is amazing just how creative the game manages to consistently be through so many different areas and that it rarely ever feels repetitive despite the generous number of stages, which include an ""alternative set"", essentially a remixed version of every stage you've already completed, but this time ramping up the hardness on your ball.The difficulty is judged nicely as well. It teaches you each element perfectly whilst at the same time testing you fairly with every mechanic you learn. As should always be the case in any game, if you fail here, it doesn't feel like the game's fault, and each ""death"" isn't a punishment on your ball, but rather a lesson to learn as you further refine your strategy and ball technique. If there is any frustration to be had it's when you get to the end of a tricky stage, have your ball suddenly drop or get your ball stuck somewhere, then have to go all the way back to the start and drag your ball the whole way through again. But between the quick restarts and well designed stages, this shouldn't be too much of a problem for anyone with any patience, and when you finally achieve success, that euphoric feeling should be ample reward enough for your struggling ball.The look and sound of the game deserve some attention, too, as the solid black foreground of most stages set against the beautiful night-time backdrops help keep your blood pressure down during even the most difficult of ball manoeuvers. This is further reinforced by the sedate music and charming little dings and thuds of any moving parts around you. I can imagine it could have been tempting to try ramping up the tension and sense of urgency on your ball by adding more energetic music to push you forward, but I think they judged it perfectly here and are real enablers of that ""one more go!"" mentality you want to have in your ball games.So for a slightly different breed of puzzler with fun, fair, challenging and yet relaxing ball play, you really need look no further than NightSky... now with 87.8% more ball jokes.

												Nice looking graphics, peaceful soundtrack. Found the normal mode good playable. The game also has an alternative mode, which can prove to be challenging. Sometimes it felt a bit repetitive, depending on how challenging a level was. This was mainly due the fact that you had to restart from the beginning when you failed (replaying one or two stages). Other than that the game has nice variations with various worlds and mechanics, and provides extra challenges with finding stars to unlock another world.			"

												The style is about as basic as it can be and still be beautiful. The music is simple, but pleasant and undistracting. The gameplay is challenging and still damned entertaining. The mobile version is fun too, but I prefer the controls in this version. If you enjoy puzzle platformers, then definitely grab this at the next sale.			"

												For the Price point of $10 I would not recommend this game, the music is dull as is the levels. The levels don't get any challenging and stay at a constant difficulty set. Yes, there was some levels that stumped me and took several tries before completing, but the game was more frustrating on the simple fact that it never threw a challenge and felt more like a task completing each level. I noticed on some levels the reuse of old puzzles from earlier maps and some puzzles could be skipped all together by getting enough speed to fly clear across the obstacle placed in front of you. If you would like to check out this game, I recommend snagging it during a steam sale as I could tell not much time went into crafting some of the levels. I could possibly be being harsh against the game on the fact that I had played through the game twice. Once before the game had introduced steam achievements and the most recent to complete those achievements. On the final note this game isn't bad, it just falls under a category that if a friend was asking me if they should buy it I would recommend spending their money elsewhere.			"

												A good puzzle game, which can range from being easy or difficult.  Some consider if average, some that ignore the alien atmosphere, the variety of gameplay, the soft relaxing music, and the hidden secrets.   Some people don’t know the meaning of average apparently.  You will see all manner of strange creature and landscapes here, with something always catching your attention.  Backgrounds and soft music..  it's worth it for that alone.This is not a game you play to try and figure out puzzles though,  this is a game you play to unwind. When you need to wait for something to get done, when you just want to lay back, take a deep breath, and play a game that makes no demands on you.Until you play it on hard mode of course, then prepare for a challenge. honestly though the game isn't that long, and can be completed in a few hours.  If there was anything I would want, is more.One thing to note is the variety of levels.  Sure you will always be a ball rolling along, but your situation can drastically be different in fun new ways.  Maybe you will have different powers?  Maybe you will be stuck inside some kind of machine? or even better maybe you won't be able to control yourself at all and need to activate things on the landscape to get by?   It's all beautifully well done, and I would recommended this game to anyone with an ounce of patients.The Rating: Owls on a rocketship.			"

												Beat the whole thing in 2.4 hours. I would say it's one of my favorite puzzle platformers. As always with games like this, it's not easy to describe what makes it fun - the game as a whole is just designed in a way that it's pleasant, relaxing. and entertaining through the whole game. At no time in the game did I not enjoy myself, so however short you think it may be, you're in for a really good time throughout the whole game. I'll do my best to try to explain why it's so good.SOUNDThe experimental jazz soundtrack combined with the nature soundtrack is done very well. If you're used to the typical indie game mistake where you have a blastingly loud short chiptune loop that's played all the time, you're in for a breath of fresh air. It's as relaxing in the same way as going to a secluded beach or forest trail. It invites you into a mindset that helps you appreciate the minimalist art style even more. You won't be getting listening fatigue from this. The sound effects for every interaction sound great, too. I especially like the sound the ball makes when it clinks into things. It's just very polished and pleasant all around on this front.GAMEPLAYUnlike more chaotic physics platformers like Gish, you never feel like you're being cheated out of success or struggling due to the random nature of the physics. They give you a great amount of control over the ball - the ability to switch to a high-traction or high-speed mode makes it very precise. I never felt like the ball wouldn't do what I want - you do have to keep in mind that there's no air control though, something that you might have trained into yourself from playing other standard platformers. The game also features several levels with a wide variety of vehicles, and levels where you can't even control the ball but control elements in each stage. Those are also fun to interact with and add fun variety. Overall, I found the gameplay to be a perfect level of challenge throughout. Each of the levels is a small, self-contained puzzle. When you die, you restart from the beginning of the level. This makes death hardly frustrating at all - you just get another chance to try what you messed up on instead of having to go through a whole bunch of stuff you already solved and are bored with. The challenge towards the end, where you have to collect stars by replaying levels and searching for them, is also not as frustrating as you might expect. It's usually pretty obvious where stars might be (and it tells you which stages have unfound stars), and the levels are so small that you really don't have to search far.VISUALSThe visuals are very easy on the eyes and very easy to parse while also being beautiful. Just the simple gradient and other small details enhance the relaxing aesthetc.In sum, I would describe the game as more of an action and movement oriented puzzle platformer (as opposed to more ""sit and think"" type platformers). I found the experience of playing it to be vaguely similar to the Trials games (except for the aesthetic). If you like puzzle platformers, definitely get this game. "

												NightSky is a very short, but neat, physics-based puzzle platformer. You control a ball which must be rolled through a series of levels, solving various puzzles along the way. The game does a good job of easing you into the various different techniques required to progress. It starts off easy, with simple things like speeding up and slowing down to control momentum, then advances to more complex tasks such as changing the spin of the ball on walls and slopes to fling yourself to otherwise unattainable heights. Along the way, you'll also have to solve a number of puzzles involving objects such as balls, cannons, rotating platforms, wagons, blocks, an assortment of different ball-powered vehicles, and more. Complementing NightSky's solid physics gameplay is its unique graphic-style. The levels are rendered in a dream-like palette of rich hues in the background and stark black terrain and objects in the foreground. It really is quite impressive and soothing to look at. Add in some subtle music that plays from time to time, and it all comes together nicely. If you're like me, you'll also find yourself wanting to take a screenshot of nearly every screen, because there's always something neat to look at. That said, one major downside to the graphics (and the game in general), is that it only runs at an extremely low resolution. This is a seriously unfortunate issue for a game like this that depends so much on its visuals to stand out. Additionally, the game doesn't even run full-screen properly. In order for it to run full screen (albeit with ""blown up"" visuals), you should make sure to download the ""unofficial"" 1.1 patch from the developer's web site (more info below). That one major issue aside, this is still a game that is worth checking out. Between the solid gameplay and the beautiful visuals, there's a lot of variety packed in such a small package. And small, it is - the game can be fully completed in around 3-4 hours. Once finished, there is an extra bonus level that can be unlocked by finding a series of hidden ""stars"" throughout the main quest (don't worry, the game tells you which specific sub-levels the stars are hidden on, so it's fairly easy to find them all). But aside from that, there's not much else here. There is supposedly an HD version in the works (which will in theory fix the one major issue noted above regarding graphics resolution), so it may even be worth waiting in case that ever materializes. Regardless, whether you get the current version or hold out for a true HD update, this is a game that is worth experiencing if you're a fan of physics puzzlers or games with unique styles and gameplay.*** Note about updating the game: The default download that comes from Steam runs in a very low resolution that can't be changed. However, there is a post in the developer's forums (and also in the official Steam discussions) which links to an updated executable (NightSky11.exe). I recommend downloading this. Rename the original ""NightSky.exe"" in your SteamApps folder and replace it with the 1.1 version (rename it ""NightSky.exe"". This version allows the game to run full-screen, though unfortunately not at a higher resolution (so the graphics will be slightly blurry). Still, it's much better than nothing.			"

He ran, and I pursued him, and still we chase each other across the sky. I love him, and I fear him. Night wins, then day wins. Yesterday I was beaten by a different strength. Dimly, I felt the blows, and was bruised. I cried, and my tears were wet, and amazed me, and I cupped them in small fingers and stared at them, tasted them in the dirty cracks of skin.

												More of a tech demo than an actual game, Nightsky is charming, but forgettable. It asks the players to solve simple puzzles using a sphere and the physics that come with it. The sphere can be rolled left and right, use special ""powers"" (usually speeding up or inverting gravity), and weigh itself down.Nightsky has a beautiful minimalistic art style and soundtrack, making it a very peaceful and relaxing game.The problem with Nightsky is it's puzzles - more times than not, they can be solved by brute force rather than problem solving. Many screens do not require any user input at all, the ones that do usually only require a well-timed roll or button press. Many may consider this a positive, as it gives the player time to soak up the scenery. Unfortunately, as stated, the game uses a minimalistic art style, and there are only so many times you will be impressed by black squares and dandelions.Overall, Nightsky has some positives, some negatives. Unfortunately, this game is so short it's impossible to really dig into it... and seeing it's age, Nicalis is not likely to update in more levels anytime soon.			"

												I would recommend this game if you get it in a bundle, or if it's on sale. It's a soothing puzzle game with some interesting physics, though at times it felt too easy. There are two modes, either beginner or advanced, but it says if it's your first time playing you should start on beginner. Still, there isn't much I haven't seen before.  If you're a skilled fan of puzzle platformers, this game will probably be far too easy for you. If you're looking to introduce someone to puzzle platformers and you don't think a game like Limbo or Oddworld would be appropriate for them, either content or skill wise, then this is a good option. It's fun in the way that little unique challenges pop up from level to level, but on the other hand those unique bits left me going, 'Oh, I remember this from Braid,' or 'This part is just like that part in Limbo'. Definitely get it if it's in a bundle or goes on sale. Wouldn't recommend it for the $9.99 though.			"

Good polish, enjoyable music. Just a fair warning to people who care, but the majority of achievements did not pop for me, not exactly sure why.

GameplayNightsky is an odd mix between a puzzler and a 2D platformer. On paper, it sounds like the two would muddle up, but it's actually quite simple: you're a glass sphere that rolls around, and obstacles and physics ensue. It's a simple concept, but it starts to get naturally more complex and interesting as the levels go on. Timing, precision, focus, and manipulation of the game's physics are all gradually introduced, giving the game a natural progression of complexity. Overall, it's fun to play.It has its hiccups though. For one thing, the mechanic of holding certain keys to change the ball's traction and speed through various ""modes"" is never referenced or formally taught to the player, but is nearly essential in many of the game's levels. It has its fair share of frustrating levels as well.StoryThe story was a bit dissapointing. Much of my motivation for playing though the game was from the single sliver of story teased at the beginning, but any hint of a plot is never brought up again. It's not a huge loss, especially since a narrative would demand regulation of the game's fantastical and often unrelated settings.PresentationI was NOT expecting this much atmosphere from a such a simple game. The best way to describe it is pure, unadultered Zen. Ambience such as wind, trees rustling, and the humming of caves provide a constant backdrop for the laid-back soundtrack and the soft ""clinks"" of the glass ball as it rolls about. The visuals compliment the sounds perfectly, resulting in a game that's extremely relaxing if nothing else.CommentsDifficulty is bizzarely estatic; one level could take ages, whlie the next takes a single attempt. This could be seen as postive in many ways, but nevertheless, it's notably peculiar.			"

												I may be biased toward this game a bit (look at my hours on record :P ) but this is a fun game casually but also good to replay just for relaxation. (And then there's Alternative mode, where the great mellow soundtrack might be all that keeps you from screaming at the increased difficulty)8.5/10 because I don't give out 10's lightly			"

												Oh, is this game annoying! I could not think up a single way to make it any more annoying, they've thought of everything! I feel this is the game war criminals should be required to play to atone for their crimes against humanity. It's a sadist gamer's fantasy come true. It distills every terrible game design concept to its essence and then proudly flaunts it: * You failed 4 screens into your adventure, oh man, that sucks, we know how that feels, back to screen 1 for you. No, it's better from the beginning, believe you me, and it builds muscle memory that will come in handy, you'll see why.* You found yourself 'trapped' by falling into a pit because you didn't realize you had to drop that ball into the pit first? Are you some kind of dumbass, why would you do that?! That'll teach you, at least now you know, back to screen 1. * Wait, wait, you're telling me you were accelerating on the previous screen to make a jump, landed, got moved to the next screen and immediately fell off the cliff because you were too going fast?! Well, heh, you know, Speed Kills! Slow down next time. Nope, you can't just say sorry and get a warning, back to screen 1.* Yes, yes, of course this is a platformer, why do you ask? Oh, you instinctively pressed the SpaceBar to jump, ha ha yes common mistake, no we don't support jump, don't be ridiculous, instead we send you back to screen 1 -- yes, yes, yes, the spacebar is the keyboad shortcut to restart the level. No, we got rid of the pesky confirmation prompts that everyone hates, the level restarts as soon as you hit the Spacebar, it's superfast, just watch.* Oh, you forgot the controls because you didn't play for a few months after your last experience? We're a little offended to be honest. No, we don't have a Help or a Settings page that tells you the controls. What are you, a n00b? The controls were incrementally introduced in Level 1, just play through that level again. * That's right, on some levels, a few of your abilities/controls will be unavailable. How will you know which ones? Oh, you'll find out pretty quickly once you try to use them. No, we don't tell you ahead of time, that would completely ruin the suspense! * The colors? What about the colors? Yes, the path you traverse is black. The obstacles to navigate are black, sure. Yup, the decorative background elements are also black. Ah, you've got a keen eye, they are indeed all the same shade of black! It's a design aesthetic called minimalismjism, it's all the rage nowadays. Oh you feel some rage too? We knew it! We knew it would rub off on our players. *high five** Oh, we're glad you noticed. Yup, on half the game screens there are no obstacles, none whatsoever, you just keep the right-arrow key pressed and enjoy the scenery scroll by, as you cruise through the screen. It's an innovative design element we're bringing to the industry. You're welcome. The idea is, you add a few 'filler' non-puzzle screens to traverse through between puzzle screens. It breaks up the monotony of having to do puzzle after puzzle. You know, you only truly appreciate light after dark. It's like ying and yang. Macaroni and cheese. Where did we get the idea? Well, what happened is, as we were developing the game, we found our graphic-designers were much more prolific than our puzzle-creators, so we ended up with a lot more screens than puzzles. But we didn't let that faze us, you know what they say, whatever life gives you, make a lemon!My right-arrow key and middle finger are both experiencing repetitive strain injury, so I'm going to stop here and give them a rest. No, that's not the one I use for right-arrow.			"

												I tried to give this game a fair shot by completing it, yet I'm still frustrated.  Alternative mode ramps up the difficulty such that you need perfect timing or you have to restart the level over & over & OVER!Worst are those instances where you have to WAIT to jump/push/land on a contraption that never behaves how you want it.  Yes, this is a pretty game.  But that doesn't absolve it from the horrible punishment of starting over because you mistakenly didn't spin your marble the precise way.Now I hate physics.			"

												This is a pleasant little platformer/physics puzzler game where you roll a ball around. There's some nice variety in the way the levels are designed and it's all pretty charming. Be warned, though, that in order to complete the last stage, you have to find hidden areas scattered throughout the previous levels (I've never been so happy to use a guide from the community hub). That was a decidedly non-pleasant surprise when I was trying to book through the game in one evening.			"

												This is a review for ""Hold Right Arrow Key to Win Game"" in which you ...hold right (perhaps left occasionally) to win. Thats.. basically it. You may think I am kidding, but thats the actual game. There are speed up and slow down powers, anti gravity powers and some other neat stuff that breaks up the fact you just hold right... but still, 90% of the game is holding right and knowing when to not hold right. There were screens and puzzles I never even had time to figure out because holding right just beat them for me. Sure, there are some ""nice"" puzzles and some ""fun"" challenges... but ..honestly.. I didn't like those parts. It felt kinda like those terrible moments in Sonic where the fluid of the level design stops and you have to struggle to regain it. Its awkward and you just want it to end so you can get back to holding right. I beat the game, it was painful to do. I have fond moments of holding right..and I have many many bad memories of this game. I have labled it terrible and buried it in the graveyard of games I wish I didn't own. If considering purchase, please skip over this game. There are plenty of similar games that are much better examples of what you really want.			"

												Nightsky is a pretty interesting platformer that can only be described in a few words unique and rage inducing. In Nightsky you roll around a ball and try to get through some levels. The concept is interesting but theres no story. Theres a ball found on the beach and then it rolls around random levels. While the Art style is beutifull the game could get angering because the controls are too tight and dont fell smooth and the game does revevolve on tought phisics which does ruin the fun. And if you want to finish the game you have to find all the hidden stars which is just insane but there only twelve of them so thats not that bad. So overall this game is good but for the rage inducing  and the Abysmal level desing im gonna bump down the rating so i give it an 8/10.			"

												I feel like this game is overrated. The advanced levels come down to nothing but random physics. When I say random I mean random. This is not a game grounded in any kind of reality. Your ball is manipulated all over the place seemingly at whim of whatever the developer had in mind. To top that off you have to redo sections all the time that are pointless. Just because you failed a new part it brings you back to the beginning of an easy level, and the whole time I am asking myself why? Why keep going and wasting my time on this ♥♥♥♥. To top that off you get your powers taken away for whatever reason in any random stage. Notably, you cannot slow down your ball whenever the developer feels like you should not be able to do that.Don't get me wrong it's a cool game but I find it hard to recommend for 10 dollars. Maybe at the 2 dollar price point this game is worth it. The levels are long enough. The game on the whole is decent and the visuals and music are great.But the ball and object physics seem completely arbitrary to what the developer wants you to do. They have no foundation in reality, so most or the time you are just fiddling with random spins to get where you want to go. I'm not sure I call that a puzzle. It's more like a trial and error type of game. I mean imagine if Super Meat Boy made you go back and redo stages all the time because you messed up on one do to some random jumping mechanic. It just makes the game longer than it really should be. I do recommend this but only barely, and only at a pricepoint under 4 dollars for sure.			"

												Some good physics puzzles, but I didn't particularly care for the way the abilities at your disposal (i.e. fast, heavy, reverse gravity, etc) were capriciously granted and revoked at the developer's whim at each new screen. I started to get annoyed with it once the game started to make me replay the previous 3 screens just for failing the puzzle on one screen (I already solved those!). Also kinda annoyed by the mechanic where you have to forward spin off a ramp into the ceiling, then change to a backspin mid-air to hit the ceiling and reverse direction, etc. Just found it a little too irritating to pull off.But if you enjoy physics puzzles, then take this review with a grain of salt, dear readers. I am not a fan of physics games at all and almost always find them annoying, so this is probably more a matter of me having no taste for this type of game than it is a problem with the game itself.

												This game started out as what I thought it would be: a casual physics platformer with a soothing atmosphere, something I could play without stress to unwind after a long day. It went that way for a number of levels, but then all of a sudden, WHAM. I ran straight into a sheer cliff of a difficulty curve. Now mind you, these levels are by no means unbeatable, but the play style changes abruptly from mellow, easy fun to COMEONCOMEONCOMEON DONT FALL OFF THE @#$% LEDGE annoyance where you have to repeat levels several times to complete them and you are at the whim of the highly chaotic physics. This sudden change jars you out of the atmosphere the game clearly does a good amount of work building and into just another somehow-frustrating-and-boring-at-the-same-time physics game.			"

												The presentation is lazy and limited. The settings made available to the user are minimal to nearly none. The ""widescreen"" setting is not widescreen at all, as the size of the game's screen is still very small and surrounded by large black borders. The graphics are also of the most minimal efforts that are found in free Flash games for PC or phones. The so-called ambient music is barely noticeable and does not add to the overall experience in any way. The game mechanics are only mildly interesting or amusing, and the game world and design are uninspired and uncreative. Guiding the ball around the levels is unsatisfying and dull. The game play is so vacuous and boring, that I would find it hard to believe that someone would actually be interested in such a dead and valueless activity after about one hour. Every aspect of the game is so breathless, numb, flat, lackluster, and muted. The physics of the game are not interesting nor exciting in any way, and the overall atmosphere is so indifferent and apathetic, that you will be wondering why you should be spending any time at all with this poor attempt at a game. NightSky's sale description lists it as an ""action-puzzle"" game, set in ""picturesque worlds"". This couldn't be farther from the truth. NightSky does not involve any action whatsoever, and the game world is the opposite of picturesque, as it is as good as dead. The asking price is borderline insanity, as the developers are clearly overpricing an obviously poorly designed and low-grade game.NightSky is mediocre.			"

												Nightsky is a simple casual 2D platformer that exhibits a beautiful minimalistic art style combined with one of the most calming ambient noises to have ever reached my ears. Nightsky has everything you could possibly ask for in a modern 2D platformer, there are physics based puzzles, cool abilities that affects movement, secrets to unlock hidden levels, and fairly well designed casual puzzles. Sadly the game is far too short and with no story, no random events, and no characterization  I would be very hard pressed to spend 10 dollars on this game. As a matter of fact even at 5 dollars, Nightsky is far too expensive for what it offers. However, if you do manage to find it at 75% off, buy it and leave it on in the background just to listen to the beautiful and soothing ambience.			"

There is a plot, but no resolution to it and it's basically ""I found a sphere and experienced surreal dreams"".

You will, however, need pretty good reflexes and timing for the puzzles. The graphics are beautiful too, and those and the puzzles are somewhat reminiscent of Limbo, but without the grotesque deaths.The game cries out to be played with a gamepad, but unfortunately it's not gamepad-enabled.

												This is another one of those wonderful, relaxing games. The gameplay is very simple - you roll the ball from left to right. However, there is an excellent amount of variety in this game as far as what you are rolling the ball over and what parts of the environment you can interact with, as well as a couple powers that come and go. One of my favorite aspects of this game is that sometimes the ball is enclosed in machines that you manipulate. The art style is very pleasing to the eye. For the most part, the foreground and ball itself are black and the background is either made up of blues and purples like a night sky or sunset tones. The levels also have nice distinct themes. This is not a hard game, but I like that about it. I think the most times I had to retry an area was about five times, but that is just right for a casual, relaxing game because it isn't a total cakewalk but it also doesn't get frustrating.  I also thought it was a nice touch that in order to get through the last level, you have to unlock stars from certain areas in previous levels.  This extended the gameplay in a nice way for me			"

												Very charming, beautiful artwork, and just as the name suggests dream like. While this is a physics puzzler, the way physics is exploited especially in the alternative mode is astonishing. The difficulty is challenging but not impossible in normal mode which is IMHO perfect. Levels are short but there's lots of them, even then first play through on normal should take you anywhere between 2-3h. Alternative mode is more difficult and looks like it will take around 5-8h by my estimate.What's not so hot, is the star hunting, personally I felt it could have done without, but that's a minor quibble.All in all, great puzzler, somewhat short but very sweet.

Getting all of the stars are somewhat tricky and at the threshold of having collected them all on the alternative difficulty, you will feel a little tired of playing the game, cause of simple errors making you start over and just overly hard challenges.Easily recommendable game; pick it up, if it's on sale and you like physics-platformers, cause that is just, what this is: An above averagely challenging physics-platformer.

												Very charming, beautiful artwork, and just as the name suggests dream like. While this is a physics puzzler, the way physics is exploited especially in the alternative mode is astonishing. The difficulty is challenging but not impossible in normal mode which is IMHO perfect. Levels are short but there's lots of them, even then first play through on normal should take you anywhere between 2-3h. Alternative mode is more difficult and looks like it will take around 5-8h by my estimate.What's not so hot, is the star hunting, personally I felt it could have done without, but that's a minor quibble.All in all, great puzzler, somewhat short but very sweet. Recommended! 8.5/10			"

You just need to get to the end.  There are no enemies or bad things, just quick failure.Took me about 2 hours, but I did not collect enough secret stars for the secret level but I still beat the game.Totally worth it if you love puzzle physic games, this one was pretty good and relaxing to play.

												NightSky is a really interesting puzzle/platforming game where you control a ball and try to get it to the right edge of the screen. The game is executed well on many levels, and it makes for a great overall experience. Also, the ball is often placed in odd vehicles, which are pretty fun to mess around with.The game isn't terribly hard. Not sure why it was in the Indie Royal ""Difficult"" bundle.The game's engine works very well, and the physics work as they should. The game controls well, except that it sometimes switches what some of the buttons do... it's more of an annoyance than a hindrance. The environments are really cool, but the music is a little grating.It took me forever to get JoyToKey configured, since it doesn't tell you which keys are important at first. Feel free to ask me for my XB360 controller config.The game's too short to recommend at $10. Get it if you can find it under $5.			"

												3/5cons------ The background is not shaded differently to the foreground so a lot of the time you can't tell if something is actually part of the game or not.- The fonts sizing and family make it look unfinished- Some of the puzzles can easily be skipped by bruteforcing yourself against a wall- When you fail a stage, it takes you back to the start of the level rather than the start of that stage. So if you're on stage 3/3 and you fail, you get put right back to stage 1/3. Massive PITA- Sometimes music doesn't play when you enter a new stage. This was only particularly noticeable on the 'slightly nonsense' area.It does have its good sides thoughpros----- The puzzles are decent.- There's plenty of variations on what to do (maybe a bit too much at times)- Music for the most part is pretty decent and fits with the theme of the game- Sound effects IMO are good as wellI'd recommend this if you're into relaxed puzzlers, for anyone else though, I might stay clear.

It has that same dream-like black-and-white art style and minimalistic gameplay without the story, or the spiders, or the small child being dismembered by a bear-trap that you get from Limbo. Overall it's well-designed, well-executed and kind of cute. Nightsky, I mean. Not Limbo. Limbo isn't even remotely cute.			"

												Very well made platforming indie game. There's not a whole lot to it but it stays interesting throughout the whole game.Gameplay: It's a physics based puzzle game in which you control a ball and get from one side of the screen to the other, utilizing certain powers such as speed, inverting gravity, and precision control of the ball. The physics are very well done and it's very satisfying and fun to move the ball around. I thought that all the puzzles were a good level of difficulty, I never had too much trouble finishing them, but some required some intuition.Graphics: Similar to something like Limbo, although more colorful. The graphics aren't anything too special, but the game is more about the gameplay. It looks nice for what it is though.Nothing much to say about story, since it's just a basic puzzle game. The level design is good quite good and compliments the gameplay well. It's not too long, but not too short. Check this one out on a sale. 8/10			"

Nice, soothing music coupled with a few 'tutorial' levels makes you feel like you'll have this game done in a half hour. You soon start to see that there are a few extra layers of complexity hidden within. Especially when you get to the Alternative tracks. The game has a few secrets too, but I'll let you find those. Definitely worth a play, was a fun game that took about 5 or so hours to complete.8/10 marbley madness			"

												For its price point, its not a good game. If it's on sale however, its worth the buy if you need a relaxing game or like these kinds of puzzles. The puzzles can be creative, but the difficulty curve on this game is just non-existant, some levels are just stupidly easy and some take quite a bit of effort. The ""secret stars"" you need to collect are sometimes fair, hidden in plain sight or in places you would've never tought to look. -The Aestethics of the game are good, the backgrounds and ambients are nice and feel relaxing.-The music is not that special. Gets repetitive after a while-It has plenty of levels and the alternate levels can prove a challengue.-There really isn't that much of a plot. You're just a ball.-The engine can sometimes be silly and screw you or let you cheese the level.-Playing this with a keyboard is hard, but you'll get used to it.7/10			"

												NightSky is a simple yet engaging physics puzzle platformer using a ball and the various terrain and objects to get through each level. The controls are simple to move the ball which moves quickly, but extra controls are given to move it faster, slower, or upside down depending on the level along with various contraptions and other objects that are required to solve the levels. Each level is crisply and cleanly drawn with black vector objects along with a well textured sky background in nature or non-nature settings. The art style opts for a simple and almost minimal look along with more intricate and articulate designs in other levels. The music and sounds are also ambient to suit the level styles, with natural sounds and small pieces of music to go with each level. Some levels may be really straightforward and easy, while others give a good amount of puzzle thinking or platforming skill to complete. While it looks like just a simplistic game, NightSky gives a good experience with some interesting design and gameplay.			"

												A pretty cool indie game about trying to get a ball to the end of checkpoints that are every three screens. The normal game is a solid campaign, but the alternative one, is more of a puzzle game, that takes much more time, and is tedious. The art style is a mix of Obulis and Limbo. There are no lives, but endless attempts. It's a good game if you have a few minutes to spare.Rating 7.5/10			"

												Good mix of relaxing ambience and clever physics puzzle gameplay. The game sometimes breaks your zen moment with a particularly challenging puzzle, but it's never so bad as to make you want to quit trying to progress. Once you complete the game, there's an alternative mode with extra challenge to add some replay value. The game's soundtrack is great, too, and you'll likely want to listen long after the game is done.			"

												In both music and visuals, this is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played.  Gameplay-wise, it's very simple, just move a marble left and right, but moving the marble can lead to interesting effects as gears and physics affect the game.  A few additional actions are thrown in, like speeding up and changing gravity, when the level allows, but they're all simple to understand.  What isn't so simple is the puzzles, sometimes reminding me of the better Portal 2 community maps with ""ah-ha!"" moments.  And the music is very calming even when it gets frustrating.			"

												NightSky is a simple yet engaging physics puzzle platformer using a ball and the various terrain and objects to get through each level. The controls are simple to move the ball which moves quickly, but extra controls are given to move it faster, slower, or upside down depending on the level along with various contraptions and other objects that are required to solve the levels. Each level is crisply and cleanly drawn with black vector objects along with a well textured sky background in nature or non-nature settings. The art style opts for a simple and almost minimal look along with more intricate and articulate designs in other levels. The music and sounds are also ambient to suit the level styles, with natural sounds and small pieces of music to go with each level. Some levels may be really straightforward and easy, while others give a good amount of puzzle thinking or platforming skill to complete. While it looks like just a simplistic game, NightSky gives a good experience with some interesting design and gameplay.			"

												This is a superb example of a physics-based puzzle game.  A side-scroller with visuals that are easy on the eyes, NightSky takes you on a journey as a sphere rolling through a world of harmless and comical silhouettes.  The journey itself is marked by fun puzzles, each one blocking your progress.  Some of the puzzles involve abilities that come and go - such as speeding up walls - while others involve timing or powering little carts.  The puzzles are deceptively simple and not frustrating at all.  Truly a relaxing experience that anyone can enjoy.			"

Overall, NightSky is good for a couple hours of play time, but that's about it.  7.5 out of 10.Decent little side-scrolling platformer and well done where you control a ball and depending on the level can either make him faster and/or have better traction.  An easy game to pick up where you're using physics/gravity to make jumps to cross the screen.  The complete game can be completed casually in a little over a couple hours.  The final level is certainly not clear in that you needed to pick up ""hidden stars"" in the earlier levels in order to continue;  it really should be made clearer in the game.  Regardless I made it to the final level in 2hrs and after some googling discovered what I needed to do and used a guide to get the well-hidden stars in order just to play the last level; 30mins to complete the guide and then the last level.

												Unless this game is on a hell of a special, give it a miss.  There's nothing puzzling about it, and the platforming is in that try, try again and pray category.It's not a puzzle game if you know exactly what you need to do but are beaten by the control scheme.  That first wall running bit is a good example - hold left all the way through the loop, but then you have to flick suddenly to holding right.  No matter what I couldn't get a smooth looking transition on that one, I'd always end up losing momentum and if I was too slow coming to a complete stop.  Very jarring, breaks the smooth, flowing tone of the game by making me have to THINK about the control scheme.  I can't think of any intuitive way to implement the mechanic, and I'm not sure that bit, and the others like it, were really worth including in the game.			"

												It's ok. Music is great, visuals are nice and relaxing with mostly simple gameplay. The chaotically physics-y nature will make you do that annoying thing where you try the same thing like 4 or 5 times doing nothing really much different but just hoping it works this time. I find myself enjoying it more the less reliant on physics the challenge is.I'm glad to see the steam version was updated to finally have the HD version of the game where as previously you could only download that on app stores or humble bundle so I'll finally give this a recommendation.

												Another nice platform-puzzler, that comes in two flavours:* chilled and slow, almost a no-brainer* more challenging puzzles and requiring good reflexes/controlThe first time the player will run the normal mode ... and this is a perfect game for late-night relaxation: soothing music, sweet ambient sounds (wind & rain), dark and minimalistic visuals (papercut-style, sometimes with colorful/plasma backgrounds).While this mode lacks a true challenge, it gives the nice n warm feeling of a friendly casual game. Yes, even without a ""true"" story (no need for fancy stories in puzzlers anyway (IMHO)).The second mode is called ""Alternative"" and the required control-skills are way higher. Later levels also need some creative thinking in order to find a solution.However, it still remains a ""slower"" game (for me a good thing ;) ).I totally enjoyed both modes.			"

												An excellent game.While minimalistic, the graphics are very appealing. The ambient sounds and audio overall are well madeand provide a distinguishing feel for each of the ""Dimensions"". The gameplay is simple and engaging, andshould cater to anyone who likes brain teasers and playing with finesse. Alternative levels are somewhata rehash of the regular ones, which is an acceptable flaw; especially considering the sheer number anddiversity of the challenges presented. Some levels are clearly more demanding in terms of skill, but arenever frustrating. The game itself runs very smoothly, and the keyboard responses are quite natural.Overall, several hours worth of fun and art. Ten out of ten from me.Would recommend to anyone into puzzle games, or looking for a different genre from their usual fare.Enjoy :)			"

												Nightsky is a whimsical rolling ball game that proves to be creative in its many environments. You simply roll about and traverse the landscape of the twilit realm, seeing where this curious world takes you. The game starts out simple and gives you a decent enough learning curve to really test your abilities, and you will feel fulfilled when the journey ends.Now this game, while fun, is far from perfect. the physics detection can get wonky in places, and the key controls are fairly ambiguous and may cause some confusion, like mistaking the ""action key"" for the ""restart level key."" And while the normal mode is what defines a steady and enjoyable platform game the alternate mode is anything but, being basic revisions of the normal levels with harder and more overly frustrating precision placement maneuvers. I've made the same argument in The Bridge, but if there really weren't any more ideas for more challenging levels then the game should have ended at the end of the normal mode. There are also sound-based glitches all throughout the game that cause a bit of discomfort with it's ear-piercing static sounds caused from corrupted audio files. Thankfully though that can be remedied by turning the music volume off.But despite the latter though Nightsky still manages to shine; it's a fun little game that will prove to be an enjoyable adventure.

--GAMEPLAY--This simple minimalist platform puzzler is packed with exquisitely designed puzzles where you control a small black ball across a silhouetted landscape. Its ambient and subtle atmosphere along with its lack of time-pressure makes it almost zen-like. Most of your focus will be on a small black ball which you manipulate left and right. You may also speed it up, put the brakes on or invert its gravitational pull. For an added twist the ball is sometimes embedded inside certain airborne or vehicular contraptions.Overall the difficulty is spot-on and perfectly pitched putting you in that sweet-spot of puzzle gaming. Restarting is instant and you never have to do large chunks over again.--PRESENTATION & DESIGN--Nicalis sticks to the less-is-more formula greeting the player with a straightforward start-menu that simply lists the names of the areas in the game. The ambience instills a zen-like calm to the user where the soundtrack consists of a lone acoustic guitar with a hint of other gentle sounds and soft notes. The ball hits surfaces with a satisfying chink suggesting it's made of marble or is metallic. --CONCLUSION--The game took me around 5 hours to complete. The restricted size of the screen along with no option to change the resolution or to re-configure the keys are some of the very few negatives. Clicking Settings takes you to a small window in the desktop, which can spoil immersion slightly, but the game as a whole is exquisite.5/5For the full review of this and other games please check out or follow my curator page at:Parsons' Garden "

												That few moments after the sun sets, but darkness hasn’t arrived yet.  The sky lit in vibrant colors, but everything around you unlit and shrouded in shadow.  NightSky from Nicalis exists solely in that short time, a collection of puzzles centered around moving an enigmatic sphere from left to right.The physics are top notch.  You’ll guide this little sphere through dozens of stages full of clever puzzles, ingenious machines, and constantly changing (though easy-to-understand) rules.  The game will often give you a new control scheme, and immediately twist it in a surprising new direction.  The story is almost nonexistent, but it doesn’t have to be strong in a game like this.There are two difficulty levels, but the game plays functionally the same in each.  The main themes of each world are still present in each, though the puzzles themselves are ramped up in the alternate version.  Some levels have hidden stars on them, which are required to finish the bonus levels found at the end of the game.  Going back to find those stars is a fun little sidequest.The audio is astounding in its minimalism.  The music is soft and relaxing.  The sound effects include waves lapping at the shoreline, the soft sound of rain on grass, and wind blowing through tree leaves.  The sphere and other movable objects will make audible thunks when they hit something, giving them a weightiness that would otherwise be lacking.  The sound the sphere makes when it hits something makes it seem fragile, though you can’t break it (but you can drop it down a bottomless pit).The graphics are gorgeous, and I always had a softspot for this kind of art direction where the foreground is black and the background is lit in brilliant colors.  Though sometimes it can be difficult to tell what is a stable platform and what is scenery, and more than once I dropped my sphere thinking I could land on something.The puzzles are expertly crafted and gorgeously detailed.  They progress very logically, teaching you the rules you’ll need to solve them as you go.  At least in the normal difficulty, nothing was overly frustrating or unfair, and most times figuring out what I needed to do was rather simple.  It was the doing of it that took a bit of time.NightSky is a great example of minimalist game design.  Nothing too flashy, but there is some real enjoyable content here.  The physics come together very well and everything behaves realistically.  Graphically its a real treat, and I would listen to the soundtrack every weekend to help me relax.  It only takes about two hours to finish, but what a great two hours it is.  Highly recommended.NightSky is available on Steam, Humble, and 3DS.			"

												SHORT REVIEW INCOMING:NIGHTSKY is a short little plattformer which compells with its simplicity. Easy physics based puzzels are the main criteria in this game. You only have 4 abilities: Rolling left and right, speeding up, slowing down and changing gravity. That's it. Nightsky is a fun relaxing game which you should pick up during a sale.			"

												The name ""nightsky"" really fits this wonderful little gem of a game.  Set against a dark, rainy background, with rain streaking down, the occasional flash of lightning, it's easy to forget that this is, really just a physics game with a marble and obstacles.   As you move from level to level, the sounscape changes... One minute you're in a swamp, with rain, bullfrogs, and lightning, then you careen into a cave, and there's drips, and echoes.. then into an industrial complex, with humming, and clanking... Each of the surfaces you hit has a different sound too, and you feel the clonk of wood, or the tang of metal-on-metal as you bounce around.The levels are extraordinarily varied too.  You're not always a ball, sometimes you're a flying or hopping thing..  Sometimes you're on a zipline.  Sometimes your controls are reversed (for good reasons!), and sometimes you have no controls at all, but must adjust the scenery instead.   Every level is very different!The game starts off very atmospherically.. Talking about a dream, and then you're a ball, rolling along a beach.  The first few levels are just dreamlike.  There's no major difficulty.. You're soaking up the rushing waves, the beautiful sounds and music.. Then things get a little complex.. But not so that it breaks the flow... and so on.. the game gets gradually harder, but (in normal mode), never becomes too frustrating.  I finished the normal mode game pretty quickly, and it was wonderful.  There's nothing groundbreaking in Nightsky, it's just that it puts everything together really really well.  All the way through, it never gets boring, and just as you've had a hard part, you get a nice serene quiet grassy part, where you can relax and roll on through.   The levels themselves are grouped into screens of three.  Once you've finished a three-screen run, you get a 'save point'.  This is great, because the 'feel' changes every three screens as well, because each of the three-screen-levels usually contain one major puzzle or obstacle, and a few minor ones.at the end of normal mode, you get to the last level, and if you haven't found all the secrets, you don't get to proceed and get that last achievement.  Not to worry though, the secrets are marked, and (usually) easy to obtain once you know where to look.   There are a few exceptions to this, however, which are VERY frustrating to get, but these are in the alternative mode....So..  You can choose to play through in Normal or Alternative mode.  Normal is a nice, easy, free-flowing fun game, as descrived above. Alternative mode contains fiendishly altered versions of the levels from Normal mode... It makes for a fun playthrough, as you see how the game is made so much harder by the omission or substitution.  Some of the level changes are absolutely down-right cunning.  Some of them feel like they were the 'alpha' versions of the levels, before the playtesters announced that they were just too finnicky for the main game.All I'll say is this, I managed to finish both modes, and had a good time doing it.  The only annoying parts were trying to get the achievements in Alternative mode.. That was a real exercise in frustration!  However, overall, the game was solid, and well worth the money.  Well recommended to anyone who likes a good indie physics puzzle platformer, and fancies something with good, nice, atmosphere, but very pick-up-and-put-downable for busy lives.    Not recommended if you don't have good hand-eye coordination, and have difficulty coordinating fast button-clicking to pull off pixel-perfect maneuvers.. It does need some very find finger-control to balance that ball!			"

												This is a superb example of a physics-based puzzle game.  A side-scroller with visuals that are easy on the eyes, NightSky takes you on a journey as a sphere rolling through a world of harmless and comical silhouettes.  The journey itself is marked by fun puzzles, each one blocking your progress.  Some of the puzzles involve abilities that come and go - such as speeding up walls - while others involve timing or powering little carts.  The puzzles are deceptively simple and not frustrating at all.  Truly a relaxing experience that anyone can enjoy.			"

												NightSky is a really interesting puzzle/platforming game where you control a ball and try to get it to the right edge of the screen. The game is executed well on many levels, and it makes for a great overall experience. Also, the ball is often placed in odd vehicles, which are pretty fun to mess around with.The game isn't terribly hard. Not sure why it was in the Indie Royal ""Difficult"" bundle.The game's engine works very well, and the physics work as they should. The game controls well, except that it sometimes switches what some of the buttons do... it's more of an annoyance than a hindrance. The environments are really cool, but the music is a little grating.It took me forever to get JoyToKey configured, since it doesn't tell you which keys are important at first. Feel free to ask me for my XB360 controller config.The game's too short to recommend at $10. Get it if you can find it under $5.			"

												Some days you want to unwind and relax with a game before heading to bed.  Something that will provide a little cerebral stimulation rather than giving you sweaty palms.  NightSky is that game.  The background music is amazing, so much so that I've put the OST into my regular playlist.  The visuals are of a color gradiant against black, giving the impression of sunsets.  It is incredibly relaxing.  Each stage is roughly three panels wide, with the objective of traveling from the left panel to the edge of the right panel.  The controls vary with each stage.  In some cases you can speed up, in others you can slow down for more precision.  In some cases you can't control the ball at all, and instead control the environment.  Along the way there are contraptions you become embedded in that allow you to do fun things like hop or fly.The puzzles aren't terribly difficult, and you can easily complete the game in a couple of sessions.  This isn't a game for rushing through, though.  So get a warm drink, turn down the lights, and cozy up to this delightful physics puzzler.			"

												NightSky, a 2011 indie release by Nicalis, can easily be described as such: it's almost exactly what comes to mind when one hears the word indie games. Picturesque and stylized graphics, simple controls, a short playtime, cerebral yet casual challenge, and an ambient soundtrack by some experimental musician or another.Personally, I enjoyed it; my play-through took only a meagre 2 hours, but that's well worth the price considering I got it through one of the Humble Bundles. The physics could be a bit frustrating sometimes: sometimes the game just doesn't do what you want it to do, especially if you're playing with poor d-pad, like the good ol' 360 controller. However, such a problem doesn't exist with a keyboard - the only reason I played with a controller is because I lack a QWERTY keyboard, and you can't remap the controls.Other than that nitpick, the game is a neat, picturesque and ambient little puzzle game, that gives your brain something to chew on without ever becoming frustrating (discounting the control hiccups mentioned above).

												I actually really enjoyed NightSky- the combination of ambient soundtrack with simple visuals, and the nice mechanics and physics, made it altogether a very calming yet rewarding experience. The progression through the dream and the distinctive areas were always interesting to explore, along with the variety of unexplained, unknown characters you pass by through your journey.			"

												Not normally a big puzzle platformer fan but this one was more platformer/marble-madness than puzzle and it was enjoyable enough that I went about backtrack searching for the secrets to unlock the bonus levels.Good art and effects, great music and sound effects, good balance of platforming skill to puzzle solving. Good variety of challenges.The only negative I have is that on rare occassions the physics of the 'speed' ability would glitch out and ruin an otherwise fine jump.			"

												It's certainly relaxing, at least until you start to swear at the monitor because you're failing the same puzzle over and over again until you realize you've been approaching it the wrong way and feel lopsided.The point of the game is that someone is sleeping and this is their dream. They dream of a glowing marble traversing some levels and not really doing anything besides getting past puzzles. That's it.I mean, I liked it for what it was, but it's nothing remarkable or spectacular. I certainly won't remember playing it a year from now.7.5/10			"

												I'm not into puzzle games, got this as a part fo a bundle deal. But for a game in a  genre I don't care for, its pretty good. You play as this ball. Some sort of glass or crystal sphere. You roll around.  You have powers like reverse gravity at the games pre determined whim. And you try to use said powers get past the oobsticles.And the artwork is pretty good too.			"

												That few moments after the sun sets, but darkness hasn’t arrived yet.  The sky lit in vibrant colors, but everything around you unlit and shrouded in shadow.  NightSky from Nicalis exists solely in that short time, a collection of puzzles centered around moving an enigmatic sphere from left to right.The physics are top notch.  You’ll guide this little sphere through dozens of stages full of clever puzzles, ingenious machines, and constantly changing (though easy-to-understand) rules.  The game will often give you a new control scheme, and immediately twist it in a surprising new direction.  The story is almost nonexistent, but it doesn’t have to be strong in a game like this.There are two difficulty levels, but the game plays functionally the same in each.  The main themes of each world are still present in each, though the puzzles themselves are ramped up in the alternate version.  Some levels have hidden stars on them, which are required to finish the bonus levels found at the end of the game.  Going back to find those stars is a fun little sidequest.The audio is astounding in its minimalism.  The music is soft and relaxing.  The sound effects include waves lapping at the shoreline, the soft sound of rain on grass, and wind blowing through tree leaves.  The sphere and other movable objects will make audible thunks when they hit something, giving them a weightiness that would otherwise be lacking.  The sound the sphere makes when it hits something makes it seem fragile, though you can’t break it (but you can drop it down a bottomless pit).The graphics are gorgeous, and I always had a softspot for this kind of art direction where the foreground is black and the background is lit in brilliant colors.  Though sometimes it can be difficult to tell what is a stable platform and what is scenery, and more than once I dropped my sphere thinking I could land on something.The puzzles are expertly crafted and gorgeously detailed.  They progress very logically, teaching you the rules you’ll need to solve them as you go.  At least in the normal difficulty, nothing was overly frustrating or unfair, and most times figuring out what I needed to do was rather simple.  It was the doing of it that took a bit of time.NightSky is a great example of minimalist game design.  Nothing too flashy, but there is some real enjoyable content here.  The physics come together very well and everything behaves realistically.  Graphically its a real treat, and I would listen to the soundtrack every weekend to help me relax.  It only takes about two hours to finish, but what a great two hours it is.  Highly recommended.NightSky is available on Steam, Humble, and 3DS.			"

												The name ""nightsky"" really fits this wonderful little gem of a game.  Set against a dark, rainy background, with rain streaking down, the occasional flash of lightning, it's easy to forget that this is, really just a physics game with a marble and obstacles.   As you move from level to level, the sounscape changes... One minute you're in a swamp, with rain, bullfrogs, and lightning, then you careen into a cave, and there's drips, and echoes.. then into an industrial complex, with humming, and clanking... Each of the surfaces you hit has a different sound too, and you feel the clonk of wood, or the tang of metal-on-metal as you bounce around.The levels are extraordinarily varied too.  You're not always a ball, sometimes you're a flying or hopping thing..  Sometimes you're on a zipline.  Sometimes your controls are reversed (for good reasons!), and sometimes you have no controls at all, but must adjust the scenery instead.   Every level is very different!The game starts off very atmospherically.. Talking about a dream, and then you're a ball, rolling along a beach.  The first few levels are just dreamlike.  There's no major difficulty.. You're soaking up the rushing waves, the beautiful sounds and music.. Then things get a little complex.. But not so that it breaks the flow... and so on.. the game gets gradually harder, but (in normal mode), never becomes too frustrating.  I finished the normal mode game pretty quickly, and it was wonderful.  There's nothing groundbreaking in Nightsky, it's just that it puts everything together really really well.  All the way through, it never gets boring, and just as you've had a hard part, you get a nice serene quiet grassy part, where you can relax and roll on through.   The levels themselves are grouped into screens of three.  Once you've finished a three-screen run, you get a 'save point'.  This is great, because the 'feel' changes every three screens as well, because each of the three-screen-levels usually contain one major puzzle or obstacle, and a few minor ones.at the end of normal mode, you get to the last level, and if you haven't found all the secrets, you don't get to proceed and get that last achievement.  Not to worry though, the secrets are marked, and (usually) easy to obtain once you know where to look.   There are a few exceptions to this, however, which are VERY frustrating to get, but these are in the alternative mode....So..  You can choose to play through in Normal or Alternative mode.  Normal is a nice, easy, free-flowing fun game, as descrived above. Alternative mode contains fiendishly altered versions of the levels from Normal mode... It makes for a fun playthrough, as you see how the game is made so much harder by the omission or substitution.  Some of the level changes are absolutely down-right cunning.  Some of them feel like they were the 'alpha' versions of the levels, before the playtesters announced that they were just too finnicky for the main game.All I'll say is this, I managed to finish both modes, and had a good time doing it.  The only annoying parts were trying to get the achievements in Alternative mode.. That was a real exercise in frustration!  However, overall, the game was solid, and well worth the money.  Well recommended to anyone who likes a good indie physics puzzle platformer, and fancies something with good, nice, atmosphere, but very pick-up-and-put-downable for busy lives.    Not recommended if you don't have good hand-eye coordination, and have difficulty coordinating fast button-clicking to pull off pixel-perfect maneuvers.. It does need some very find finger-control to balance that ball!			"

												Simple, stylistic, puzzleish. No real setback if you screw up, but the challenge is just enough without needing to be punishing. The moody ambiance can pull you through. Does seem to go quick, but a bit of a fun trip, with not your usual platformer mechanics. Reminds me of And Yet It Moves in that regard. Just very nicely done, with interesting flourishes. 4/5			"

												Unless this game is on a hell of a special, give it a miss.  There's nothing puzzling about it, and the platforming is in that try, try again and pray category.It's not a puzzle game if you know exactly what you need to do but are beaten by the control scheme.  That first wall running bit is a good example - hold left all the way through the loop, but then you have to flick suddenly to holding right.  No matter what I couldn't get a smooth looking transition on that one, I'd always end up losing momentum and if I was too slow coming to a complete stop.  Very jarring, breaks the smooth, flowing tone of the game by making me have to THINK about the control scheme.  I can't think of any intuitive way to implement the mechanic, and I'm not sure that bit, and the others like it, were really worth including in the game.			"

												Another nice platform-puzzler, that comes in two flavours:* chilled and slow, almost a no-brainer* more challenging puzzles and requiring good reflexes/controlThe first time the player will run the normal mode ... and this is a perfect game for late-night relaxation: soothing music, sweet ambient sounds (wind & rain), dark and minimalistic visuals (papercut-style, sometimes with colorful/plasma backgrounds).While this mode lacks a true challenge, it gives the nice n warm feeling of a friendly casual game. Yes, even without a ""true"" story (no need for fancy stories in puzzlers anyway (IMHO)).The second mode is called ""Alternative"" and the required control-skills are way higher. Later levels also need some creative thinking in order to find a solution.However, it still remains a ""slower"" game (for me a good thing ;) ).I totally enjoyed both modes.			"

												Very well made platforming indie game. There's not a whole lot to it but it stays interesting throughout the whole game.Gameplay: It's a physics based puzzle game in which you control a ball and get from one side of the screen to the other, utilizing certain powers such as speed, inverting gravity, and precision control of the ball. The physics are very well done and it's very satisfying and fun to move the ball around. I thought that all the puzzles were a good level of difficulty, I never had too much trouble finishing them, but some required some intuition.Graphics: Similar to something like Limbo, although more colorful. The graphics aren't anything too special, but the game is more about the gameplay. It looks nice for what it is though.Nothing much to say about story, since it's just a basic puzzle game. The level design is good quite good and compliments the gameplay well. It's not too long, but not too short. Check this one out on a sale. 8/10			"

Overall, NightSky is good for a couple hours of play time, but that's about it.  7.5 out of 10.Decent little side-scrolling platformer and well done where you control a ball and depending on the level can either make him faster and/or have better traction.  An easy game to pick up where you're using physics/gravity to make jumps to cross the screen.  The complete game can be completed casually in a little over a couple hours.  The final level is certainly not clear in that you needed to pick up ""hidden stars"" in the earlier levels in order to continue;  it really should be made clearer in the game.  Regardless I made it to the final level in 2hrs and after some googling discovered what I needed to do and used a guide to get the well-hidden stars in order just to play the last level; 30mins to complete the guide and then the last level.

												An excellent game.While minimalistic, the graphics are very appealing. The ambient sounds and audio overall are well madeand provide a distinguishing feel for each of the ""Dimensions"". The gameplay is simple and engaging, andshould cater to anyone who likes brain teasers and playing with finesse. Alternative levels are somewhata rehash of the regular ones, which is an acceptable flaw; especially considering the sheer number anddiversity of the challenges presented. Some levels are clearly more demanding in terms of skill, but arenever frustrating. The game itself runs very smoothly, and the keyboard responses are quite natural.Overall, several hours worth of fun and art. Ten out of ten from me.Would recommend to anyone into puzzle games, or looking for a different genre from their usual fare.Enjoy :)			"

You soon start to see that there are a few extra layers of complexity hidden within. Especially when you get to the Alternative tracks. The game has a few secrets too, but I'll let you find those.

												Getting your marble from one place to another is the basic premise of this game. The story told in the beginning doesn't really hold much of anything but the game physics do shine along with its changing mechanics such as adding or removing gravity control, boost and etc.My only complaint is that the transition between the segments should be more fluid because I don't enjoy going to the edge of the screen only to find myself somewhere in the middle in the next one. It feels strange to ""teleport"". It breaks the immersion of moving forward. Then again, the story did say that we are in a dream.If you like playing with marbles then this is definitely worth adding to your collection.For me, I'm just annoyed with playing it.			"

												NightSky, a 2011 indie release by Nicalis, can easily be described as such: it's almost exactly what comes to mind when one hears the word indie games. Picturesque and stylized graphics, simple controls, a short playtime, cerebral yet casual challenge, and an ambient soundtrack by some experimental musician or another.Personally, I enjoyed it; my play-through took only a meagre 2 hours, but that's well worth the price considering I got it through one of the Humble Bundles. The physics could be a bit frustrating sometimes: sometimes the game just doesn't do what you want it to do, especially if you're playing with poor d-pad, like the good ol' 360 controller. However, such a problem doesn't exist with a keyboard - the only reason I played with a controller is because I lack a QWERTY keyboard, and you can't remap the controls.Other than that nitpick, the game is a neat, picturesque and ambient little puzzle game, that gives your brain something to chew on without ever becoming frustrating (discounting the control hiccups mentioned above).
