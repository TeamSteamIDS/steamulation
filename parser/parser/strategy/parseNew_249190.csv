												To paraphrase a certain quirky games reviewer - ""Ancient Space is Like Homeworld but...""(Also... ancient space? isn't most space ancient?)Imagine for a minute you're playing Homeworld with persistent ramifications level to level (the more you suck early on, the tougher later levels will be - so don't suck)... well Ancient Space has none of that. Careful resource management? Nope. A large variet of units? Nah. Major differences between your ships and the baddies? Nu-uh. Massive truely 3D space environments where you have to think tactically in three dimensions? Sorry - but it does pretend fairly well.No. Ancient Space (which in TeamSpeak is pronounced ""AAAAAAAncient Spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace"") instead goes down the Dawn of War route to being a game.There are persistent resource points - which given the infinite nature of space, are of course severly limited in number and fixed. You can only place ""buildings"" on the fixed resource points (really they're turrets. Either good vs Cap ships OR small and medium ships, radar, repair, or slow the enemy) which is lucky as the AI is too stupid to try going around them.The resources are infinite - being one of those X resource/time types, which is mostly fine, but it robs you of the risk vs reward of trying to go further and further out from your base to mine/dig/harvest stuff that was present in RTS games since Dune 2 Ship numbers are insanely low. Don't expect to re-enact cool space battles from films or previous games... the most I've seen so far was 21 slots (some ships take more than one slot). I say ship numbers are low - they're low for you. The enemy have no such troubles, and their production times are much shorter (so the poxy ships that disable your pop up so often that they get very annoying very quickly).Ships are ... boring really. 2 or 3 of each size of ship (eventually 4 different fight sized ships! woo). The limitations on numbers and the small variety mean that Corsairs are the best thing since sliced-starships. They can imobilise an enemy and then capture it 6 of them takes on every resource area/enemy building facility I've come across) and you could build more.Space is apparently not 3D... it pretends to be... but it's really just a blanket over some bumpy things (like it was in the original Doom). Why do I say this? because you can't direct your ships up or down... there are some floaty circles in space which are higher or lower than each other and if you click on them then your ships will dutifully move there - but you can't positions ships half-way without fist commanding them to move somewhere then stopping them midway. Homeworld might have been more years ago than I'd like to admit, but they worked out how to go up and down back then. Then there's the fact that the circles of space being transparent which occasionally causes ships to go somewhere you didn't think you were clicking because the context sensitive movement system though you wanted to go somewhere closer to the camera than you knew about. Seriously the movement in this game is almost poor enough to be a bug - not quite, but really... meh!Between missions do your actions carry any weight? No. You can upgrade some ships a bit (and one ship a lot) by spending points which are arbitarily doled out at the end of each mission. Ships you build vanish mysteriously to be replaced by an entirely different fleet of ships the mission designers thought would see you through.In Homeworld you had your entire race with you on one ship - because your previous home had been bombed into a radioactive hellish nightmare type affair... so it made sense that you lose your mothership, you lose. In this game despite travelling everywhere by fixed, reliable and free warp gates, you send your utterly irreplaceable carrier on every mission... not just outside the last gate so you can send reinforcements through as and when they're needed... because, reasons.But the graphics are awesome right? Well, they're ok I guess - we are unfortunately in a time where graphics are pretty good even in low budget titles. Sure things are pretty, but no prettier than X3 for instance and that's several years old. Textures are alright, models are ok... nothing says ""OMG! THIS IS AWESOME I WILL NOW DRY HUMP MY MONITOR"" though.Also, the levels are small - it's space! Why must things be so small... Warp-gates are the only way to get from one sector to another so there's no inbetween space, and the sectors themselves are tiny (compared to Homeworld).I know by now people will be wondering why compare it to Homeworld so much? Well to those people - go play Homeworld then play this... you'll see that at no time has there been an original idea design wise. This game is trying to be Homeworld and a bit more.People really seemed fixated on Skirmish mode in forum posts running up to release - there are three skirmish missions. No free form - decide things yourself missions... nope, 3 specific missions. The first is a Horde type game ""survive as long as possible""...There's no multiplayer. No Co-op, no Versus mode. I've heard people counter with ""well, that means they can focus on the single player story"" ... Well, Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaancient Spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace is clearly aping both Homeworld and Dawn of War - both games had rich developed single player experiences AND multiplayer.I can't recommend this game - not because it's terrible, not because it's below average, but simply because it's trying to be two games which were both better examples of being them. Had Homeworld and Dawn of War not existed then this would be good. But they do exist, and having played them, this feels more like a poor copy that it would otherwise.Allow me to move ships UP and DOWN in spaceAllow me to play the game with friends (co-op campaign or competitive)Allow me to build a fleet of ships (not a couple of ships)Allow me to take ships from one mission to anotherAllow me to choose a strategy from a variety of ships and play styles (rather than severly limiting my choices by having so few unit types - best ships in the game are the Corsair and Cutlass and you have to capture those)Increase the number of skirmish optionsFix those and you'll have a game that's almost as good as Homeworld (which if Gearbox are reading - a release date for the remaster would be nice). Till then you have an average game which doesn't stand out enough to recommend - even at £14.99			"

												An RTS set in the future and in space. Large fleets of warships exchanging fire. Everything from small frigates to extremely large super carriers and battle cruisers. Sounds good? I thought it did. Watched a few videos, read the reviews, and thought I would give it a go anyway. The entire premise sounds fantastic, but the game has one really fatal flaw that makes it almost unplayable. I will explain further on. Positives + Diverse amount of ships, creating strategy and counter strategy+ The environment looks really nice+ Particle effects look not too bad, explosions and lasers look pretty awesome in huge fleet battles+ Upgrading system for the fleet and your carrier allow for different playstyles+ Limited amount of ships that you can build, forcing you to choose the best ship for the job+ Music is pretty good, though the effects sound a little washed out+ Replayability is pretty good via skirmishing, even without multiplayer Neutral +/- Graphics could look slightly better, what I mean is if you zoom all the way in on a ship, it looks really pixelated. Not a huge deal, but the textures could have been better.+/- No grinding, and only a limited amount of scrap collected per mission make it hard to have a good fleet all the time. Upgrades can be resold for full value, but the upgrade phase is before the next mission, and without any kind of brief it is hard to anticipate what you would be facing. Negatives While there is only one negative point I can think of so far, it is the biggest and most glaring issue with this game. It take the playability of this game down to almost zero. All of the positives and neutrals do absolutely nothing to allieviate this one, and only one, negative point. Here it is,- Ship pathfinding and obstacle negotiation is non-existentSeems like that would not be a huge deal? Well, this is a strategy game, in space, with spaceships. And the pathfinding is terrible, and they can't fly their way out of a wet paper bag. Multiple times I have failed a mission simply due to my ships not responding to a move order, or getting stuck in an infinite loop of ""bounce off wall and try to go through it again, only to bounce off of it"". A slight work around has been to activate the tactical pause, and micro manage each move and positioning ship by ship. Gets tedious and should not be that way. Conclusion Other than the pathfinding issue, this would be a great game. I simply cannot recommend this game, based only on that issue. If the devs release a patch to fix the pathfinding, then this would be a fantastic game.  Category Score   Gameplay 1/5   Graphics 4/5   Music & Sound 4/5   Replayability 4/5 Total                  13/20 = 65%Cannot RecommendTL;DRGame is pretty good, looks good, has decent replay value, music and sounds washed out a little, but major pathfinding issue makes it unplayable for me.65% "

												Plainly: The game that tries to do too many things, piles too many things on player and does none of them well enough justify them.If you really, really, really want a ""space rts"" (that has good chance of dissapointing more ways than one) give it a go... but don't pay the full price it isn't worth it not by a long shot.Rant version:Well it looks and sounds quite good. But there are problems and quite many of them.The ""maps"" in game look very nice, not just empty space which is nice... untill you need to navigate corridors and entrances on paralel levels... the rounting of the units can be bad, or worse  the larger ships tend to get caught, if not stuck, either slowed to a crawl or taking the bloody longest route to get anywhere. Makes one hope the maps were void of any obstacles. The combat areas are usually split to more than several sectors, which might sound good but hardly is. Areas are connected by wormholes and AI or player can go through em almost at will, reingforcing or attacking  dependending objectives.  The problems begin when you have to, divide ships and atention to 2, 3 or 4 locations. The ship limit is so appalling you really can have only one proper assault force and maintain effective ship type diversity, there are only few ships that that can churn out more cannon fodder and naturally (except the main carrier) those are pretty much out from your fighting force. To hold the areas and collect resources you need to capture certain positions in sectors, in these positions you build stations and upgrade from quite a few options, sounds again nice but overall the stations are quite apalling in deffence, only able to hold their ground to a lightest of assault without backup. Naturally there are several diffrent station types ranging from slowing, repairing, detecting and what not half of them are a damn waste... except perhaps the repair one. Why there had to be so many options? Could there have not bee more extensive upgrades instead of single useless specialition? Guess not.Basicly you are left with useless ""defense"" which should be protected, except you dont have the manpower really to do that if you are seriously thinking of pushing foward.Many of the units have special abilities, abilities you need to use due the limited fleet sizes, again sounds good but leads to way too much micromanagering even with a pause option in battle. Some or most the abilities hould have been made autotriggering , enabled or not bloody there at all.The missions are interesting and... warying... wich again should be good, but again it is done quite irritating way. Usually you start with everal sectors, usually full of opposition. Beside objectives attacking something, deffending, scanning object you need to maintain deffenses and counter enemy attacks that the ""deffensive stations"" rarely can handle. The objectives can be spread around on several diffrent sectors and at best have time limits... felt every second objective seems to be time limited or needing to protect something thats as sturdy as thin glass chalice.At best you need attack, deffend, scan, chase something down from several diffrent sectors, without manpower to cover half of it (never mentioning the rock, paper, scizors of the ship types yay!"", the production capacity to mantain pressure, or attention that would need to be divided between 2, 3 or 4 hotspots in diffrent sectors.Overall the the problem, the core problem is that the game tries to do too many things at the sametime, not doing half of them decently but still piling it all to the players plater all the same and thats where it falls appart.The game can hardly get out of the swamp of mediocrity but is it a bad game? No,  if not good one either.But... kinda makes one sad to see people comparing and even praising this to be a ""spiritual"" successor to the Homeworld series. Even with the fact ""time makes the memories golden"", one can say the original homeworld with its many bugs, and flaws was a good game, and so was the sequel. Comparing this rubbish to it is a damn crime againts the gilded memories of ""better times and games"".  "

												Ancient Space is a 3D, space based, story heavy, single player, real time strategy game (RTS).The Great:- Gorgeous 3D space environments that should be the standard for space RTS games going forward- RPG mechanics such as gear and specializations customization added to ships and capital ships that make you wonder why no one else has done it this well in an RTS game before- Detailed and intricate RTS with RPG aspects gameplay works very well - a solid foundation to build upon- Voice-acting and story are well above average for the genreThe Good:- Intuitive control scheme- Varying difficulty- Nice pacing such that it is almost always interesting but not exhausting or stressfulThe Bad:- Some technical glitches present- Graphics options are nearly non-existent- Missions can run long at times and sometimes contain tedious overlong sections- Occasional excessive difficulty- This game would do very well to include Steam Workshop support for easy modding supportOverall:This looks to be a very worthy addition to the RTS genre.  While a slightly tighter and more forgiving campaign might have proved better,  at $20, and given how much the game innovates in some ways (e.g. adding ""gear"" to your fleet of ships and the overall art direction) it is hard to find much to complain about.  If you like strategy games or RTS games in particular, you should definitely pick this game up.			"

												An unsatisfying drink for the parched rts fan.  Bland is probably the best way to describe this game. Limited maps inspired by moba lanes with limited placement ""tower"" defense type buildings thrown in.  To be honest pickings are slim right now in the rts genre unfortunately which inspired my purchase. The best thing I found about this is the price. My disappointment was slightly eased. Its pretty but like a great looking painting, you wish you could go there but when you reach out you realise its just 2d afterall and you can only look...Homeworld ruined pretty much any pleasure which might have been found here with comparisons but even standing on its own merits its weak. God knows how many years on and nothing has touched homeworld since. Just soulless.Edit - missed a word out. Cleaned up last paragraph.			"

												I'll expand upon this review later as I play through more of the game. The time that I've spent on it so far is merely a review of my first impression of the first 5 missions.Compared to other RTS games, this game doesn't really do anything that better games, such as Homeworld, haven't already brought to the table. The difficulty is pretty damn hard due to the way the AI are unfairly given so many units that are all thrown upon you. The game is not difficult because of an intelligent AI, but more because you have to face overwhelming numbers most of the time which sometimes leaves you feeling cheated when you're beaten.Example:In mission 2, you have to face roughly 50 units with your 12. The enemy are given battleships and frigates and many fighter squadrons. You only have a carrier, a battleship and 9 squadrons of fighters/bombers. You cannot build frigates yet, and frigates are good against fighters, so your fighters get mowed down while they try to hit the enemy fighter squadrons which counter your bombers. Even then, frigates are fairly decent against bombers, which doesn't make much sense. To win, you have to have your fleet at the center of the map where your turret's angle of fire (if you haven't built many turrets, you are screwed and have to restart; the trigger which spawns all of these units is unexpected and you won't have enough time to build the turrets to counter the threat) can deal the most damage on the incoming enemy units and allow you pick off the early incoming units one by one until the battleships arrive, rather than having a massive wall of enemy units focusing on your mission critical capital ships (if you lose either the carrier or battleship, you fail).To each mission, there is a specific formula to how you should beat each mission (e.g. you have to build/upgrade these units, attack these units at this time, use this special ability etc all in this order to win the mission, you will find it extremely hard to do it any other way). This then becomes a gruelling trial and error affair where you have to figure out the formula and win, which sometimes frustrates you to no end and limits your tactical options to win the mission. Some tactical choices you make earlier in the mission render the later part of the mission next to impossible to win, resulting in you having to go back and restart. This game looks pretty much your typical RTS game, but not what you'd entirely expect. It may not introduce many new things to the genre, but it does keep you on your toes and is unforgiving. This can be interesting, especially for people who want a challenge.I do not wish to give this a negative recommendation, I'd rather give it a neutral rating (some will hate it, some will love it, some will think it's just okay). But, since there is no such option, and I'd rather lean a little to the negative side, I have given it a negative recommendation. I'd suggest you wait for the eventual sale to come around if you wish to get this game, just incase you get disappointed with it.			"

												I've played with numerous space RTS games in the past and I have to say I like Ancient Space. I'm at Mission 4 and until this point it has a very good atmosphere, something what only older games, Homeworld or Conquest: Frontier Wars were able to give. And maybe I've played space RTS, such as Homeworld a long time ago, and I played that one on hard, but this is the first time I've lost on normal (I've lost a few times already, first during Mission 1 and then right at the beginning of Mission 3 and a few times after that. It's not an easy game.).As a storywriter, as that's my job IRL, what I like the most that here the characters sounds life like. They don't explain evident elements, but tell it well, like if they would part of their life. This is something what I miss from others games and what I really like here, as this gave the first good impression during the first cutscene, namely that we have a character who doesn't feel the necessity to explain the whys or whens in the log, but tells everything natural.The only thing what I've found strange that the were no VO during the tutorial and I miss the unit feedbacks (However they're synthetics, so I can live with it.). And the narrators are also doing their job well. What I also liked is that during the tutorial, the music was also able to give a great atmosphere, something what many games are unable to. And if I already speak about the music, as it's one of the necessary element, I have to say it is also great and very atmospheric.I still have to get used to the controls and such, but I already see that the upgrades and scannable elements also make sense, and they don't feel as just filler elements, but they're really give something for your units, so as the officers and their skills. Overall, after the first few hours, I'm pretty impressed with the game as it's giving back something what only older games, such as Homeworld or Conquest: Frontier Wars were able to give. I believe Ancient Space worth the investment and your time.My rig is a FX8320 3.5/4Ghz, 8GB Ram with a Sapphire R7 260X and on this config the game plays smoothly in 1920x1080.			"

												""Ancient Space"" is a really decent entry into the space RTS genre, which (very refreshingly) gets away from the ironically boring routine of just having to be fast, fast, FAST!Indeed, the game pretty much goes in the opposite direction. Many missions are downright...contemplative in pacing. However, this isn't to say that there aren't some pulse-pounding moments where you have to think quickly. Indeed, if you forget that you can ""get on the gas,"" you probably won't complete all the missions.Going along with the previous paragraph, I'm very pleased to say that this title emphasizes giving things thought, especially in terms of figuring out what fleet configuration works for you. Frantic micromanagement really isn't the order of the day, although some micromanagement helps you get the most out of your units. The friendly ship AI isn't brilliant, but it's good enough that you can often let them make a number of decisions themselves. This emphasis on strategy (as opposed to hotkey mashing) even applies to those moments where you can't dawdle: You have to recognize what's going on and react swiftly but deliberately, whether it's proceeding with a certain kind of build or just running away.No, the game doesn't reach ""Homeworld-franchise"" territory. The scale of the game is too limited for that, both in the story and the way the game plays. ""Ancient Space"" is really a number of interconnected, constrained arenas that do become relatively easy to predict. (At the same time, I have to give a nod to the developers choosing a workable and recognizable mechanic, and then sticking with it consistently.) Also, this isn't a game about battles with tens upon tens of ships. Resources tend to be pretty thin, though steady, and your unit cap never goes much beyond 20. Unlike in other offerings, you're simply prevented from being able to ""overwhelm"" the enemy - and a person might argue that this helps to keep things interesting.On the story side, the scope of the narrative is surprisingly human-scale. This does allow for some interesting intrigue and a pretty decent plot-twist, but it doesn't quite fire the imagination like a ""Homeworld"" game might. ""Sprawling"" and ""epic"" just don't describe the way ""Ancient Space"" feels, and sprawling epicness is what's required for a ""Homeworld"" experience. There has to be a confluence of visual style, musical depth, and narrative context that conveys an almost mystical sense of size. This game doesn't get to that point, and it may be that it just wasn't meant to. That is to say that ""Ancient Space"" isn't a bad setpiece at all. It's just that the metaphorical walls aren't very far apart.There are some ""mechanical"" errors to be found. I had some moments where ships would infuriatingly fail to pathfind, and perhaps connected with that, I had a couple of occasions where ships would just halt for no apparent reason.But those are only little dings. ""Ancient Space"" is a good game, and definitely worth a playthrough. It seems to have been crafted well, and it scratches the RTS itch in a slightly different way than other contenders in the genre. I say, ""Good On Ya"" to CreativeForge for putting this thing together. I enjoyed it.			"

												In short - heavy Homeworld-inspired space RTS, with few interesting ideas and worth playing, despite lacking the final polish.In each of 15 missions (plus few skirmish scenarios, without typical ""random"" skirmish and no multiplayer) you are tasked with various main and optional objectives from the range of typical RTS tasks - convoy escorts, strategic points capturing and holding, scanning/picking up objects and such. Most of them have to be taken on simultaneously, which, along with rather fast combat, makes active pause really important, not to mention fleet composition (since your ""replicants"" aka squad cap is usually smaller than needed and enemy nearly always have advantage in numbers). Ships are generally divided into 4 categories (small, medium, large and ""extra large"" + buildings) and while you unlock new models automatically with progress, it is possible to capture enemy ships as well, which increase options. Upgrading ships with parts found along the missions in preparation screen between them, as well as selecting officers for battle (providing various active buffs or abilities during the mission) and researching new modules for your main ship is also possible.Story, however, suffer from rather poor presentation - most background information, treated often by characters as oblivious, is skipped or hidden in ships/discoveries descriptions. Voices are poorly done. Abilities to hold fire against selected targets or adjusting units speed to slowest ones are missing and would be really needed in many situations. Missions are heavy scripted and thus some have to be repeated few times, always with same or similar results. Camera controls are problematic sometimes (many users instinctively use zoom along with WSAD keys to operate camera in third dimension, only to find that said zooming is heavy restricted. Devs replied that they never intended zoom to be used as camera controls, as keys Q and E covers moving in up and down - explanation can can be understood, but is still less intuitive than it could be).Overall 7/10 or even 8/10 game. Maybe not the best space RTS out there - but we had almost nothing new lately and game is still fun. Ending suggest sequel, so maybe next time it will go better?By the way - if you experience heavy fps drops during the game and graphical options dont do anything - try to manually add the game to your GPU control panel list.

												Not bad, but severely underwhelming.  It's the sort of thing you would find in the $5 bin at WalMart and be pleasantly surprised by. Worth purchasing on sale, maybe, but at full price there's far better games out there.The big upside is that it's extremely challenging. Not because of the enemy AI or anything, no it's hard due to the sheer ridiculous swarms of enemy ships you will face - missions are generally pretty short and brutal slugfests hopelessly outnumbered which you can win by being equal parts clever and lucky.The story is alright but extremely generic. It's somewhat nonsensical to me to send in your precious, irreplaceable carrier for every mission and to abandon your fleet whenever you leave the sector, but then I'm not some masterful tactician so who am I to say.The maps are not open, as was implied - they are typically divided into 3 small sectors connected by warp gates. The only place you can build is fixed positions and the only thing you can build is turrets.Ship pathfinding is hilariously bad. You can somewhat overcome this by manually instructing your ships around every small obstacle but this obviously presents an absolute nightmare situation doing a lot of things, like trying to send ships reinforce other ships in a major fleet fight, or trying to not smash your keyboard and froth at the mouth in your chair.I could go on but I think you get the point. It has potential, yes. It's not a bad game. But it's far outclassed, even by games decades older than it (yes I mean Homeworld 2). And I wouldn't reccommend anyone buy it at full price.			"

												Now that I've had the chance to play this game for a few hours, I can tell you that this 20 dollar purchase was very reasonable. A lot of people are comparing this game to HomeWorld, but that is an unfair comparison as you are dealing with apples and oranges.Homeworld was great for what it offered. Massive fleet battles, graphics that were amazing for their time. A compelling story. Ancient Space didn't try to copy Homeworld. PROS :The voice acting as has been stated by other reviewers are great. The story is plausible and pallatable in the same way Nexus: The Juptier Incident had a fresh spin on the old space genre.The level of detail on the ships is great. Perhaps, because I do have a good video card, I can play it on max settings and the detail really shines. The way you control your ships is intuitive and I felt the learning curve was negligible. The ""hero commanders"" that are activated via the interface that can cast spells or debuffs(shields, more armor, more attack, enemy is more vulnerable, and so on) is a nice addition. Having stationary platforms that help you crawl is a creative and fun idea. Has a small Command & Conquer feel to it. CONS : As some have mentioned, the graphical requirements are pretty high. People are having performance issues. I am not one of them. The AI. It seems like waves of enemies continue to come your way. That's not so bad, but the game doesnt teach you that you basically just set up your units in specific areas of interest, following the rock paper scissor approach depending on what the enemy is throwing at you. You dont tell your ships what to attack as much as tell them where to be, ready for an attack. And when you get swarmed, you can issue orders to target fire on a specific ship. Point is, its more like moving chess pieces into position, and then using it, than just go and attack this target the way Homeworld did it. I think this is a great game, relatively speaking. I hope that future projects come to fruition as a result of Ancient Space.  "

												I will flesh out this review more when I finish the Campaign and try Skirmishes.  My tenative review of the game is that it is quite good, especially considering the price.Story/Campaign:  The tone of the story is short, but effective.  The form of delivery for the story is modeled after general RTS Campaigns such as Company of Heroes or the Homewrold franchise.  Campaign missions tend to allow the player to move at their own pace.  In one mission (I believe mission 3 or 4), I sincerely messed up an assault on an enemy position, and paid the price in time and resources, but was able to recover and press on to completion.  The difficulty can be quite hard, but once you know the high-value targets (Warpgates/Repair Stations), things seem to resolve themselves quickly.Units:  Unit design is distinct both in art and play.  Ancient Space uses the tried and true RPS style of unit countering, in the case of this game different weapon systems are more or less effective based on the hull size of the opponent.  Once you begin customizing your units with upgrades (between missions), you can truly give your own fleet a wide range of effectiveness.  It is unfortunate how limited some of the upgrade option can be though.Art:  This is a catagory where the game tends to knock it out of the park.  Each sector looks distinct and interesting, and the background space is at times awe-inspiring.  All told, the artists for Ancient Space have created a vibrant and interesting space environment that I could likely look at for hours, assuming of course that I have eliminated the enemy Warpgates.*THIS REVIEW IS DUE TO BE UPDATED SHORTLY*			"

												You can move verticaly but there's not really any reason to. The maps have obstacles that you can't go over or under so it might as well be a two dimensional map.Its actually about controling teritory by capturing key points and is not really a fleet combat game. It has more in common with Company Of Heros than any 3D space game.Having said that, its not a terrible game for 20 bucks. Its just not quite as advertised. I played a few missions and had a bit of fun but mostly it just made me want to play Homeworld again.			"

												I'm currently 5-6 missions in the game.I always wanted a space RTS where you could fly and ficht into megastructures.  Now I can finally enjoy it.The game is good, and the scenario is simple but fun.  Sure, it's not on the level of Homeworld, or Nexus-TJI, but up to now I enjoy the game.There are a few cons, though, but nothing that a few patches can't solve.  Here are some of main issues I have:-The main one would be the camera being unable to zoom-out enough to have a full view of the battle.  Seriously, they (the creators) should work on that, as it makes seriously hinder the gameplay.-Ship movement sometimes seems erratic:  ships get caught into the megastructures (or into each others), and it can be quite tedious to direct them waypoint by waypoint. (then again, it might be better if the camera could zoom out far enough)-3D movement is not explained in the tutorial or in the control menu. (Either that or I was really distracted when playing the tutorial).  It took me quite a while to figure it out. (""g"" to summon movement disk, then ""left ctrl"" to ajust altitude, btw)  It is also somewhat buggy, and I often have to give the order twice.Outside of those few points, which are quite easy to deal with once you get used to the game, I have no complains at all about the game.

												Don't get your hopes up, it is not a new Homeworld!What you will get is a space themed RTS with unit building, light resource management (think CoH) and the ability to upgrade your mothership only between missions.The Campaign is a two edged sword, very difficult with seemingly impossible situations but also very rewarding if you manage to work your way through. The biggest disappointment for me was the lack of a skirmish mode. Well there is a menu button which is called ""Skirmish"" but behind that are just 3 maps with missions attached to it, like a horde mode for example.Pros:+nice graphics+nice sound+difficult campaign+small but interesting map designCons:-no skirmish mode-not very innovative/deep mechanics -pathfinding is a bit edgyOverall I would give it a neutral rating mostly because of the missing skirmish mode.

												Thoroughly mediocre, not worth your time.  The levels (in a space game, mind you) feel cramped.  This is compounded by very poor pathfinding.  And then on top of that, the levels are inexplicable.I got as far as a mission, where you activate the warpgate deep in enemy space.  All of my best fights so far have been pretty much taking EVERYTHING along with me, leaving a trail of turrets in my wake and sieging enemy turrets.  Not terrible, really.And then this mission.  It splits your forces, in an idiotic way, ON AN ESCORT MISSION, and then throws more DPS at the second half than you can handle.  So you have an idiotic escort train that stems straight into enemy turrets, before you can do anything about them.  And you're AT the production limit, so you can't even make more units to handle the split.  And then a large unit steams in, which none of the remote units have the weapons to handle.			"

												First of all, game strikes out on the whole ""space fleet battle"" concept, that's cherished by many homeworld fans. It's more like Starcraft with ships instead of marines. Maps are full-3D and filled with gigantic space objects you have to fly around but despite stunning looks that doesn't affect battles since ships don't have weak zones or blind spots to exploit with different attack angles.So we've got a very basic space-themed story-oriented RTS with nice visuals, fleet upgrading between missions, battles on multiple maps at the same time (when ""sectors"" aren't used as simple map-extender) and very interesting voice acting, where characters keep themselves forcibly calm and professional that transfers their stress and despair surprisingly good.Biggest issue I got so far is poor performance on my gtx670. I noticed drops to 20fps in some large battles and it made me consider giving it a negative review. Overall it keeps framerate on the reasonable level and judging by the forum that's my personal issues that won't necessarily happen to others.The game also lacks basic skirmish mode and any form of multiplayer hence replayability is a bit shallow, that may be a dealbreaker for many people.However, if you are fan of space-themed games, this one could satisfy you. It's got solid story, nice fleet-customization and overall good gameplay.			"

												First of all, if your a fan of homeworld this is an awesome game. No other space RTS game is as good as ""Ancient Space"" currently in it's time in age. Saying so, homeworld series still beats all space RTS games. Pros: Good story lineChellenging when set on harder mode (which is nice to have)OK graphicsPretty decent voicing, narration, and music.Con:Needs more content the story line is too short (Needs more objective and open space exploring)Too predictable (enemy will spawn from warp hole or base and map is narrow in where the enemy has only a few ways to enter.)Limit of units that you can command Limit types of unitsResource are easy to getEnemies AI are dumb they don't know how to counter units with your current units.I know the con list is bigger than the pros because I am huge fan of Homeworld, so anything that homeworld has other RTS space games doesnt is a flaw in my book. Yet, this game should be a collection in your library since it's a good game.			"

												I expected more...They really need to fix the cliché Group AI that you see in average strategy games... Things like: formations going totally crazy when you send them in a attack run or even a certain way. So expect a lot of micro management to safe yourself from rage.They also make comparisons with Homeworld, but expect more a Command and Conquer 4...Mainly because you cant harvest and focus on zone control. Small unit cap. Building is limited to control points. And static battles.			"

												Interesting game so far, i dislike that fleets to not carry over into the next mission, instead a preset of ships will accompnay you with only the main 2 ships awlays with you.  The game play is let down with the z plane movement (up and down) the ships can move in this plane but you cannot command them to which causes the ships to get stuck on obstacles when the only way to procceed is a passage lower or higher than the ships current position. Its an average game that will entertain until the home world remastered edition is released.Very dissappointing that when the developers release updates all saved data is erased. The only way to play old saved games is to uninstall those updates.			"

												Attention FPS fans!I am not an RTS fan at all and have not been since Home world 1 and 2. Infact nearly all of the games i own are fast paced action shooters and driving sims like Racing room, Race 07 and Rfactor. However i saw this on steam and it reminded me a little of Homeworld and i decided to go ahead and give it a try, I cant tell you how surprised i was. I actually like this game alot and it drew me into the story. The story is very good and there are some examples in our own society with regards to large coorperations, resembled in the story of this game, which i really liked. Furthermore I recognised quite a few of the voice actors, some from Star Trek (wont say which one's).The game itself is hard to play if you dont watch the tutorials at the beginning!! or look at the tips/hints at the top of the screen as you progress through the game. The graphics look nice and there was only one slight bug where I couldnt pan around the screen until I held left click and dragged the mouse and released. Then i could pan again. Overall i loved this game and its good story line despite having nearly always been a FPS fan etc... I have even just gone and bought ""Nexus: Jupiter incident"" and another RTS game.			"

												Let's talk about what this isn't : Homeworld 3.This is a story driven RTS game set in space, without the strategic complexity or depth of the homeworld series.Why do I say this? First off, for a game set in 3 dimensional space there is no Z axis!  Battles predominantly revolve around rock/paper/scissors style ship weapons and resource generation is per tick, based on owning fixed points on the map. I enjoyed it but I was disappointed there wasn't more complexity ala homeworld. "

												The Story, Voice, Music and overall ambiency is in my opinion, very well done. I like the way they used ""ingamestoryreasons"" to justify enclosed places and the use of buildings, which can be customized to heal, or shoot a specific damage type, or support, or whatever, like tower defense.With respect to the main gameplay mechanic - ship combat - I think it resembles much Nexus, but it is done in a more micro-intense matter, because you have to SPACEBAR-pause every few seconds to allocate a power, swap repairs, spawn a replacement unit, or issue new orders. This game is thus not really real time strategy but more real time tactics, like ground control, with some Z-axis movement to call it 3D. Personally, the gameplay is fun and challenging even on the easier settings, and must be downright nightmare ragemode on the hardest settings.With respect to the RPG elements... Depending on objectives you accomplish (if you even can), you receive some rewards like additional superpower (from officers), or additional secret officers. Also by collecting the yellow anomalies (which is IMHO mandatory) you gain powerups like extra resources, or materials for upgrading the fleet/carrier at the start of each mission.My only wish was that customization had been given more freedom because now you can only customize a hull by selecing between 3 or 4 narrow options like +1 armor, or +1 XL damage or +20 speed.Customization wrt to the mothership (carrier) is much more free, and you can choose between an offensive or defensive version that have advantages and disavantages. I have run with the Defensive one because it gives more resources per second, and you can build on its advantages by selecting from like 40 different upgrades, or round it out to your desire. Now my main issue with this game is not even the common (like once every 6 hours) crashes, which is understandable for a very small company product, but on the choice of the engine and the way the map layouts railroad and constrict you. I know you made the game good and adapted it to work in these constraints but I'd like to think the game would have come out better if made to work in a more open envronment, specially since in some of the missiong that are really tight, camera positioning is a pain in the butt and very frustrating not being able to see clearly whats on the area and being unable to zoom out, or worse, having to look from the bottom up (this is a problem because there is a definite up/down layout and you sort of need to be able to look from the top down).TL;DR: This game is definetly worth $20, and if you liked ground control, homeworld 1 or nexus jupiter incident, go for it. But please watch a gameplay video before buying so you can understand how different the game actually is and plays than those aforementioned titles.			"

												I like what this game is trying to do. Single-player story-driven RTS? Hell yes. Beautiful space environments? More please. Three dimensional space combat? I want it! Sadly, as much as it pains me to say this, there are just too many flaws in the execution for the game to be as enjoyable as it should be.Let's start with the worst - there are some serious technical issues going on here. I've had the game hang permanently once, and I've had a save file corrupted, which I'm honestly not used to seeing in games these days. I also had a gamebreaking bug in the mission Psychonauts (I think that's Mission 7?) where the object tied to a mission objective simply never appeared, forcing me to enable cheats through a config file and auto-win the mission. This kind of stuff is a real shame, doubly so because the game seems to have been abandoned fairly quickly after launch, with no hope of patches.Less utterly broken, but still really bad, is unit pathfinding. It can be incredibly difficult to get your units to do what you want, especially if you're trying to make use of 3D movement. I've repeatedly tried to navigate my fleet above or below objects in 3D only to have them move back down to the basic plane of movement, putting them in the way of enemy fire or getting stuck behind obstacles. Units also seem to sometimes just forget their move orders, and some abilities seem to break sometimes. The Dreadnought, for example, has a triple-blast cannon ability that obliterates buildings and does heavy damage to units, but sometimes it just doesn't seem to fire all or any of its shots despite triggering the cooldown. All of this means that half the time unit command is smooth, and the other half of the time it's infuriating.Even when it works, the gameplay design isn't flawless. Issuing targeted commands on units that are closed together is tricky, requiring you to pause and angle the camera to select what you actually want rather than all the icons beside it. A lot of combat must be either really difficult or finnicky, because I spent a lot of time waiting around to build up my forces before tackling tougher points of resistence, as going in full-force is often your only hope.The game does indeed look great, but unfortunately it's best to play at a distance a lot of the time, so you see the unit icons much more than you see the detailed units. The sound design and music are well-done, the cutscenes look cool, and the story overall is fairly interesting, though there are a few predictable beats (sudden but inevitable betrayal!), and a few threads left hanging that, I fear, will never get resolved in a sequel.Ultimately, it boils down to that - Ancient Space has some good ideas that are marred by poor execution in a few key areas, and it's really begging for a sequel, or a massive patch, that fixes these things. Sadly I doubt it will get either, and as such I can't really recommend this unless you're willing to deal with a fair amount of technical frustrations while playing.			"

												Well, this was actually a pretty good game. It has a strong strategic and tactical take (think rock-paper-scissors-Spock-lizard with a few units having abilities that can crush those who are supposed to beat them some of the time), not particularly ""lanes"" like some have said after the first couple missions. The plot is original as far as I know:   Expedition funded to investigate growing nebula and previous fleet, finds aliens who attack on sight but turn out to be clones of more peaceful Scythe who have been themselves attacked and experimented upon by the large group/corporation that funded both expeditions in the first place , who then try to kill the second expedition.  My main issue was the graphics, this was the first time on this computer I had to lower the setting, and by that I mean ALL the way down.Partly because there are so few decent space games being made anymore, I would recommend it. 8/10Oh, and I never figured out who the girl on the game image is supposed to be. 10/10 for mystery ;)			"

												Possibly the best space RTS released in years. I enjoyed the diversity of units, the missions felt at the right pace and were varied enough to stay interesting. The unit types seemed well thought out and provide a variety of different ways of completing missions. Perhaps one of my favourite things is that the steam achievement system was put to good use, most achievements were rewarded for completing missions in a different way which made you play differently instead of always spamming the same ships.My only potential gripe with the game is that the first mission is undoubtedly the hardest and then the difficulty curve drops rapidly. Other than that this was a game that kept me playing and I think I will play the campaign again on the hardest difficulty.			"

												If you love RTS, then you need to give this game a shot! I have played many RTS games and love ones that are space themed and this is the BEST one thus far.  I have played Sins of a Solar Empire, Galaxy Civ. and many others... Thank you for creating this!  Keep in mind that this is currently meant to be a single player game strategy only.  You have 4 unit classifications in this game, and each classification has its own selection of units.  Small, which would obviously be small fighter craft and bombers and others.  Medium, which consists of corvette or Frigate like space craft.  Large, which has cruiser size space craft.  And finally EXTRA LARGE, my favorite, which consists of dreadnaughts, and some other giants of space....  Also base building and capture points,  dont forget that.			"

												This games has great graphics, gameplay, voice acting, and artwork whether moving or not. The units strength and pro/cons pan out nicley. the only complaint i have is that its strange to see just how long the AI units dont die in a dog fight with my fully upgraded units. I do have a recommendation though: More content/DLC. I personally like the pirates faction so i recommend a Pirate Carrier. I personally would pay to have a campaign or skirmish in which i make sharks and cutlasses by the load. Now i understand desinging the ship might be difficult, but i think certain powers such as assualt squad (my favorite), field repairs, and either a photon cannon/nuke will suffice. The last power should be pirate specific: Scavenger. Scavenger is like their own version of war factory but instantly converts all nearby dead enemies into instant pirate ships( if not enough pop then just grey ships). Repairs could be called something like Jury Rigging or whatever. Anyway great game, fun, and needs an expansion. Please comment below in a respectufl manner.			"

												I've done a video with my playing through some first impressions. In general, I enjoyed the game. HOWEVER - if you were hoping for a homeworld replacement (as I was), don't expect to find it here. This is more a basic RTS with a few other elements. It's fun, I enjoyed playing, but didn't give me the pure joy of Homeworld.If you approach it with more generic expectations, I believe you can find a decent amount enjoyable about this game, making it worth the price. EDIT: Took out a comment regarding 3D movement based on Developer note. Will further explore, although I don't believe it'll change my review too much. Still an enjoyable game, still a bit less than I was hoping for, but fun.

												Pretty graphics, but unfortunately useless controls. You can't even change the height/altitude of your vessels. Your vessels are categorized by size (S, M, L, XL, etc) instead of function, so it's impossible to distinguish between the different classes of spacecraft (corvettes, cruisers, carriers, fighters, etc) in your armada. All the icons are more or less identical, and you have to keep clicking through your armada until you find the one you're looking for. Some interesting concepts, but it's really far away to even match the essence of the Homeworld games. The game lacks any feeling of maneuvering ""real"" spaceships. There's no inertia, vector thrusting, or even moving parts like cannons. The ships just flip around with no inertia and start moving towards their destination. And ion beams and lasers don't even emerge from the space vessels themselves. It's fun to play a few of hours, but then you get bored, and just select all your spaceships and right click the enemy to get it over with. Would never buy it at full price. Wait for at least 50% sale. It's worth a few bucks if you just want to kill a few hours of boredom.			"

												It's not the best RTS I've ever played, but the setting is interesting, the story is pretty good and the missions are actually quite diverse and pretty fun. I love the abilities the different units have.Don't go into it expecting Homeworld (nothing but Homeworld has been Homeworld so far). It's more focused on managing abilities on your ships and playing your ships to their strengths, while Homeworld was more focused on economy and tech. It's easy to fall into the same rhythm every mission, like putting together the same kind of fleet and doing the same thing every mission. However, while that can work, the different missions play to different ships strengths.Not a bad game. Pick it up cheap. I'd give it a 7/10.			"

												It's not a terrible game, some people might actually enjoy it, it just wasn't my kind of game I guess.It has some ups and downs but there is one thing that bothered me the most:There is not much freedom in each of the levels. You are bound to circles(that aren't very big) that contain zones to control where you can build stuff. It's just not a very interesting system. You get your fleet(or part of it depending on what's going on) and you fly into the enemy, you pause, assign targets(rock, paper, scissor) and use skills if needed, you repeat this a number of times, scan something here, pick something up there and that is pretty much it.I guess the story was alright but I didn't find it very engaging.

												**** (out of 5)It's a good strategical game in space with an interesting story. You can adapt the difficulty level by the how much you stop the game for your planning. Everything works quite fine, although the quests get quit long to master and a so it takes a bit too much time for the strategic chellenge. Graphics, Voice acting and play scenes are nicely done and give a good space feeling like you were out there.			"

												Somewhat similar to Homeworld, just not as good. Stuck at Campaign Scenario 4, because game crashes due to ""insufficient memory"". Well. I have a 32GB RAM Rig... Many tiny niggles sum up to a game you may only consider if you'e a real fan of the genre and can wait for a sale.+ Looks nice- Space is full of ""stuff"" just to extend travel times in the actually pretty small areas- AI doesn't seem to play by the same rules- Some missions are not done very well - Small fleet- feels very ""2D""			"

												Ok, its no homeworld. Still...Ever try to fight multiple battles at the same time using the same, limited pool of units? In addition, you can't just spam a single unit as the battle plays out like a massive game of rock-paper-scisors. Some units are strong against fighters but do little damage to big targets, another is good at taking down hard targets but will lose to fighters. Space here is also 3D, alveit limited 3D as the individual maps are fairly small.Thing is, do you think you can handle defending a target on one map, attacking a base on a second, protecting your flagship on a third map while being actively attacked on a fourth? Your basically playing multiple levels of an RTS at the same time, and units can move between levels. You can only control one group at a time, so generally need to leave at least some of the decision to the basic AI. All of this happens in realtime. This game gets hard, even more so if you play on hardcore, which disables tactical pause. It is rare your completely safe even if all enemy units are destroyed. However, the game is also fairly flexible as you get to choose your tactics and ships each level. You can play aggressive, defensive, stealthy. Use big units or small units of your choice. There are a limited number of points where you can put down support buildings, which can repair, protect, attack fighers, attack capitals, and so on. The enemy doesn't play fair, often having multiple points where enemy ships can spawn, though you can destroy these like any other building. Expect to be outnumbered often and just deal with it.So this is a mix between Homeworld, Warcraft,  and Command and Conquer. If you don't mind a difficult RTS which requires tactics and dividing your attention, give this a spin.			"

												Just finished the game.   It is not a homeworld copy.  I does have some similarities but it is it's own game.   Many people say the game is hard.  I did not find it overly hard.  It was a good chalange even on normal.    I found the best way to play is to take it slow.  Build all the stations you can and make sure the stations you build suport each other.  I liked that I was able to build up the ships that I like to use in the way I wanted to use them.   As for the story I found it very entertaning.      The over all game is a good deal for $20.  It is not perfect and would be horibly over priced at $50.   This game looks to have some more campains coming and I look forward to playing them.			"

												This game deserves a lot more love. There's a lot to learn before feeling comfortable with it, feel free to lose from time to time. Unfortunately, you won't find the information needed within the game, you'll have to read through.I feel that the game deserved more love from its developers as well. I'm not impressed as other people by the environments, they don't make a whole lot of sense considering the story and the 3d part is just for the sake of it being 3d because you won't be able to control your squadrons like that. But then again, I'm not very good at it, so maybe I'm getting it wrong.However we need to show this genre a little bit of love IF we plan to see better games coming out anytime soon.			"

												I do enjoy this game. Its not another Homeworld but definitely has some of its aspects. There is a lot of depth to the strategy in this game and is decently challenging. The story is told through an interesting string of voice messages and communications between officers.The voice acting, music, and overall ambiance is very well done. It really immerses you in the game and gets you completely involved.The art is beautiful and I could stare at a map for hours. I definitely appreciate the effort of the artists as even the spacecraft have rich detail. The environment itself is amazing to look at. My only complaint would be its rather slow pace. I tend to like faster-paced RTS games.			"

												might I say I understand they want to focus on telling an interestig story, but I feel skirmish should have some more variety of missions, at least have 3 different versions of the same missions the next being larger scale and more enemies. Some games are looking to be a quick fun experience, why not just push through and be as amazing as many people want it to be. but i mean what do i know about making games, I've been playing them for only 15 years, sorry just a little upset because it could have been a space game better than Star Wars Empire at War, but SW better because it has alot of replayability not only having a REAL skirmish mode but a galactic conquest mode (campaign's pretty much gc with specific missions).I like the game for it's variety of ships tactical combat and epic sound track, but let me digress, this games variety of ships also plays as the games minor weakness. you have to capture points on the map to be able to increase ship population, and we're talking about a starting pop of like 9 or 10 when ships can take up 1 to 3 slots. Your not going to have a massive strike fleet comparable to Mass Effet 3's basically or the Empire's when general says his famous line ""IT'S A TRAP!!"". I mention this cause I'm quite use to large fleets in my space rts games.Balancing is a bit off, like in Sins of a solar empire fighters feel almost useless, Fighters don't seem to be fast strike craft but flying fodder only to be built when bombers seem to pose a threat and then destroyed later on. I feel if fighers are so vulnerable why not increase their speed or maybe let then dock in the mothership.... I mean it is a mothership. let get back on track, you need a fairly powerful machine to run this with graphics on high, the story is ok letting you upgrade your ships and use officers to boost combat capabilities, ship designs are unique and unlike any ships i ever seen, like I said before the sound track is amazing it will have strap your self to the bow of you ship and give the finger to the universe as you slowly ascend towards epicness.... ok maybe not all that but it really is good. It offers a challenge on low difficulties making it a good game for those who want to flex those brain cells, the background is stunning and effects are nicely done. Even though I get upset about the lost replay value I enjoy playing it from time to time. 7/10			"

												Thus far I've only played the first few missions so this is just an initial impression.I see a few people comparing this to Homeworld but truth be told, though it shares certain elements like the space theme and the 3D movement, the game doesn't share much more with Homeworld.It's more accurately described as an area control type game and much more comparable to the likes of Ground Control/World in Conflict mixed with elements of Conquest Frontier Wars (the warp routes and different sectors). Each unit has a specific role and powers to which you have to micromanage each of their ability(ies). Resources are acquired by capturing specific areas and building stations on them to which resources will then trickle in over time. Each station in turn can have a certain add-on (only 1 add-on per station) build on it that adds certain actions and powers. Like turrets as an example. Between missions you can upgrade your unit's stats or abilities and you can choose which Officers to take with on your next mission, who each will have different effects during the next mission.The game is quite difficult, not because of particularly difficult AI but rather because it feels like each mission was designed to be played in a certain way but sometimes there is no clear indication of what the devs intended you to do. So a lot of trial and error. This could also only be due to my inexperience with the game.There is obviously more to the game but I’ll write a proper review once I’ve spend more time in the game. And thus far I’m more on the optimistic side. Just don’t get this with the impression that it plays like Homeworld but rather that it has a rich atmosphere and strong character like Homeworld. The thematic Battlestar Galactica-ish music also helps with this regard.			"

												This game is very nice to look at and the controls are intuitive for a 3D space game. The issue I have at this point is that it is a very linear game. Instead of an open world where you can take over bases, collect resources, and build a fleet you are led down a path of doing each of these things only to the extent that you need to in order to complete the current mission. The ability for your ships to navigate to a chosen location without getting caught on rocks/portals/etc is also an issue in some missions.As it is now, I rarely need to setup a base of operations once I remove the previous owners from a zone. Instead I just setup a base on the one or two tiles that will give me resources over time and then max out my fleet according to replicant count and move to the next location down the designated path. I assume this gripe is not as big of an issue when playing on hard difficulty, but it would be nice for the game to require you to make use of bases regardless of difficulty.I'm having fun with the game in it's current state, but I am at the point where I want more, and I'm not sure that I'll get it out of the available campaign. I hope this game is expanded upon in some way in the future to allow for different types of gameplay similar to my description above.			"

												Very good game, totally recommended for any space-RTS fan. Some good ideas, some excellent ones, and realisation is splendid, with some rather unique mood and a strong identity. Finer controls would have been good, with larger battlefields, wider tactical options, better use of the 3rd dimensions. Another issue I found is aesthetical: ships don't always behave very ""naturally"" in empty space: large or X-large ships sometimes maneuver with difficulties to reach a target, with unnatural ""pivoting"" moves; small fighter craft don't collide or evade, so sometimes they might pile on each other when standing still, instead of whirling around or drifting or something; Minor critics, though. A solid game, which begs for a larger, improved, broader sequel.			"

												Ancient Space tries very hard to appeal to Homeworld fans, and i'd say it does a decently successful job. Instead of comparing this title to the 1st Homeworld, a better comparison would be Cataclysm or Homeworld 2 due to very strict unit caps. This might seem like a horrible thing, but it actually is a saving grace for this game. Each and every single ship so far has some sort of special ability (sometimes two) which can be triggered at specific times for great effect. The more ships you add from the current values when having this variety in individual ships creates a micromanagement hell. It strikes an excellent balance between fleet size and interactivity of each type of ship.This game has its problems for sure, but if you're looking for that Homeworld kick, you will find it here. Just don't expect it to come close to the gem that is its source material.			"

												Finished the campaign on normal. Gameplay: Ancient Space feels somewhat like a single player party based MOBA game as oftentimes you'll be facing down waves of enemies with a relatively small number of ships. There are even structures on the map that spawn hostile ""creeps"". You need to use your ships' abilities and strengths to overcome the enemies' numerical superiority. Base building is minimalistic and reminiscent of tower defense games since you capture ""building nodes"" that allow you to construct turrets and support structures which can assist you in defeating enemy attacks. Missions consist of search & destroy, survival, protecting convoys and other objectives with a bit of stealth thrown in. You can scan anomalies to gain various bonuses and resources some of which can be used in between missions to upgrade your fleet and ""hero"" carrier. Your carrier can alternate between a defensive and offensive variant which has to be chosen before mission starts. One small problem here is that the offensive carrier seems to be much better and even the missions' structure seems to favor it. After I unlocked the offensive variant I never went back to the other one. In addition you can bring three officers on every mission with each having their own activated global ability with capped, per-mission, uses. Some missions favor certain officers. Combat can be paused (unless using hardcore mode) which gives you time to consider your options and issue orders. Controls can be a bit hard to get used to but ultimately I simply zoomed out a bit, used wasd to move about and played it as more of a traditional 2D isometric or bird's eye view RTS despite the game being fully 3D. AS does feature a vertical axis and you can move your ships ""up"" or ""down"" but verticality is underutilized and there is little reason to engage with it.Visuals: Visually, the best part of AS are the maps. Taking a fairly unique approach to its space-scape maps in AS often feature large rock formations or structures often giving them an enclosed or ""indoor"" feel which defies expectations one would have of a space game. Other than the interesting visual effect the only point of these obstacles is to serve as choke points or funnels. Ships have a very utilitarian, down to Earth appearance which some might find bland or boring though I'm personally happy with it. However the ships look pretty blurry and don't have much detail to them so don't expect a Homeworld-esque visual experience when it comes to observing battles. Due to the nature of the game you'll almost always be zoomed out taking a more strategic view of things so it doesn't matter much. Story/Music/Atmosphere: Everything in this game has a subdued tone. There are no over the top emotional moments, no romance, no quirky comic relieft, no saving the human race or defeting some great ancient evil. Characters are professional, even under duress, and focused on their task which is also reflected in their voice acting. Again, some might find this boring but it's a refreshing change I think. The story gets a fair amount of exposition and a conclusion but also retains some mistery. Imagine if the first Alien or Predator movies never got a sequel. Music takes cues from Homeworld with some classical and middle eastern sounding tracks and can make for a compelling listen.Overall: While I do recommend Ancient Space I don't think it's a superlative game by any stretch of the imagination. Much could be said about how this game could be better like more variety in carrier upgrades/abilities, less linear, script driven mission structure, more satisfying ship/weapon visuals/effects, more playable factions, etc. but much of that is offset by its low price and Ancient Space, such as it is, is a full working package. Best way to approach it is to not base your expectations on Homeworld (even though AS does try to tug at that particular nostalgia) but go in with a blank slate and take it as it is. I would sooner compare it to the old Conquest: Frontier Wars in terms of gameplay (albeit more streamlined). AS's maps are even separated into sectors connected by wormholes which is something we could see in Conquest. If you're a fan of sci-fi and RTS, Ancient Space makes for a pretty good, and affordable, space adventure.			"

												Interesting RTS, in fact I would believe it would be safe to say this is the only interesting RTS I've played in a very long time. It makes a good effort to bring a lot of stuff to the table but can't help feeling that if they focused more on certain aspects it could have been a lot better. Seems like they threw ideas at it and saw what stuck. It is a game that is frankly screaming out for multiplayer and modding. Onto the bad parts.The unit cap is frankly ridiculously low and you have to micromanage quite a few units. For a game that is supposed to be emulating parts of Homeworld it tends to throw you into the storyline and universe rather than introduce you to it (yeah sue me, but can't deny Homeworld series did actually have a good story). You'll spend more time paused and zoomed out than anything else which means you aren't really wow'd by the scale, combat or environement.Worth it for a couple of quid but nothing more. The praise really comes from the effort they put in to make it interesting. There really hasn't been an RTS that has tried to be this interesting since Company of Heroes, perhaps Men of War (though that's more RTT).			"

												My only complaint about this game is that it is at times challenging to the point of frustration even on the lowest difficulty setting. For this reason, I would not recommend it to those who are not already familiar with the RTS genre.That issue aside, this is a very good game that I would strongly recommend to RTS fans. It's a fairly old school experience that reminded me of the original StarCraft and the old Dune games, but while it's not especially innovative, it's not blindly clinging to the past, either, and it has enough modern ideas and mission diversity to not feel like retread of old games. It's an homage to the RTS greats of the past, but not an attempt to ape them.The story is pretty strong -- though suffering slightly due to technical limitations -- and the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard. Ambience is something RTS games tend to struggle with, but Ancient Space does a wonderful job of making you feel isolated and alone in a vast and often hostile universe.Plus it has Phlox in it.All in all, a game more than worth its minimal price tag.

												Anyone who remembers Homeworld will instantly recognize the intent behind this game. While map sizes are smaller there are often multiple areas you can jump your fleet to on each level with individual hardpoints which can be customized to suit your needs. This game offers a fun yet reasonably challenging playthrough with only a few minor flaws. Notably on the flaw side the only units you keep between missions are your Capitol Ships, and a lack of multiplayer. To balance this out between missions you can buy permanent upgrades for each vessel that helps them fill the rolls you need them for.			"

												This is my first edit to my review since i have played the game longer. THIS IS NOT HOMEWORLD, and IT IS NOT LIKE HOMEWORLD. So please don’t buy this game thinking that’s what you’re going to get. The game plays more like ORB if anyone ever played that game!Pro: Good graphics Rts gameplayok storytelling (i haven’t done much to make a fair assessment)Con:Ai is kind of cheap on higher difficulties and on lower ones just dumb almost tower defense.bugs (but it just came out so expect some) crashes.Building is only allowed on circles that give you infinite resources.There is a tech tree but is limited to only the ships you can build, no researching for upgrades.I will define how a skirmish/mission plays out for prospective RTS buyers.You start with a few like 6 ships of different types dreadnaughts XL's etc. each ship counters a different type like a fighter counters a bomber bombers counter corvettes etc. i will not insult RTS players intelligence going forward lol. so you go and find these large circles that have resource points. you can build turrets on these and gain infinite resources and defenses/repairs. there are no buildings the AI tends to just send ships at you without any regard or strategy....maybe go around that huge cluster of ships? naaa GO THROUGH IT AI FTW! you continue on like this until one of you dies the end. The campaign is not so bad but there really isnt complexity to the commanders/people you get to be in your fleet.  I will recommend this game however i just want to reiterate, this is not HOMEWORLD, the only reason i say this is because this was a big factor when i bought it due to other reviews.			"

												So far so good, The game is pretty, although lacking in certain departments (mainly multiplayer) the skirmish mode seems to be more like a gauntlet, some of the controls have been well thought through and are close to the camera controls to make the experience pleasent and not some RSI inducing click fest. Ill update as I progress... "

												This game had really good bones, gorgeous artwork, interesting units that did interesting things, it just didn't come together. It felt like a too many cooks situation. And then the waiter came in and just grabbed all the half done dishes and tried to convince you it was a proper meal.After finishing the game I was left with the same feeling I had after watching the movie Prometheus so, if you're the guy who likes to pretend that wasn't a train wreck, you'll be the guy who likes to pretend this is a great game and everyone else just doesn't get it.

												If you get it cheap it's worth a couple hours, but honestly there are just better games out there.  Gameplay is uninspired.  Pathing is terrible.  Units randomly fly off in the middle of a fight for no reason.  Crashed once randomly.  Setting makes no sense at all and indicates developers didn't really understand the 3-D environment of space.  In the end, you don't feel like this is a space game, not sure what it is.  Story feels like missions should lead in to each other as far as units (like Homeworld), but they don't (so more like every other RTS), but that feels disjointed.  My whole fleet just warped to the next area, and is now gone?  Awkward.  Again, not the worst game by any means, but it's so meh it's not really satisfying.			"

												Pretty solid RTS. Great for this amount od money. Art and music are stunning for me. Story and quests are quite interesting so far (I'm at Mission 3) and delivered in a decent way (story movies, cutscenes, briefings, in-game dialogs).Definitely it's not casual game, but i've read somewhere note from developers that there is no easy mode, and the lowest difficulty level is ""normal"" - little bit confusing, esspecialy for guys who claim Ancient Space is too hard to enjoy - they are probably playing on level hard mode :) There are some bugs though, but not that much for a PDX just-released game :P Few problems i've noticed:- problem with texture filtering on menu screen in different resolutions than 1600 x 900- ships sometimes are taking weird paths moving to target- ships randomly are passing through each other- there is no noticeable difference on cursor when you can or can't use ability on enemy- some smaller ones......but nevertheless i think Ancient Space is worth its price. I'm really enjoying it!			"

												I got this in a bundle package, and it seemed to be a pretty decent real-time strategy game. Unfortunately, the game doesn't translate the strategy aspect too well into a game. Why? Because it has a fatal flaw: THE CONTROLS ARE TERRIBLE. This is a game-breaker folks.Yes, it's a 3D environment, yes, you need 3-axis controls to work with it properly, but that's not what this game provides. Instead, it provides linear movement keys in the different directions with a counter-intuitive mouse ""rotate"" that is a camera-rotate instead of a field rotate, making the player end up having to do a lot of unnecessary motions to really get a 3D control.And... at the same time, as I found out the hard way, your playing field is still... badadum-tish... painfully 2D. So, you end up with all the pains of a clumsy 3D camera to have a single-plane game.That's not even talking about losing centering and focus all the time on the units you're supposed to control...It doesn't matter that the environments look nice or that the tutorials are good or that the missions available are varied and interesting if the game fails miserably at what it should be focusing on: providing an efficient interface for the user to make tactical decisions, preferably in real-time.The game tries to remedy this by having a tactical pause, so you can pause the action at any time to redirect ships and fleets to the desired points but... that kind of defeats the real-time part of RTS. And in the end, you end up doing this a lot: Pause the game -- fight with controls, selections and clumsy orders to send the desired ships in the correct formations to do the right thing -- unpause, watch the scene unfold a little -- pause again, rinse and repeat.That's just not fun to play.Perhaps, if the game developers get smart and adjust this setup, they can make it work -- potentially the only real way I see this game setup work is if it would be rewritten for multi-touch screen, or completely re-do the way the game is controlled and presented. The terrible mouse+keyboard interaction at least doesn't work.			"

												This is legit teh only game i have that i want a refund from. there is some good points but mostly bad.good points:-the level do look cool and obviusly had alot of work go into them-the controlls are fairly fluid-a simple system to get your head aroundBad points- the enviroment is not full 3d like homeworlds. may as wel ne 2d. the sips do try but if they collide with anoher object they glitch out alot and make them impossable to control. (took 10 mins for my capital ship to turn around).-if you zoon in close o ships they look crap. ou can see weapons fire but no weapopns. beams jsut magicly appear from areas like the bridge, or maybe a cargo hold?-playability and mechanics is awful. on the second level you ned to destroy on enermy ship flying a route. i got thema l yet the game claimed they escaped.-glitchy, expect high amounts of lagg even on a high end system with no explanation as to why. their are more but i cba rambling on more. in short is is like playing an early access game pre alpha, nota finished product. if you like playing rts combat at 5fps on a £1500 system then go ahead if not i would avoid this game at all costs.

												I bought this on sale out of curiosity. I went in on the deal under the assumption that this was similar to Homeworld 2, which is awesome by the way. Damn, was I ever wrong.This was not even worth the 66% discount, for the following reasons:1. It runs terribly (granted, my computer aint special but still)2. Horrible UI. Seriously, don't block the screen like that3. No ambient sounds. Yes, nobody can hear you in space, but that doesn't mean that there should be little to no sounds at all!4. Uninteresting story. Yup, this one really did it for me.There should be no reason to explain further. Only 20 minutes of gameplay was all it took too. Don't bother buying this under any circumstances. If you want a great space-based strategy game, look onwards from this garbage.			"

												This seems like a really good start of a game, but the controls are frustrating enough to kill any interest I have in it.  There is no way to do something as simple as tell a group of units to attack another group like there is in every other RTS I have ever played.  A common scenario is that there are 2 enemy units, and you have to target one or the other.  Now say a turret kills the unit you selected.  All your units just stop in mid flight and don't do anything.  I keep running into little issues like this that just make the game unmanageable.  There are simply too many things going on at any given point in this game for me to want to be constantly going back and checking on whether my units bothered do what I told them to do.			"

They are both in space, have space craft, things explode.  Those are about the only things they have in common.  This game is a typical RTS.  You build units, throw them at the other guy, build some defense, etc.  Controls are pretty bad in my opinion.  Not very intuitive at all.  It feels like they fight you every step of the way.  Music, which at first I liked, quickly grew old by repeating the same 8 notes over and over.  Graphics were nice.  It's got that going for it.   "

												Ancient Space is definitely not a new Homeworld, nor should it have to be. It has found its own niche, applying the excellent balance and approachable tactics of the traditional RTS, and taking it into space with a style all of its own.There are missed opportunities here, to be sure - especially the lack of multiplayer - but this remains an entertaining, if punishingly tough, diversion that I’m happy to recommend to fans of sci-fi strategy.Read my full review here: http://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/ancient_space/review/article-1337.html "

The lone drone sitting in front of me, selected the view just pans again....lost interest.  Gaming companies need to dumb down their games on the UI front or make the tutorials more friendly by explaining exactly what it is your are doing, not following back on standard WASD keys to explain it all (example, WASD makes some units in games move left/right/forward/backward but other games also use WASD to look up on flat planes and yet other games use finer controller of a seperate component to spin faster then Ancient space...which does nothing but spin point of view while facing in one direction - step forward, step back, step forward right, step forward left...and my complaint about this game was nothing changes)			"

The environment doesn't really justify the bad performance, there are some rocks, less than 30 units (enemies + your own), some vfx. Don't know how they accomplished that- Dull story and gameplay, this is like the very first command and conquer, just in space and more boring. As units get built on the battlefield most of the time you don't have to do much and can just watch the match play out. Don't expect depth in any way, this is the most basic and surface RTS game- Horrible UI, you can hardly read anything in HD resolution, font size is way too small. Overall UI looks bad- Bad controlls, ESC doesn't open the menu as usual, there's a tiny button for that. You have to scroll around with WASD + QE, which is also true for zooming. You can zoom with the mouse wheel, but only a little bit. Why is that?- Pathfinding algorithm doesn't work properly, units tumble around in space, fly around in circles and by that waste time instead of reaching the destination			"

But it's really just these small arena like areas you can't leave you can just warp to another small arena like area.  It's almost like island hoping in space.   You can't do another other then in these setup areas.  This really limits that stategic componant of the game leaving it feeling very bland for my tastes.  I would of played more but it was too boring to continue to play.  I could see some people liking this style of game as it's mostly focused on combat and not expantion and building.

												The polish is merely polygon-deep.I've seen quite a few small bugs (and they are small - save for one crash).  Several parts of this game are best described as 'annoying'.  The near silent ships (much moreso than homeworld), the level design (endless reinforcements for the enemy thus far, plus a buggy skirmish level), the incredible slowness of every ship, including fighters, the weapon discharges that appear out of nowhere, with no effects or moving turret (only applies to some of the ships), the halfhearted RTS control/command based on +1 defense rather than something real (homeworld 1 geometric formations that affected position->results, not +1 attributes).The story might be good - can't say yet.Don't buy - yet, at least.  See if the basics are fixed up first.			"

												Really, this game is only fun if you enjoy spending more than half of the time playing it in pause mode, micromanaging the different ship types. The hull-vulnerability mechanic dominates the gameplay so much athat it really is the only aspect of your ships which matters, and on skirmish (as well as most of campaign) the game is not truly 3D. That said, the campaign mode is genuinley challenging. What really spoils it for me however, is the claim that there would be a big mystery to solve and a gripping story. The story was mostly flat, and the characters were not compelling. Ultimatley, campaign mode will leave you feeling like a right clever-clogs upon every little sucess, but i doubt you will have much fun.			"

												I've been playing RTS games since C&C. The Homeworld series has, since I first played it, been one of my all time favourite RTS series. The gameplay was simple, intuitive and elegant. The ships had interesting designs and looked, for the time and even now, beautiful. The Avatar looked like a brawler. It oozed a kind of raw power. It was a moving chunk of armour that was armed to the teeth. The Qwar'Jet, it's Taiidani counter part was equally as daunting. The units were varied, several different kinds of fighters (of which the Taiidani were the more visually interesting in my opinion). The fighter furballs raging around formations of assault frigates and walls of Ion Cannon Frigates to the destroyers and cruisers duking it out in battles of attrition were spectacular. Following trails of your fighters as they jinked, dodged and spun through enemy formations, firing pot shots at what they could or covering each other. It was and still is visually stunning. Even though there were only two or three characters, Homeworld had ambience to spare. Certainly the gameplay of the second trumped the first at the cost of the ambience and much of the heart and soul. It's gameplay was superior, even if the number of usable fighters and ship classes were halved, the changing of individual fighters to squads cleaned up a lot of the flotsam of maintaining your fighter's numbers. It was, in my opinion of gameplay, superior. I was seriously disappointed that there was no Homeworld 3 and I'm hoping against hope that Gearbox don't ♥♥♥♥ each and everything up with the remake and possible sequel. Why these two paragraphs about Homeworld in a review for a completely different game? I just want people to understand where I'm coming from when I say that Ancient Space is a mess. It's gameplay is overly convoluted and needlessly complex. The camera controls are utterly awkward and I wouldn't wish them on anyone. This game would have been far better if it had simply stolen a page from Homeworld in terms of it's controls. It would have been better for it. Graphics, ship designs (which are hideous) aren't aren't worth considering in my opinion as important. It's all gameplay. This game fails miserably in it. I just can't get over how bad it is. I'm going to give this game another try later, I have a week off in a few weeks and I'll make sure to try it then where I can dedicate proper time to playing it. Till then, I would strongly recommend avoiding this.			"

												I am a huge Homeworld fan. I purchased this game because of all the people describing it like Homeworld. This game is nothing like Homeworld. It is mostly maneuvering a small number of ships around environmental obstacles.The AI in this game is pretty questionable. Say I encounter a group of enemy stations that do nothing but murder light units. What anybody would do is keep the fighters away and bring in the heavy guns. Well the fighters see a party going on and will join it and get ripped to shreds.It also takes a lot of work to get big ships through the walls that are everywhere. I have lost my carriers multiple times while trying to retreat to a repair station and having it just hump a wall to its death.The game also gives you a camera that can do a 360* view. This is completely unnecessary in this game due to the fact that you will only be looking down. This is another place that completely differed from Homeworld: The Homeworld levels were huge while the maps in this game are not only small, but the camera has to stay within a small bubble within the map as well.

												-no mp or skirmish option (only a few predefined scenarios)-choppy performance (i have good computer)-considering its open space you are extremely limited in where you can go-ships are fixed to a 2d grid that only mimics 3d space.-basically you get 3 graphics options, low med or high.+campaign is pretty good, i got bored before i completed but what i did do seemed engaging story wise.+music and audio is pretty good+unit upgrade system is decent and a welcome addition+erm... its cheap?if you are looking for a tactical space game with a decent sp campaign then id recomend you check out Nexus: the jupiter incident instead.

												I cannot say much about the content, since the game crashed too often for me to reach interesting parts of the story.At least for the mac version, the software quality is abysmal (content build id 418812, current as of 2015-01-06). The game crashes every second time a game is started. If it does not, graphics errors occur until the game crashes.Until someone does some testing and debugging, I cannot recommend buying this game.			"

												Ancient Space isn't a bad game, just not something I can recommend to casual RTS gamers as it can be VERY difficult and unforgiving, even on the ""easy"" difficulty setting.  I'd have to classify it as a small scale RTS (the population cap is low) with puzzle-like elements...meaning that you have to complete the mission objectives in a particular way based on what you're given in order to succeed.  Instead of building tons of units and constructing buildings, you'll simply be building up a small fleet and upgrading your units over the course of the campaign.  I was also disappointed with the skirmish mode as it really isn't one.  Instead of being able to choose a map, number of opponents, and etc., you're given three skirmish maps utilizing preset conditions...one is a last stand scenario, one is a 1vs1 on a small map, and another pits you against a number of skirmishes.  Those hoping for base building and free turret placement (you have preset spaces with which to build structures) will be disappointed.While this game did not appeal to me, it may appeal to others.  I recommend checking out the gameplay video below to see if its something you'd be interested in.

												The game has excellent story elements, but after playing the first couple missions the game play and tactics are forgettable. Just Rock Paper Scissors in space, if you are looking for depth skip this title or pick it up on sale. If you enjoy more casual 'RTS' and space genre, you may actually enjoy this. I should admit, I was excited about this gaming thinking it had detailed combat mechanics, customization and (my fault didn't read fully) multiplayer.			"

Posted: October 5, 2014
												Summary: Just buy Homeworld 2 for less.After 2 hours of download, got through the tutorial thinking ""OK, this is simplistic but reasonably straight forward, and the graphics are decent.""  Started the first mission, realized I wasn't having fun and didn't want to play.  Thinking about it a day later, I realize the following:1) The AI is ""Dumb"": enemy ships run straight from a spawning ""wormhole"" to destroy a freighter.  No clumping up to make it harder, no shooting at my ships which are defending the freighter, they just spawn one at a time and make a bee line to the freighter and start shooting at it.  Why?2) Because they are pirates and they want to capture...  ...um, yes, they did say the pirates would want to capture (something) on the freighters, but they are doing this by destroying the freighters?3) And they're succeeding.  Not because my ships can't kill them fast enough, (my ships are kicking the crap out of them) but because I can't tell my ships to kill them fast enough.  There's no quick key grouping of ships so I can highlight a bunch of them, assign them to group 1, and then select them later by pressing ""1"" and tell them to do something.  Noooo, I must go up to the upper left hand corner of the screen and double click on one to get all of that type, then assign them, then double click on the other type, and assign them separately.  Then when that enemy is dead, I get to do it again.  I do not like clicky games.  If I wanted to play a clicky game, I'd play a clicky game, not an RTS game.4) But if I set my ships to aggressive tactics, they should just look for the next/closest set of enemies and go after them next.  Right?  This misunderstanding led me to fail the first mission at least 3 times, because no, they don't go after the next nearest enemy, or anything else.  They just sit there, and if something comes along, they shoot at it, but they don't even follow it once it flys right past and goes out of range.5) Resource collecting is... what?  There are fixed locations in space with a little gas cloud around one and some lightning around the other that you can 'build' collectors at, which are about 1/10th the size of the associated cloud but which accumulate resources forever?Nothing makes sense!!!6) Soooo.... I've finally worked out how to get my ships to kill the pirates fast enough to keep one of the freighters alive on the 5th or 6th try at the first objective, first mission, and this has been going on for ~10 minutes, and the freighter is sooooo sloooooow that it's taking this long for it to travel less thatn 1/3rd the way across the map which my fighters can travel across in less than 15 seco... wait!7) OMG the maps are tiny!  And the ships are tiny too, so they need an icon for you to click on to select them as they fly across the screen which completely obscures the actual ships.  But your ships can fly from one side to the other in about 15 seconds, maybe 20, so you never actually see any of the 3D graphics for your ships because you're zoomed out as far as you can so that they and the enemy don't go racing off where you can't see.  So all you really see is some georgeous background (which you promptly ignore), some large floaty things that are in the way of what you want to look at (which you promptly ignore), and the 2D icons for your ships and your enemy's ships, which all look the same except one set is blue and the other set is orange.8) But that zoom and speed thing brings us to more things that don't make sense.  Each 'map' has one or more wormhole entrances which take you to another map.  But there are still resouces within 15 seconds flight time of these wormhole entrances.  Like no one is going to have flown by, said ""Hey, that'll make me some money."" and set up shop and scooped everything up?  Or how about a toll collector: ""Nope, can't go through this here wormhole unless you pay me a gazillion resource.  What, can't pay?  Have fun with that whole 'light speed' thing.""But lets get back to 6) I'm moving right along, suffering through the first objective of the first mission, playing it for the 5th or 6th time because I set the game to stupid hard, but actually 'making progress' in that the freighter is oh so slowly making its way along (insert more stuff that doesn't make sense)... and the game crashes.I took it as a sign and uninstalled the game.Yeah, I really can't comment on the story line, or the voice acting, or ship upgrades, or anything after the first objective of the first mission.  Never got that far, and don't expect to, unless I run into a play through on youtube.  At 100x speed.  Seriously, buy the old Homeworld 2, add in patch 1.1, and have a ball for <$10.00.  Add in the free Complex 9.1 mod and you've got so much PvC and PvP potential... Ancient can't hold a candle to it.			"

												After playing the training scenarios and the first campaign mission (about half an hour) I have to say I am underwhelmed.  Some might say that's too short to draw a conclusion but I have already run into enough disappointment with this game that I've lost interest in it.  I'll break it down into pros and cons:Pros:  The graphics are good and the backdrops look great.  The voice acting is pretty decent as well.  I also thought the soundtrack was strong.  The ship models look good and the moving hardpoints are a nice touch.Cons:  The ""movement"" of the ships, for some reason I cannot quite put my finger on, just does not seem right.  It definitely feels more Sins of a Solar Empire than Homeworld to me.  As a absolutely HUGE Homeworld fan (one of my favorite game series of all time) I was not impressed with this game.  Another big disappointment is the explosions.  In a game like this they should really make the explosions feel powerful and awesome and this game fails tremendously in that reguard.  Large captial ships explode extremely quickly and with a visual and auditory fidelity not up to par with Homeworld 2, a game 11 years its senior.  In Homeworld 2 when a captial ship was destroyed it was EPIC.  In this game it's forgettable.  Weapon effects are largely in the same boat... just underwhelming and almost immediately boring.  Another complaint was that I felt largely underprepared for the first mission following the training scenarios.  The first mission throws several objectives at you and immediately drops you in combat.  Overall I'd say that while I respect the intentions of the developer and almost always welcome a sci-fi/space oriented game I just cannot give this game my recommendation.  A few strong aspects are completely overwhelmed by multiple negative ones.			"

												Well to be honest worst stuff I have seen in years.Did Crash 2 times by try to start the game.After I was In, its just 3 random missions for singleplayer you can choose to play ?And some kind of really boring story.Extreme, extreme slow game speed. Without any ability to speed it up.The AI or Bots are so stupid and easy to kill of.i like RTS games, its one , but not even worth the time I did spend.You just look at ships move to target in a big group and kill of turrets and small enemy units.Well you command here around a group of 10 Ships , the fly slowly to target , there are just location they move and shoot small fighters or turrets down.No Strategy or Challenge or what ever.The Entire Battle is just select you group of ships, move them from A to B and shoot down turrets and weak fighters , repeat. To fix this game must be done a lot of stuff, really lot.1 Game Speed Controls.2 Why did they make this game so lame ? Its even slower than Homeworld.3 Generally increase the speed of the game like at least double it.4 Fix the Camera movement and icons here.5 Fix the starting of the game, 2 times to crash isn't really inviting to keep it.6 Fix description of Missions, like show the map you will be play.Well in each RTS if you selcet a map you see , how it will be lloking like and where you will start and so on, not here.7 AddReal Skirmish, not Random move and kill of Turrets, vs Bots Army.8 You can't change here resource gathering speed.9 Different Factions. Not Just random red colour enemy. And much more......This one just doesn't feel like a video. It feels more like we put stuff together and hope its alright. So Again. Its just not playable. Here is no Skirmish. 3 Mission maps you can play and Story isn't enough. Even for 1 Euro.The Game must really be redesigned by its speed.Bigger Icons for unit you buy and bigger Text so you can read it.Its extreme small Text lines over small squares of units.Make a Side bar and double the Size of these ""unit Icon"" Squares and triple the Size of the Text Description for the Units, you can't just see it.

Not to mention the combat has a nice combat triangle with smalls good against large and large good against other large, not good against small ect. But every once in a while the game randomly chrashes and not to mention on the SECOND mission i lose 100% of the time, not because of how i play,but because after I destroy cargo ships that i need to stop from reaching a warp gate, which your sopposed to, to retrieve T-Cells, after i kill them I get a message saying I let the cargo ship through?!  This happens even after 4 restarts. At this moment i would not recommend this game unless the devs patch this quickly.			"

												I really thought this game has potential, but after 2 hours of gameplay my view has changed.It has really good approaches:-Graphic is good-3d space movement-ship management-crew managementand certainly much more.BUT what kills the game for me is the way the ships move.They move like autoscooter's. It locks that way unrealistic, its kinda funny.They move arround like toys.I really hoped it is like homeworld or nexus. (slow and smooth)But it is far far from that 10 year old games.			"

												It would be ok with more reasonable controls, As it is now, I would not recommend it, unless it is on sale.Maps are 2d, but even with that limitation you cannot correctly see and control everything. In some parts camera is simply to close or too far to enjoy the game. This add unneccessary difficulty to the game and prevents enjoying the main good thing about it.Graphics are nice.			"

												Was hoping for a game like Sins of the Solar empire, got a more run and gun with 360 degree accessability. Some of the missions require careful planning and execution. The main character voice is voiced by Dwight Schultz. Nice to hear his voice after seeing so much of him in Star Trek the Next Generation.			"

												look of the game 9/10game play 6/10overall 7/10 some issus really mark this game downthis game looks great but some game play issues like rovers some times move on there own to close to the bad guys getting destroyedand they some times auto repair and some times dont this is anoying as this makes the difference between winning and notthe movement of camera could be better the scrool only adjust a bit where it should zoom all the way out and in saves moving from groups to camera all the time im sitting over 1 2 3 4 to select the units needed but to move from that having to move view is annoyingso over view looks great you will need to change some of the key config to get this working okbut some small changes from the devs could make this game much better			"

												I was drawn into trying this game on basis of the idea it was about discovery and exploration in the face of a hostile, unknown force... but all the mystery was quickly swept to one side in favor of near-immediate conflict.  My stats say only 20 minutes, but given that I fought several battles during the tutorials without LEARNING much of anything about this ""Black Sector"", I quickly lost interest.I'm okay with RTSes, but without a good story hook they just tend to bleed into one another for me.

												Enjoyable, if a bit simple in the story department. The characters are pretty one-dimensional and the tale is predictable.The environments are beautiful and you can see how much effort went into the design of the ships! The combat is relatively straightforward, but there's a lot of abilities and such.Overall the game is a bit simple, but fun. It's not Sins of a solar Empire (although I think the devs were inspired by that game) but it's an enjoyable and the space battles are pretty.			"

												Ancient Space takes a great stab at the Space RTS genre that there is few and far between these days. With a twisting gripping story along with some insane visuals you should really get this one on your radar

												Pretty fun if you like this sort of game. It's not really a 'space RTS' or Homeworld, and going into it expecting that may leave you disappointed. It's more like a cross between Nexus : The Jupiter Project and Dawn of War 2. There are unit creation and resource collection mechanics, but they aren't really the main focus of the gameplay (a la Dawn of War 2). The campaign is heavily script-driven, and almost puzzle like. Every unit has special abilities (in some cases quite a few of them) and micro is virtually required. Personally I enjoyed it a great deal. If you treat it as an RTwP RPG, except customizing through ship composition instead of levelling, you won't be too far off. Basically Dawn of War 2 with space ships instead of space marines.			"

												I had great hope for this game, but listen to the complaints of others - pathfinding for your ships is so bad it makes the game unplayable. Its space you think - how could pathfinding be that hard? The maps oddly are designed like 3-dimensional mazes - so you spend a shocking amount of time trying to force your ships to make adjustments in such a left/right/up/down fashion. I found myself fighting the interface and system more than anything else.  The sytory and atmosphere were interesting, I just couldn't get past the frustration of control.			"

												Looks like everything that could be said about the game has already been said, looks good, but that's really the only thing it has, everything else ranges from tolerable to terrible. First few levels are not bad, but as the story goes on the flaws gets a lot more visible. It's not even worth it for the story, the gameplay often contradicts it and is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at some places. Some mission are horrible to play, I certainly don't think this is an enjoyable game.			"

												Ancient Space is a something, that could be called ""2.5D close quarters space strategy"".  Maps are split into sectors linked by warp gates and sectors are again split into multiple, well, for a lack of a better word, areas. It is possible to build structures only in those areas and only at limited locations (typically 2-3 per area, less or more possible). You tend to adopt a ""attack and build strategy"", attacking the next area, building up its defences (structures also help to extend your population cap). This gives the game a relatively leasurely pace, where you usually have time to plan on you next move. Add active pause and you get the deal. This is general flow broken up by some timed missions, where rushing past an area is important. In general, building is only ever to support your fleet. Your carrier(s) are the actual center of the game.If you are into such games, you will like Ancient Space.Your ships have special abilities with a cooldown and using them at the right point (note again: active pause) against the right parts of the enemy armada is quite important. Pro:- closed quarter strategy - takes a more slow approach (minus those missions when it doesn't), but there are still pitched battles.- graphics are decent, the space backdrops and missions are nice.Cons:- The multi-sector approach takes getting used to, especially on those missions where your fleet needs to be split between sectors.- The micromanagement is limited to use of abilties. The rest is more or less melee-range fleet battle, i.e. a mess.- Would you be able to zoom in, you would miss details on the ships. But you cannot zoom in that far.- Fleet customization is limited. The fleet upgrades DO have an effect, but they don't necessarily feel immediately effective.-  The space battles feel a little lackluster.Still, I'd like to see more from this universe, possibly with more customization options, a more extensive campaign with more backstore and exploration.
