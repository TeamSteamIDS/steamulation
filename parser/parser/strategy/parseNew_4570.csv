												Dawn of War is one of the first ""real"" Warhammer 40k RTS games to ever hit PC´s.You get to follow Gabriel Angelos as he uncovers a major plot in the Tartarus campaign, this is the first game in a long series of Warhammer 40k games that was created by Relic while they where still owned by THQ, also the very first game where we got to see the Blood Ravens as they where created purely as a ""PC Game"" chapter.Story wise the game is as good as you can do with an RTS, you get a deep sense of where Gabriel Angelos comes from and what his goals are as you get deeper and deeper into the game the story changes and there are some major plot twists all the time. Graphic wise Dawn Of War is an old game and that is visible, however SEGA (now owners of Relic) keeps supporting the game and recently even released a patch to deal with some of the issues that had been around for awhile, this is despite the fact the game came out in 2004 which makes it over 10 years old now.Gameplay wise DoW is very straightforward, you build bases and kill stuff as any other RTS, however the way that Relic gave us the Warhammer universe with the Dawn of War series is amazing, you get a deep feeling for your chapter and your enemies, you get some great story and a great experience as you go through the missions one by one. Even now the multiplayer is very much alive and working very well, you get to pick between Space Marines, Orks, Elder or Chaos Space Marines which gives you a great chance for some epic battles, Relic even included the option to paint your own army and use it online. All in all a great game for old RTS fans and even more so if you are into the Warhammer 40.000 Universe.			"

This is a long review, so if you just want a summary of why I recommend Dawn of War Gold Edition then skip to the Results section and reading from there.Relic Entertainment works with Games Workshop to produce an epic real time strategy game that pushed the boundaries of the genre. Dawn of War offers economics, base building, military tactics, and unit management. Story:Dawn of War, the first installment on an incredible Warhammer 40,000 saga. The game is based on the planet Tarturus where Ork forces are out of control ravaging the planet and destroying Imperial Guard moral; but, how are they winning so easily? Of course the forces of Chaos are behind the whole war. Dawn of War is the story of Gabrial Angelos and Isador Akios and how they work together to figure out the whole reason behind the presence of Chaos on the imperial garrison at Tarturus. Campaign:The campaign offers an epic tale into the 40k lore with amazing twists and turns around every mission. Coupled with the amazing combat system, base management, and resource management this game really packs a punch. The campaign is divided into eleven missions which put you to the test fighting against the Orc Horde and the Chaos Might. As you progress through the campaign you work with the Eldar to defeat a common foe, but as the game dictates the Enemy of your Enemy is not always your friend. The game pits teams together, but at the same time continually draws them apart. Gameplay:This game was one of the first to successfully introduce rapid base expansion by requiring players to capture strategic points, which give the player a trickle of endless resources over time. The fast paced gameplay coupled with the macro and micro unit management really made this game a force to be reckoned with. Although the unit population seems rather low (20 personal – 10 vehicle) because the units are based in squads the real unit count is much higher. The battles seem more like full scale wars with you gripping to manage all your units at once. The best feature of this game (and all the Dawn of War games) is that each team is completely different. They have different units, different buildings, upgrades, tactics, resource types, hero units, and strategies. For example the Orc play completely different from the Eldar while both the Eldar and Orcs play completely different from the Space Marines and Chaos Marines. The only two similar teams are the Space Marines and Chaos marines which offer a good learners curve to Dawn of War by giving providing a basic approach to strategy: build barracks, build turrets for defense, use main base to upgrade to new “age” to receive better buildings, build power plants to get power, and upgrade units within armory, etc. Teams:There are four teams: Space Marines, Eldar, Orcs, and Chaos Marines. Each team poses different tactics/strategic elements which make you play them differently. The Orcs are based more around unit massing and rapid base expansion. While the Eldar are more about unit specialization and micro base management. The Space Marines and Chaos Marines are essentially the same team set, and fit between tactics of the Orcs and Eldar. Each of the teams units have upgradeable attributes which customize them for specific purposes: weapons, additional squad members, and squad leader units. Each team has special commander units which can be used as heroes buffing the team and supporting military units.Results:All and all Dawn of War is a must get game. If you can play older games without constantly yearning for the graphics of the modern day games then you’ll enjoy this game. The gameplay is not outdated, but rather refreshing. As it seems most strategy game developers have diverted from base building, resource management, and mass scale war to simple micromanagement tactic games. I loved this game and all the installments so much I repurchased them all on steam. Despite that I still have all the discs, in functional condition, right next to me. Pros:+Economic, Base building, and macro unit management+Fantastic story and campaign (which is very rare in a strategy game)+Amazing teams which each play completely differently.+Fast paced gameplay which requires expansion to acquire resource nodes (but those nodes do not run out like in most games)+Unit customization allows you to create squads for specific tasks+Fantastic computer AI that puts you to your witsCons:-Cannot play this game while having another monitor running (if you have two monitors the game will launch but every time you move the mouse to the edge of the screen where your monitor extends the mouse exits the game as if you are playing in Windowed mode).-Lots of unbalances (don’t worry they fix all of these in the later installments)			"

												WAAAAAAAGH!!!SPESS MARHEENS! ADVAHNCE!!!!This game... Dawn of War is a timeless RTS classic that bumps hips with legendary RTS titles like Starcraft, Age of Empires, and more. The Warhammer 40K universe is mostly about the Blood Ravens (the space marines) and their hellbent (or is that... heavenbent...) mission on purging the world of heretics, and other filth.It is simply awesome. I played this game religiously (haha... it's a pun because the... oh nevermind just play the game and you'll understand) when I was a kid and I finally decided to get it on Steam as well due to other Warhammer titles coming out (some main ones being REGICIDE and WARHAMMER 40,000: TOTAL WAR <-- real stoked about that one).The nostalgia is real.If you are an RTS fan, then you'll love this game. It's a bit clunky, but then again it's an old game. Everything about this game screams 10/10. But because it's in the Warhammer universe, I'm rating it 40,000/40,000.Get this game. Heck, grab the entire collection when it goes on a sale. Every single game has its own value and they're worth every dollar.			"

												This is one of the best (and not just best ""10/10 IGN') games of my life and also one of the most important. I love it just as I love the 40k universe. When I first played it (and I was a young kid) my brain just exploded with awesomness. The stroryline, the gameplay, the races! Everything is so great in this game! Back in those days there was nothing better than crushing the enemies of the Emperor under the boots of the mighty Space Marines!To be honest - there is no other game that is so close to me - I was growing up with it and now I'm am a great fan of this universe.Get it, play it and enjoy it. If not - burn you heretical scum!			"

												Dawn of War is a fantastic modern RTS that measures up very well against the greats in the genre like Starcraft and Age of Empires. It takes place in the Warhammer 40k universe but manages to appeal to players who aren't familiar with the tabletop or lore such as myself. Dawn of War unlike most ""older"" rts games isn't focused on building or resource gathering. You gain resources automatically through capturing ""strategic points"" around the map and stealing them from other players. This encourages exploring the map and assaulting other players very quickly early on. Building is also done very early on so the majority of what you spend your time on is creating units and attacking players.Combat in Dawn of War is done very well. Because there's very little micromanagement with resources and buildings you spend most of the game creating squads, upgrading those squads with different weapons and assaulting the enemy. Each of the 4 races are familiar but different enough so that you'll quickly pick out a favorite among them. Dawn of War's greatest asset is speed, games go by very quickly and you are always getting rewarded for the smallest of accomplishments like capturing strategic points. Which stack up greatly as the game goes on. There are also a lot of little details to the game like how Space Marine buildings are generated by being dropped from orbit. The real unfortunate aspect about this release (The original Game of the Year edition) is it's arguably the one I'd recommend the least. It only contains four of the core races (Space Marines, Eldar, Chaos Space Marines and Orks) along with a fairly lackluster Blood Ravens campaign. I still do recommend getting it since it does introduce you to the mechanics of the game very well, and those races do port over to the multiplayer of the subsequent expansions. But by itself the Game of the Year edition isn't as impressive as Winter Assault or Dark Crusade.			"

												10 Years Later, And It Keeps On Giving!Ive always been a massive fan of the Wh40K Universe, and my love for Games Workshop and all things related, started 10 years ago with this game! I remember my brother pre-ordering  it, and he introduced me into the Universe, and I spent many years watching him play DoW. A few years later, I managed to get my hands on the great title, having been handed down a little beast of a PC ( or had been at the time anyway), and it was my first chance to unleash the power of the Space Marines unto those nasty orks, and the heretic forces of chaos. It was a 3 disk installation, and about a 3 hour wait ; before the game was properly onto the PC. It was well worth it, and the expansions that came out along the years added to the mayhem, it was all part of the experience. I stopped playing DoW as I got rid of my computer, as it was well outdated, and then I suppose it got forgotten in time.Now back in present day, I became a part of the Steam community, and thought id dig around the room for some games I could add to steam. I found this little gem on my top shelf, so I thought I would give it a go and enter the cd key into steam, I was awfully excited! Put it onto my little laptop, 30 minute installation and I was away, ( so much for those 3 hours installs eh). It all came back to me when I started playing it once again, the music, the classic call of the space marines charging into battle. Me chanting “Burn The Heretic!”, while my Space Marines shoot the hell out of a squad of Chaos marines. Yes, all those requirements of a great RTS game, with hours and hours of enjoyment. You cannot go wrong with good old Dawn Of War, or rather i cannot anyway. The graphics may be quite outdated, and the multiplayer doesn’t hold much of a feature in the game nowadays,  however that certainly does not hinder any enjoyment at all.  Fan of the Wh40k Universe? Used to own the game, but not sure whether to return to serve the emperor? I recommend purchasing this game, and having a whole lot of fun playing it! I personally have a great deal of more of hours to enjoy on this game, reliving the moments of destruction and chaos. In terms of gameplay elements, Dawn Of War still does not fail to be a very fun, and a practically great game. 10 Years Later And It Sure As Hell Keeps On Giving!Overall:+ Everything a classic RTS needs+ Clever resource system+ Immersive campaign to sink many hours into+ Must buy for Warhammer 40k fans+ Still great at 10 years of age- Multiplayer servers not great- Outdated Graphics- Minor bugsSolid 9/10That goes it for my short Dawn of War Steam Review.Thanks,The-Sentinel-Gamer			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Game of the Year EditionDeveloper:  Relic EntertainmentPublisher:  SEGAGenre:  Real Time StrategyGeneral ImpressionOne of the best Sci-Fi 3D RTS to date and the classic of an established franchise which sparked a Dawn of War trilogy as of 2016. With just the right amount of base management and plenty of brutal combat, it is far better than many similar RTS games. I remember the first time playing it, more than a decade ago and I was amazed by the fact that you can have hundreds of fallen units on the battlefield and they wouldn't vanish within seconds, like they do in almost all the other real-time strategies. The graphical details have aged well and they can be enjoyed even without texture mods. If you would consider skipping this title and going directly for Dawn of War II or play the upcoming III, think again. DoW I is still a worthy RTS experience and always will be.Strong Points+ Beautiful graphics and sounds.+ Excelent setting and storyline.+ Steam Trading Cards.Weak Points- No Achievements.Rating 10/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												Watching a beloved franchise move between mediums is always difficult. Sometimes it is the awkward transition from movie to videogame. Other times it is the even more awkward transition from videogame to movie. However, every once in a while a franchise weathers the change well, some might argue better off because of the move. The Warhammer 40,000 universe, deftly crafted by the folks at Games Workshop, has attempted the move to videogames before, meeting with varying levels of success. However, it is truly Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War that has made video game players aware of the tabletop brand. Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is a real-time-strategy title that recreates the epic tabletop battles of the Warhammer 40k universe, almost perfectly, on your PC. Epic is truly the best word to describe some of these battles as Space Marines and Imperial Guard do their best to hold off the war hungry Orks, the mysterious Eldar, and destroy the twisted forces of Chaos. Dawn of War does an excellent job of staying true to the source material, both in story and gameplay. Specifically, the gameplay for DoW has shifted the focus from individual troops to squads of soldiers. Morale of these squads also plays a role in how combat plays out with ""broken"" squads becoming significantly less effective until they can regroup. Just as special characters also play a large role in the tabletop game, they make a significant impact on your Dawn of War army. Force Commanders, Librarians, Sergeants, and Apothecaries can all be attached to your Space Marine squads to imbue them with additional powers and improved combat skills. Access to these characters, as well as certain types of buildings, research topics, and vehicles is granted through a construction tree that will be instantly recognizable to anyone that has ever played a RTS game. That is one of the great things about Dawn of War, it is, at once, both familiar and new. As the heir apparent to the StarCraft legacy, Dawn of War had some large shoes to fill. Fortunately, it didn't try to replicate the StarCraft experience step for step. The shift to squad-based combat and completely redesigned resource management system have taught us all that there is no room in this world for a lone soldier or gathering crystals, gas, and trees on the battlefield. These adjustments fit the Warhammer 40k game model extremely well and keep the focus on the action, where it belongs. The 3D graphics engine behind Dawn of War's action does a great job of making the epic combat of the 40k universe a personal affair while maintaining the global view that you need to keep track of your forces. Zooming your camera all of the way into the action allows you to see every detail of what is going on in the middle of combat. The animations are tailored fabulously to the characters at hand and are extremely satisfying for those of us that have spent countless hours playing the tabletop game. There is nothing quite as satisfying as watching your Dreadnought grab an Eldar soldier, lift him into the air, and rend his body into a bloody pulp. Okay, maybe watching your Whirlwind's missile battery send Orks flying across the battlefield can match it. Whatever your preference, the combat is visceral when you get up close and personal. It is just a shame that the camera can't back out just a little bit farther as the somewhat limited field of view makes it a little bit tricky to keep an eye on a large force. Because of this, using rally points and the quick assignment keys become mandatory in managing your troops. Multiplayer is standard fare in real-time-strategy games and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War dishes up a pretty satisfying variety of maps and races with which you can wage war. Each of the game's four main races, Space Marine, Ork, Eldar, and Chaos are playable in multiplayer and while the matches can degrade to a battle of numbers, the inclusion of strategic points definitely mixes things up a bit. How does Dawn of War stack up to the original tabletop game? Some of the Warhammer 40k nuts out there might disagree with the RTS adaptation of the turn based game. They also might complain that not every vehicle or troop made the jump to the PC. These kind of objections to DoW are nitpicky and don't take into account that this is truly a great real-time-strategy game.There is no question why so many gaming enthusiasts voted Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War the top real-time-strategy game when it came out and the game is still one of the best RTS titles in existence. A few minor camera flaws are easily overshadowed by the visceral combat experience that Dawn of War offers.			"

Product received for free
												I wanted to play this recently (owned it on disc for 12 years) so, on the off chance, i emailed Sega pictures of my orginal dics plus Winter Assault and Dark Crusade. Soulstorm, actually activates on Steam with the supplied key code. To my amazement Sega emailed me keys for all 3 games for me to add to my steam library within a day. Delighted was an understatement, its not often a publisher is not just after your money.On to the game, the story is good and easy to follow. Graphics, the cut scenes have aged obviously but in game its not so noticable. Most of the missions amount to building up your forces and destroying the enemy. How you choose to do this is up to you but eventually you will settle on a few select units and just mass build these.Dawn of War is easily the best W40k series and a must buy if you are in to warhammer. 8/10			"

												Don't get me wrong when you see that i don't recommend this, as it is a very fun game to play, and i will continue to play it. But the reason why i don't recommend it is due to the false labeling of the game itself. Now, it being a game of the year eddition, one would think it comes with some, if not all, of the DLC, right? WRONG! The only benefits that it gives you are a few extra maps (that you will be unlikely to find yourself playing) and multiplayer functionality (which should have been in the game originally, so the developers really represent american financing at its finest). The point is, the game should not be listed as a ""game of the year edition"" if it does not deliver on any game of the year edition content. It is falsely labeled and advertised, causing misunderstandings that should not occur in the first place.			"

												I'm a huge RTS fan, but for whatever reason, I never picked this up until recently. I was introduced to the Warhammer 40,000 universe by way of the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine third person shooter, which I greatly enjoyed. This universe has intrigued me since then, and I have tried to catch up with the more long-term fans of the franchise by reading up on the lore and such online. It's quite different from most fantasy; where magic and medieval type weaponry is common in fantasy, Warhammer has a refreshing spin on things, relying more on machinery and gunplay while keeping the magic and awe the fantasy genre offers to players. It also falls in the area of dystopian, which is by far my favorite genre of any entertainment, and it is interesting to have a protagonist in this game whose ideals and beliefs could be viewed as fanatical by our standards, but would be understandable in such a future where he serves beneath a totalitarian empire.Moving on from the universe to the gameplay, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is an RTS that is unique in its approach to a genre that is tried and true. Whereas many RTS games focus on base building and annihilation, this game simplifies the base building and relies more on strategical points that you must capture for resource generation throughout the map. Each campaign or skirmish mission ""gets going"", so-to-speak, much more quickly than other RTS games. You spend less time buiding and more time moving your armies along the map. For those that find some in the genre to be slow moving in the beginning, Dawn of War brings a welcome change. Something else that Dawn of War does well that not enough RTS games do (sometimes at all) is reinforcements and upgrades. Where some games have you upgrade units from their respective recruitment centers and it encompasses all units of the same type, Dawn of War gives you more choice in how you want them upgraded. You can build a group of Space Marines, add reinforcements (making an initial group of four into up to eight), add sergeants later on, commanders, etc. In addition, with upgrades you can have a few men within the group upgrade their weapons, and the selection of weapons is up to you. You can have four rocket launchers, two rocket launchers, one flamethrower, and a laser pistol, or any combination between. This gives the player an ability to build up a small army for one intention (rocket launchers are great at taking out vehicles and buildings, for example), while creating another for a different intention (sending a differently equipped army to fight infantry). Even within firefights, you can reinforce your army if you possess the resources, giving the player a second chance in battle when most RTS games give none.Lastly, it should be noted that I am a single player only strategy player, so I buy games like this for the campaign and skirmishes. In saying that, this game's campaign is fantastic. While somewhat short (eleven missions and about 15 hours of gameplay; note that Steam did not track all of my game time), the story is quite good and involving, taking you across many different types of landscapes and introducing you to different races to fight against. The cutscenes are a bit stilted due to the game's age, and the voice acting (while over-dramatic at times) is fantastic. The missions are vast and varied, and the game never gets in the habit of annoying you with time limits (I hate timed missions in any game, personally). The missions were challenging without being impossible, and they were friendly to both players who like to rush and complete the missions, and players like me, who like to leisurely explore the whole map and take over all positions before deciding to fully vanquish my enemy. Skirmishes are available, offering a few dozen maps that you can choose to play on, giving you choices as to what colors your army wears to which races you fight against, along with a whole myriad of other choices to make to tweak your gameplay if you so choose. In summary, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is a fantastic RTS title that makes me very happy I purchased the Master Collection of games, because I am looking forward to experiencing more of this interesting universe. I would recommend it to any fans of RTS, as well as those looking to get into the genre, as this game is extraordinarily user friendly and has a fantastic tutorial. If you are unsure, I urge you to try the demo. I played the demo some time before buying the game and loved what it offered, so it is a fair representation of the game. I can see myself adding this to a list of games I come back to every now and then, because it offers a truly unique strategy experience that stands apart from others. I went into this game with no expectations other than what I'd read through some of the reviews, and after beating it, I consider myself a fan.			"

												""Beware the Alien, the Mutant, the Heretic""'Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War' is, simply put, one of the best Real-Time Strategy games on the market - A blood-soaked odyssey through the Warhammer 40k Universe - filled with Imperial Space Marines, Ork Hordes, Eldar and The Forces of Chaos. Campaign: Released in 2004 by Relic Entertainment, 'Dawn of War's' brutal opening cinematic sets the stage for what awaits within - a savage battlefield across the Imperial Planet of Tartarus where the local population have been suddenly beset by Ork Hordes. As Commander of the Space Marines (The Emperor's Personal Guard), you begin a quest to push back the Orks and determine why they are on the planet. A deep and engaging story-fueled campaign takes you from cities to lost ruins, from mountains lairs to the planets icy tundras, leading a tech heavy force of Space Marines, Mech Walkers, Artillery Tanks, Predator Tanks and Terminator Assault Squads, to unearth the cause of this strange heresy plaguing the planet. Gameplay | Graphics | Sound:  Gameplay is centered around a combination of basebuilding, resource management, unit management, and battlefield tactical combat. Unlike other RTS games however, you will not spend a lot of downtime collecting resources as the game is focused on capturing 'Strategic Points' on the battlefield which keep the onus always on the forward movement of your army. The action is always fast, frenetic and bloody, and always around the next bend in the road. For a game released in 2004, the graphics are a tad dated, but generally hold up extremely well during gameplay. Great sound quality, a phenomenal soundtrack and responsive M&K controls round out a well polished title.Overall, 'Dawn of War' is a title of legend - one of the finest RTS games of its generation and a must-have for any Strategy gamer. The campaign is deeply satisfying, gameplay is polished, the battles are bloody and unapologetically violent, and somehow you cannot help but be drawn into the Warhammer universe of Orks and Mutants, Heretics and Socerers, Daemons and Blood Gods. ""Forward, ..For the Emperor!"" - (Rated 9.5 /10)			"

												9 years later, I'm still playing this game with my friends more than Planetary Annihilation, Company of Heroes, or even the newer Dawn of War II.I can't give it a higher recommendation than that.Dark Crusade expansion is absolutely my favorite. Necron all the way. Genocidal Death Robots and a strategic map for infinite replayability... who could really ask for more?Check my play time, and realize, I owned this first on PC Store Bought Disk, and then bought it again on steam when those wore out.Highly Recommended. 9.8/10.

												This game is part of an iconic series, and I'd be a fool not to recommend them.  Probably the best strategy game of all time, it is definitely something you should pick up.  Grab the whole series, they are worth it.Now, beware, the first two games have resolution problems and the Steam version of this one has a couple of bugs, but don't let it fool you; the games are better down the line anyway.  Grab this game for the campaign, and for the extra units in multiplayer.  Guaranteed to be worth the cash.			"

												I remember walking through the store and finding some milk. I held it up and looked at the price tag. I remembered that I already had two cartons of milk at home, and I though to myself ""What am I buying this for?"" Then suddenly, as if possesed by a ghost, I screamed aloud ""FOR THE EMPEROR!"" That was the moment of my enlightenment. I had discovered my puropse in life. Whenever I see someoe backing into a parking space I roll down my windows and yell ""Claim it in the name of the emperor!"" I find myself painting blood ravens on yield signs and kneeling down in front of them. When a freind asked me if I wanted to go see Captain America I responded ""Faith is my shield"" My doctor said that I have a benign tumor in my brain. I slaughtered the heretic, the mutant, the alien. FOR THE GLORY OF THE IMPERIUM!			"

												WAAAAAAAGH!!!SPESS MARHEENS! ADVAHNCE!!!!This game... Dawn of War is a timeless RTS classic that bumps hips with legendary RTS titles like Starcraft, Age of Empires, and more. The Warhammer 40K universe is mostly about the Blood Ravens (the space marines) and their hellbent (or is that... heavenbent...) mission on purging the world of heretics, and other filth.It is simply awesome. I played this game religiously when I was a kid and a friend got it for me on Steam recently, due to other Warhammer titles coming out such as Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide (Yes of course I have the public beta) this game is still one of the best games I've ever played.The nostalgia is real.If you are an RTS fan, then you'll love this game. It's a bit clunky, but then again it's an old game. Everything about this game screams 10/10. But because it's in the Warhammer universe, I'm rating it 40,000/40,000.Get this game. Heck, grab the entire collection when it goes on a sale. Every single game has its own value and they're worth every dollar.			"

												An absolutely brilliant adaption of the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game to real-time strategy.  Relic hits it out of the park in nailing the look and feel of Warhammer 40K, while providing for fluid real-time gameplay - including base building.  There is suprising depth to the strategic elements of the game, and the sides are well balanced despite being very distinct.  Incredibly fun to play.  I'm still playing it 10 years later, which really says it all.   Most highly recommended.  Dark Crusade and Soulstorm add even more fun and depth to the mix.   Also, be sure to check out some of the incredible mods for the game.			"

												One of the greatest tactical RTS games of all time.  Dawn of War has aged fine, but the expansions are somewhat questionable.  Vanilla + Winter Assault seem to be the best versions of the game.  The races added in the other two add variety and fun, but there are some balance issues later on, most likely attributable to the game studio going out of business.  If you're a fan of sci-fi RTS, these games are a must-have.			"

												I have to admit, this game really surprised me. Not only is it a solid strategy game in its own right, but it's a fantastic gateway into a universe that's simulateniously a grim, miserable world of a humanity in constant fanatical fear of treachery and kind of an insane goofy sci-fi version of ""Orcs vs. Humans"" with guns and a unapologetic disregard for life. I find it kind of funny that the unit designs are what I expect the minitures to look like. Mechanically, it runs like a mutation of all the other strategy games I've played, such as StarCraft, Star Wars: Empire at War, and even Army Man RTS.Most of my problems with the game are largely technical, such as I think the camera is a little small. I only learned units could be added into your group with a Crtl-click 10 hours in. I do like that units can be part of more than one group, that's proven helpful. The only problem is that when I try to move my epic Space Marine army en masse, they can easily get in their own damn way through what I can only assume is a combination of troublesome collision programming and pathfinding AI. I don't know if this is Relic's way of encouraging me to split my forces, but that seems more like something you would do after hours of experience and not right off the bat so it just felt frustrating.While these problems are note-worthy, they do not detract from the experience in any meaningful way. I have no idea what the expansions and sequels are like, but I'm definitely interested in buying them.9/10			"

												Dawn of War, if I was held at gunpoint and had to choose one RTS out of all of them, it would be this. I love Warhammer 40,000 with a passion  and I love RTS games. With that simple mixture it has easily won my heart over. However with the up and coming Dawn of War III is Dawn of War still relevant after all these years? It's been over a decade now and many people have mixed opinions on that subject. My objective with this review is to inform consumers whether or not they are making a good purchase as well as share my own view if the game is still worth getting even after Dawn of War III's release. The Plot In the grim dark universe of 40k we start the story like any other in the Warhammer universe, massive invasion of Orks attacking an Imperial controlled world blowing stuff up and slaughtering thousands of innocents for ♥♥♥♥♥'n'giggles. Our hero and Force Commander is Gaberial Angelos, captain of the Blood Ravens. He has been sent to Tartarus to counter attack the greenskin scum and look bad♥♥♥♥♥while doing it. While on the planet Angelos, and Isador Akios (a Psyker) discover that Orks are not the only thing on Tartarus. The Eldar have set up a beach head and are trying to protect an ancient relic from being discovered by the evil forces of Chaos.And that's basically the story without spoilers. I think it is to be expected out of RTS games that the developer's attention is more on the mutliplayer than the campaign. So expecting a space opera of some sort in an RTS is the first step on the road to disappointment. But at least it gets the job done and it introduces the player to the mechanics of the game through a narative. The Multiplayer Since I am assuming you are either buying this game for the base factions, or you are getting into Warhammer 40k for the first time, I will dig into the real gutts of this game. The mutliplayer.Let's start off with the factions: Space Marines Space Marines are genetically and cybernetically enhanced super humans that were created by the holy Emperor to conquer the galaxy and maintain order when that objective was completed. This faction is highly recommended for new players simply for how durable, defensive, and fairly adaptable they are. They start out with simple bolt guns and bolt pistols but you can customize some squad's loadouts on the fly like for example; Tactical Marines with the following: Flamers, Heavy Bolters, Plasma Guns, and Rocket Launchers. Each of these serve a purpose for different enemies you may encounter on the battlefield. They also have melee units such as Assault Marines that can jump in and out of combat. Making them great for breaking enemy morale and breaking ranged unit lines. Space Marines also possess a wide range of vehicles to crush their enemies with holy fury. Overall the Space Marines are just a great faction. They look cool, they function properly, but they aren't overly powerful. The Orks Orks are chaotic, dangerous, silly, and insane all at the same time. They eat they sing they laugh and they slaughter and that's pretty much all Orks do. Make the tribe bigger and rush the enemy with a lot of numbers. Of course for balancing reasons you can't just trample the guy/gal you're fighting 2 minutes into the game. You have to build what is called ""WAAAAAAGH! banners"" let's just call them WB's for short. You have to build WB's in order to gain the WAAAAAGH! resource as well as increase the population cap. This can take a while for an inexperienced player so I recommend reading guides. I've played for hundreds of hours and even I have trouble keeping up with their tiers.But when you do get a ahead? Orks are a tough bunch and will not go down easily. Their advanced units are also pretty brutal to anything they come into contact with. Thus it is important to stay ahead of Orks as best you can or else it is game over. Now I can see people saying they are OP because of this, but their basic units can die pretty easily. They may have some decent super units, but they still need the numbers and resources to maintain themselves. The Eldar The Eldar are a dying race of (basically) space elves. They have increadibly advanced technology as well as a vast wealth of knowledge of the webway. It is because of their webway mechanic they are considered OP. They can go almost anywhere on the entire map with their webway gates as well as support themselves with their stealth and healing auras. If you are ever fighting an Eldar player or A.I opponent, expect to be going on an hour long goose chase to find where their real base is. Generally people just give up and rage quit leaving the Eldar player victorious for doing absolutely nothing but move to a new hiding spot every time the transport cooldown is over. So it basically rewards players that didn't try to preserve their army and are more than willing to hide their base rather than play the game. The only real drawback to this is that Eldar as a whole require a lot of RTS experience and mirco in order to play properly. Chaos Space Marines Chaos Space Marines or CSM for short are a horny asset flip of the Space Marines....Alright alright I'll go into more detail. CSM were loyal Space Marines that turned to Chaos during the Horus Heresy. An event that caused a civil war between Space Marines, the Emperor, and his own children. CSM are not necessarily as durable or adaptable as their loud and proud brothers. But make up for this with raw DPS, devastating armored vehicles, and teleporting Daemons they can drop in to cause more havoc. There are only two problems with the Chaos faction as a whole, one: Chaos Heretics have one of the most annoying voices I have ever heard in a videogame. And two: Other than Daemons, they don't have much that makes them stand out or make them act differently from the Space Marines. Same models (but with horns) same, animations, and half of the same weapons. I personally think Dawn of War 2 did a much better job at depicting CSM and making them stand out....Well there was this one time Alpha Legion broke the lore by summoning a Daemon of Nurlge but that's a story for another time. The Final Verdict For a 40k game, 4/5. For an RTS game? I would say 8/10 is pretty fair. It has stood the test of time proudly, and while it's game balance is questionable Dawn of War has provided something very few 40k games have managed to capture. And that is the vast combat of the universe and setting it is in. 40k games these days have either had potential but squandered it, or the developers have no idea what they are doing with an IP they barely understand. By all means leave your opinions down in the comments and if you have something to point out in the review I would be happy to hear it!			"

												Solid start to the franchise however it has a few technical issues initially (lack of widescreen support, sluggish mouse/camera controls compared to its expansions and sequels).The story is regular grimdark stuff you'd expect from Warhammer 40K. It primarily focuses on the Blood Ravens chapter of the Space Marines so if you want a campaign which allows you to play other factions, then getting Dark Crusade would be a good idea as well (Soulstorm too, though that game also has its issues).Gameplay-wise this is the solid RTS we've come to know and love over the years. You control squads rather than individual units, some squads are customizable in terms of weapons such as Tactical marines to fit the current situation or need. If you really want to test yourself, play against the insane AI on quick start either by yourself or with friends, you will experience some of the most frantic and gloriously messy RTS battles of its time.All in all this edition of the original game is solid, though Dark Crusade would be an easier recommendation for those who do not want to deal with some of these technical issues.

												The crimson armoured figure strode across rubble, burning vehicles, and corpses alike. Blood caked it's armor, wide sploches of darkened ruby which were spread all over it's once majestic- yet still formidable -armor, and made it even more terrifying in the shining light of dawn. It stood at nearly 9 feet tall, fully armored, twin massive shoulder plates on each side of it, and a helmet of grinning death, piercingly green optics burning through the haze of weapons discharge and smoke alike. it raised it's massive blocky bolter rifle with exaggerated movements belying the immense strength behind it's arms, as it slowly aims it at me. It would be the last sight I would see, as drop pods streamed from the heavens behind the giant.This was the day the Ork Tyrant of Galgaris fell, alongside the rest of his Ork WAAAGH.This was also the day I shoved my power armored boot (and PC) up said WAAAGH's collective @$$ and joined the Space Marines. 40,000/10, would run over Ork encampments in a Land Raider, screaming ""FOR THE EMPRAHHHHHH"" as loud as the vox-systems in the cabin would allow me again with the rest of my squad watching on.

												A classic real-time strategy game with excellent balance and an interesting campaign story.  Though the graphics may be well past their prime the mechanics of the game are still fun to this day.  I assume Dawn of War was truly a trendsetter in its time though this review in particular is being typed up by someone who first laid their hands on it in 2015.There are several aspects of this game that really hooked me in.  The fact that your units are -actually- units (small bands of soldiers) was a pleasant surprise.  Each unit can be reinforced, given time and requisition (currency), so it will continue to be an active part of your army as long as you replace your losses.  This prevents replacements from clogging up your new unit construction at your base and allows you to keep pressing your advantage without worrying about logistics as soldiers arrive on your frontlines instead of far behind them.  Additionally, I enjoyed being able to personally customize my own units.  If I wanted one unit of Space Marines to excel at eliminating other heavy infantry I could deck them out with a few plasma rifles while if I was going for more an anti-vehicle/building approach with that unit I could supply them with rocket launchers instead.Though I personally can't think of any complaints on the game as a whole other than stretching and pointing at the outdated graphics, I can say that I enjoyed the campaign far more than I did the random scenarios or multiplayer.  I found that I had a blast playing the game with objectives and a story but the Starcraft model of 'create a horde as fast as possbile and zerg the other base' got old quickly.  However, I am aware that there are -plenty- of players out there who would find that a great addition to the level of fun that they experience, not a detriment.I recommend this game to all RTS fans especially those who enjoy the more old-school variants.  I picked it up in a sale and got almost fifteen hours out of the Game of the Year version by itself; fifteen hours that I still believe were very well spent.			"

												Dawn of War is an RTS set in the 40k universeStory:The game starts with a company of blood ravens being sent to the planet Tartarus to help the Imperial Guard with an Ork invasion, but shortly after they arrive they find evidence that the Orks aren't the only threat to the planet, with twists around every corner that ramp up the stakes.Gameplay:When it comes to macro, the only thing that I found to be different is that you get one of your resources by capturing points, other than that, micro isn't that special. Micro on the other hand, is made unique thanks to the squad system(there may be a game that has done this before but as of this review I don't know of an game before this that did the squad system) basically when you make a unit you don't get just the one unit, you get a squad of 4(initial units in each squad does vary for each race/unit type) and can then add more to the squad, and give them special weapons. This is nice mainly because it does mean that attacks where barely anyone survives won't be as devestating since you won't have to make a new batch of units and send them accros the map, as you can just reinforce squads, also it makes selecting a large group of units easier. And the fact that you can give your squads weapons means that you can make each squad have multiple purposes. Still if you've played an RTS before then this will feel a bit familiar but the things that the game has that most rts games don't will make it seem new and not more of the same. Overall this is an amzing game that I would recommend to anyone who likes rts or Warhammer 40k(it actually made me really intrested in 40k I even got the Dark Vengeance set because of this game).Note: This is my first review that took me more than a minute to write, if there was something that I could've done better or if there's something I forget to mention feel free to let me know(I already know my intro is kinda lackluster).

												It's a Warhammer game. What's there not to love?The game can run smoothly without any major FPS hits. Plus the game helps you ""set"" up and test your settings before you play the actual game. Which is nice.The tutorial is really easy to understand. Lol, its an RTS game. If you play these sort of games before, then this should be no problem. You can customize your ""armies"" color, and insgina which is nice. Plus you can play online and/or skrimish mode as a way to help you train yourself when playing this game.This is my first Warhammer game. And I'm enjoying it so far. I won't spoil the story in the game, but Warhammer still stands as an enjoyable game to play.			"

												""WOW!"" Is what I said to this game when I played it. This game in particular, excluding the Second Dawn Of War, is addicting, fun, down right amazing! I fell in love with this game at the moment I layed eye upon its beuty! The gameplay is really well rouned, the UI is pretty steady, the gameplay gives the ""mission accomplished and I'm a BADASS"" feel. The Story is pretty interesting as you progress through it, there's no multiplayer due to GameSpy shutting down, but you can still setup a battle with the CPU, up to roughly 8 players, or 4v4 on a map. Definitely worth the payout! I give this game a 10/10. Just because it's old doesn't mean it sucks......well that's debateable, but still, GET IT !!!			"

												Dawn of War is a timeless classic. I've played this game years ago but it seems it hasn't lost any of it's sweetness.Here are some things that make Dawn of War different:Gameplay:1. Resource management is basically reduced to territory control. The more strategic points you control and the better you fortify them, the more of the 'requisition' resource you get.Investing into strategic point fortification, makes them harder to capture and after simple upgrade, they can shoot at your enemies. So you're basically building sentry turrets that mine resources for you. 2. Squad reinforcment Most units operate as squads. You get a squad of 4 marines, and you can add to it (reinforce) untill you got 8 marines. With upgrades you can add a sergeant who has a skill to rally them and instantly restore Morale. If few of your marines die, you can just reinforce the squad, and they will appear at the squad position at the fraction of a cost of a new squad. This allows you to push forward after a battle with little delay without moving new forces from base to the frontlines. 3. Squad equipment You can equip your squads with weapons effective against certain types of units, you can mix them up in one squad, or just have a dedicated squad for every type. This provides interesting choices and allows for more variety in your tactics.4. Cover Having your units sit in a bomb crater, behind a wall or in the trees, makes them harder to hit and they also feel better (see Morale)5. Morale Certain situations make units lose their composure and lower their effectiveness. Especially when they fight outnumbered, or against intimidating opponents or weapons (flamethrowers, snipers).6. Space considerations with 'macro'You need to think about the space your forces are going to operate in. You wont fit 3 tanks and 4 squads of infantry into a narrow street, without totally compromising their ability to efficiently move and operate. They will get stuck, bump into each other and wont be able to all get to the front to shoot the enemy you encounter. Some people say it's a downside and speak about ""bugged pathing"". Pathing is ok, it's just that Space Marines have ""Space"" in there for a reason :>If you fail to chose the path wide enough for your forces to move through comfortably, you're going to have to accept the fact they take much longer to get into position, and if they get attacked while the squad is not in tight formation, some of them will be in range to the enemy while others might not be. Settting:It's Warhammer 40k. In the Dark Grim Future there is only War. Space Marines aka ""Adeptus Astartes"" operate in chapters similar to battle-orders of old and live to fulfill the will of the God Emperor. They routinely drop from orbit in droppods, aWhole WH40k universe is full of awesomeness and I guarantee you wont regret getting into it. High production value:Dawn of War has some of the best voice acting in videogaming of last decade. Most buildings you build are dropped by your battle barge Litany of Fury from high orbit with a very loud ""thump"" when they impact (it's hard to call it landing). Animations of a dreadnaught cherry picking an orc from enemy squad, breaking his back while setting him on fire and then tossing him in an arc over 2 tanks and a squad of infantry are priceless. Blood is everywhere and in general you can set perment scaring and bodies, so your progress through the map can be marked with bodies of your enemies. TL;DR:Dawn of War is a game like no other, except it's successors in the Dawn of War series: Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, SoulstormTotally recommend to any and all fans of RTS games and/or WH40k universe.If you think you could like this game, but would like something with a bit more replayability (Dawn of War only has Space Marine campaign and skirmish/multiplayer) take a look at Dark Crusade and Soulstorm, which are a source of endless entertainment with their conqeur-the-planet style of gameplay and 7 different races to choose from.  Also be advised, that it's an old game and it has problems with wide-screen resolutions which might or might not be fixed.Myself I just played it in a 1280x1024 window. The same problem exists in Winter Assault, but Dark Crusade and Soulstorms are ok with any resolution in fullscreen.			"

The game mechanics are pretty cool as well, as the ai, and unit squad ai is awesome. the squads split apart and fire at enemies while moving, the moral system is also good. i personally think the infantry is cooler, but i love me a dreadnaught.Cool factions, awesome gamplay, best qoutes.10/10 would use faith as a shield again.

Found one so far and I loved itI recommed this game. 9.5/10 would slaughter Orks again!			"

												I'll finally be reviewing this game and I'll do it now.This game is a gem, the game itself is great, it has a lot of content if you compare it to modern video games.The same could be said for its expansions, great expansions with lot of new content, something that you do not see anymore nowadays.If you want the true experience then you should get this game and Dawn of War II.That's it that's all, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is also worth buying but not as much as those two games, I don't know about Endtime - Vermintide and of course I don't know about Total War: Warhammer but all I can say is this: If you want the true experience then play this one, forget about every other Workshop games (Warhammer's universe), this game, its sequel and Space Marine are the only ones to get it right at the moment.The factions are awesome, the music is simply epic, the campaign is great, the skirmishes is one great addition to the game, everything, or almost, about this game is awesome.You should buy right away it even if it is not on sale, It is totally worth it, especially if you love strategy games in a dark Sci-fi World.9.5/10			"

												This is the game that introduced me to Warhammer 40k. I love the game and the franchise as well as the universe of Warhammer 40k. The campaign is really enjoyabled to play. Although eventually I find it that it's a bit boring fighting Orcs over and over and over again. But then fortunatly we change to fight the Eldar and after shortly we fight the Chaos Space Marines.The game is about the Blood Ravens protecting an Imperium world from an Orc Invastion. Later the story folds out that other forces are at work on this planet and that their is an aftefact that if controlled by the wrong hands, it'll realse a Deamon Prince. The game is total worth playing and you should play this first before you play the other Dawn of war games: Since this is the one that started it and contains important information about the chapter which will make it easier for you to understand on what is going on later in the franchise.I'd give this a rating 9/10 since it's one of the best RTS games and it was realsed in 2004. However the only thing I think this game should of had was an map creator. As this would suit the game perfectly and an RTS game called Age of Myhtology done it back in 2001. But overall, this game is defenitly worth buying.			"

												One of my favourite strategy games, and I am not a big strategy player at all. This game was the dawn of the Dawn of War series, and an outstanding game in its own right.In the single player campaign, you play as the Space Marines. Through various maps and settings, the story builds towards a handful of epic confrontations, and the difficulty progresses in like manner. Playing on normal is a little too easy, but push the difficulty up and you will find yourself challenged (disclaimer: I'm not very good at RTS games).Venture into multiplayer, and you will have four races at your disposal, each with their pros and cons: Chaos Marines, Elder, Orks and Space Marines. I found the multiplayer portion of the game to be well-balanced, with end game units strong but not so readily accessible to make one race overpowered.Lastly, if you're playing on any system built in the last seven-eight years, I HIGHLY recommend following the below guide to get widescreen resolutions working (all credit goes to OP):

												""In the grim darkness of the 41st millennium, there is only War"" And thus was born, the most brutal tabletop game ever created. Loved by Painters, and board game addicts alike, the game finally jumped the boarder from tabletop to strategy game in 2004. Amoungst the StarCraft's of the industry, where E-sports are the primary focus sits this game. Absolutely terrific, fast paced, strategic force deployment where you're bound to see a 'Bloodthirster' tear of the head of the nearest spacemarine given the chance  This still remains my favourite RTS game all of time. Not to mention the terrific story which inspired multiple books and plot strings which carried over into it's latest sequel 'Dawn Of War II. If you any kind of fan of strategy games, you will no doubt, love this. A true gem in a sea of mediocre Warhammer games. (Firewarrior any?) If you can find this on sale, dont hesitate to snap this up. And as the Orks would say; ""WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!""**************************************************************I would like to note that I've played this for years, just not on the steam version.

I enjoyed the story till he end.What i didnt like that much was the gameplay. It's kinda okay but nothng outstanding. Guess there is a reason why they totally revamped it for the second game. Besides that there were games that used the capture the strategic points mechanic better (like z2)Anyhow all in all i would still recommend this game for the story/lore and atmosphere.Would recommend on sale.

												Good things--Good graphics well painted/animations and sync kill.-Fun game to play for casual or a competitive player.-Online multiplayer functionality.-Strategic depth.-Good Ballance.-Good team and 1v1 game.-Lots of differnt ways to play could sink many hours into this game.-Dawn of war original opening cinematic was great also.-Hero units not overdone but play there roleBad things--Broken replay ability(Sometimes sync error and unable to watch replays(my best replays needed to be deleted)-Ladder/automatch unfuctionable kills competive side of the game.-Stats broken.-campaign too easy.-In skirmish and multiplayer not all unit are utilized to 100% effect could do with some patching.-Blackscreen,crashes,Other applications(broken after saveing replays)-Unable to host/join games nobody can see games on occasions.-Bugs warpspider exarch bug,load and unload with all transport vehicles, sometimes units dont cap stratigic ponts and relic points and are left idle on the point.-Sometimes no que events.-Building thermo gen(each race equivelent does not give full resources.)-When you rally a Brightlances or shurkien platform on attack mode it issues a move command and engages in melee.-In team games  a squad when can sometimes decap a stratic point own by you team mate when shirft commanding.-Entangle sometimes does not work and the enemy troops can still engage in melee.-Eldar abuse overpowered can kill low skill player.Final impressions i liked the game otherwise i would have not played it so much.It did have problem but were fixable.The core game was good and it did cost alot to make,So it was worth playing because of its depth.The only drawback was i did not completely understand the game and got a computer virus from playing but my experience in multiplayer was positive so it was worth playing.Once THQ went bankrupt we lost most of the playerbase so it lost a lot of its appeal.-9/10 multiplayer was fun.-7/10 single player need some tweaking still was a good story.

												There are two ways in which a real time strategy game can easily screw up.The first is to have far too much micro-management.The second is to feel limited in scale, ability or grandure.Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War expertly sidesteps both issues and delivers a fun, engaging campaign to save a planet from Ork invasion.Of course more is going on, and you will soon meet all of the other factions as well.What works so well in this game compared to most other strategy games is the fact that infantry units are comprised of squads of up to 10 individual soldiers. These can be tuned with new gear and restocked when they fall.It allows for an easy way to still have an impressive army steam-roll an enemy encampment without having to micro-manage everything.I had fun, and will definitely pick up the sequel (EDIT: Then I did, it's great too. Review here)Avoid this game if you can't stomach the dead-pan Space Marine seriousness though, it can get a bit much (and it's the only faction that has a campaign).			"

												If you are a warhammer 40k fan you should get this gameIf you like real time strategy, or strategy in general, you should get this game because there is a lot to love about itBut what will you like?-Base building-real time strategy combat-The choice of playing as the Classic Space Marines, the Heresy of Chaos, The mystic Eldar, and The Whopping Orks-the skirmish matches are amazing and the multiplayer is fun too-you can have paint jobs for your troops; for example you can have the space marines with the ultramarines paint job, blood Angels, space wolves, and more or you can make your own unique paint jobs-there are different difficulty levels that you can choose fromNow what will you not like?-short campaign-only Space Marines get a campaign-if you have read the books there is one aspect of the campaign story that has been a bit done to death but I will keep this review spoiler freeBottom line:I really love this game and will get the rest of the series. I have spent 100+ hours playing this game and have never regretted buying it.My final verdict is that this is a great game and you can rest assured that your money is well spentI give this game a 10/10 with a title of Divine			"

												This is one of the most perfectly crafted games ever created in the industry's history. The amount of hours I have played this game on steam do not fully represent just how much I have played and loved this game in the past.Dawn of War - and its following sequels - are Real Time Strategy done right. Almost perfectly right.It has depth, whilst not being overly complex; It stays passionately true to the lore where it can, whilst compromising on unit abilities/roles in clever ways;It is functional, practical and is shipped with a wealth of features;It has a rich story based campaign, reasonably accurate to lore, with entirely new plotlines being introduced in the later sequels;Each race/unit is beautifully rendered in their [almost!] full glory and scale, with a graphical engine that still holds up even today;It supports local and [formerly] online multiplayer, usually with relative ease;$12.49 is a bargain for this calibre of game on Steam, not to mention that you get Imperial Guard bundled.Even though you may be as excited as I am for the release of DOW3, if you haven't given this a shot yet you definately should. There is a lot of fun to be had with these titles, especially with a good LAN session.9.8/10			"

												DOW is an RTS with a bit of a deviation from the standard resource/base model seen in the likes of Starcraft or C&C. Instead, you obtain resources based on captured points and relics found around the map. Doing so prevents the ""turtle in/mass army"" tactic, as you are forced to expand outwards in order to gather. Gameplay wise, the game is very clearly a Relic game; and anyone who has played Company of Heroes will pick it up right away. Rather than build one unit at a time, you build squads of units. These squads can be upgraded with special weapons, or even link up with hero type units to greatly boost their ability. While members of the squad can die, you can reenforce them on the fly, making a squad feel more valuable than the sum of it's parts. Give it a try!			"

												Totally new to Warhammer and this game is awesome! Not some easy walk in the park but its a blast. You can build giant mech warriors that grind orks to pieces and blow the cr** out of anything that gets in their way. You have to be quick at building stuff and quick to get your defenses up against whatever is being thrown at you but once you get it, you can march right up the enemy's rear and blast them to pieces.The way the soldiers run is hilarious and the ""epic"" sounding quotes are awesome. ""Heresy grows from idleness"" is stuck in my head haha.Awesome game play, big explosions, and enough to make this game really fun for a game that is a decade old. Paid $5 for it on sale - well worth the money.			"

Allows for a lot of different tactics to be used due to the variety of units.  Also some crazy mods out there that make it even better and rebalance, even adding titans in some mods (warhound and reaver).  Have came back to this game multiple times to play through as well as playing skirmishs.  Highly recommended.			"

												This game is one of the finest RTS games ever to grace the genre. The game truly holds well even to this day, well over a decade afters its initial release. The game offers an interested and very fun singleplayer campaign where you play as the  Blood Ravens Space Marine chapter as they fight against a massive Ork force on an imperial planet. It's up to you to use your brain and tactical sense to destroy the Ork menace. But as time goes on the forces of Chaos arrive as well as the elusive Eldar and the stakes only begin to rise. The gameplay is solid. From the army commands as well as base building and management. Unlike other, older, RTS games the way you gain recources is by capturing and holding points that are around the battlemap making those areas complete hotspots for some epic large battles. You get to command large armies and pit them against other large armies, unique units and buildings per factions (four factions are available in the game), an army painter (very basic, but still fun to use custom armies in skirmish), and overall the game has a lot to offer. There are some downsides sadly, but these are more in the technical side rather than the game itself, the game does not support 16:9 resolutions, but with some mods you are able to force a 16:9 resolution in the game, but the mini map tends to bug out. The unit path finding can be a bit wonky at times as well and artillery units can be a real pain if you don't know how to properly use them, but overall nothing too serious, just minor inconveniences. This is a great game for both RTS fans and Warhammer 40k fans or if you're a fan of both, you're doing yourself an unjustice by not owning and playing this great game.			"

												Wish I had gotten into this series back when it first came out but I benefit via lower prices :P. Game is like a COH older brother where you can see where they got many of the ideas for the squad based hold point means of strategy. If you want just the campaign get DoW Platinum. Dawn of War Platinum has the expansion packs with the campaign in them. If you want for the skrimish/mp you might want to also get Soulstorm since it adds quite a bit for that purpose. Its a fun game worth getting Platinum for if you want just the story. Game feels like it could of been something on the scale of Supreme Commander Easily with large caps of units. There is a robust modding community for this old game.They still make mods even today.			"

												Brand new player to the series (beyond Warhammer Online).  With 3 new big titles (The MMO, The Space One, and the Total War One), I figured I should go back through for story and such.No spoilers, but I'm several missions in; and enough to be caught up in the plot.  The game is a bit aged in the graphics, but the story and action immerses you enough that you won't notice.Unit controls and micro functions are lacking, but this is back in the day of 20 or 40 unit population limit, and 8 squads to a keybind.  So.... they don't matter as much (because it's not thousands of units).On the graphics front, turn on all those super fancy things your card does to the max!If you bought that big pack, or bundle, this is the game I've been told to start with.  Then just wiki the DLC/Expansion packs and play in order until 2!			"

												Dawn of War is one of the greatest single-player RPG's I have ever played. The WH40K franchise stories might sound incredibly cheesy on paper but you get control of your own company of Space Marines it just comes to life in a way few other franchises does. It makes you care about winning, it makes you care about the Empire.The gameplay is solid but nothing impressive. It maintains the standard resource based RTS gameplay but just replaces gold mines with strategic points. The units work great though, the sounds and looks of Space Marines and Ork's alike make them come alive and brings a great level of immersion.What takes Dawn of War from being just another solid RTS game to being a great RTS is not something that can be easily explained.It is the satisfaction you get from hearing the thump of a Thunderhammer impacting an Ork's skull. It is the sound of a heavy bolter opening fire from concealment. It is the Space Marine captain screaming ""CHARGE"" and rushing into certain death...			"

I really didn't care much for other RTS like Age of Empires, which were big at the time.When I got Dawn of War however, it grabbed my attention instantly. It didn't have the humours nature of RA, or the actors during the Cutscenes, however it was dark and the voice acting is full of charisma.The Warhammer 40k universe is a dark one, full of twisted religious notions, which was something new, at least for me.Having had the chance to get Dawn of War on Steam recently, I jumped on the oportunity and I must say that even though the graphics and the interface are dated, the game is as enjoyable to play as ever.The adventures of the Blood Ravens carry on, and I'm delighted to join them once again.I bloody love this game :D			"

This game uses a squad based unit selection so 1-10 units move and fight with each other as an overall unit and take damage independently so as long as one member of the squad survives they can recover over time.

												A must have strategy game for RTS fans. I absolutely love this game next to Company of Heroes. The Warhammer 40k universe is awesome ans has gotten me to check out the books which the entire series is originally based on the tabletop war game. The makers of this game is Relic, whom is really good at making the best RTS (ex. CoH).GET this game, not many people are playng online but the campaign is fun as well as skirmish with bots. There's also 3 expansions you can get that will introduce more factions and storyline and probably more people playing.			"

												Dawn of war is your typical RTS style game in that its involves base building, unit building, and upgrades. What set it apart from everything in the market is the universe it is set in. 40K is extremely dark and beautiful at the same time, it is set in the 41st millennium of man where we have set foot all over our known galaxy. We find Aliens of the typical fantasy worlds, elves, orcs, demons but they are all their own empires stretching across the stars. With other factions thrown in, such as Chaos, the galaxy is one huge warzone. Game play is paced for small squads play to epic armies going all in and tho the unit counts may be lower than that of AoE or StarCraft a few squads of well armed marines can take a whole base in a matter of minutes. It is a great start to what turns into a 4 piece series that add more factions of the universe and a great intro to not only the digital games but the table top as well. On that note the table top may not be paced at its digital counter part but the units mirror each other to great detail. Fans of the table top will fall in love with this game in no time. Campaign is a good story line and shows just hopeless this era in the future can be and how the Space Marines will do everything it takes to win and bring glory to Empire.			"

												*One of my default favorite games*Placed in the 40k universe of warhammer, Soulstorm is (From that I know of), the last expansion [Note: expansion] pack to my favorite series of RTS. Building small bases and with a unit population size of 20, the battle may feel small, but depending on the unit, the battle can get pretty intense. The game focuses more in unit traits and abilities then in numbers (Although orks are a quantity race).The standalone version contains: Space Marines, Orks, Eldar, Chaos MarinesTo extend on a great game, there are:Dawn of War: Warhammer 40k Dark Crusade (Contains Necrons & Tau)Dawn of War: Warhammer 40k Winter Assault (Imperial Guard)Dawn of War: Warhammer 40k Soulstorm (Dark Eldar & Sisters of Battle)All of which I highly recommend together (Once you have Soulstorm, you should have every race in the series except Tyannids (They are in DaW:40k II (Which I do not recommend).Overall the game is among my top 3 of all-time series and game series. There seems to be a race for everyone's play style (Necrons would be my favorite).My only complaint, I wish they made a platinum pack the contains all races in one, + tyannidsOther than that, enjoy the 40k universe.

												This is probably the best game in the franchise, the original pure unadaulterated goodness that is Dawn of War. Dawn of war introduced me to gamesworkshop and the table top game that this game is based on and is overall responsible for some really good moments in my life.without a doubt id say this game has the best campaign of any in the series even amongst the newer DOW 2 games.The bread and butter is the MP game but sadly no one seems to play this one anymore online because its lacking so many races to play with and has the fewest maps, you can only be orks, eldar, marines and chaos.

												I played this game, as well as all of its expansions, back when they were launched. I'm a Red Alert kind of guy, having played Red Alert 1 on the PS1, and Red Alert 2 on the PC. I really didn't care much for other RTS like Age of Empires, which were big at the time.When I got Dawn of War however, it grabbed my attention instantly. It didn't have the humours nature of RA, or the actors during the Cutscenes, however it was dark and the voice acting is full of charisma.The Warhammer 40k universe is a dark one, full of twisted religious notions, which was something new, at least for me.Having had the chance to get Dawn of War on Steam recently, I jumped on the oportunity and I must say that even though the graphics and the interface are dated, the game is as enjoyable to play as ever.The adventures of the Blood Ravens carry on, and I'm delighted to join them once again.I bloody love this game :D			"

Sometimes units just stand around not following orders.-Dated graphical elements that break or don't work at higher resolutions, such as an invisible mouse or out of frame minimap.-Doesn't support modern resolutions.-Game apparently doesn't work on Windows 10.

												I enjoyed this game greatly.  The story was pretty cool.  The missions didn't offer too much variety but I still found myself enjoying each.  My only issue, gameplay wise, is the pathing issues.  I'd direct my forces to one location and they'd split into multiple directions, especially when vehicles were involved.  You really just have to get used to directing your squads one by one at times.  For those that like to play full screen, you'll need to know that the game doesn't support 16:9I've played a little bit of the multiplayer and it's fantastic if you have a friend to play with.  Not too many people playing online anymore (get Soulstorm if you really want to play multiplyer with others)			"

												First of all, I'd recommend the Master Collection as a whole. The games are all worth playing through, and you have to own them all to use every race for online multiplayer in Dark Crusade/Soulstorm, if that matters to you.But let's say you're hesitant and want to buy them one at a time. That's cool too, and I'd certainly recommend starting here even if you buy the Master Collection. The Space Marine campaign this game offers is a great introduction to the series, and will serve you much better than throwing yourself into one of the more organic campaigns of Dark Crusade or Soulstorm.The gameplay is rather hard to describe, but the essential is that you build up your base, proceeding through tech-levels to unlock/produce more powerful units/vehicles, all while fighting for control of the resource points (the resources are needed for units/vehicles/buildings/upgrades) on the map and trying to destroy the enemy's base/not get yours destroyed. The victory conditions can vary, from destroying the enemy's headquarters, needing to eradicate them completely, or fighting for control of the difficult to defend ""Critical locations"" and holding a majority for a set amount of time (or completely eradication the enemy to end it faster).The base Dawn of War offers four races to skirmish with. The Space Marines, who are the only playable faction in the campaign, the Eldar, the Orks, and Chaos. One of the images in the slideshow shows the Sisters of Battle assaulting a Dark Eldar base, but that's from Soulstorm and shouldn't be there. Every faction plays differently, with the only overlap being some very similar units between Chaos and the Space Marines, but they have different stats/upgrades and have their own faction art. You're also able to customize the factions with the Army Painter, or use one of the several presets corresponding to different factions within the Warhammer universe.The campaign is, in my opinion, the best one in the original set. You only plays one faction, accomplishing static goals, and so it's only good for one runthrough, but that allows it to be the most polished of the bunch. It eases you into the game, introducing concepts slowly enough for you to grasp it all, but you will fail if you don't use everything it teaches you.]So, if you're looking at the series for the first time, or have already decided to buy the set, I'd recommend this one first. It's the best introduction to Dawn of War there is, unless you've found you prefer the incredibly different style of Dawn of War II.			"

												Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War served as my entry point into the Warhammer 40,000 universe, and it did a very solid job at it. It features a refreshingly unique and interesting take on the RTS genre and has a story-driven campaign that stayed true to the lore.At first, I did not understand why the Imperium of Man has such deep hatred towards anything but human, namely those mutants, xenos and heretics. In the game, the Space Marines under your command are always yelling slogans like “Burn the heretic! Kill the mutant! Purge the unclean!”, seems pretty extreme, no? Then as I progressed through the game and inevitably started reading more tales from the Warhammer 40,000 lore, it is realized how these mutants, xenos and heretics treated human like absolute trash and won’t hesitate to annihilate Mankind at all.Hence justifying all the “Burn the heretic! Kill the mutant! Purge the unclean!""But then again the Emperor of Mankind actually wanted to create a secular society of science and peace, but we ended up having an Imperium of Man that is religiously fanatic and fanatically worship the Emperor as God.But this religiously fanatical Imperium of Man is also the only thing that protects and allows Mankind to survive the never-ending deadly threats it faces from mutants, xenos and heretics in the grim darkness of the far future.So what choice does the Imperium of Man has?“Cleanse, purge, kill! All in the name of the Emperor! It is better to die for the Emperor than to live for yourself!”So get this game and start purging in the name of the Emperor!All in all, this game is quite old but it is still a good game to pass time and get to know more about the Warhammer 40,000 universe.40,000/10 would purge in the name of the Emperor again and again			"

												A great, classic RTS game and part of the greater Dawn Of War series which is also a treat for RTS and Warhammer 40,000 fans. You can play through multiple storylines as different races that are part of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, and go in depth with the stories as the campaigns progress. The game did a good job of not only mastering the RTS aspect, but also of capturing the essence of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Capturing key points is a key part of battlefield gameplay in this RTS, and it should be enjoyable for anybody that likes RTS games in general.Once you are done with the campaigns, you can also play in Skirmish mode, or play Online against other players. This game should give you many hours of quality gameplay and I would recommend it to anybody that is interested in the Warhammer 40,000 universe - as well as for new players that want to start getting into it as well.

    This is my lasgun. There are many like it, but this one is mine.    My lasgun is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.    My lasgun, without me, is useless. Without my lasgun, I am useless. I must fire my lasgun true. I must shoot straighter than the heretic who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will in the name of the God Emperor of Mankind...    My lasgun and I know that what counts in war is not the shots we fire, the noise of our screams, nor the corpse barricades we make. We know that it is the Immortal God Emperor of Mankind.    Before The Emperor, I swear this creed. My lasgun and I are the defenders of the Imperium of Man. We are the paving stones for the Adeptus Astartes. We are the joke of our enemy. We are the expendables of The Imperium.    So be it, until victory is The Emperor's and there is no enemy, but peace!

												Relic once again proves that they're masters of RTS development with Dawn of War. While it has some balancing issues here and there, it's an excellent example of a game that sticks to well-established conventions (general playstyle) yet injects its own, Relic flavoring. On top of that, it captures the Warhammer 40,000 universe's lore phenomenally. You can tell a lot of effort went into making this game challenging and fun to play. Definitely worth grabbing, especially if you're a Warhammer 40,000 fan!			"

Money (Requisition points) are gathered from Capturing and HOLDing (the harder part of the job :P) points throughout the map.Well put storyline including Space Marines, Imperial guard, Chaos and OrckZ with perfect dubbing and quite well made Dialogs. I so liked the game. No bugs nor problems found so far.. Only pathfinding with many groups on small terrains could be itchy sometimes.___Herecy grows from Idleness.			"

												It includes all them Dawns of Wars! And it acts as the base game when you do. So I'll review that here: Dawn of War was, at the time of its release, the best treatment the Warhammer 40K liscense had ever gotten. It's still way up there, right next to its sequel. It positively -screams- the need for more games in the setting. Sadly, things went ploin-shaped for THQ, so we'll have to wait a while for that to settle out and get studios working on more proper Warhammer games. Until then, you have this to fall back on, and it will catch you, with its innovative (no, really, they are) squad mechanics, lengthy campaign, and wonderful skirmish modes. Some of the sequels and expansions are better, though, so, 4/5			"

												TL;DR:A fantastic game that still holds up surprisingly well for its age, Dawn of War is a solid strategy game that does double-time. It serves as a solid introductory porthole into a universe filled with history and lore that spans dozens of rule books, character sheets, and novels. It also provides hours of entertainment as a founder of new types of real-time strategy gameplay that breaks away from the Blizzard norm. If you have exhausted your strategy game library and have never tried Dawn of War, I highly recommend it.For the full review, go here: http://dagondogs.com/2016/01/06/dawn-of-war-late-bird-review/ "

												Just like the other 885,363 PC gamers out there, a few weeks ago I picked up a copy of the Humble THQ Bundle. Not only was it a great deal for some games, it was also a way to help a company in need.  Now everyone can argue the ‘Hows’ and ‘Whys’ of THQ’s current situation, but at the end of the day gamers aren’t overly interested in their products.  And its hurting them more than it has in years.  But this isn’t an financial overview of the current fiscal situation of THQ.This is a Bargain Bin Breakdown, and the game is Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War.  And you may have figured out prior to the break that I’ve never played anything Warhammer 40,000 before.  So its another unbiased review that falls completely on the games merit!  I love it when that happens.  However, with schedules tightening and life being life, I’m not always able to play an entire game.  Its actually a difficult choice on what to play when and for how long.  And having nine new games added to my Steam games list only makes it more of a challenge.  Do you realize I’ve had L.A. Noire for months and have yet to play it?!But I’m rambling again…My plan with Dawn of War was to play at least 3 missions of the main campaign then a skirmish as the enemy faction.  This, in theory, would give me enough to rate the games mechanics, story, and balance.  After which point I could continue to play, if the game had captured my interest, or begin writing my review.  Everything started well.  I played the tutorial so I could see which type of RTS this was.  Then I started the first mission.I was impressed at how well they tell the story with the opening sequences.  Even if I wasn’t really following what was going on with the story, the way in which it was given was very well done.  Unfortunately, to me its just another Orc vs Human story that I can’t find interest in.And unfortunately I've never had any interest into the types of worlds where Orcs are present.  I am a fan of Science Fiction, but Fantasy hasn't ever done it for me.  Orcs, Elves, Humans, Middle Earth, whatever or where ever it is, hasn't been my thing.  I've played the WarCraft games, I’ve seen the Lord of the Rings movies, I attempted to read a few different stories in the past.  But none of it really sparks much interest in me.  So the real challenge with games of this genre is to excite me in other ways.  Which has happened, but is a rare occurrence.I can’t find any of the Orcs terrifying, or anything other than plain stupid, and in this game its no different, they just look goofy.  Sure the graphics are dated, but not so bad, and I kinda enjoyed them since they reminded me of Star Wars Galaxies.  But the models themselves, and the designs that were chosen.  A part of my lack of interest in the fantasy worlds fall under technology.  The worlds always look very similar to the Middle Ages, but then there will be some sort of advanced technology that just doesn't fit.The Humans are actually fine in this regard since everything of theirs looks and matches the advance space faring race type.  However the Ocrs look like a lesser advanced race, until they bust out the battle units.  And I just can’t accept being so far advanced on one side and looking a few centuries behind on the other.But story and setting or not I can still play a game.  So I brushed aside my opinions of the story and played on, enjoying the games itself.  And the mechanics are amazing.  The first mission did a great job of holding my hand and guiding me through the process of playing.  Sure, I had learned a bit from the tutorial, but had quit that about halfway in.  It didn’t take long to finish the mission, and even take a moment to realize that I have genuinely enjoyed playing the game.Then came the second mission.  And while I did enjoy myself for most of it, my enjoyment started to ween.  There came a point in the mission where my troops, just a couple of infantry squads, felt so overpowered.  There wasn’t anything they could’t take out in a matter of seconds.  I expected it to be on the easier side this early in the game, but this was ridiculous.  The hand holding was still there, which wasn’t a big deal, just not really necessary.In between he missions are more story pieces.  And I’m not sure what to call them, since they’re not FMV or cinematic’s   They are scripted sequences that take place on the map itself.  Often before you take over control of the game and start the mission.  It was really well done, and probably my favorite thing out of this game.I did also love the dead units not disappearing from the battlefield.  There’s just something about watching your enemies slain pile up.  It really brings to light just how many souls you’ve taken in your quest for vengeance.Onto the third mission, this is where everything changed.  This is where the game got real.It starts with a pre-built base and units guarding checkpoints.  It starts with you coming under attack.  And the attacks don’t waver.  Now I will offer the chance that I was completely missing some important factoid that makes the mission easier.  But I did try it three separate times.  Each time I was unable to build up or maintain a defense force while also building an attack force.  And after awhile the tanks rolled in, and I hadn’t a chance.That’s when a friend informed me of a Mech unit that was located on the map.  So on the fourth attempt I managed to hold my ground long enough to seek out this unit.  I found it and unlocked the ability to build more of them.  And with these new units I swept through the lands slaughtering all that came in my path.  And completed the mission.But here is the problem.  While on previous missions my infantry units mowed through people and buildings like they were all made of paper, now the enemy has tanks and is mowing through me in the same fashion.  Until I get these Mech units, and it sways back into my favor.  I don’t like this.  This doesn’t feel like balance.  It feels like the scales are swaying back and forth.  One side always has an advantage over the other, its just the who that changes.So I tried a Skirmish, just to see.  A standard 8 team Free For All, where I played as the same faction that I was in the campaign.  It was pretty uneventful, I may have had it on too easy of a difficulty.  But I managed to build a base and maintain my defenses from a few attacks, and then build up my attack force.  Then I sent them out to battle, and they walked right through the enemy like paper…Now, when I play a mission I tend to have double the needed units to succeed, sometimes triple.  I love nothing more than having units in the triple digits.  Dawn of War, like most others of its RTS type, has a population limit.  Sometimes I can work with this, but I always feel like its not enough.But don’t think I’m going to trash this game because of the apparent major change in the difficulty curve from mission two to mission three.  Or because the balance feels to be in constant shift.  Because of what I did play of this game I did enjoy.  A lot of this game I thought was great and pretty ground breaking for its time.  I just can’t create any connection with the characters, units, or setting.But I have no plans to uninstalling or forgetting about Dawn of War, I will keep it there, ready for when I’m ready to come back to it.  But most of all this time spent has shown me where Company of Heroes really came from.  Which seeing as I’ve been obsessed with that game is a great way to open my eyes to its evolution.  Things that I don’t like, or don’t feel like they work in Dawn of War are not present in Company of Heroes.  While other things are expanded on and evolved into better thing			"

												The first of a stellar series of Metal Box Simulators. This one sees the hilariously ineffectual Chaos Warlord Bale ruin the good name of the Alpha Legion everywhere by being one of the most absurdly unsubtle oafs in the galaxy, as he tries to use the demonic Maledictum to transform himself into the Grandest Metal Box in the galaxy. Naturally the Imperial Refuse Cleanup Division cannot allow such a scale of littering to occur and so the stage is set for the grandest of clashes and a rip roaring adventure as the Metal Box clad Blood Ravens get into other, larger and more swiftly moving Metal Boxes in order to thwart the evil of Chaos, who do much the same only with more spikes on their Metal Boxes. The Orks just wish they knew what a box was and the Eldar are too aloof to admit that boxes are a good idea, even as the Imperium repeatedly use Metal Boxes of all shapes and sizes to smash their silly floating hovercraft. Also there's Sindri, a Chaos Sorcerer who almost makes up for Bale's stupidity, by being the most ridiculously moustache-twiddling villain you could picture, who's sole purpose in life seems to be to simply troll everyone he ever meets. In addition, Captain Angelos is one of the manliest men in gaming and Mordecai Toth and Carus Brom are pretty cool too. Even if their names are utterly absurd. Speaking of, there is an early boss called Orkamungus who calls Bale and his cronies ""smelly boyz"" and if that's not worth a five star review then I don't know what is.In short, if you like Metal Boxes, a sublimely ridiculous story and more Metal Boxes then this is a game that you will love.

												Single-player story comprises of a single campaign with around 10-12 hours play-time, less if you only play to the objectives. Good RTS fun, but nothing special. Not widescreen.			"

												one of the great strategy games of the 2000's era, its territory based resource system completely changed the game from starcraft style mining system to a more conflict driven strategy experience.  The territory system combined witht the warhammer background and the really neat close combat animations make this game a real standout in the genre.  The expansions are good too, but probably not worth the money unless you just want to unlock more races for multiplayer and skirmish.also, as an added bonus, this games  requirements are very low and it will run on most anything these days.

												I enjoyed playing this game over the free weekend. I am an FPS kind of gamer but the DoW series looked quite mesmerizing so I said ""Screw it, I'm bored and it's free!"" I am NOT disappointed with my decision to give DoW1 & DoW2 (& their mostly successful standalone sequels, a chance because I became addicted and in love with the two (which caused me to oversleep and miss the sale on the last day :P )Great series! Definitely learn from my mistakes everyone! Pick up DoW1 & DoW2 if you can afford both. If you can only choose one of the two here are some tips for choosing if you know nothing about them, - DoW1 is what you would think of a strategy game, meaning you build an HQ, barracks, generators, etc and then dominate your opponent (with the exception of some missions based on command one squad and infiltrate the enemy's territory)   -The multiplayer was hardly alive, and I was unable to join a match the first and last attempt I made. - DoW2's campaign is mostly command the Force Commander (the main character which you get to name) and 3 other squads and dominate the enemy orks, farseer, chaos, tyranid. Did I mention it is co op?   -That isn't the only great part of #2 though! It also has a co op survival game mode called ""The Final Stand"" where you and 2 others work together to survive and progress through the increasingly difficult waves of enemy A.I. You get to choose your race and also level up each individually, earning new abilities, armor, and weapons. This game mode is still partially alive with players.So do yourself a favor and buy Dawn of War (1&2 - or at the least 2)  :)Skeptical? Look up some gameplay, and reviews!

												DoW is fairly enjoyable for me. It's fairly easy to play, and squads are somewhat balanced, but end up being kind of broken depending on which race you play and qhat weapon upgrades you choose, as one can have a few of the earliest squads avalible take down the last group that you can unlock. Granted, some maps don't include relics, which means that you lose access to the end stage squads, but since they tend to be the smaller maps desined for 1v1, it may not be as much of an issue for some. Base building is farily enjoyable as you need specific buildings in order to advance further, although the small projections around the two (three if you play Eldar) make it a pain to place things without running out of space if you aren't clever with placement. Overall I think it's fun to mess around in for ~25 minutes in a game just grinding down the opponents.			"

If you get Dark Crusade it adds a new campaign with new mechanics making an already great game better. Definitley worth the purchase. I played this game when I was about 13 and revisiting it now at an older age gave me a whole new appreciation for not only this game but the entire Warhammer universe.			"

												On the bright side, it's an undying classic, which provides a strong foundation for the series. Radiating that unique halo of the Warhammer 40K franchise, it appeals to any fan tremendously, while still holding a certain entertainment value to a complete stranger, too. Concerning campaign, the plot is traditionally brutal and somewhat enigmatic, and the roleplaying aspect is rather decent for an RTS. In two words, there are Space Marines, and their famous Tartarus campaign (with Imperial Guard cameo, sort of). Concerning skirmish, the tech-trees are quite clear, and the resource management is pretty straightforward. The game is about battle tactics and strategies, and in this field it delivers fairly deep and dynamic experience. In skirmish, Orks, Eldar, and Chaos factions are all playable, too. And re-playable, and enjoyable, of course.Talking cons, the textures and video FX are so... oldschool, and the music is rather naive to my taste. Besides, the in-game tooltip fonts are so small that it's almost unreadable, and also unscalable, just like this Steam's built-in browser. But the most annoying thing in the whole game is the dumbest pathfinding ever, which makes fielding large armies quite a challenge. See, the map landscape is typically uneven here, the terrain is rough, and the ruins are everywhere (supposed to be tactical, I think). That doesn't work well with bad pathfinding, - when you issue a move order for several squads at once, you can see them crowding, loosing formations, getting stuck, holding each other, then running away or apart from each other, and begging to be shot during all the hilarious process. Now, THAT is not something to which you can accomodate, not after playing so many modern RTS with brilliant pathfinding. That's why, against modern standards (e.g. DoW II), the game is a bit too uncomfortable to play on a regular basis.Verdict: definitely a ""must have"" for the fans of Warhammer 40K universe, and well recommended for the students of classic RTS. For everybody else - it's your call, but I'd recommend starting with DoW II instead.			"

												TL;DR:A fantastic game that still holds up surprisingly well for its age, Dawn of War is a solid strategy game that does double-time. It serves as a solid introductory porthole into a universe filled with history and lore that spans dozens of rule books, character sheets, and novels. It also provides hours of entertainment as a founder of new types of real-time strategy gameplay that breaks away from the Blizzard norm. If you have exhausted your strategy game library and have never tried Dawn of War, I highly recommend it.For the full review, go here: http://dagondogs.com/2016/01/06/dawn-of-war-late-bird-review/ "

												Just like the other 885,363 PC gamers out there, a few weeks ago I picked up a copy of the Humble THQ Bundle. Not only was it a great deal for some games, it was also a way to help a company in need.  Now everyone can argue the ‘Hows’ and ‘Whys’ of THQ’s current situation, but at the end of the day gamers aren’t overly interested in their products.  And its hurting them more than it has in years.  But this isn’t an financial overview of the current fiscal situation of THQ.This is a Bargain Bin Breakdown, and the game is Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War.  And you may have figured out prior to the break that I’ve never played anything Warhammer 40,000 before.  So its another unbiased review that falls completely on the games merit!  I love it when that happens.  However, with schedules tightening and life being life, I’m not always able to play an entire game.  Its actually a difficult choice on what to play when and for how long.  And having nine new games added to my Steam games list only makes it more of a challenge.  Do you realize I’ve had L.A. Noire for months and have yet to play it?!But I’m rambling again…My plan with Dawn of War was to play at least 3 missions of the main campaign then a skirmish as the enemy faction.  This, in theory, would give me enough to rate the games mechanics, story, and balance.  After which point I could continue to play, if the game had captured my interest, or begin writing my review.  Everything started well.  I played the tutorial so I could see which type of RTS this was.  Then I started the first mission.I was impressed at how well they tell the story with the opening sequences.  Even if I wasn’t really following what was going on with the story, the way in which it was given was very well done.  Unfortunately, to me its just another Orc vs Human story that I can’t find interest in.And unfortunately I've never had any interest into the types of worlds where Orcs are present.  I am a fan of Science Fiction, but Fantasy hasn't ever done it for me.  Orcs, Elves, Humans, Middle Earth, whatever or where ever it is, hasn't been my thing.  I've played the WarCraft games, I’ve seen the Lord of the Rings movies, I attempted to read a few different stories in the past.  But none of it really sparks much interest in me.  So the real challenge with games of this genre is to excite me in other ways.  Which has happened, but is a rare occurrence.I can’t find any of the Orcs terrifying, or anything other than plain stupid, and in this game its no different, they just look goofy.  Sure the graphics are dated, but not so bad, and I kinda enjoyed them since they reminded me of Star Wars Galaxies.  But the models themselves, and the designs that were chosen.  A part of my lack of interest in the fantasy worlds fall under technology.  The worlds always look very similar to the Middle Ages, but then there will be some sort of advanced technology that just doesn't fit.The Humans are actually fine in this regard since everything of theirs looks and matches the advance space faring race type.  However the Ocrs look like a lesser advanced race, until they bust out the battle units.  And I just can’t accept being so far advanced on one side and looking a few centuries behind on the other.But story and setting or not I can still play a game.  So I brushed aside my opinions of the story and played on, enjoying the games itself.  And the mechanics are amazing.  The first mission did a great job of holding my hand and guiding me through the process of playing.  Sure, I had learned a bit from the tutorial, but had quit that about halfway in.  It didn’t take long to finish the mission, and even take a moment to realize that I have genuinely enjoyed playing the game.Then came the second mission.  And while I did enjoy myself for most of it, my enjoyment started to ween.  There came a point in the mission where my troops, just a couple of infantry squads, felt so overpowered.  There wasn’t anything they could’t take out in a matter of seconds.  I expected it to be on the easier side this early in the game, but this was ridiculous.  The hand holding was still there, which wasn’t a big deal, just not really necessary.In between he missions are more story pieces.  And I’m not sure what to call them, since they’re not FMV or cinematic’s   They are scripted sequences that take place on the map itself.  Often before you take over control of the game and start the mission.  It was really well done, and probably my favorite thing out of this game.I did also love the dead units not disappearing from the battlefield.  There’s just something about watching your enemies slain pile up.  It really brings to light just how many souls you’ve taken in your quest for vengeance.Onto the third mission, this is where everything changed.  This is where the game got real.It starts with a pre-built base and units guarding checkpoints.  It starts with you coming under attack.  And the attacks don’t waver.  Now I will offer the chance that I was completely missing some important factoid that makes the mission easier.  But I did try it three separate times.  Each time I was unable to build up or maintain a defense force while also building an attack force.  And after awhile the tanks rolled in, and I hadn’t a chance.That’s when a friend informed me of a Mech unit that was located on the map.  So on the fourth attempt I managed to hold my ground long enough to seek out this unit.  I found it and unlocked the ability to build more of them.  And with these new units I swept through the lands slaughtering all that came in my path.  And completed the mission.But here is the problem.  While on previous missions my infantry units mowed through people and buildings like they were all made of paper, now the enemy has tanks and is mowing through me in the same fashion.  Until I get these Mech units, and it sways back into my favor.  I don’t like this.  This doesn’t feel like balance.  It feels like the scales are swaying back and forth.  One side always has an advantage over the other, its just the who that changes.So I tried a Skirmish, just to see.  A standard 8 team Free For All, where I played as the same faction that I was in the campaign.  It was pretty uneventful, I may have had it on too easy of a difficulty.  But I managed to build a base and maintain my defenses from a few attacks, and then build up my attack force.  Then I sent them out to battle, and they walked right through the enemy like paper…Now, when I play a mission I tend to have double the needed units to succeed, sometimes triple.  I love nothing more than having units in the triple digits.  Dawn of War, like most others of its RTS type, has a population limit.  Sometimes I can work with this, but I always feel like its not enough.But don’t think I’m going to trash this game because of the apparent major change in the difficulty curve from mission two to mission three.  Or because the balance feels to be in constant shift.  Because of what I did play of this game I did enjoy.  A lot of this game I thought was great and pretty ground breaking for its time.  I just can’t create any connection with the characters, units, or setting.But I have no plans to uninstalling or forgetting about Dawn of War, I will keep it there, ready for when I’m ready to come back to it.  But most of all this time spent has shown me where Company of Heroes really came from.  Which seeing as I’ve been obsessed with that game is a great way to open my eyes to its evolution.  Things that I don’t like, or don’t feel like they work in Dawn of War are not present in Company of Heroes.  While other things are expanded on and evolved into better thing			"

												Awesome, I have had this game for so long but had been playing Dawn of War 2 which is good as well but with small squads, this game is how Warhammer 40,000 should be ""Large Armies"", the only thing that would make this game better would be if they remade it with the updated graphics of the sequel, but these graphics still hold up very well, get this game!.

												one of the great strategy games of the 2000's era, its territory based resource system completely changed the game from starcraft style mining system to a more conflict driven strategy experience.  The territory system combined witht the warhammer background and the really neat close combat animations make this game a real standout in the genre.  The expansions are good too, but probably not worth the money unless you just want to unlock more races for multiplayer and skirmish.also, as an added bonus, this games  requirements are very low and it will run on most anything these days.

												Great game. As both a W40K fan, and a big fan of RTS games, this was a game made in heavan for fans of both or just RTS games in general. Excellent sound design, options, graphics, and the gameplay is fantastically well designed. It's a tad traditional, but it does enough to make itself stand out, such as focusing on reinforcing squads, and the unlimited resources adds an extra source of tension since both you and your enemy could end up slugging it out until the last man falls if you dont equip them properly or suck as a general.Overall, great experience, but the expansion packs, specifically Dark Crusade, are better in terms of content and unit variety, but still worth a playthrough for completionists sake as the story is followed up on in DoWII8/10			"

												BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!!(ThanksBuketIloveyounohomo!!) Warhammer® 40,000: Dawn of War® is a RTS game by Relic, who did all the other (Good?) Warhammer  games, along with Company of Heroes.  The gameplay revolves screaming out SPACE MARINES ADVANCE!! and generally capturing strategeic points, which gives you one of the game's currencies, Requisition points. The other is obtained by building generators, which gives you power. You do this all while being attacked by Orks, Eldar, and Chaos Marines. Luckily for you, you have Space Marines, along with a large arsenal featuring units, weapons, and vehicles. So do all your enemies, however, so you must reach your vehicles and other powerful units to give you the advantage you need, before your foes reach it and start smacking your face with their stuff. Yeah, its pretty awesome.  I highly recommend this game as it features a great campaign along with some suprisingly humorous dialouge(Mainly between Bale and Sindri), along, and multiplayer with a Skirmish mode(Standard RTS fair, select a faction(s) and fight them), and, of course, multiplayer(Each player controls a faction. Who'd want to play Eldar, I have no clue.).  I recommend this game to really, just about anyone. I'm terrible at strategey, but I loved this game. (And remember, Even in death I serve!) "

												Played this game like 6-7 years ago and played a lot more than stated by steam.IMO dawn of war is defenitly one of the best RTS games of all time and I reccomend you get the whole franchise.Pros--Large control groups compared to other RTS's of the time, allowing you to control huge amounts of units at once-Great camera system allows you to see the battlefield the way you want to see it withought having to use a completely different set of keys-Training squads instead of individual units makes battles seem more large scale and ""war like,"" compared to other RTS games. -More diverse upgrades than  most RTS games.-COMPATIBLE WITH DARK CRUSADE HYPE-Stunning graphics for its time and since the game is old it will run even on the ♥♥♥♥♥iest of todays computers, bringing fun to all computer gamers :DCons--Multiplayer will♥♥♥♥♥♥on you-My second/third favorite war40k factions are not in the game :( -Resource system is different from almost every other RTS i've ever played and im frankly not a huge fan, although some people enjoy it.-Army painter isn't as in-depth as you would hope, but is still fun to play around with.-Campaign is relatively easy and then has a sudden difficulty spike, which turns off both veterans playing on hard modes and new players trying to learn the game.

												An aging RTS gamey that, nevertheless, remains quite good. The plot is relatively straight-forward for 40k stuff: you fight lots of Orcs only to find that there is a greater danger lurking that the Space Marines, being the colossal ♥♥♥♥♥♥s that they are, unwittingly help out until the situation ends up becoming desperate. The plot is not particularly deep or complex, but it works alright.Really the main reason to play this is to build huge armies of dudes and use them to kill tons of enemies for the glory of some emperor guy who probably is a jerk like many of his followers.Anyway, have fun. :o			"

												Dawn of War is a very special game to me, not only beacause it served as my entry point into the WH40k universe, but also as it cemented my love for strategy games along with its expansions, Warcraft 3, Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars and The Battle for Middle-Earth II back in the day. There may not be ample reasons to play it today, but the campaign delivers an interesting, character driven story with stellar voice acting and writing, and serves as a good entry point for anyone unfamiliar with the series and the universe. The multiplayer is dead, but its very much alive in its Dark Crusade expansion, which I recommend getting as well. You'll just need the original game first to play as four out of the seven races that are playable in Dark Crusade. The fifth race, The Imperial Guard, is obtainable through the Winter Assault expansion, while the last two come with Dark Crusade.Last thing I'd like to mention is the sneaky price increase that happened  somewhere near the end of last year. The price went up from 9.99€ to 12,99€, in what I assume is an attempt to cash in on the still growing popularity of the series now that Dawn of War III is coming out at the end of this month. It still gets heavily discounted during sales so you'll be able to get it for just 3.75€, as opposed to 2.50€, which is how much I paid for it.  Nothing major, but nothing fair either. All in all, Dawn of War is a good game that hasn't aged too badly. There's fun to be had in the game's singleplayer campaign, but other than that there isn't much else to do if you're not planning on getting the expansions  so you could play multiplayer.			"

												I've got a 75% off coupon for this game, so you can have it for $3.25 US if you hurry. I can't use the coupon, so I'd accept just about any offer.This game is good. It fixes most of the common flaws of the RTS genre (lookin at you, Starcraft). Small, plentiful units are grouped into squads and basic/obvious tasks are handled automatically, so there's less micro-managing/actions-per-second and more actual strategy. It's nice to command troops that aren't totally incompetent. The point-capture-for-resources gameplay is reminiscent of the Battlefield series, and a little bit of an improvement IMHO. Balance is decent but not great, but you're playing it on PC, so mods.			"

												There are a lot of RTS games out there and Dawn of War is one of the best of the best. It actually does feel like you're playing the Warhammer 40K tabletop game, except without all of the hassle. While the graphics are lacking nowadays, the gameplay and fun factor are still top-notch. There is base building, but it doesn't require an insane amount of micro-managing like SC2 does, for example. What makes this game so enjoyable to me is that you spend the majority of your time managing your massive army and it's just straight up fun to do.The campaign is OK and worth a single playthrough. Just be prepared for drawn out conversations, overly wordy narration, and some incredibly terrible voice acting (though it does have a particular charm). The meat and potatoes is the multiplayer mode, which you can play against CPU bots or online. In this version of the game you can pick between four factions which include Space Marines, Orks, Eldar and Chaos.Highly recommended.			"

												What a nice RTS game!  Really love it! Instead of controlling each unit, you will control a squad. And you can upgrade the squad with some weapons, and the vehicle is also upgradable. It's so fun!			"

												It's a really good game, especially if you are new and want to get a hang of the first few races. You may even spend a little while getting into the campaign (I have to be honest; I am not amazing at RTS games and of this current moment in time, I am fairly new fan of the WH 40K series, but I have had my experiences with both). I am starting to enjoy the Dawn of War games, both for their stories and gameplay mechanics. I plan to do more fleshed out reviews in the DLC's as I get more knowledge about the series. But in my opinion: Online is probably your best bet if you want to enjoy the most out of this game amd I still recommend it for your collection. 85/100.			"

												Dawn of War is Warhammer 40K's first Real-Time Strategy game in the collection of Warhammer 40K videogames.  Since there's quite a bit to say, I'm just going to categorize the different sections of the game.-Story:  Combining aspects of fantasy and science fiction, you are tasked to lead Gabriel Angelos and the Space Marines known as the Blood Ravens as they take on a campaign to rid the planet of Tartarus of the war-loving, barbaric Orks.  What first starts out as a quest of extermination becomes a more complex conflict as more hostile factions enter the fray and a threat that could endanger the whole galaxy is discovered.  I will refrain from revealing much more about the story, but the campaign ends on a cliffhanger, all the more reason to buy DLC.  While the campaign is only 11 missions long and feels paced a little faster than it probably should be, the game attempts to compensate with each level taking anywhere between 1-2.5 hours, which probably explains why the story may have been rushed.  If you're a veteran of the RTS Genre, you may find the core game's campaign to be easy and manage to clear every level without failure.  Overall it's a story that justifies your actions and explores a small fragment of what it's like to be part of the Imperium of Man if nothing else, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.    3.5/5-Graphics:  The game was made in 2004, as a result the graphics you're going to see are going to be a little dated in contrast to the more modern landscapes and character designs known today, even on the higher settings.  As a result, the textures are going to be rather bland and lacking in detail in some places.  Obvious geometry for the most part isn't too noticeable, however animations are rather rigid and limited and you will probably start seeing the same actions get repeated, especially during the Campaign cutscenes.  Even with all the advancements in graphics throughout the years, Dawn of War ages surprisingly well.  You'll be able to notice the bloodshed, corpses, bullet holes and explosion residue left in craters as the battles rage, even if there are a few limitations.  The buildings are animated, so you'll know if your stuff is damaged, being built or whether something's happening, which is always useful in a fast-paced skirmish where information is vital.  Every faction has their own distinct style that's present in their architecture and Game UI, preventing the player from confusing one side for another. Overall, the game's graphics aren't the best I've seen, but it's pretty remarkable considering what was available at the time.   4/5-Gameplay:  Dawn of War is one of the simpler RTS games in terms of complexity.  The map is already drawn with every key point identified, however fog of war still exists, ensuring that  reconnaissance is still important.  There are only two resources to collect:  Requisition and Power, with the former being automatically generated (but sped up as you explore the map and claim more points) and the latter requiring the player to construct generators to collect.  Because of how requisition works, one never has to worry about the map being depleted of resources and being unable to build things, although it becomes much more difficult to construct anything when you have less buildings and points to generate resources.  There are also few kinds of units, which allow for simpler yet fewer strategies.  You will only encounter infantry, land vehicles and builders.  Fortunately the game not only classifies infantry as groups that can be reinforced and improved with your resources wherever they're located, it also avoids adding defenseless builders when you attempt to select your army.  There are four factions by default with more added in DLC, each promoting different strategies and play styles, but you're most likely going to be acquainted with the Jack of All Stat Space Marines from the campaign and the tutorial levels.  Speaking of the tutorial, every key aspect playing the game is covered in an easy to understand way that will allow newcomers to at least figure out what they're supposed to be doing.  One thing I will complain about is how limited the camera zooming is, as I tend to be unable to select all of my units that start occupying the entire screen, and at times your units may have difficulty simply going where you request them to, but not very often.  Before I forget, there is one aspect that separates Dawn of War from other Real-Time Strategy games:  Morale.  Yes, the often mistakenly overlooked aspect of war that must be maintained within your ranks.  Morale determines the survival of your units, and once its depleted they will start missing more often than a stormtrooper at point-blank range.  Naturally there are commander units that exist to boost morale and/or break enemy spirit that can be bound to infantry squads and can prove to be dangerous units with enough research and training.  Because of how morale works, it's never a good idea to send in a strike team that's outnumbered.   To summarize everything that was just typed, Dawn of War is one of the less complex RTS games you'll find, but that doesn't make it necessarily easy or boring.  4/5-Sound:  Everything sounds like what you'd expect it to, weapons, vehicles and all.  Each faction has their own idiosyncratic set of sound cues you'll associate them with.   While it is a minor annoyance to hear your units make an announcement every single time something involving them changes, anything said will always be relevant to the given situation with examples such as “Squad broken!” and “Under fire!”.  Everything your units say is not only standard, but reveals more of the personalities behind the unit type and the faction they hail from.  The background music is usually faint compared to the action, which is a good thing in this case because it doesn't distract from the more important aspect of this game:  Warfare.  While the background music fits the scenario, there isn't much else to say about this limited track.  Aside from the necessary announcements and some extra filler to avoid having the game sound too quiet, sound wasn't much of a focus on this game.  3.5/5-Replayability:  As games grow older and remain active through time, their replay value gradually diminishes and Dawn of War is no exception.  While the campaign may keep one occupied anywhere between a few days to a week at most, there is no real incentive to play this game for very long.  Skirmish mode may be fun for a few rounds to experiment with other factions and strategies, but aside from that there isn't much to say.  While there might have been an active multiplayer for the core game in the past, hardly anyone tends to roam the lobbies anymore.  Unless you know of other people who own the core game, you may end up never setting foot in the multiplayer community.  Fortunately there are three DLC expansion packs that can add more vitality for the game, with the majority of them being well-received as they incorporate new factions, campaigns and possibly fixes to whatever bugs exist and updates for the graphics.  With what little exists in the core game, DLC is practically a necessity, although it's important to keep in mind that Dawn of War has a sequel where the majority of users have most likely migrated to.  A little distressing, but what do you expect from an old game?  It's a miracle it's still even active.  3.5/5Summary/TL;DR:Dawn of War may not be the most complex Real-Time Strategy game out there, but that doesn't make it any less fun.  Overall score:  18.5/25  or 74%**Note:  This score is for the core game itself.  The expansion packs have not been evaluated by this user and may change the score.			"

												I've got a 75% off coupon for this game, so you can have it for $3.25 US if you hurry. I can't use the coupon, so I'd accept just about any offer.This game is good. It fixes most of the common flaws of the RTS genre (lookin at you, Starcraft). Small, plentiful units are grouped into squads and basic/obvious tasks are handled automatically, so there's less micro-managing/actions-per-second and more actual strategy. It's nice to command troops that aren't totally incompetent. The point-capture-for-resources gameplay is reminiscent of the Battlefield series, and a little bit of an improvement IMHO. Balance is decent but not great, but you're playing it on PC, so mods.			"

By getting all expansions, you have access to every available Warhammer army that was during this time except Tyranids.Sindri Myr's voice is like auditorial chocolateConsUnit collision sucks ballsBalance could be better. No Tyranids. Play Dawn of War 2 for Tyranids. "

												This is a well-crafted RTS set in an interesting universe. It is not the usual ""mass the biggest army and steamroll everything"" RTS you normally get. As a novel idea, this strategy actually involves strategy! Who would have thought of such a thing. It's hardly perfect, and it is dated in a few ways, but it is well worth a playthrough.Pros:+Strategy. Seriously, you cannot simply throw your horde at the enemy and expect to win. It may not be the most in-depth strategy, but it does require some actual thought.+There's actually a story that is not overly contrived and generic. At the very least, you stay vested in what happens to your adorable little Blood Ravens.+This might be a con to some, but I like the fact there are only a handful of building, units, and research. I think it helps keep the action up when you can focus on actually conquering.+Warhammer...there seem to be roughly 40,000 of them.Cons:-Unit pathfinding and general movement is atrocious. Moving in groups is vital during combat, but you will often find yourself having to move squads one at a time in order to get them where you need them to be (and not stuck on each other).-There is only 1 faction to play as through the campaign.-Graphics are seriously date...but that is to be expected.-Maybe it's just me, but the cutscenes seem a bit long at times.

It's hardly perfect, and it is dated in a few ways, but it is well worth a playthrough.Pros:+Strategy. Seriously, you cannot simply throw your horde at the enemy and expect to win. It may not be the most in-depth strategy, but it does require some actual thought.+There's actually a story that is not overly contrived and generic. At the very least, you stay vested in what happens to your adorable little Blood Ravens.+This might be a con to some, but I like the fact there are only a handful of building, units, and research. I think it helps keep the action up when you can focus on actually conquering.+Warhammer...there seem to be roughly 40,000 of them.Cons:-Unit pathfinding and general movement is atrocious. Moving in groups is vital during combat, but you will often find yourself having to move squads one at a time in order to get them where you need them to be (and not stuck on each other).-There is only 1 faction to play as through the campaign.-Graphics are seriously date...but that is to be expected.-Maybe it's just me, but the cutscenes seem a bit long at times.

												A new twist into the RTS the genre, this game is old but gold.With a focus on influnce points and battle strategy over base building, Dawn of War is a great experience for RTS lovers. Also, it is worth of note that the game's LORE is fantastic!There is not much single player content and the multiplayer is dead, but still, it is a game worth a try at any time.			"

												This game is a blast from the past. This was one of my favourite RTS game in my childhood, back when I didn't know what an RTS was. This game has good graphics, runs smooth and has a lot of content. The storyline on hard for me took 10 hours and I enjoyed every second, beautiful mission designs and very good storyline. Lots of different troops and buildings. When I finished the game I said to myself “I have to buy dawn of war2""because of how much fun I had playing it and wanted to know what happens in the storyline.10/10 must buy on sale.			"

												Dawn of War is one of my favorite RTS games, even though I suck♥♥♥♥♥at them, Dawn of War is one I find myself picking up again and again to play. The game takes the setting in the Warhammer 40k universe and lets you control one of a few factions from the Warhammer lore to battle other players. The factions in this game are the Space Marines, Eldar, Orks, and Chaos Space Marines.The game, and the series, has many pros; the game has base building, units in squads, vehicles, and pretty decent destruction effects. The aingle player is decent I think and is a good few hours of gameplay and then the multiplayer is like a lot of RTS games however it has resource points you take and hold on the map to keep a steady flow of resources to your side to build buildings and troops. The game offers a variety of modes players can wage battle in such as take and hold (which is taking critical points and holding them to win), annihalation (which is just killing the other side), and capture the flag and so on. The only bad thing I think when it comes to this game is that it is an older game and a few computers have had issues running it but for the most part it seems to be able to run on the newer systems. If not then most fixes can be found online. In the end if you enjoy games like Company of Heroes, Starcraft, Warcraft, etc. then I would recommend this game. The gameplay is well done, pretty well balanced, and enjoyable to play with some friends or just to pass some times with. If you are a fan of the Warhammer 40k lore and setting than this game is great.			"

												Good game but rather short on content.I know this is one of the more venerated RTS franchioses and mind you I liked it. The interface borrows from the Blizzard school of RTS as opposed to the Westwood School. You are given a fair amnount of info for each unit, it;s damage, it's strengths it's weakness, etc.However, it's rather scarce on content compared to many of it's peers. Little hint,. If you're going to have multiple factions in an RTS, it behooves you to at least due a story campaign for each of them. Heck even the ancient Dune 2 had a campaign for each house.Why is this an issue you may wonder. Well, while the marine campaign is indeed nice, I would have loved to play an ork campaign or a chaos camapin... you get what I'm saying? They've created a lovely universe with nicely done inhabitants but yet they confine you to just one.. I hear the expansions add more campaigns but those are extra which makes me wonder. ... Why? I mean I know Other games did this as well but again they gave you a solid offering for all factions before tacking on the extras.So while I can recommend, this game is rather low on my 'must buy' list because of that.Graphically it's pretty nice for it's time, quite nice, gameplay and strategy has a tendency to be a little linear. The squad idea is a nice aesthetic but really doesn't amount to much, gameplay wise. . FOr what I played during the free weekend fun but ... meh... not teh sort of RTS I would genuinely come back to again. It's just too generic in story and too linear in gameplay.			"

												What can I say, accept that this game is awesome!  40k is best served as an RTS, even though I think they are heading towards a MOBA style after Dawn of War II gameplay style and Renicide.....at least as rumor has it :PJust going to jump right into it:PROSYou can make your owqn factionOk graphicsGreat MusicCan be used on lower-end computers (I have a higher end and a lower end)With friends to play with = Amazing! ...even vs AI compsPrice is great for all the fun possibleCONSCan't change Population max without a MODCommunity Online is quite dead (Also a few private with pass rq games)Units when under crtl+# do not act as intelligent as they could when staying together.MISCDoes not follow Warhammer Table-top 100% in damage distribution and armor, but close enoughAll-in-all a great all around game.  Even though it does not follow the rules of the real codex and mechanical understandings of weapons to armor, it does a great job all the same.  So if you love RTS this one is a bit different, but still an RTS to add to your collection.  If you love Warhammer Space Marine 40,000 then probably don't have to suggest this to you because you probably already own this... Basically a must buy to add to your Steam collection, even if just for solo skirmish mode.  You can also use this game to help you understand how the online 40k applies damage to certain armors and special abilities; which are somewhat different than table top, but seem to be reoccurring throughout 40k online games.Sirspoony's rating = 8.25/10    8.75 to 9/10 if community was not so dead			"

Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie?- Yeah. - You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead. I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way. I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are! - Bee-men.- Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your careerat Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot.- She's my cousin! - She is?- Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspectof bee existence. These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes?- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?""How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that? Why would you question anything?We're bees. We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about. Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's likeoutside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were.- I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh?- Barry! A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am.- You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough? I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one. Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it, maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals? That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today!- Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobswill be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available?- Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations!Step to the side. - What'd you get?- Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first?			"

												This game changed how I feel about RTS games. This game is my favorite and i'm counting all dlcs with it. I think they didn't do so good with dawn of war 2 but with the original they did it perfect. If you think that there is not enough units or building and other stuff then you can get the ultimate apocalypse mod for dawn of war: soulstorm. All in all This game is the best I have played so far.			"

												I played the original game when it came out and enjoyed it a lot. Bought it on Steam to relive the glory but unfortunately can't recommend it. Too many problems with sound cutting out. I'm not shy about going on forums and searching for and implimenting fixes but the sound issues, like low-volume, static, or missing sounds pop up every other session. Gimme a break! Playing on an office commercial Dell with Win 7 but the box is over ten years younger than the game; one of the reasons i chose to install it here. It shouldn't be this much of a problem.			"

												I remember this to be great RTS that combines base building and capturing control points like the old classic Z. But neither this nor Winter Assault is recomended due to one fact - they both lack widescreen support, so one will be playing either streched or blackbarred version, or will be using some community workarounds, which have their own problems. Skip GOTY and Winter Assault and go for Soulstorm or Dark Crusade, both of which support widescreen natively.			"

Can't wait to get ahold of Armageddon which seems to have went back to the true form of WHammer. But I dgress. Aside from them NOT having trading cards or achievements *which I still don't understand considering the game is still so popular and such a classic, every TBS or RTs fan should havei their library, all 4 of the DOW 1 games are great and brings back fond memories, not to mention allowing to to make some new ones!

												You know how some RTS games age really well? Dune 2, all the Warcraft games, etc? Well, this is not one of them. The game models don't have a lot of polys, and textures don't have a lot of pixels in them, sure, but this is not the problem. They also don't have any style or imagination. Gameplay is straightforward and boring, too: the same as in any other right-clicking RTS game you played before. And the story... WH40k universe offers a lot of real, gritty gothic stories of unimaginable horrors and deep space nightmares. This is definetly not one of them though.If you think that this game has any value other than nostalgic, think again. And don't buy it.			"

												At this point, I could honestly only suggest this game to hardcore RTS fans, specifically those who are into WarCraft 3 but could expand into some new lore and mechanics. It's just aged a great deal. It looks and feels bad. The soundtrack seems on par with the sequels though, and there seems to be plenty of story in the campaign, and a neat territorial conquest theme to the campaign that the DoW2 series did not have.Now, I'm typically not a fan of true RTS games, which might be why I feel like Dawn of War 2 was a vastly superior set of games in ALL ways, but I can understand that the first Dawn of War series of content here can hold some people's attention. They're definitely more focused on more multitasking and bigger squadrons. That kind of stuff honestly just hurts my brain. I much prefer DoW2's 4-Hero Unit campaign structure, and it's Last Stand mode (though now largely unplayed).As far as multiplayer goes, I cannot comment, as I know my role there. I am no use to any team. That's probably where this first series shines, from what I hear.			"

												I LOVE THIS GAME. Just wanted to make that perfectly clear before carrying on. I would love to play it again... I sunk a ridiculous number of hours into this game when it first came out, which was back in the days that current resolutions were nothing more than theory. The game now is practically unplayable on high end machines simply because it hasn't been patched to do so. Which is a real shame... DoW2 works fine on modern kit, but it's not the same game, more a 'Here's some men, go kill♥♥♥♥♥♥ and very little RTS. Until Relic put out a patch to fix it, I do not recommend it unless you're on a 10 year old machine.			"

												A good old-fashioned RTS set in the Warhammer 40k universe. Runs smoothly, easy to learn but hard to master, looks pretty good for an older game, engaging story mode and addicting co-op/ai mode. I wish more people were on the online multiplayer, but I'm happy popping on to play an hour-long game against a bunch of bots. My friend and I once had a 6-hour long game with us on a team against multiple teams of hard bots. Recommend for anybody who likes RTS games, but not for the whiney newer generation of gamers who think anything without triple-a cutting edge graphics is bad.			"

												If there was a neutral vote id put thatbut it does tip towards the no. One reason being when i first saw this i was like HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ITS A WARHAMMER VID GAME OFC ITS GOIN TO BE GREAT!!!Then i started to play and dont get me wrong very nice for its time but it lacks the warhammer feel.... the feeling of controlling thousands of troops at once, the feeling of aww man 50 of my guys died but thats alright i got 500 more to throw into the fray that kinda feel if u ever look at the artwork for battles in the codexes and books it depicts humongous batttles where thousans (im sorry i ment MILLIONS) of troops are thrown at eachother while this when i was getting to the mid campaign where the orcs supposedly are infesting the cities flooding in in the thousands where as the actual level i only got to kill 100-150 orcs max eachtime this is a great game dont get me wrong but it lacks the mass troops and the base building is just horrible. no room to build no freedom as to where i want my barracks to be or my turret to be dead smack in the middle of me base incase of sky boyz and stuff I know warhammer battlemarch came out way WAY later then this but if they were goin to setup a campaign why not like that where you get 20 squads to work with in the beginning (maybe alittle more since ya kno BIG BATTLES NED MUST HAZ) then have a battle deployment i mean they couldve done so much more with this but they chose not to and went with base building i mean come on where in the history of the tabletop game did base building matter you simply had a equal force as your enemy and the roll of the dice along with your strategy to win you the day not resources or higher tech level it simply didnt matter so why should it have mattered now.And dawn of war 2 was a complete waste of the title its simply 4 squads every level where as they took out the need for a base (which was nice) but took away EVEN MORE troops so it felt so empty like there was this perfectly good battle field with no able bodies to fill it inch by inch.Now if your a warhammer fan and have played the tabletop games and other things warhammer i suggest this to you but if your the lore fan who thought of warhammer 40k as a age of mass DA MEN EVERYWHERE then dont get this its a waste they couldve done so much more but they chose to go down a route that wasnt ever their stle when deving thids game			"

												It's very old, and it shows horribly in both graphics and gameplay.First annoyance: Whenever you boot it up it goes to the Steam overlay, prompting you to CREATE YOUR RELIC ACCOUNT. Yeah, nope, attrocious. Give it a rest already.While the campaign is entertaining in a B-movie way and the small animations of your Terminators crushing enemies are both brutal and fun to watch, your troops start messing up as soon as you have more than 10 of them; clustering together in tight spots, stopping on their way to attack-move somewhere so you need to issue another order to get them going, and having the map central on units immediately when selecting them forcing you to go back to where the action is/was to order them where to attack (as opposed to Star Craft gameplay where centralizing on units only occurs if you double click the shortcut for the unit).Case in point: Your troops captures a relic point. You then select a servant to build a listening post, however the camera goes to that unit instead of just selecting it while still being over the listening point area you just captured, making you have to click on the map where that point was and then clicking on the place you want to build again - every damn time you want to build something. It's really jarring and halts your progression and flow in a very tedious, frustrating manner.I'm sure this was decent for its time, but games have moved on since then and it's just too old and finicky to compete. Adding to that, it has no resolutions for 1920x1080 and the camera, even when zoomed all the way out, is way to close to your troops and ground to get what you'd consider a normal overview in RTS games.Only get it in a bundle as I did, or stay away, even on a sale.

												The game itself is a fun RTS, but the issues hold it back for me. I've tried it on multiple computers since I bought it a few years ago, and I can't get more than halfway through a mission without it crashing on me. A huge disappointment, since the little bit of time I've managed to play it was good. It doesn't have widescreen support built in (there's a fan-made patch to add it, but it's still not perfect), but I honestly enjoyed it enough (again, while it worked) not to mind black borders on the sides of my screen.Since so many other people have had it run fine for them, it's almost definitely something about the computers I've tried playing it on. Don't spend a cent on it unless you know for certain it works on your computer (try the demo first!).I only have half an hour listed because I only added it to Steam hoping they had fixed the issues in the newest patches. It's still crashing as often as it did when I installed it from my boxed copy.			"

												I know shouldn't let the Campaign overly influence my opinion on this game, but man I found this boring. It hasn't aged very well at all. I can forgive the poor draw distance, and the chunky graphics, as technology moves on long after games have been made.Yet... the story was pretty boring and by the book, which is a shame when you consider the huge amount of lore you can draw from the Warhammer Universe. Like other RTS before and after it, Dawn of War suffers from the ease in which you can build up a super army and just blitz your way through the map. There are some nice animations and kill sequences within the game, which is a nice little touch.I'll give this game another go somewhere down the line and play Skirmmish/Multiplayer against other people, which I think will be a fairer reflection on what it has to offer.I do like the idea of the Army Painter tool to create unique paint designs.

												While I did play this game from start to finish, I would not recrommend it when compared to much better games of the same genre. Had I bought this game when it first came out as opposed to a steam sale several years after it's release I would probably say this game is great. Starcraft is a much better game in comparison. I am mostly writing this review to say not to buy Warhammer 40,000 because it is like any other strategy game on the market. I think consumers would be happier buying Warhammer 40,000 (2) as the gameplay is less repetative and more exciting sicne your squad mates use cover and throw grenades to take over vital positions (kind of like Company of Heroes mixed with Starcraft). I would have been fine skipping on the first 3 Warhammer 40,000 games and just owning Retribution 2 with all of its expansions.  I own all the Warhammer 40,000 Franchise games and that is my honest opinion.			"

												what a horrible dissapointment. First, no matter what i did, i couldn't skip the 5 minute movie that comes on every damn time you start the game. Next, i figured for 2004, these graphics wouldn't look like, 1965, right? WRONG. I can compare this game most to Airmech, a free to play game. You wanna know what? Airmech is a better game. I'm sure most people just got this is the THQ bundle, but really THQ?-7/100			"

												Arnold Ray ""Bake"" McBride (born February 3, 1949 in Fulton, Missouri), also nicknamed ""Shake n' Bake"" and ""The Callaway Kid"", is a former Major League Baseball outfielder, known primarily as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies' teams of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Selected in the 37th round in 1970 as the 811th player,[1] he made his major league debut for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1974, finishing the season with 173 base hits, 30 stolen bases, and a .309 batting average, and was named the National League's Rookie of the Year, the first Cardinal to earn the award since Bill Virdon in 1955. On June 15, 1977, McBride was traded, with Steve Waterbury, by the St. Louis Cardinals to the Phillies for Tom Underwood, Dane Iorg, and Rick Bosetti.On February 16, 1982, McBride was traded to the Cleveland Indians for Sid Monge. On November 7, 1983, he was granted free agency, but chose to retire from baseball.			"

												Yep. It's old, but it's one of the most defining RTS during its time.Quick recommendation: If you want the 100% Dawn of War 1 experience, get Dawn of War: Soulstorm + Ultimate Apocalypse mod, instead. But if you want to really introduce yourself slowly to the Warhammer 40000 universe without clotting your head with too many stuff at once, play this one first.I used to own all of the DoW games once, pirated. Being used to Warcraft and Starcraft as pioneer RTSes, I thought, ya why not. Another space-sci-fi RTS. Recently I bought all DoW titles on Steam, just to remind and appreciate how Dawn of War introduces me to an uber-awesome sci-fi universe which is WARHAMMER 40000.This game opened doors for me. It introduces me to the dark, grim and hopeless Warhammer 40000 franchise. From there I get to know that GW miniatures are a thing, and am hooked to collecting and painting the minis now. And Warcraft and Starcraft actually are inspired by the Warhammer and Warhammer 40000 franchises, respectively.Back to the game, this is one of those innovative RTSes where you can control an entire 'unit' (or squad) of up to 9-10 soldiers instead of training them one-by-one a la War/Starcraft. This allows bigger battles with more units on screen. Other innovative things are all units can engage in either ranged or melee combat. Why melee in a sci-fi universe, you ask? Well melee is a big feature in the Warhammer 40000 universe, where combats tend to get up close and personal.So within those melee combat, they will sometimes have 'sync kills' where some of your/enemy's troops will execute a brutal melee kill animation that's really fun to watch. Other innovative things in this RTS is certain bigger units like walkers and monsters will be able to mow down and toss smaller troops around, and this really brings the battlefield alive.Am really excited Dawn of War III, the third installment of this franchise that is coming soon. And if you really are interested in delving into the universe without purchasing the overpriced models, codexes and books, this game is a must play to get you the general feeling and atmosphere of the Warhammer 40000 universe/franchise. It is a very good entry point to the overly complex universe.			"

												Altough I do not play the table top game, but i find that this game is the best way of starting to get into the MASSIVE world of Warhammer, as it goes without saying that it is a considerable amount cheaper and more enclusive. A squad of Night Lord chaos Space Marines at full strenght and an Aspiring Champion cost about 565 points in game, which are free. The same squad would cost about £50 (I've looked at a start up pack which is around 15 figures) for much the same. That unit then takes hours to make and paint, and then will end up on a shelf until you buy about 3 more units, a Land Speeder and a Librarian, at which point you have to drive to the shop (Because those units wont fit on a bike) and play some annoying nerd who keeps telling you your doing it wrong, or that you don't know enough about Konrad Curze's former life in a hive city and his subsiquent fall to the forces of chaos to play as the Night Lords. On the other hand, in game you can play agaisnt a well balanced A.I of adiquate difficulty which CANT TALK, and along side countless other sqauds and even other leigons in 2v2v2v2 skirmish matches of annihaliton or economic based battles in a bid to control the battlefield. You do the math. £6.99 or £609.99. I've even bought the £99.99 expansion package. Still worth it.			"

												This is the game that really got me back into RTS after years of docile activity. It has laughable graphics, but the story and characters just feel and look really cool. The building system is very much like Company of Heroes or Starcraft, but seem to be simplified in a way that players can pick it up easy and still feel like they're getting a challenge without the frustrating factor of ""how do i do ____."" In some ways, I view this game as superior to Dawn of War 2, but I'd still recommend buying both. Another important thing to note is that you don't have to know anything about the Warhammer series to enjoy this game. I came in knowing little more than it was about space marines or something. The story gives a good backstory and explanation for the universe, inviting players from all background rather than shunning those who do not follow the series. I don't really have a complaint except that maybe an updated HD version should be made (Though I don't really care much since, as old as it looked, I still liked how it did present itself).Gameplay: 10/10Story: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Characters: 9/10Replayability: 10/10			"

												This was the game that got me into the Warhammer 40k Universe. The gameplay is fantastic for an RTS, you have only two types of resources, requisition and power so you have to go out and capture requisition points and defend them to maintain a source of requisition, this keeps you in constant conflict with the other factions as they need it as much as you.This kind of ""Need for war"", makes the game so action packed for a strategy game. There are only 4 factions, and each of them with different units and abilities. The campaign was great, both in story and battles, but it's a shame that they only made a campaign for the Space Marines.Overall, this is a great example of a Real Time Strategy game, one with an extensive lore behind it and innovative gameplay.

												Ever wonder where Blizzard got most of their ideas for the Warcraft and Starcraft games? Look no further than Warhammer. This long-running series started out in the '80s as a tabletop strategy game, and transitioned to computer games not long after. The Dawn of War series takes place in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, and will have a very familiar feel to anyone who has played Blizzard's popular RTS games. No doubt you're already familiar with Space Marines and Orks. You'll find plenty of them here. Starcraft's Protoss and Zerg drew their inspiration from Warhammer's Eldar and Tyranid races, respectively. You'll also find several other factions unique to Warhammer, including the corrupt Chaos Marines, the undead robotic Necron, and the alien Tau. Even though the Dawn of War series was originally released in 2004, it still stands the test of time, and the many expansion packs keep things fresh and interesting. If you're a fan of any sci-fi RTS games, you'll love Dawn of War.			"

												One of my favourite strategy games of all-time, Dawn of War is a real-time strategy game set in the futuristic Warhammer 40000 universe.Like most strategy games, you have a base building. You build more buildings which give you access to units and abilities. You can then uprgrade units and building to improve your army. To build buildings or units you need resources which can be acquired by capturing points and buildng power stations. Buildings, units, abilities and playstyles change according to the race that you choose. In the original Dawn of War, you have access to 4 races: Space Marines, Chaos, Orcs and Eldar. In the single player campaign mode, you play as the Space Marines in a story driven campaign. The storyline is interesting enough to keep you engaged and maps are varied enough to stay interesting for whatever difficulty level you have selected.There are also single player scenarios, where you pick and any army and map and then play. Also there is online multiplayer to play with human opponents. Maps can hold between 2 and 8 players who can be divided into teams if desired.There is also a customiser where you can choose a race and customise the look of your units and buildings to create a unique looking army for yourself.There are also 3 expansions which further build on this: Winter Assault, Dark Crusade and Soulstorm.Winter Assault features new maps, storyline and the addition of the Imperial Guard race. The storyline features the option to play through it as Good (Imperial Guard and Eldar) or Evil (Chaos and Orks) with an ending that changes depending on who you pick to play the final mission with.Dark Crusade again features completely new maps, storyline, addition of the Tau race and the Necron race as well as new units for existing races. The single player game is changed slightly as you now have an overworld view of the planet that all these races are fighting on. You choose which areas you wish to battle in first. The more areas you acquire, the more resources that are open to you. You can also acquire honor guard units (rare powerful hero units) as well as equipment to give to your race's leader, which enhances their stats and abilities. This gives the game a pseudo-RPG element. You eliminate other races by invading their home region and taking it, but they can do the same to do.Again, the storyline is engaging enough, but not as immersive or as intense as in the previous games.Soulstorm once again builds further on what has come before by featuring more completely new maps, storyline, addition of the Sisters of Battle race and the Dark Eldar race, as well as even more units for existing races. The single layer features an overworld view of several planets and maintains the pseudo-RPG elements of Dark Crusade. Overall, this is a great strategy series to get is you are a fan of the genre or of Warhammer 40000 in general.			"

												This game takes what you love about the tabletop (action, strategy, troop management/movement, a killing Orks) and leaves what you don't (spending money). If you are a 40k fan, and also a gamer, there's no reason not to have this game.This is your typical RTS, that utilizes buildings that make infantry, other buildings that make vehicles, and gathering resources (although the resource gathering is much more simplified than in Age of Empires, or even Command and Conquer). Fairly intuitive, this game lets you hop right into the action. You can even ""paint"" your army and save a custom scheme in case you don't want to ruin the defaults for the different races.This game isn't as in depth as the tabletop as far as the disparity of units. For example, in this game, the Blood Angels have the exact infantry and vehicle choices as the ultramarines. And air vehicles are missing entirely. But still, well done, and true to the source material.I not only recommend this game, but I also bought it and gifted it to a friend so he could play with me. (In multiplayer mode. The campaign is completely single player.)			"

												I've ONLY played the single-player campaign and it was very enjoyable. The campaign has a very good story that borrows a lot from the actual WH franchise, so those familiar with the Space Marines should have a lot to look forward too. The plot's fleshed out by interesting and some what lengthy cutscenes before and after each mission. The voice actors in the game are very over the top and sometimes cheesy, but they manage to fit each character well and the voice acting actually comes away as a very bright spot in the game for me.Game-play wise there isn't a whole lot of 'new' here compared to other RTS games, but what is included is polished. For its release date I consider the game to be very technically capable with things like decent character animations and solid over-all performance. Fans of RTS games or the Warhammer franchise should definitely give this one a shot.			"

												This is a great game for new and veteran rts players alike. It teaches the fundamentals of RTS video games to the letter, ensuring you understand a unit, what it is effective against, what it is weak to and keeping your army upgraded is a constant factor in this game. Assuming you have the requisition points and energy to do so. On a deeper level, the game has a long lasting and incredibly unique and original story that has turned me into a die hard Warhammer 40K. I reccomend this to all RTS players who want a challenging, fun and immersive game. For the Emperor. For the Imperium!			"

												This is the first RTS I have played in several years, and the first Warhammer game I have ever played. After finishing the campaign in 14 hours and playing a bit of team based multiplayer with a few of my friends I have come to the conclusion that this game is at least a 9/10 The Warhammer 40k world is a richly expansive universe of the same quality as other such giants in the industry such as Starcraft and Warcraft. All characters are loveable, interesting, and at least memorable. Running into battle with a group of fully upgraded space marines against an opposing force is uplifting as it is intense and exciting. I tend to prefer RPG's and tactical shooters, but Dawn of War is a game that everyone should play at least once. As I can honestly say that after finishing the campaign mode I am now obsessed with the universe and have been doing everything in my power to learn more about it. Do yourself a favor and purchase this gorgeous gem of a game.			"

												Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is in my opinion the best RTS game of all time, and it is just fantastic.Story:- I don't know that much of the Warhammer lore, but as far as I know, it follows it really well. If it doesn't, it still delivers a good and satisfying story!Gameplay:- The gameplay is where this game shines, with different races to play as on over 30 maps, this game never gets old. All races have the same basics, but late game it changes. I won't spoil anything of it, because I think everyone who is a fan of the genre or a fan of the Warhammer universe should play this. There are, as said above, over 30 maps to play on, and all of them are different in some way. Every map is challenging to master, and it adds brilliantly to the replay value and enjoyment.Graphics:- Graphics don't add anything to the overall enjoyment of the game in my opinion, and it doesn't do that here either. The graphics were great for their time, and though the textures definitely look dated, they do hold up over 12 years after its official release.Verdict:Dawn of War is the definitive RTS experience, and it is definitely worth the money, though if you're after graphics, you should probably go for Sins Of The Solar Empire. The game gets a 8/10 from me.- Denolact			"

												Epic. A faithful transition from table-top miniatrues to desktop works in an excellent way. This is an RTS that no one should pass up. The story is hokey-- but it's WH40K, what do you expect?-- but the gameplay is solid. The GE is relatively limited, strictly speaking, with only a few of the WH40K races being playable. If you are a Tau, Necron, Dark Eldar, or SoB fan, you will need to pick up the later expansions. Pick them up anyway-- you'll thank yourself later.			"

												Such a masterpiece, but don't buy it unless you do it for the story or for the multiplayer races.If you want a solid campaign and don't care about the story of the Blood Ravens, buy Dark Crusade.If you want to have a solid multiplayer experience, buy this for the multiplayer races and then get Soulstorm. (To play more factions in the multiplayer you need the previous games. For example, this game gives Space Marines, Eldar, Orks and Chaos. Winter Assault gives Imperial Guard. Dark Crusade adds Tau and Necrons and Soulstorm adds Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar. If you buy this game and Soulstorm you will be able to play Space Marines, Eldar, Orks and Chaos + Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar.).			"

												Note to myself : rewrite this feedback later, it's unreadable. If you like RTS where your weakest unit can last longer than 1 second and tough units are mean to be tough (they'll last longer than 5 seconds even when things are really intenses, and will win a 1v20 against weak units), then this game is for you. Quite easy to start with (Game Tutorial for beginner), Dawn of War 1 is a classical ""build your base, create your army and crush your opponents"" game, where you can get both a high amount of units and ""Nokia"" units (yeah, you won't be able to take them down in less than 10 seconds unless you have enough dakka). The skirmish setting gives you the opportunity to choose between different victory condition (ex : annihilate the enemy, kill the enemy's leader, get enough ressources, ...). If you already played to a Blizzard RTS (Warcraft 3 or Starcraft), you'll discover a new way to get ressources : forget everything about harvesting ressources. Ressources increase automatically : build a Generator, and you'll get Energy over time (+10/sec for each generator, but you'll get 1 energy each 0.1 second). The more you build generator, the faster you'll get Energy (and they'll continue giving ressources, until you or your enemy destroy them). Thus you don't have to worry about ""units harvesting ressources"" or ""exhausting all the map ressources"" : just focus on the battle and use your ressources wisely. This game also has memorable ambient music (look out for «Blood Ravens Approach») and nice sync kills too, especially when a heavy unit ""crushes"" smaller units.Edit : Forgot to mention it, but effectiveness and ineffectiveness (between units) are really applied in this game (a sniper can easily one hit kill an infantry or deal 300 damages to a heavy infantry, but try it out on a building and you'll do less than 20 damages).

												I still remember when I first saw this game (Gold Edition) at Target and convinced my parents to let me get this game being a huge fan of the Tabletop Structure (~14 maybe?); Aww back when ESRB actually meant something and I couldn't buy Mature games on my own ;) This game brings so many memories, my new computer featuring 512 MB of RAM or just thinking about how sweet it looked on my ""fancy computer"" compared to the N64, Cube, PS2, etc.  Aww how time has flown (9 years!!!!), yet my faithful companion still sits just a few feet away on the shelf... Have you not figured it out yet?? Buy this game! Even purchasing multiple copies (Disc back in the day and now Steam) it has never let me down (Everyone needs a first console killer, wink wink) and this game and series will always hold that special place in my Gaming Heart and I genuinely hope it does for you too! ***Side-Note*** While I love this game, wait for a major sale (Summer/Winter)!!! The Franchise usually goes on sale for 75-90% off making all games, DLC, and expansions (**W40K-DoW2 items for the dlc and expansions, mostly skins**) around 10-25$. ***Cough Cough, worth every cent, cough cough***			"

												Single Player- Even though the campaign missions felt long and drawn out I did enjoy the story behind it. This game was my introduction to the Warhammer universe and I must say I am impressed. Multiplayer- Best played in a private party of friends I must say. Rarely have I gone onto the online lobby and found more than three active games (if that). Solid RTS, one of the best I've ever played. I recommend getting this game alonside the rest of the expansions, not only do you get more campaigns to play but also unlocks a ton of more races to play as in skirmish and multiplayer modes. The only negative I have is the scroll distance. I like having a large field of view on the map and the game just does not let me scroll out far enough for my liking. Nothing mods can't fix however.			"

												Not much to say here; I've played RTS games my whole life, since I was a kid, and this is one of the best around. Streamlined resource managment that ties well into gameplay, and a central mechanic that encourages tactics and strategy. Plus, it's Warhammer 40,000. I knew nothing about the universe or table-top game going into this and its because of this game that I've fully embraced the ""grim darkness of the far future,"" in all its glory. Do yourself a favor, buy this game, play it, and bring honor to your troops and the Emperor!			"

												Note: This game and it's numerous expansions track playtime differently, I have played more than this it is just divided amongst all the expansions which makes playtime harder to truly calculate. Dawn Of War is one of the best RTS games I've ever seen and is definitely worth the purchase and all of it's dlcs, at the time of writing they were all on sale for a combined price lower than 10 dollars, that is an absolute steal. In short, Dawn Of War is an RTS that contains:- 9 Incredibly unique factions ranging from the undead/robotic necron, who do not require requisitions but need to build massive amounts of power to sustain themselves to the legendary Warhammer Space Marines, the super soldiers who define the series with their powerful leadership units and decent unit composition making impossible fights slightly more possible (Though the expansions are needed for 5 of them, by default you get Orks, Chaos Marines, Space Marines, and Eldar though they are pretty unique and can in themselves offer hundreds of hours of gameplay).-Interesting game modes such as the standard destroy the enemy's base ranging to hold various points for a set amount of time or even just slay the enemy commander before yours falls. Plus, you can set more than one victory parameter for maximum gameplay and strategic influence. -Expansions that change the singleplayer experience (Soulstorm and Dark Crusade) to a map takeover in which all of the game's factions wage war and fight numerous matches attacking and defending territory with troops they earned throughout the campaign and even their fation specific commander his/herself.In the end, it is an amazing game well worth your time, though I do suggest getting the expansions as they make the already great game even better.

												For those who like the RTS genre or simply like the Warhammer 40K board game, this is an excelent game!The campaign is relatively short, having only 11 missions, but still has a decent story and is challenging (although some enemy hero units' AI might bug out sometimes leaving them very defenseless against your troops).The army customization for the multiplayer and skirmish modes also adds a bit of the Warhammer board game in which we were free to paint our miniatures however we wantedThe only big problem (at least for me) is that the game's screen resolution doesn't go over 860x600 unless you go fiddling with the game files			"

This series is a wonderful way to introduce yourself to the world of Warhammer 40,000 without having to shell out hundreds or even thousands of dollars buying miniatures of the tabletop version. 11/10.

												An absolutely brilliant adaption of the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game to real-time strategy. Relic hits it out of the park in nailing the look and feel of Warhammer 40K, while providing for fluid real-time gameplay - including base building. There is suprising depth to the strategic elements of the game, and the sides are well balanced despite being very distinct. Most highly recommended. Dark Crusade and Soulstorm add even more fun and depth to the mix.			"

Posted: April 25, 2015
												To start: I used to add a much longer header to these reviews, but since it often made the reviews too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery.Gameplay: One thing that's very difficult not to do when talking about any base-building RTS, let alone a military Sci-Fi RTS, is to not compare it to Starcraft, especially considering the influence that the Warhammer 40k world present in Starcraft. After all, there's a race of humans kinda like the Terrans, there's an alien race like the Protoss, and while not present in this game, there is a race similar to the Zerg. Also much like Starcraft, the gameplay is centered around building bases.The differences come in, as you might expect, with the gameplay. While this is something of a personal taste, I really do quite like how resources are handled in this game. Your two basic resources are Requisition (kinda like Minerals) and Power (kinda like Vespene). You gain requisition from controlling Strategic Points on the map. It is also from these Strategic Points that you build your base, from which you can build in a radius that expands up to a certain point. Unlike Starcraft, you gain resources at a set rate per minute, which is slow enough to require you to think about what you wanna build, as opposed to spamming harvesters all day. Power is gained from building generators, and much like Requisition, is gained at a set rate per minute. There are also Slag Deposits on some maps, which you can capture and build a special generator on, allowing a bit more strategy with your expansion.Units are produced in squads, and vehicles have their own unit cap outside of the squad unit cap. With some research, you can increase your squad cap to 20, and your vehicle cap to 10. While this doesn't sound like much, keep in mind that each squad can have up to ten people in it, reaching Starcraft's famous 200 unit limit very easily, and surpassing it with vehicle count. I do wish that your construction units didn't count as one squad, which can be especially obnoxious as there is no way of recalling your construction units other than sending them out to maybe punch the enemy's base or something.While the game doesn't necessarily have as many units as Starcraft, the matter of unit composition is largely handled by equipment. Your basic squad can be outfitted with four different special weapons, of which each squad can have up to four specially equipped members. Another aspect to this game is its Morale system, in which you can use particularly gruesome attacks to break apart squads, leaving them easy for the pickings as well as discouraging some easy rushes from time to time. The single player campaign is somewhat disappointing, as it only features the Space Marines. I'll talk more about the story later, but for now know that there aren't Eldar, Ork or Chaos Marine campaigns (Eldar being the kinda-Protoss race and Necron being the unlisted kinda-Zerg race). There are apparently campaigns in the expansions, but since I haven't played them yet, I can't speak for them.Now, we come to the important question: how fun is the game? This was my first ""legit"" introduction to the Real-Time Strategy genre, and I gotta say; I picked a damn good game to start out with. The gameplay is very streamlined, there's usually a great bit of action going on at any one time, and the mechanics are simple enough on the surface while still having a good bit of depth to it for people to play for quite some time. If you're looking for an RTS to get someone's feet wet with, I can very easily recommend this one over Starcraft (although Starcraft may take a bit of weening into) for first timers to the genre. Simple on the surface, deep underneath, very streamlined and just overall a hell of a lot of fun to play. 9/10.Story: Since the completion of this game, I've gone on and read some more of the Warhammer 40k lore, and I've gotta be honest; the campaign doesn't do the series justice. The content is kinda neat, and the Orks are still fun to watch bumble about, but for the Space Marines, this game doesn't do very good in showcasing just how grand their empire is. It feels kinda... fanfic-y, in a not so great way. They try to do some intrigue, but it just doesn't work, and the cliffhanger at the end is, to be quite frank, inexcusable. While the dialogue and writing in-game is good, the actual story itself just isn't good. At all. Disappointing. 6/10.Graphics: Unfortunately, to get this game to run at 1080p I had to download some modded files, which may trigger anti-cheat protection if you happen to play multiplayer. Also, running these files breaks the HUD for the Space Marines (although strangely not for any of the other races). It's frustrating, and I really would expect Sega to get around to making 1080p available in-game without any modding required. Despite this, the game looks pretty good for a 2004 game. Unit design is pretty neat, most of the areas that you visit throughout the campaign look really cool, and of course, seeing an Ork mech tear a Space Marine in half is just plain awesome. I never suffered any frame drops, which is always nice for an older game, as older games around this generation like to depend entirely on your integrated graphics chip if you happen to have one, leaving your GPU idling uselessly. 4.5 for not having 1080p available by default, but the half point comes in because a mod is very easy to download and install.Sound: The voice acting during the cutscenes isn't bad, but it's not exactly award winning work either. Voice acting in battle is pretty good, though, especially for the Orks (I may also have a bit of an Ork bias). The music is pretty excellent as well, and is definitely memorable. It's pretty much entirely orchestral, but it's very ""heavy,"" with loads of brass and percussion; just the way I like my orchestras. Apart from that, there's not much else to talk about here. Good stuff. 4/5.Overall scores are: 9/6/4.5/4; cumulative score of 7.8/10. Again, the biggest problem with the game is the campaign being kinda not good, but at least skirmishing is a lot of fun. Still though, the campaign is disappointing, especially considering that Relic made Homeworld.			"

												Important thing to note about the game, this is not a resource management RTS in the vein of Starcraft or AoE, instead it is closer to a game like Company of Heroes or the LotR RTS. Fantastic squad management and variety. Each race feels different and it takes a little bit to get used to which I love. Play it on a harder difficulty if you want to stay engaged for the whole game. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE STORY MODE GET DARK CRUSADE!Dark Crusade is set up for fantastic empire style skirmishes without any of the story clutter.A fantastic tactical RTS in my opinion, a must own for an 40k or sci fi strategy game fan			"

												This is the game that started it all for me. This is the game that put me on the path to become a Warhammer 40,000 fanboy (PC and literature, not tabletop). The setting is the distopian Warhammer 40,000 universe where a planet is beset by Orks (with a ""k"") and the Space Marines are sent to liberate the planet. Confusion and twists, Eldar and Chaos, follows.This game was best known as introducing the new squad based fighting units. Instead of creating your army one unit at a time, you can now create an entire squad of a specific unit and have it fight as a whole. It moved the focus from resource gathering to strategic point captures, freeing up your focus from managing gatheres to managing your army.The single player campaign, unfortunately, only follows the Space Marine storyline, so it seems quite short. However, you can still play with the other races in either multiplayer or skirmishes.			"

												I have never really bothered to play a Warhammer game, or even the board game. But after playing Dawn of War I can safely say that Warhammer has been cemented in my memory as an excellent rts with excellent lore behind it.You begin as a commander of the forces of the Imperium of Man finds himself outnumbered by orks, a race of green humanoids hell-bent on conquering everything. The storyline, although short, is one of the most interesting I've seen in an RTS, and it is easy to follow, even if you know nothing about the Warhammer lore. It evolves into a decent ending, with elements for a sequel clearly present.This game, as an RTS, is brilliantly executed. Rather than buying a single unit, you buy a squad of units, each with its own health bar, which you can reinforce, upgrade weapons, and beef up to take on the challenges that lie ahead. This applies only to infantry, however, as vehicles are a single unit, with their own strengths and weaknesses. The variety of tools available to you ensures that no matter the task, You will have everything needed at your disposal. In addition, workers do not gather resources, rather capturing strategic points generates them, which takes an element of micomanagement away from the game, making it more acessible. Your squads tend to have good lasting power, and remain useful even very late into the game. Just as well, as they tend to be pretty expensive. Also, they have a morale system; when things are going good, morale stays high and your units fight normally. Face them against a flamethrower or other psycologically devastating weapon, and the squad will break, severely reducing its effectiveness. this is a great feature, and as far as I can tell one unique to the warhammer franchise.All in all, I strongly recommend this game. The campagn is rather short, however you'll find yourself having had too much fun to really care, and the multiplayer is an excellent addition. "

Pros:+ Solid storyline+ Bug-free+ Classic RTS Gameplay+ Clever use of flags+ This is our land now+ But do you have a flag?+ Great Multiplayer/matchmakingCons:- Game is a bit short; single-player campaign lasts roughly 20 hours- Only four playable races; later expansions add moreOverall: Warhammer 40k is a fantastic board game franchise, but it's very expensive.  This is a solid introduction to the world in a fun, entertaining package.  If you played this game in its heyday, you really don't need me to tell you it's great.  If you're new, then know that this game stands the test of time, and is still fun so many years later.  It nails the RTS genre, and still looks good.  It plays smoothly, and rewards clever gameplay and tactics.  The later expansions give more campaigns and more opportunities for multiplayer shenanigans, but this game started it all.Bottom Line: Worth playing and replaying, for old and new fans.  Familiarity with the Warhammer universe not required.			"

												Such a masterpiece, but don't buy it unless you do it for the story or for the multiplayer races.If you want a solid campaign and don't care about the story of the Blood Ravens, buy Dark Crusade.If you want to have a solid multiplayer experience, buy this for the multiplayer races and then get Soulstorm. (To play more factions in the multiplayer you need the previous games. For example, this game gives Space Marines, Eldar, Orks and Chaos. Winter Assault gives Imperial Guard. Dark Crusade adds Tau and Necrons and Soulstorm adds Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar. If you buy this game and Soulstorm you will be able to play Space Marines, Eldar, Orks and Chaos + Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar.).			"

												Be careful! Warhammer 40k Dawn of War - Game of the Year Edition doesn't include Winter Assault and any other expansions. GotY edition is kinda misleading here, since in most games it means that there is every DLC/expansion/add-on etc. included.Warhammer 40.000: Dawn of War was one of first games I owned on Steam. I remember when I bought it shortly after release (box edition) and for some reason I thought it would be cool to start somehow with Steam. And here I got it. Didn't spend then much time playing (just a few mission and skirmish) and I moved along to other games. Few days ago I wanted to recall how amazing first Dawn of War game is. Even after almost 10 years this strategy game looks amazing. It didn't get old at all. The main story maybe isn't the longer in strategy games (just 11 missions) but the harder difficulty level you play on, the more fun it is. There are much more skirmish maps, where you can play with much more players/ai and have even more fun. Not just as Space Marines, but also as Orks or Chaos Space Marines. If skirmish and story aren't enough for you, there is also multiplayer! It still have active community, so if you want a great strategy game for online purpose, I think Warhammer 40k Dawn of War is good choice too. Hardcore fans of Warhammer will probably happy with one more think - army painter.In my opinion, Warhammer 40.000: Dawn of War is one of these games that should be played by every gamer. And if you call yourself a fan of strategy games then you must play it.			"

												Played this game as a teenager and this always struck me as the epitome of a rts (even more so than starcraft). Your armies are massive, all units feel strong and nothing is useless, and the story (being a 40k player for years) is exactly what i wanted. The only issue i had witg it personally are some of the races tech trees are really big. Love this game. Its for 40k and rts fans, do yourself a favor and pick this up. 8/10			"

												A great real-time strategy game in a genre that is getting fewer and fewer new titles these days.  The graphics in the original game feel a little dated, but the expansions really upgrade the graphics and gameplay.  If you're a fan of the Warhammer franchise you will enjoy this game, but it is also a great introduction to the Warhammer universe if you're new to it.			"

												Decided to link my Dawn od War ""Platinum Edition"" with steam. I am disapointed that steam thinks its only the core Dawn of War ""Game of the year Edition"" as the Platinum Edition includes Winter Assault and Dark Crusade.. Also, steam makes you download the files even though you have a disc which is a faster install then over the internet. So be warned if you also own a Platinum Edition disc as steam wont recognize the game codes for Winter Assault and Dark Crusade provided with it... Asside from that game franchise recieves a 12 out of 10 for playability and replay.			"

												A decent tabletop to video game conversion. Age of Empires II attempted to use in-game dialogue to simulate real time discussions and events between people in RTS games, but Dawn of War manages to make it even more believeable with the closer camera and the more dynamic movements of the models. The story is riveting, suspensful and startling towards the end. Anyone who enjoys a futuristic crusade and a struggle between good and evil should certainly follow this chronicle. The add-on system of weapons, unit commanders and special attacks enhance the game play in a variety of ways. A menagerie of units is available to not only the Imperium, but the Orks and the Forces of Choas. The map design is very good and the structures are both impressive and fearsome sights. The voice over work is very theatrical and the cut scenes strongly resemble stage set pieces at times. The up close battles are especially well done. Swords, axes and electronic melee weapons all combine to spectacular effect. Dawn of War serves as proof that visualizing a table top game and taking time to develop solid game mechanics and credible army units can pay off.			"

Pros:+ Solid storyline+ Bug-free+ Classic RTS Gameplay+ Clever use of flags+ This is our land now+ But do you have a flag?+ Great Multiplayer/matchmakingCons:- Game is a bit short; single-player campaign lasts roughly 20 hours- Only four playable races; later expansions add moreOverall: Warhammer 40k is a fantastic board game franchise, but it's very expensive.  This is a solid introduction to the world in a fun, entertaining package.  If you played this game in its heyday, you really don't need me to tell you it's great.  If you're new, then know that this game stands the test of time, and is still fun so many years later.  It nails the RTS genre, and still looks good.  It plays smoothly, and rewards clever gameplay and tactics.  The later expansions give more campaigns and more opportunities for multiplayer shenanigans, but this game started it all.Bottom Line: Worth playing and replaying, for old and new fans.  Familiarity with the Warhammer universe not required.			"

If only they could fix the wide screen ""problem"".Thank you for reading  Yollk2 "

												After a couple of years I reinstalled the game via Steam. And still I find it very good even though the graphics cannot compete with todays standard. But the multiplayer is always good for intense battles. This game is not over complex it gives you easy access but at the same time it gets deep when it comes to upgrades and all the different units and peoples. Capture the flag to get resources makes the game dynamic. It definitely is a golden oldie and recommended for everyone who likes to play a strategic game. And the setting of the Warhammer universe is just great.			"

												A pretty epic RTS. Game-play is balanced (for the most part), introduction of squads and squad upgrades remove a lot of the micromanagement funk while still keeping tactical game-play intact.  All of the races are varied and have different play styles, and not one faction is similar to any other faction. Campaign is decent, but a bit repetitive at times, but still has some pretty memorable moments. Even though it's old, its still visually impressive, and battles are always very entertaining to watch. Great sound design and voice acting too. Like many other Warhammer 40k games, you don't need too much experience with the background in order to enjoy yourself. so if you like RTS games, there is no reason to not pick it up.			"

												The first game I played that immersed me into the absolutly brilliant Warhammer 40,000 universe. These games are great, with a great storyline, and awesome RTS gameplay. The series only got better as the games came out. The first game has the Space Marines, Orks, Eldar, and Chaos Space Marines, with you being able to play as the Space Marines in the Campaign. The first expansion, Winter Assault, which is paired with the first one, allows you to play as the other three, plus the new race, The Imperial Guard. All in all a great game and a great first expansion, to start a great series in Warhammer 40,000.			"

												Set the standard for all Warhammer games to come, and got a Game of the Year edition for a reason.  Voice Acting on par with Starfox 64 for quotability, and gameplay that makes it worth mentioning in broader RTS circles.  Relic's attention to detail fits the series extremely well and you can tell this product was made with a lot of love.  Make sure to check out the later DoW titles, which add even more races and campaigns with the same great gameplay.			"

												Having played this game since it came out, I can say that it's easily the best RTS game I've ever played. Each race is very well done, the voice work is amazing and the campaigns are really good (especially for the first game). Unlike Dawn of War 2, (which was heavily based on Company of Heroes) this game features base building and allows you to build larger armies to send against your enemies. The graphics are a little bit dated, but the gameplay is solid.			"

												This game is surely one of the best real-time strategies ever made. I never really been into WH40k, but this game made love this brutal, depressing universe.The campaign is really neat, as a leader of the Blood Ravens space marine chapter fighting through the planet of Tartarus which has quiet diverse maps, marshlands, cities, plains, mountains etc. The story is also enjoyable, it has some twists and good characters. The factions are really different, besides the Space Marines you get Orkz, Chaos Marines and the Eldar, but they're only available in multiplayer and skirmish.If you haven't tried DoW yet, now's the time, the gameplay is still fantastic and despite 11 years passed, the game still looks stunning.For the Emperor!

												Single Player- Even though the campaign missions felt long and drawn out I did enjoy the story behind it. This game was my introduction to the Warhammer universe and I must say I am impressed. Multiplayer- Best played in a private party of friends I must say. Rarely have I gone onto the online lobby and found more than three active games (if that). Solid RTS, one of the best I've ever played. I recommend getting this game alonside the rest of the expansions, not only do you get more campaigns to play but also unlocks a ton of more races to play as in skirmish and multiplayer modes. The only negative I have is the scroll distance. I like having a large field of view on the map and the game just does not let me scroll out far enough for my liking. Nothing mods can't fix however.			"

												A bit dissapointed that the base single player campaign only dealt with the Blood Ravens, but there was a sufficient number of missions, though I never found myself particularly invested in the story. It was a bit clunky to get squads to engage the way I'd envisioned but otherwise its systems were very interesting. As a Warhammer noobie I thought the units, buildings, and such were really cool and it left me wanting to learn more about the universe.			"

												Such a masterpiece, but don't buy it unless you do it for the story or for the multiplayer races.If you want a solid campaign and don't care about the story of the Blood Ravens, buy Dark Crusade.If you want to have a solid multiplayer experience, buy this for the multiplayer races and then get Soulstorm. (To play more factions in the multiplayer you need the previous games. For example, this game gives Space Marines, Eldar, Orks and Chaos. Winter Assault gives Imperial Guard. Dark Crusade adds Tau and Necrons and Soulstorm adds Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar. If you buy this game and Soulstorm you will be able to play Space Marines, Eldar, Orks and Chaos + Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar.).			"

												Worth buying! Entertaining animations, territory control as an actual game mechanic as opposed to a general principle, the expansions add new content but are also stand alone and more or less games in their own right, after you have the expansions the original still seems complete and balanced compared to the sequel DOW II which seems more cash grabesque, quite understandable considering warhammers origins as a tabletop but still; easy to learn but hard to master in the same vein as chess but with more explosions and retreating. That is another thing! Retreating is actually a valid tactic! Make a fallback position to heavy cover when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits fan, beware though that if you turtle in that fantastic invincible making cover your enemy squads can and will spec there squads out with flame throwers and explosives, The wargear mechanic means that while some units are still better than others for specific tasks you can generalize or specialize THOSE units as well! Tanks are scary. Chaos marines flinch easy, Orks splatter, Space marines drown, and Eldar eww.			"

												Short version? It's still great.Slightly longer version? I played this back in the day and it's still as fresh and fun as ever. You might hear some complaints that the graphics are dated but I disagree. The low poly count and bright textures just add to the feeling that you're playing with animated citadel minuatures. I remember the first time how fun it was to finally see all those wonderful models come to life and start killing each other:) That pleasure hasn't dulled as the animation and audio work is still great. Audio, the one thing that hasn't aged a day. The music is wonderfully atmospheric and fits the characters, the world and the story perfectly. The voice work puts a lot of modern games to shame and makes the relatively simple story really fun to follow.The mechanics of the game keep you on your toes and added an injection of action into the RTS genre. Some complaned it was RTS 'light' but it's simply another twist that helps broarden the genre. When you have hundreds of units all surging into a massive battle, leaving scars on the battlefield and bodies everywhere you're inner child will thank you for giving it a go. (and when you finally get your paws on a squad of Terminators i'd say it was worth every penny)If you have even a passing interest in the Warhammer universe then definately try it. If you enjoy RTS games from back in the day then give it a go. Even if you have a crappy laptop like myself then you can be pretty sure it'll work fine. (I also grabbed the expansions but haven't tried them yet, so I can't tell if they work fine yet)Peace and love			"

												Note: This game and it's numerous expansions track playtime differently, I have played more than this it is just divided amongst all the expansions which makes playtime harder to truly calculate. Dawn Of War is one of the best RTS games I've ever seen and is definitely worth the purchase and all of it's dlcs, at the time of writing they were all on sale for a combined price lower than 10 dollars, that is an absolute steal. In short, Dawn Of War is an RTS that contains:- 9 Incredibly unique factions ranging from the undead/robotic necron, who do not require requisitions but need to build massive amounts of power to sustain themselves to the legendary Warhammer Space Marines, the super soldiers who define the series with their powerful leadership units and decent unit composition making impossible fights slightly more possible (Though the expansions are needed for 5 of them, by default you get Orks, Chaos Marines, Space Marines, and Eldar though they are pretty unique and can in themselves offer hundreds of hours of gameplay).-Interesting game modes such as the standard destroy the enemy's base ranging to hold various points for a set amount of time or even just slay the enemy commander before yours falls. Plus, you can set more than one victory parameter for maximum gameplay and strategic influence. -Expansions that change the singleplayer experience (Soulstorm and Dark Crusade) to a map takeover in which all of the game's factions wage war and fight numerous matches attacking and defending territory with troops they earned throughout the campaign and even their fation specific commander his/herself.In the end, it is an amazing game well worth your time, though I do suggest getting the expansions as they make the already great game even better.

												Dawn of War is an excellent strategy game, and a must-have for fans of the Warhammer 40,000 franchise. The campaign is solid, the multiplayer and skirmish modes are excellent, and--barring Soulstorm--the expansions are top-notch. Sure, the voice-acting can be corny at times, but then that's part of the game's charm. It's by no means perfect. The AI sometimes has pathing issues, and on occasion there are times were the campaign makes odd choices with some of your units (such as putting the Whirlwind artillery tanks in the Cease Fire stance by default). And of course, there is the mess that is Soulstorm. Even so, I found the game immensely enjoyable for the most part, both as a fan of Warhammer 40k and as a fan of strategy games.			"

												I'm not a really big RTS fan anymore but I enjoy the 40K universe. Fun game with one of my favorite RTS resource systems. No focus on farming/mining, focus is purely on strategic control of the map. It creates a different dynamic emphasizing aggressive play. Also, these units can fire on the move, a point that used to frustrate me to no end playing Starcraft and Age of Empires 2 where a unit can only attack while stationary.			"

												A bit dissapointed that the base single player campaign only dealt with the Blood Ravens, but there was a sufficient number of missions, though I never found myself particularly invested in the story. It was a bit clunky to get squads to engage the way I'd envisioned but otherwise its systems were very interesting. As a Warhammer noobie I thought the units, buildings, and such were really cool and it left me wanting to learn more about the universe.			"

												A pretty epic RTS. Game-play is balanced (for the most part), introduction of squads and squad upgrades remove a lot of the micromanagement funk while still keeping tactical game-play intact.  All of the races are varied and have different play styles, and not one faction is similar to any other faction. Campaign is decent, but a bit repetitive at times, but still has some pretty memorable moments. Even though it's old, its still visually impressive, and battles are always very entertaining to watch. Great sound design and voice acting too. Like many other Warhammer 40k games, you don't need too much experience with the background in order to enjoy yourself. so if you like RTS games, there is no reason to not pick it up.			"

												In 41st Millennium there is only war...Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War was RTS game from the universe developed by Relic. Gameplay is large scale and epic with a mix between base building and managing units. There are two main resources: Power and requisition. Requisition is used to make buildings, units, upgrades. The same can also be said of power, which generates slower. To acquire these resources you need to capture points on the map and hold them. You can field a variety of units including infantry, land vehicles, heroes and super heavy unit. All units cost requisition to make. Upgrades are also available for purchase from buildings. You can upgrade squad with weapons or more members.There are two modes to play with: Campaign and skirmish. Campaign follows Captain Gabriel Angelos of the Blood Ravens chapter of space marines as he faces off against the orc horde. Unlike the latter entries to the series, the campaign is set into levels.  Each level of the campaign starts you off with a few units. Your goal is to build a base and then an army to accomplish various objectives. Such objectives are split between primary and secondary ones and involve either destroying a specific building or enemy unit. Completing all primary objectives will win the level, while secondary ones are optional. Skirmish mode has you face off against up to 7 players/bots in game modes such as annihilation and victory point capture. There are a total of 4 races available to play as including Eldar, Space marines, Orcs and Chaos. The other expansion packs (ie Dark Crusade, Winter Assault, Soulstorm) will allow you to select more races to play as and against, should you acquire them. Audio is excellent. The weapon sound effects feel as they should. Background music fits well with combat. Voice acting for campaign (as units) are well done.If you are looking for a good RTS game with lots of action or you are interested in the 40K universe, this is where to start. "

												An absolutely brilliant adaption of the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game to real-time strategy. Relic hits it out of the park in nailing the look and feel of Warhammer 40K, while providing for fluid real-time gameplay - including base building. There is suprising depth to the strategic elements of the game, and the sides are well balanced despite being very distinct. Most highly recommended. Dark Crusade and Soulstorm add even more fun and depth to the mix.			"

												This game is fun and relatively easy to learn... so long as you play one of the human factions (the Space Marines and Imperial Guard; Imperial Guard might be in one ""Winter Assault"" expansion, however). The only problem is the humans are only really capable of fighting either the Orc or ""Chaos Space Marine"" factions, which have similar fighting capabilities and play styles. One faction, the Eldar, have an annoying ability to jump around the map using ""web gates"" or ""web portals,"" showing up unexpectedly just about anywhere. If you are playing against the computer, it seems as if the AI knows when your own armies are away from your base, or jump amazing close to your base. This complicates matters because this game is something like ""capture the flag,"" rather than hanging out at your base being a ""soccer/football goalie,"" just defending your structures. To me, this doesn't seem quite fair. All in all, I'd rate this as 4 out of 5 Stars.			"

												This game takes what you love about the tabletop (action, strategy, troop management/movement, a killing Orks) and leaves what you don't (spending money). If you are a 40k fan, and also a gamer, there's no reason not to have this game.This is your typical RTS, that utilizes buildings that make infantry, other buildings that make vehicles, and gathering resources (although the resource gathering is much more simplified than in Age of Empires, or even Command and Conquer). Fairly intuitive, this game lets you hop right into the action. You can even ""paint"" your army and save a custom scheme in case you don't want to ruin the defaults for the different races.This game isn't as in depth as the tabletop as far as the disparity of units. For example, in this game, the Blood Angels have the exact infantry and vehicle choices as the ultramarines. And air vehicles are missing entirely. But still, well done, and true to the source material.I not only recommend this game, but I also bought it and gifted it to a friend so he could play with me. (In multiplayer mode. The campaign is completely single player.)			"

												Note to myself : rewrite this feedback later, it's unreadable. If you like RTS where your weakest unit can last longer than 1 second and tough units are mean to be tough (they'll last longer than 5 seconds even when things are really intenses, and will win a 1v20 against weak units), then this game is for you. Quite easy to start with (Game Tutorial for beginner), Dawn of War 1 is a classical ""build your base, create your army and crush your opponents"" game, where you can get both a high amount of units and ""Nokia"" units (yeah, you won't be able to take them down in less than 10 seconds unless you have enough dakka). The skirmish setting gives you the opportunity to choose between different victory condition (ex : annihilate the enemy, kill the enemy's leader, get enough ressources, ...). If you already played to a Blizzard RTS (Warcraft 3 or Starcraft), you'll discover a new way to get ressources : forget everything about harvesting ressources. Ressources increase automatically : build a Generator, and you'll get Energy over time (+10/sec for each generator, but you'll get 1 energy each 0.1 second). The more you build generator, the faster you'll get Energy (and they'll continue giving ressources, until you or your enemy destroy them). Thus you don't have to worry about ""units harvesting ressources"" or ""exhausting all the map ressources"" : just focus on the battle and use your ressources wisely. This game also has memorable ambient music (look out for «Blood Ravens Approach») and nice sync kills too, especially when a heavy unit ""crushes"" smaller units.Edit : Forgot to mention it, but effectiveness and ineffectiveness (between units) are really applied in this game (a sniper can easily one hit kill an infantry or deal 300 damages to a heavy infantry, but try it out on a building and you'll do less than 20 damages).

												Great, better than DOW 2 in my opinion; this has the classic base building and lore and was a masterpeice in its day. DOW2 is more a strategic RPG and lost a lot of the magic shown in its first installment. Still great even now; the character models still stand up well althought the terrain textures begin to look a little dated now. Path finding can be a bit hit and miss but the story's great especially with the exapansions. I hope if the developers ever do a sequel they go back to tthe RTS roots that this game pioneered			"

												so i went into this with little to no knowledge. the only knowledge i had was that i knew that there was a great game called warhammer 40,000 space marine and that the legendary heavy metal band bolt thrower used some covers of the diffrent adaptations of the board game for album cover's on there albums. now i dont care for rts that much but this is an exeption. this game is fun. weather u just want to relieve stress or play a mission before bedtime. i love this game and im glad i am starting to get a tiny tiny more bit of knowledge as i progress throughout the campaign! from my playing so far this gets a well deserved 9/10!

												Throwing off the burden of age is hard enough for most games we hold dear without choking on thier own legacy and exposing the flaws we once were willfully ignorant of. But not for this titan of a game which weaves the best mechanics from action and RTS games ensuring freshness combined with timeless fun. Leading the impressive, hulking Blood Ravens proves to be a thrilling experience which excercises a brain that often switches off thanks to overly simplistic modern games. Using the lore of 40K like a paintbrush benefits the game in every regard, the  strong character design of each race to the BRILLIANT voice acting, finishing off with a stimulating, richly composed soundtrack. Being a old school RTS player, the ripping out off micromanagement was a concern unfounded because finding myself as involved with the fates of my units rather then a multitude of speadsheets was a welcome break. Anyone looking fior a fun, enjoyable introduction to RTS, buy this game ASAP.			"

												This game is fun and relatively easy to learn... so long as you play one of the human factions (the Space Marines and Imperial Guard; Imperial Guard might be in one ""Winter Assault"" expansion, however). The only problem is the humans are only really capable of fighting either the Orc or ""Chaos Space Marine"" factions, which have similar fighting capabilities and play styles. One faction, the Eldar, have an annoying ability to jump around the map using ""web gates"" or ""web portals,"" showing up unexpectedly just about anywhere. If you are playing against the computer, it seems as if the AI knows when your own armies are away from your base, or jump amazing close to your base. This complicates matters because this game is something like ""capture the flag,"" rather than hanging out at your base being a ""soccer/football goalie,"" just defending your structures. To me, this doesn't seem quite fair. All in all, I'd rate this as 4 out of 5 Stars.			"

												D.O.W. 40k GOTY is the 1st RTS game that got me into the genre. These games are so amazing and the tutorials make it easily accessible with easy to follow instructions and info on how to command units  and supply resources. I also highly reccomend company of heroes 1 and 2 a WWII RTS. Another GAMES WORKSHOP thq developed game wich is highly acclaimed as one of the highest rated RTS's of all time! I love these  type of games as im am huge sci-fi and fantasy NERD and this has both. I have been so burnt out with the FPS and same old fantasy rpg story genre ""generic"" these last few years 12,13, that i decided to try out a different genre and im glad i did cause theres a lot of great games in this genre and warhammer 40k has a lot of them. Its not the best looking game but it is 7 years old now and i think it holds up well. the gameplay is still great and is what got me hooked on 40k and RTS games. its extremely fun and immersive i just love this universe and have already purchused some of the books.  I give D.O.W. GOTY edition a 9.25/10. for its time a great game!			"

												A pretty epic RTS. Game-play is balanced (for the most part), introduction of squads and squad upgrades remove a lot of the micromanagement funk while still keeping tactical game-play intact.  All of the races are varied and have different play styles, and not one faction is similar to any other faction. Campaign is decent, but a bit repetitive at times, but still has some pretty memorable moments. Even though it's old, its still visually impressive, and battles are always very entertaining to watch. Great sound design and voice acting too. Like many other Warhammer 40k games, you don't need too much experience with the background in order to enjoy yourself. so if you like RTS games, there is no reason to not pick it up.			"

												This is the one that started it all. Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, Soulstorm, it all started here. Even the original Company of Heroes, which was not just better than it's buggy, DLC-bait sequel, but a near-perfect example of an RTS game, was a direct evolution of Dawn of War.All 4 races are actually pretty well-balanced in multiplayer (better-balanced than the source material is nowdays!). The campaign story is great, and fits the Warhammer 40,000 lore perfectly, which makes it a good introduction, if a bit predictable for the already-initiated (if you went in knowing the lore, you knew X was manipulating Y against Z long before the main characters had a clue Z was involved).This came out right when I first started getting into the actual 40k tabletop game, and the original Rome: Total War followed soon after. My 10th-grade GPA could've been a full point higher, but on top of learning 40k and painting my first army, autumn of 2004 was an RTS golden age we will probably never see the like of again.Except here. Why are you still reading these? Go fight for the Emperor and learn to yell ""SINDRI!.""			"

												Fun RTS. The squad system with units is interesting how you can equip special weapons. The campaign was excellent with an interesting story and map design, music is fitting to the levels. Good tech tree progression.Didn't outstay its welcome, lasted a fine amount.One mission is bugged, I had the same issue with CD and DVD copies of the game, where you must use arty to kill a base to make your own base, you end up having to kill the base with some jetpack units which is kinda a hassle and you could screw up loosing then and have to restart the level, This is at the beginning of the level so it isn't a hassle if you restart but still.Difficulty wise, very easy. You set up defence in the campaign with 2 - 4 squads starting out then you slowly take over the points and then fortify the points then you steam roll enemy base.Overall, I will give it 7/10 an enjoyable RTS and worth your time. The W40k lore is interesting and kept me going playing the game, I wanted to learn what would happen next.More of a unit based RTS with basebuilding included but not the main point of the game.			"

												Fun! In a very wierd way....Ths really captures my eye in terms of warhammer games, simply because of the scale of it. On a small map with hundreds of troops absolutely smashing each other, with carnage, death and destruction. The campaign can be a bit unfair at times, but I feel like that adds to how it brings across the ""War is hell"" feel, even if it is really entertaining to watch loads of tiny gretchens being slaughtered. Some of the time the camera controls can be frustrating. I found myself flying past the troop I wanted to look at at 100 miles an hour, and the camera ould glitch a bit at certain time. Objects in the scenery frequently got in the way of the camera, even when zoomed in fully, and character animations and graphics are pretty janky. (I can forgive that though, this game came out in what, 2005?) Some of the time the animations can be pure eye candy, especially with the Imperial Gaurd's machine factory. Overall this game falls a bit short in some aspects such as controls, but this is really a very small problem. This is a great FUN/10 game, but also has it's much more serious notes in brief, getting straight back to the tactical fighting and troop planning.  8/10.			"

												I'm not a huge RTS fan (that is to say, I like 'em, but I suck at 'em, :-), but I really liked some of the things they did in this game to enhance tactical gameplay (as opposed to just  the 'BUILD ALL THE THINGS, KILL ALL THE THINGS!' approach used in  AoEII and other games. Units come in squads, you can resupply squads in the field, units shoot without you having to tell them to shoot, capture points, attaching heroes and healers to squads, upgrading. This all made it feel different and exciting and also very much like a Warhammer 40k game (Not a big 40k fan, but WH Fantasy fan, definitely).The story is♥♥♥♥♥♥ the voice acting atrocious, but the gameplay makes up for that. I do have to say I only played the singleplayer campaign (I'm not really into skirmishes and definitely no MP).

No focus on farming/mining, focus is purely on strategic control of the map. It creates a different dynamic emphasizing aggressive play. Also, these units can fire on the move, a point that used to frustrate me to no end playing Starcraft and Age of Empires 2 where a unit can only attack while stationary.			"

												A bit dissapointed that the base single player campaign only dealt with the Blood Ravens, but there was a sufficient number of missions, though I never found myself particularly invested in the story. It was a bit clunky to get squads to engage the way I'd envisioned but otherwise its systems were very interesting. As a Warhammer noobie I thought the units, buildings, and such were really cool and it left me wanting to learn more about the universe.			"

												This game is fun and relatively easy to learn... so long as you play one of the human factions (the Space Marines and Imperial Guard; Imperial Guard might be in one ""Winter Assault"" expansion, however). The only problem is the humans are only really capable of fighting either the Orc or ""Chaos Space Marine"" factions, which have similar fighting capabilities and play styles. One faction, the Eldar, have an annoying ability to jump around the map using ""web gates"" or ""web portals,"" showing up unexpectedly just about anywhere. If you are playing against the computer, it seems as if the AI knows when your own armies are away from your base, or jump amazing close to your base. This complicates matters because this game is something like ""capture the flag,"" rather than hanging out at your base being a ""soccer/football goalie,"" just defending your structures. To me, this doesn't seem quite fair. All in all, I'd rate this as 4 out of 5 Stars.			"

It seems be one of those systems that is easy to pick up and satisfying to master. If you enjoy RTS in any capasity, you owe it to yourself to pick this game up.			"

												Throwing off the burden of age is hard enough for most games we hold dear without choking on thier own legacy and exposing the flaws we once were willfully ignorant of. But not for this titan of a game which weaves the best mechanics from action and RTS games ensuring freshness combined with timeless fun. Leading the impressive, hulking Blood Ravens proves to be a thrilling experience which excercises a brain that often switches off thanks to overly simplistic modern games. Using the lore of 40K like a paintbrush benefits the game in every regard, the  strong character design of each race to the BRILLIANT voice acting, finishing off with a stimulating, richly composed soundtrack. Being a old school RTS player, the ripping out off micromanagement was a concern unfounded because finding myself as involved with the fates of my units rather then a multitude of speadsheets was a welcome break. Anyone looking fior a fun, enjoyable introduction to RTS, buy this game ASAP.			"

												Note to myself : rewrite this feedback later, it's unreadable. If you like RTS where your weakest unit can last longer than 1 second and tough units are mean to be tough (they'll last longer than 5 seconds even when things are really intenses, and will win a 1v20 against weak units), then this game is for you. Quite easy to start with (Game Tutorial for beginner), Dawn of War 1 is a classical ""build your base, create your army and crush your opponents"" game, where you can get both a high amount of units and ""Nokia"" units (yeah, you won't be able to take them down in less than 10 seconds unless you have enough dakka). The skirmish setting gives you the opportunity to choose between different victory condition (ex : annihilate the enemy, kill the enemy's leader, get enough ressources, ...). If you already played to a Blizzard RTS (Warcraft 3 or Starcraft), you'll discover a new way to get ressources : forget everything about harvesting ressources. Ressources increase automatically : build a Generator, and you'll get Energy over time (+10/sec for each generator, but you'll get 1 energy each 0.1 second). The more you build generator, the faster you'll get Energy (and they'll continue giving ressources, until you or your enemy destroy them). Thus you don't have to worry about ""units harvesting ressources"" or ""exhausting all the map ressources"" : just focus on the battle and use your ressources wisely. This game also has memorable ambient music (look out for «Blood Ravens Approach») and nice sync kills too, especially when a heavy unit ""crushes"" smaller units.Edit : Forgot to mention it, but effectiveness and ineffectiveness (between units) are really applied in this game (a sniper can easily one hit kill an infantry or deal 300 damages to a heavy infantry, but try it out on a building and you'll do less than 20 damages).

Even for a game that's kicking down the door on a decade worth of age, it still looks decent enough, and plays very well.Outside of that, the single player campaign provides an interesting backstory, though I honestly don't know enough about 40k lore to be able to pick up on whether everyone is canon, or if there's some weirdness involved.

												After a couple of years I reinstalled the game via Steam. And still I find it very good even though the graphics cannot compete with todays standard. But the multiplayer is always good for intense battles. This game is not over complex it gives you easy access but at the same time it gets deep when it comes to upgrades and all the different units and peoples. Capture the flag to get resources makes the game dynamic. It definitely is a golden oldie and recommended for everyone who likes to play a strategic game. And the setting of the Warhammer universe is just great.			"

Pros:+ Solid storyline+ Bug-free+ Classic RTS Gameplay+ Clever use of flags+ This is our land now+ But do you have a flag?+ Great Multiplayer/matchmakingCons:- Game is a bit short; single-player campaign lasts roughly 20 hours- Only four playable races; later expansions add moreOverall: Warhammer 40k is a fantastic board game franchise, but it's very expensive.  This is a solid introduction to the world in a fun, entertaining package.  If you played this game in its heyday, you really don't need me to tell you it's great.  If you're new, then know that this game stands the test of time, and is still fun so many years later.  It nails the RTS genre, and still looks good.  It plays smoothly, and rewards clever gameplay and tactics.  The later expansions give more campaigns and more opportunities for multiplayer shenanigans, but this game started it all.Bottom Line: Worth playing and replaying, for old and new fans.  Familiarity with the Warhammer universe not required.			"

												A decent tabletop to video game conversion. Age of Empires II attempted to use in-game dialogue to simulate real time discussions and events between people in RTS games, but Dawn of War manages to make it even more believeable with the closer camera and the more dynamic movements of the models. The story is riveting, suspensful and startling towards the end. Anyone who enjoys a futuristic crusade and a struggle between good and evil should certainly follow this chronicle. The add-on system of weapons, unit commanders and special attacks enhance the game play in a variety of ways. A menagerie of units is available to not only the Imperium, but the Orks and the Forces of Choas. The map design is very good and the structures are both impressive and fearsome sights. The voice over work is very theatrical and the cut scenes strongly resemble stage set pieces at times. The up close battles are especially well done. Swords, axes and electronic melee weapons all combine to spectacular effect. Dawn of War serves as proof that visualizing a table top game and taking time to develop solid game mechanics and credible army units can pay off.			"

												This game is surely one of the best real-time strategies ever made. I never really been into WH40k, but this game made love this brutal, depressing universe.The campaign is really neat, as a leader of the Blood Ravens space marine chapter fighting through the planet of Tartarus which has quiet diverse maps, marshlands, cities, plains, mountains etc. The story is also enjoyable, it has some twists and good characters. The factions are really different, besides the Space Marines you get Orkz, Chaos Marines and the Eldar, but they're only available in multiplayer and skirmish.If you haven't tried DoW yet, now's the time, the gameplay is still fantastic and despite 11 years passed, the game still looks stunning.For the Emperor!

												This game and it's subsequent expansions are my favorite set of strategy games that I have ever played. I have enjoyed this series since it's original release on PC when I was a kid and still do to this day. The combat is intense and the difficulty is taxing at the very least. This series is a wonderful way to introduce yourself to the world of Warhammer 40,000 without having to shell out hundreds or even thousands of dollars buying miniatures of the tabletop version. 11/10.

												This is the first RTS I have played in several years, and the first Warhammer game I have ever played. After finishing the campaign in 14 hours and playing a bit of team based multiplayer with a few of my friends I have come to the conclusion that this game is at least a 9/10 The Warhammer 40k world is a richly expansive universe of the same quality as other such giants in the industry such as Starcraft and Warcraft. All characters are loveable, interesting, and at least memorable. Running into battle with a group of fully upgraded space marines against an opposing force is uplifting as it is intense and exciting. I tend to prefer RPG's and tactical shooters, but Dawn of War is a game that everyone should play at least once. As I can honestly say that after finishing the campaign mode I am now obsessed with the universe and have been doing everything in my power to learn more about it. Do yourself a favor and purchase this gorgeous gem of a game.			"

												10/10 would purge again. but this is a good game, campain was great, all 5 factions were involved, even if the imperial guard did not do much they put them in there and it did not feel forced at all. all factions progress different and i would not say any have a definent strength. for example all factions have good ranged,melee and vehicles even if some have more good ones in one category they are pretty much even.i think this is a good thing because you do not know what to expect, for example if one side had great melee infantary then you could use alot of anti-infantary stuff, so i think that that was great. i will not spoil the campaign but it was great my only complaint being i found a bug in the last mission where the boss was stuck on a squad dof tactical marines, it ment i had him in the same spot under my sight for most of the game until i got terminators and killed him.overall good game, army painter was fun and added some personality to the skirmish mode for me.

												An overall solid RTS that blends the building management, unique factions, and interface of War Craft with the company structures of Kohan. The story for the campaign is also very solid. Even if you aren't thoroughly familiar with the 40k universe (I'm not), it is easy enough to grasp, relying on familiar tropes and simply gift wrapping them with the flavor of the setting. Though you should be warned that it is certainly a product of its time as the hotkey layout is not user friendly (and at the time of this writing the manual doesn't even work). It is also possible that it is not fully compatible with modern operating systems. Several times while playing the screen would get stuck scrolling and the only way to stop it would be to click the minimap. Above all the pathfinding AI is pretty horrible. Units will often stop outside of combat or try to spread out as much as possible with undesired consequences.			"

												I played Company of Heroes before I started Dawn of War, and I absolutely love both games. Disregarding the several very awesome standalone expansions to Dawn of War, I have to say the original is ♥♥♥♥ing kickass. When I first picked it up, I played it for the classic skirmish option, and set up my own custom games against the AI so I could have massive battles within this awesome universe. But when I really got sucked into this game was when I fired up the campaign with the nice little story, for an RTS game, and the varied missions that escalated the scale and availability of troops as I progressed. If you like RTS games, then Dawn of War is a must-buy. And I would even recommend it to those who've never played an RTS game before because it's very accessible given the less complicated base-building and resource system (no gatherer units, you just build energy generators with workers and capture points with infantry). I often have a difficult time playing the likes of Age of Empires and other games of a similar vein because I'm too lazy to manage everything economy after playing this game.			"

												I'm not even sure what to say about this other than this game is a lot of fun.Before playing this I wasn't really a huge fan or player of strategy games. The only other RTS I play is CoH, but even that hasn't been able to give me as much fun as this game.It's easy to get into and understand. The tutorial teaches you the basics, and the campaign slowly eases you into the game allowing you to quickly get a handle on what to do and leaving it up to you on how to go about completing the objectives.I think this game is very good to get into if you are new to the RTS genre. The satisfaction of crushing your enemy with an iron fist, missile launchers, plasma weapons, tanks, and more is borderline addictive. If you're reading this and wondering if you should get this game then go ahead and buy it. I don't think you'll regret it.Although you will have to use a mod for widescreen (16:9) support, it still looks great and plays like a dream. Not bad for a going on decade old game :D			"

												Stands alone in the RTS world for one reason. I have not played another RTS yet that has as satisfying visual depictions of crossing fields of tracer fire from scores of units. Seeing clouds of plasma shot, heavy bolter rounds, and missiles cross the battlefield, along with the excellent SFX and soaring music score, makes this worth playing again and again.9/10 "

												Pros: +Persistent bodies adds to GRIMDARK+You don't play as Ultramarines+A black Inquisitor who's not a complete maniac+Brilliant voice acting for an RTS+Sindri's voice is like butter. Manly butter.+Gameplay stands on its own (these are the guys who made Homeworld and Company of Heroes)+Orks are hilarious+Army painter+Guardsmen are usefulCons:-Kindergarten level AI-Bolters sound like regular guns-You can't actually play as Guardsmen (get Winter Assault)-Tutorial sounds like one of those books-on-tape your grandmother listens to in the carOverall 8.5/10			"

												A pretty epic RTS. Game-play is balanced (for the most part), introduction of squads and squad upgrades remove a lot of the micromanagement funk while still keeping tactical game-play intact.  All of the races are varied and have different play styles, and not one faction is similar to any other faction. Campaign is decent, but a bit repetitive at times, but still has some pretty memorable moments. Even though it's old, its still visually impressive, and battles are always very entertaining to watch. Great sound design and voice acting too. Like many other Warhammer 40k games, you don't need too much experience with the background in order to enjoy yourself. so if you like RTS games, there is no reason to not pick it up.			"

												First of the Dawn of War games, a good start for a video game adaptation of the table-top Warhammer 40k franchise. Play in single player campaign as the mighty Blood Ravens 3rd Company under the command of Captain Gabriel Angelos to spread the Emperor's fury and vengeance against all xenos, mutants and heretics alike. Top-down RTS with base-building, infantry and vehicles; Dawn of War will happily chew up some spare hours set aside for gaming. ****			"

												The beta period for Dawn of War was one of my favorite gaming experiences ever. Believe it or not, there was a pretty long period of time where the general tone of gamers online wasn't overtly negative and troll-ish, and the whole beta was filled with fantastic players who were down to play this new and exciting entry into the RTS lexicon.That being said, Dawn of War has certainly aged strangely. Since it has been out for nearly twelve years at this point, its kind of a funky game. Video games have grown up and changed a lot since this was new, but that doesn't really detract very much from the overall experience. Widescreen doesn't really work and isn't worth trying to get to work, as a sidenote.The core gameplay is based more around controlling squads of units than building a base. There are still resource nodes to grab on the map, and you still need to be mindful of the tech tree and working towards better units, but most of the game is army and unit based. Each of the races in the game sort of play similarly, with similar ideas, although some asymmetrical aspects are present. The core design is still fun years later, and games versus the AI can be hectic. If you have a buddy who is down to do some 2vAI games, and you don't mind clunky early 2000's interfaces, you'll get some good mileage out of this. The campaign is totally forgettable and only features one race, though. Online seemed to be a ghost town when I tried it out, but that also might be a side effect of the confusing naming of the first Dawn of War game + expansions.You see, the GOTY edition doesn't contain everything, strangely enough. You're still missing the expansions. If you want the complete experience, you'll have to look elsewhere and get the Platinum edition. I got this through a bundle, so I'm not too miffed, but the naming is confusing.Overall, this was a good bit of time for some nostalgia. I had a blast playing a couple of maps and doing most of the campaign, but there isn't much staying power here if you're not a returning player. You might find the design a bit flawed overall, and there are later Dawn of War games that improved on the formula this game established.			"

Kinda classic RTS game, but with some twists like squad based controls rather than per unit and a lot of upgrades for the units.Great: -Manly voice acting and character models. Daayuum.-Brutal death animations.-Pretty easy to understand gameplay.Bad:-Campaign is short.-I wish I could micro the units better.-Technical issues. Videos were lagging if vsync was disabled. -Outdated resolution support. Gimme dat FULL HD support.Highlights were for sure the death animations and the manly voice acting. 7/10. Alright intro to the series I suppose. I started with Winter Assault next and it seems to be a bit more creative with the campaign.			"

												Dawn of War is an RTS or real time strategy, where you can play the campaign as Gabriel Angelos leading the Blood Angels 3rd company of space marines or engage in multiplayer fight or skirmishes against computer controlled enemies. You can chose from a large number of different factions if you have all of the expansions (you would need to launch soulstorm to use all of the expansions content regarding factions in multiplayer). All in all it is a good strategy game with the Warhammer 40k setting.			"

												This strategy game is fairly good for its age (12 years now as for 2016!).The player can play campaign or skirmish. In campaign mode we have 11 missions connected by some pretty average story. Missions are solid for a scripted campaign, although the enemy is just standing there most of the times. Oh yes, the race is Space Marines Blood Ravens chapter if it means anything.When it comes to skirmish we have four races in the base game:- Space Marines- Chaos - Orks- EldarsThe main point of the game, besides destroying enemies that is, is obtaining and keeping requisition points that provide well, requisition points needed to build units and buildings. Be prepared to fight fiercely for those points as it is easy to lose them but it takes a bit too long to re-obtain them.Pros:- 40k mood- pace is fine by me- music is ok- vehicles are really powerfulCons:- infantry battles are a bit too long - what are those bolter loaded with, peebles?- playing tag when it comes to requisition points- graphics are pretty rough around the edges now- most units are slowOverall I've found this game amusing. Campaign mode was fun, though a bit weak on the plot side (Bale & Sindri seemed like Flip & Flap sometimes). I didn't played many skirmishes really, so I can't tell whether this option is good or not. Dawn of War is fun if you like 40k franchise. If not then there are some better RTS games out there.---------- For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ "

												I bought this game on sale and started playing it for nostalgia sake and I am glad I did, I played it when it first came out and remembered really enjoying it.  Now that I played it again I have to say it still stands the test of time.  Definitely one of my favorite RTS games.Heavy in resource management and base building, something I think was sorely missing from the second one. The graphics are dated and you have to download a patch in order to play it widescreen.

												One of the best strategy games ive personally played, most of my hours took place on the disk version of this game, however between its combat system and the army design, it makes each faction feel different while always making strategy and each engagement feel like it makes a difference. It has a good storyline if you decide to play the campaign and it will continue to have you coming back for more, if you really enjoy this, I recommend picking up the expansions and the ultimate apocalypse mod as it will expand the game to the level of the battles that the tabletop version tries to simulate. 10/10			"

												Damn I love this game ! Having played the Warhammer FPS a few years ago I was attracted to this after playing another Relic game the Company of Heroes series. I've never played the Warhammer table top game but I've at least been in a Games Workshop shop and briefly toyed with board and dice role playing games many years ago. I would guess that some of the developers have played table top RPG's before as some of the kind of humour in that world comes across in this game. I would highly recommend this over Dawn of War 2 as the second game just does not have the same attention to detail, art and graphic design direction that this game has. But DAW2 is a very different game. Here we have Relics calssic attention to detail. The animations and voice acting are incredibly endearing just as we would see a few years later in the first Company of Heroes game. The map design is also solid and believable, where, again, in the second game map objects have been placed badly and you don't feel like your're in a real place.  The sound is also very good. I was listening to a tank firing and it sounded impressive with the shell whooshing off and then a huge explosion as it detonated echoeing off into the map. Sadly that is just not there in DAW 2 although Relic would go on to get it right again in COH2. So well recommended. An excellent diversion and just a very good game.			"

												I'm not a big fan of strategy games, but I was always curious about the Warhammer 40k lore and boy I got really suprised by this game! While this version is pretty much standard compared with the expansions, this game is a really great start to beginners to either the lore or the games. However, this game has also some problems that maybe were fixed in the later games. I loved playing as a Space Marine, Chaos Space Marine and Orks. What about the Eldar? I hate them.- Great animations for every character. EVERY. CHARACTER. Even the fights are fantastic.- Pretty nice story in the main campaign.- Interesting and nice camera angles during the game.- Just 3 main races makes the game a little bit short, knowing the full lore of the franchise.- Some bugs like for example: Soldiers not moving and getting stuck in places and after a while they move.- Some of the vehicles that can transport can only take one squad, which is not really helpful in my own opinion...And to finish this review: I really hate the eldar in this game.

												A decent tabletop to video game conversion. Age of Empires II attempted to use in-game dialogue to simulate real time discussions and events between people in RTS games, but Dawn of War manages to make it even more believeable with the closer camera and the more dynamic movements of the models. The story is riveting, suspensful and startling towards the end. Anyone who enjoys a futuristic crusade and a struggle between good and evil should certainly follow this chronicle. The add-on system of weapons, unit commanders and special attacks enhance the game play in a variety of ways. A menagerie of units is available to not only the Imperium, but the Orks and the Forces of Choas. The map design is very good and the structures are both impressive and fearsome sights. The voice over work is very theatrical and the cut scenes strongly resemble stage set pieces at times. The up close battles are especially well done. Swords, axes and electronic melee weapons all combine to spectacular effect. Dawn of War serves as proof that visualizing a table top game and taking time to develop solid game mechanics and credible army units can pay off.			"

												The Gold Edition of Dawn of War was one of the first M-rated games I bought as a teenager, and I always had fond memories of it because it catered to my personal favorite combat strategy: turtling. Nine years later, those feelings are still going strong.For the uninitiated, turtling is the notion of erecting a stiff defensive perimeter, absorbing enemy attacks while establishing one's own economy, then lashing out with the full fury of one's tech tree and crushing the enemy in a swift show of force. Dawn of War's most effective strategy is what I like to call ""Turbo Turtle"" because of its resource mechanics. Unlike most games which require players to harvest resources from the game world in something of a parallel operation to the military stuff, the two mix together in the form of requisition, gained automatically from capturing various points around the map. This system keeps the game moving because no resource infrastructure is required to build infantry units. Just take a squad or two, capture some points, and you're off and rolling. These points can even have fortifications built on them, keepinig enemies at bay long enough for a force away from the flashpoint to react and engage and allowing the player to hold large swathes of territory (and resources) without desperately trying to get every detail just so to prevent exploits in the defense. (The other resource, power, is produced entirely within the tech tree with bonus areas available on most maps, meaning any shortage is usually self-created.) This keeps the game moving at a reasonable pace and prevents players from turtling for 20-30 minutes while advancing to the next tech level like one might in other RTS titles. This simplified approach keeps the focus on combat and battle tactics rather than letting resource gathering linger in the back of the player's mind.The game also doesn't have players building infantry units piecemeal; instead, infantry come in squads which can be expanded and outfitted with heavy weaponry. The Space Marines - the sole faction the player uses in the campaign - have such powerful infantry that most early missions and even skirmish games can be won with 4-5 decked out squads of their mainline infantry, and the squad as the base unit can result in infantry combat on a massive scale at the climax of a battle. Five full squads of Space Marines puts 45 units under the player's control; mainline infantry for the other races churns out even more individuals, and it's all commanded at the squad level, so, again, no micromanagement.The visuals were quite good for the time, although they haven't held up very well in the nine years since the game's original release. The upside to this is a lack of lag or chug on most modern PCs, even when the battles reach their most frenzied. There are fewer positives to be found with the story (quite dull and rather predictable) and the sound design (the voice acting is downright painful at times), but playing an RTS for the story is like eating a cheeseburger for the pickles; it's nice to have the extra flavor, but it's not really why you bought the burger.Relic hit a home run with this game. Not only did they capture the essence of Warhammer 40,000 and its lore, they also made it something players new to 40k will be interested in and enjoy without getting bogged down in trying to bring 40k's rules to a video game, something other GW-inspired titles (read: Blood Bowl) could stand to learn from. Fun is the most important element of any game, and Dawn of War provides plenty of it. For the Emprah!			"

												In some ways, Dawn of War hasn't aged all that well. It feels like I'm playing a game on low settings even with everything maxed out, and there's certain UI elements that are missing or hidden, such as hotkeys or a squad tab.But it's important to remember this is a ten year old game; look past the creaking joints, and at the core is still one of the finest 40K games ever made.The core gameplay remains solid and enjoyable, and the campaign is as satisfying as I remember. The plot is solid, with twists and turns as four factions vie for control of the world, and while the narrative plays its hand a bit too early with some of the big twists, it's not enough to spoil the impact.Dawn of War; come for the nostalgia, stay for an RTS experience that's as enjoyable today as it ever was.

												Being a first time RTS player and new, yet deeply interested in the Warhammer franchise after playing Space Marine I decided to grab this game off the Summer Sale and give it a go. I'm mainly gonna focus on the single player aspect of the game as I have yet to get into a multiplayer match (it's quite dead). However, I can say for certain that this game is very fun and enjoyable. It was easy to pick up and get into, the vehicles were fun to mess around with, and building up a large army to use it in a massive assault against the enemy's bases was incredibly satisfying, even if it was just vs AI. The story didn't do much to grip you in the beginng, but later it became quite interesting, maybe a quater of the way through. All in all, highly enjoyable and would recommend to anyone.			"

												An overall solid RTS that blends the building management, unique factions, and interface of War Craft with the company structures of Kohan. The story for the campaign is also very solid. Even if you aren't thoroughly familiar with the 40k universe (I'm not), it is easy enough to grasp, relying on familiar tropes and simply gift wrapping them with the flavor of the setting. Though you should be warned that it is certainly a product of its time as the hotkey layout is not user friendly (and at the time of this writing the manual doesn't even work). It is also possible that it is not fully compatible with modern operating systems. Several times while playing the screen would get stuck scrolling and the only way to stop it would be to click the minimap. Above all the pathfinding AI is pretty horrible. Units will often stop outside of combat or try to spread out as much as possible with undesired consequences.			"

												Greetings!I make it no secret that the Dawn of War series is my favorite RTS (one could argue the later ones are more rpg) series, StarCraft coming close second and followed by the Command & Conquer.  …I think I just named all the big RTS series out there to begin with so that may have just been mute.  Regardless, it’s a great game though struggles to remain relevant due to some quality of life and less than stellar story.Respect Your Elders:  I really enjoy this game and it shows an amazing stepping stone from early RPGs, yes I’ll easily admit it doesn’t hold up as well as I’d like.  The bare game (without mods) is from a previous generation in both graphics and functionality.  It has most of the quality of life components you’d expect:  Shift Clicking, Queuing Orders, etc but lacks a lot of the expected polish, especially in the realm of pathing.  In many ways this game was the cornerstone of future amazing RTSs.Some Assembly Required:  The game really needs certain mods installed to work correctly, specifically the zoom out mod and the higher screen resolution mod (both of which can be easily found via google) but once these are installed the game runs just as well and is just as fun that I remember.  Another thing that adds to this game (including the rest of the series) is a massive quantity of mods provided by the community, from Grey Knights to Tyranids and new campaigns you can find it all.  Though not as numerous as games like Fallout there is much here to provide years of content.I’m not here to tell you a story:  To be fair the story isn’t all that amazing, it’s more of the cliché ‘kill the enemies attacking you only to find that other enemies are there as well but oh! I got backstabbed by my best friend’ kind of story and the book isn’t terribly better either.  With that said, it does get the job done and is more or less on par with a lot of other RTS games out there.  It doesn’t hold a candle to the story in DOW2 or SC (period) but it is enjoyable and begins a long narrative for the sequel to expand on.Overall, this game is highly recommended, though it may not hold up to modern standards I greatly enjoy the game and feel that it continues to live up to and (with mods) keeps pace with the modern RTSs out there.  I’d argue it is one of the greats and a game that I constantly go back to every year or so.  Highly recommend this game. "

												This game was my first game in the Warhammer40k franchise and I was astonished how well made this game is.The game story is nothing particularly interesting (planetary invasion, fight everyone in the name of the emperor) but is quite long, 8 hours+-. The real fun begin in the multiplayer division with 4 unique army to command: Space Marine which you use in the campaign, Chaos similar to the space marine but with demon and more stealthy, Eldar the weakest in direct combat but have teleport useful for guerilla tactic, and Ork with their WAAAGH resource which interesting and made for pure carnage whith 100+ ork on the field. If you can, grab the expansion packs they are very well worth it because:-4 new campaign and 1 new army, Imperial Guard in Winter Assault-a Total War similar campaign mode and 2 new army Tau Empire and Necron in Dark Crusade-basicly identical to Dark Crusade but with 2 new army Sister of Battle and Dark Eldar; but f..k that you pick soulstorm for the ultimate apocalypse mod and wreck every one with a bazilion new unit and army			"

												I just beat this game and its expansion Choas Rising. For some reason in my Steam account they made the games seperate but also one game if you choose in game. I don't understand that. However, I did beat both of them and I think I can honestly recommend it. First of all, you need to go into this game knowing that is it not like how Dawn of War was. That game was more of a Commmand and Conquer style RTS with a swap out of for their stuff. Whiched I absolutely loved. I loved how bloody the battfields got and how gruesome the fights got. I still need to replay them now that I got them on Steam. This game plays nothing like the original and it focuses on how the group as individuals rather than as a massive body counts in the originals. At first, I absolutley hated this idea and I didn't play it. I got bored and decided to play them as thier own game. Eventually, I felt stupid it was to hate this game for not being like the original. Mainly because this game is awesome to play and customize your characters. Chaos Rising is a shorter game but it is nice that you can use your old save for a new game. Plus, you get to use all your old gear. I had a lot of fun playing it and by this time I got so used to the new play style that I could really appreciate this for what it is. I would recoommend it to people that love Warhammer 40K and the lore around it. Blood Ravens are one of my favorite chapters and to play a game with them in it like this was awesome.			"

												To start: I used to add a much longer header to these reviews, but since it often made the reviews too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery.Gameplay: One thing that's very difficult not to do when talking about any base-building RTS, let alone a military Sci-Fi RTS, is to not compare it to Starcraft, especially considering the influence that the Warhammer 40k world present in Starcraft. After all, there's a race of humans kinda like the Terrans, there's an alien race like the Protoss, and while not present in this game, there is a race similar to the Zerg. Also much like Starcraft, the gameplay is centered around building bases.The differences come in, as you might expect, with the gameplay. While this is something of a personal taste, I really do quite like how resources are handled in this game. Your two basic resources are Requisition (kinda like Minerals) and Power (kinda like Vespene). You gain requisition from controlling Strategic Points on the map. It is also from these Strategic Points that you build your base, from which you can build in a radius that expands up to a certain point. Unlike Starcraft, you gain resources at a set rate per minute, which is slow enough to require you to think about what you wanna build, as opposed to spamming harvesters all day. Power is gained from building generators, and much like Requisition, is gained at a set rate per minute. There are also Slag Deposits on some maps, which you can capture and build a special generator on, allowing a bit more strategy with your expansion.Units are produced in squads, and vehicles have their own unit cap outside of the squad unit cap. With some research, you can increase your squad cap to 20, and your vehicle cap to 10. While this doesn't sound like much, keep in mind that each squad can have up to ten people in it, reaching Starcraft's famous 200 unit limit very easily, and surpassing it with vehicle count. I do wish that your construction units didn't count as one squad, which can be especially obnoxious as there is no way of recalling your construction units other than sending them out to maybe punch the enemy's base or something.While the game doesn't necessarily have as many units as Starcraft, the matter of unit composition is largely handled by equipment. Your basic squad can be outfitted with four different special weapons, of which each squad can have up to four specially equipped members. Another aspect to this game is its Morale system, in which you can use particularly gruesome attacks to break apart squads, leaving them easy for the pickings as well as discouraging some easy rushes from time to time. The single player campaign is somewhat disappointing, as it only features the Space Marines. I'll talk more about the story later, but for now know that there aren't Eldar, Ork or Chaos Marine campaigns (Eldar being the kinda-Protoss race and Necron being the unlisted kinda-Zerg race). There are apparently campaigns in the expansions, but since I haven't played them yet, I can't speak for them.Now, we come to the important question: how fun is the game? This was my first ""legit"" introduction to the Real-Time Strategy genre, and I gotta say; I picked a damn good game to start out with. The gameplay is very streamlined, there's usually a great bit of action going on at any one time, and the mechanics are simple enough on the surface while still having a good bit of depth to it for people to play for quite some time. If you're looking for an RTS to get someone's feet wet with, I can very easily recommend this one over Starcraft (although Starcraft may take a bit of weening into) for first timers to the genre. Simple on the surface, deep underneath, very streamlined and just overall a hell of a lot of fun to play. 9/10.Story: Since the completion of this game, I've gone on and read some more of the Warhammer 40k lore, and I've gotta be honest; the campaign doesn't do the series justice. The content is kinda neat, and the Orks are still fun to watch bumble about, but for the Space Marines, this game doesn't do very good in showcasing just how grand their empire is. It feels kinda... fanfic-y, in a not so great way. They try to do some intrigue, but it just doesn't work, and the cliffhanger at the end is, to be quite frank, inexcusable. While the dialogue and writing in-game is good, the actual story itself just isn't good. At all. Disappointing. 6/10.Graphics: Unfortunately, to get this game to run at 1080p I had to download some modded files, which may trigger anti-cheat protection if you happen to play multiplayer. Also, running these files breaks the HUD for the Space Marines (although strangely not for any of the other races). It's frustrating, and I really would expect Sega to get around to making 1080p available in-game without any modding required. Despite this, the game looks pretty good for a 2004 game. Unit design is pretty neat, most of the areas that you visit throughout the campaign look really cool, and of course, seeing an Ork mech tear a Space Marine in half is just plain awesome. I never suffered any frame drops, which is always nice for an older game, as older games around this generation like to depend entirely on your integrated graphics chip if you happen to have one, leaving your GPU idling uselessly. 4.5 for not having 1080p available by default, but the half point comes in because a mod is very easy to download and install.Sound: The voice acting during the cutscenes isn't bad, but it's not exactly award winning work either. Voice acting in battle is pretty good, though, especially for the Orks (I may also have a bit of an Ork bias). The music is pretty excellent as well, and is definitely memorable. It's pretty much entirely orchestral, but it's very ""heavy,"" with loads of brass and percussion; just the way I like my orchestras. Apart from that, there's not much else to talk about here. Good stuff. 4/5.Overall scores are: 9/6/4.5/4; cumulative score of 7.8/10. Again, the biggest problem with the game is the campaign being kinda not good, but at least skirmishing is a lot of fun. Still though, the campaign is disappointing, especially considering that Relic made Homeworld.			"

												This game is surely one of the best real-time strategies ever made. I never really been into WH40k, but this game made love this brutal, depressing universe.The campaign is really neat, as a leader of the Blood Ravens space marine chapter fighting through the planet of Tartarus which has quiet diverse maps, marshlands, cities, plains, mountains etc. The story is also enjoyable, it has some twists and good characters. The factions are really different, besides the Space Marines you get Orkz, Chaos Marines and the Eldar, but they're only available in multiplayer and skirmish.If you haven't tried DoW yet, now's the time, the gameplay is still fantastic and despite 11 years passed, the game still looks stunning.For the Emperor!

												I bought this game to unlock the 4 original races in the Dark Crusade Multiplayer because on the game's page it says that the games work together but no matter what I've tried the 4 DOW races are still locked. What's worse is that the playerbase is all on Dark Crusade so even though I have the ability to play SM/Chaos/Ork/Eldar on this game's multiplayer there is nobody to play against. I'd much rather find a fix but I've tried everything (some people let me know that it only should work after you've opened the game and played a skirmish match, and the ""race unlocker"" online requires 2 keys and Dark Crusade doesn't produce its key). If you think this game is worth it for the singleplayer alone go ahead and purchase it but I will be getting a refund.			"

Dawn of War Does Several unique things for its combat from having units hold their ground and fire range or move close for melee attack. It seems be one of those systems that is easy to pick up and satisfying to master. If you enjoy RTS in any capasity, you owe it to yourself to pick this game up.			"

												This game is fun and relatively easy to learn... so long as you play one of the human factions (the Space Marines and Imperial Guard; Imperial Guard might be in one ""Winter Assault"" expansion, however). The only problem is the humans are only really capable of fighting either the Orc or ""Chaos Space Marine"" factions, which have similar fighting capabilities and play styles. One faction, the Eldar, have an annoying ability to jump around the map using ""web gates"" or ""web portals,"" showing up unexpectedly just about anywhere. If you are playing against the computer, it seems as if the AI knows when your own armies are away from your base, or jump amazing close to your base. This complicates matters because this game is something like ""capture the flag,"" rather than hanging out at your base being a ""soccer/football goalie,"" just defending your structures. To me, this doesn't seem quite fair. All in all, I'd rate this as 4 out of 5 Stars.			"

												I had this game on disk since a few days after launch so try not to mind the time that Steam says.This was my first ever PC and is therfore one of my favoured games due to nostalgie. All that aside I would reccomend this game only if you want to play them in order. All the Dawn of War games do actually have story that each builds on so that might be important to you. Really though the best Dawn of War game is Dark Crusade which I love soo much it's ridiculous.			"

												Warhammer 40K : Dawn Of War - Dear god.... i mean Emperor, this game is one word AMAZING.dawn or war is a RTS game with resources to gather, how do you gather said resources you ask? well simple you plant flags around the map showing your DOMINANCE!!!!... to the enemy... in other words go capture those pionts on the map, you also have to gather a second resource called power by building power generators there is also a fair balance between 4 races.i would recommend this game and the following dlc winter assult and dark crusade to anyone who want to play a intresting and fun games with a great story, voice acting and badass battles.  9/10 i would rush my 100 pionts of ork nobz to there deaths again.

												Dawn of War is by far one of (if not the) the most successful Warhammer 40,000 games to have ever been created- and for good reason. With a great campaign for both the base game and it's first two expansions, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Game of the Year Edition is well worth the price to pick it up (though I recommend buying the Master Collection instead for access to Dark Crusade and Soulstorm). Just don't play Soulstorm first: The expansion is flawed in it's campaign to the extent of madness.			"

												I've been playing DoW for the past few years and I keep going back to it time and again. It's probably not the best RTS but it works brilliantly within the context of the WH40K universe and it is one of the most consistently fun games I've ever played. Just hearing the Orc scream of 'WAAAAGH' and the pious words of the Emperor's faithful Space Marines are enough to make this game one of my favourite 40K experiences. It's very different from the tabletop vesion but it still has a great deal to offer players, in terms of different races and the iconography of the rich 40K universe, and deserves to be seen as a game which has stood the 'Test of Time'.

												Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is in my opinion the best RTS game of all time, and it is just fantastic.Story:- I don't know that much of the Warhammer lore, but as far as I know, it follows it really well. If it doesn't, it still delivers a good and satisfying story!Gameplay:- The gameplay is where this game shines, with different races to play as on over 30 maps, this game never gets old. All races have the same basics, but late game it changes. I won't spoil anything of it, because I think everyone who is a fan of the genre or a fan of the Warhammer universe should play this. There are, as said above, over 30 maps to play on, and all of them are different in some way. Every map is challenging to master, and it adds brilliantly to the replay value and enjoyment.Graphics:- Graphics don't add anything to the overall enjoyment of the game in my opinion, and it doesn't do that here either. The graphics were great for their time, and though the textures definitely look dated, they do hold up over 12 years after its official release.Verdict:Dawn of War is the definitive RTS experience, and it is definitely worth the money, though if you're after graphics, you should probably go for Sins Of The Solar Empire. The game gets a 8/10 from me.- Denolact			"

												Game's pretty fun, worth 13 dollars for a campaign and alot of maps to fight AI on, if you're looking for multiplayer you'll probably have better luck with Soulstorm, just saying, still, its pretty damn good.			"
